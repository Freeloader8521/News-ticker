      "summary_orig": "THE guns may have fallen silent after a night of fierce fighting between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban forces along the border, but the situation can flare up again anytime. It was not the first time both forces have clashed, but the latest fighting was certainly the fiercest . For several hours Pakistan’s ground and air force pounded targets inside Afghanistan along the entire stretch of the long border. It was said to be in response to the attack on Pakistani border posts by Taliban forces. Heavy casualties have been reported on both sides. The latest round of skirmishes started after Pakistan Air Force jets and drones reportedly struck alleged militant sanctuaries across the border. The main targets of the airstrikes were believed to be TTP leaders, particularly Noor Wali Mehsud, the alleged mastermind of the recent attacks on Pakistani security forces. There are conflicting reports about whether he was killed in the raid. Although Pakistan did not say if it was behind the blasts in Kabul and other places, it has repeatedly declared that the country has the right to defend itself against surging cross-border militant attacks on its security forces. In this month alone scores of Pakistan security personnel, including army officers, have been martyred in the attacks by various factions of the TTP. This year has been the bloodiest in the past decade. The worsening conflict between the two neighbours carries serious implications for regional security. It seems Pakistan has lost patience with the Afghan Taliban administration refusing to act against the TTP sanctuaries being used to stage cross-border attacks. The tension further heightened after Pakistan claimed it had evidence about Afghan Taliban men also being involved in some of the terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. It was not the first time the PAF has targeted militant sanctuaries inside Afghanistan — some of which were officially acknowledged — but the latest strikes were said to be the most devastating. Declaring the incursion as an attack on Afghanistan’s sovereignty, Taliban forces retaliated by attacking multiple Pakistani security border posts, claiming to have killed dozens of soldiers. The fighting has stopped but the situation remains extremely volatile. The borders are closed completely, stopping trade and travel between both countries. The worsening conflict between the two neighbouring nations carries serious implications for regional security. Interestingly, the latest clashes occurred when some positive developments had taken place after Ishaq Dar’s recent visit to Kabul, and Pakistan had decided to upgrade diplomatic relations between the two countries. China also played a significant role in cooling the tension. Kabul and Islamabad had since been holding regular official-level talks to ease tension. Meanwhile, Islamabad had also decided to reopen some of the trading routes closed down for months. The two foreign ministers had recently met under the aegis of the so-called Moscow Format on Afghanistan. But the situation has changed completely in the past few days with the border clashes. Kabul refused to receive a Pakistan delegation led by the special envoy for a regular weekly meeting. Curiously the latest flare-up happened when the Afghan Taliban foreign minister was on a visit to India . The relations between Kabul and New Delhi have improved greatly over the last few months at a time when India and Pakistan were locked in bitter conflict . Although New Delhi has not recognised the Taliban administration, it has now announced to upgrade its office in Kabul to the level of a full-fledged embassy. The development signifies a remarkable shift in India’s position on the conservative Islamic movement. In the past India had described the Taliban as proxies of Pakistan. But the dramatic changes should not come as a surprise in the current regional geopolitics where “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” seems to be the guiding policy. The growing relations between New Delhi and Kabul, however, reinforce Pakistan’s concern about revival of the old nexus threatening its western border. Pakistan’s security institutions have long been accusing India of backing the TTP and other militant groups involved in terrorist activities. There may be no denying the security threat emanating from the militant sanctuaries across the border. But it’s not the only reason for the surge in militancy in the country. One must not gloss over the failure of our own counterterrorism policies. Arguably, we have never had a long-term and coherent policy to deal with this existentialist threat. Our inconsistency in dealing with the threat has been a major cause for the current surge in militancy. The military’s spokesman in his recent press conference in Peshawar tried to shift the blame to the then political leadership for allowing thousands of armed TTP fighters back home. But the fact is that all state institutions were on board at the time. TTP fighters were allowed to return without any precondition, including some ‘jet black’ terrorists. It was all reportedly done on the pressure of the new Afghan Taliban administration, which was then seen as a close ally. Could it have happened without the approval of the state? Most importantly, the political instability in the two strategically located provinces — Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which are the main centres of militant violence — has given huge impetus to the outlawed groups to operate. What the state is not willing to accept is that the rise of militancy is directly linked with political instability. Only kinetic operations cannot defeat militancy. The growing political alienation in KP and Balochistan is most alarming. There is a huge trust gap between the local population and the security forces in the troubled areas, making it much more difficult to fight militancy. Putting the entire blame on external forces is not enough; we must put our own house in order. No country can successfully fight insurgency without public support.

      "summary_orig": "• Prosecution wraps up arguments; ex-PM, spouse attend hearing at Adiala jail • Anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema Khan ISLAMABAD: The legal team of former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi is likely to conclude its final arguments before the Special Court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in the Toshakhana case related to the alleged unlawful retention of a Bulgari jewellery set, after the prosecution wrapped up its arguments on Tuesday. Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand resumed the hearing at Adiala jail, where Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi and defence counsel Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry were present. Special Prosecutor Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Naqvi and Barrister Umair Majeed completed the prosecution’s final arguments following the recording of statements by the PTI founder and his wife under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The court adjourned the proceedings till Wednesday (today), when lead counsel Barrister Salman Safdar is expected to conclude the defence’s arguments. The prosecution may then seek brief time for a rebuttal, after which the court could either reserve or announce its verdict. Earlier, the prosecution had closed its evidence after presenting 20 witnesses, including the PTI founder’s former military secretary, whose testimony was described as “damaging”. The court later summoned Mr Khan and his wife to record their statements before the conclusion of proceedings. The case concerns the alleged unlawful retention of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set — comprising a necklace, earrings, bracelets and rings — reportedly gifted by the Saudi royal family. The couple allegedly acquired the set at a nominal price, causing a loss to the national exchequer. According to the prosecution, the jewellery set, valued at around Rs80 million, was retained after paying only Rs2.9m. The former military secretary testified that Mr Khan had instructed him not to deposit the set in Toshakhana, in violation of official rules. During his statement under Section 342, Mr Khan had denied all allegations, terming the case “fabricated, malicious, and politically engineered” to disqualify him from politics. He said the case was politically motivated and violated due process. Mr Khan argued that he did not qualify as a “public servant” under the Pakistan Penal Code and maintained that even as prime minister, he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he claimed was presented to his wife. He said the jewellery set was lawfully retained under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 after proper valuation and payment. Rejecting allegations of undervaluation, he said neither he nor his wife had influenced any official appraiser and described prosecution witnesses — including former comptroller Syed Inamullah Shah and appraiser Sohaib Abbasi — as “unreliable and politically compromised”. Mr Khan also challenged the jurisdiction of both NAB and the FIA, asserting that the investigation was “extra-legal” and that the FIA had acted merely as a conduit for NAB. He questioned the admissibility of evidence obtained from abroad, including from Bulgari Italy. In her separate statement, Bushra Bibi also pleaded not guilty, denying charges of illegal retention and undervaluation of the same jewellery set. She said the gift was declared, assessed, and retained according to Toshakhana rules. She too challenged the jurisdiction of NAB and FIA and termed the proceedings “political victimisation”. Arrest warrant Meanwhile, the Special Anti-Terrorism Court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in the Nov 26 protest case registered at the Sadiqabad police station. The court noted that Ms Khanum had failed to appear twice and directed the Sadiqabad police to arrest and produce her before the court by Wednesday. The court rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that Ms Khanum was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the protest.

Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand resumed the hearing at Adiala jail, where Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi and defence counsel Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry were present. Special Prosecutor Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Naqvi and Barrister Umair Majeed completed the prosecution’s final arguments following the recording of statements by the PTI founder and his wife under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The court adjourned the proceedings till Wednesday (today), when lead counsel Barrister Salman Safdar is expected to conclude the defence’s arguments. The prosecution may then seek brief time for a rebuttal, after which the court could either reserve or announce its verdict. Earlier, the prosecution had closed its evidence after presenting 20 witnesses, including the PTI founder’s former military secretary, whose testimony was described as “damaging”. The court later summoned Mr Khan and his wife to record their statements before the conclusion of proceedings. The case concerns the alleged unlawful retention of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set — comprising a necklace, earrings, bracelets and rings — reportedly gifted by the Saudi royal family. The couple allegedly acquired the set at a nominal price, causing a loss to the national exchequer. According to the prosecution, the jewellery set, valued at around Rs80 million, was retained after paying only Rs2.9m. The former military secretary testified that Mr Khan had instructed him not to deposit the set in Toshakhana, in violation of official rules.

      "summary_orig": "• Huge cache of foreign currency, around 2kg gold recovered from Rizvi’s home • FIA says outfit’s financiers will be placed on stop list • Punjab police register over 20 FIRs against TLP leadership, say Rizvi escaped during crackdown • Mufti Muneeb, HRCP call for probe into ‘excessive force’ against protesters LAHORE: The authorities have launched a money-laundering investigation against Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan chief Saad Rizvi after “huge sums” of foreign currency were allegedly recovered from his residence in Lahore during a raid by the law enforcement agencies. The Punjab police said the raid was conducted by the provincial police, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), adding that all items, including the gold ornaments, were confiscated. The raid at the residence of the TLP chief came after the crackdown on the outfit’s march on Sunday night. Police said Mr Rizvi had escaped during the crackdown in Muridke. A senior police official said the law enforcers were shocked to find such a large amount of foreign currency, gold, and silver at the residence, as the TLP chief did not run any business before the formation of the radical outfit. In light of these findings, the authorities expanded the scope of their investigation to acquire details of bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, his son, and other family members to assess the total movable and immovable assets he had obtained under the TLP banner. The total currency allegedly recovered from the residence amounted to Rs110 million, including 50,000 Indian rupees. In a separate statement, the FIA said it has initiated legal and financial actions against a religious group involved in anti-state protests and violent activities, adding that the accounts and assets of several important officials and workers of the religious group were being examined based on evidence. According to the statement, “The FIA has frozen several bank accounts that were allegedly being used to fund violent protests.” Similarly, key individuals involved in fundin­g the TLP were being placed on the stop list. TLP headquarters ‘no-go’ area According to a police official, who shared initial findings with Dawn , the TLP purcha­sed dozens of properties in the vicinity of its headquarters — the hub of its activities — on Multan Road, making it a ‘no-go area’ for the LEAs and the general public. He said that the TLP chief had created a team of his loyal extremists and accommodated them by purchasing various houses at throwaway prices. “Several streets connected to the TLP’s main office have become a hub of the organisation’s trusted workers/supporters,” he said, adding that a separate team of the TLP was provided an office equipped with the latest gadgets to run and handle social and regular media campaigns. He said a dedicated team of highly trained activists was made available by the TLP to respond quickly to police operations. The Punjab police officially shared the detailed inventory of recovered valuables from the TLP chief’s residence. They included 1.92kg of gold, 898g of silver, 69 branded wristwatches, 28 gold bangles weighing 445g, 12 bracelets (490g), 24 necklaces, chains, and lockets, and 46 gold rings (355g). Similarly, the raiding team also recovered one silver crown and 32 silver rings from the house. 22 FIRs against TLP On the other hand, the Punjab police lodged at least 22 FIRs against TLP chief Saad Rizvi and his violent supporters across the province on various serious offences. In the primary FIR, Muridke police booked over 300 suspects on serious charges, ranging from terrorism to murder. Besides Mr Rizvi, his brother Anas Rizvi and many central leaders were also booked for inciting hate and instigating workers to raise anti-state slogans. The FIR said Ins­p­e­ctor Shahzad Nawaaz was allegedly kidna­p­ped and thrashed by a TLP mob, leaving him injured. It also accused Saad Rizvi of shooting the inspector in his abdomen, leaving him critically injured. The police officer later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital. It said that the TLP mob attacked the policemen with clubs, iron rods and sharp-edged weapons containing nails and injured several, adding that the TLP supporters were armed with lethal weapons and they opened indiscriminate fire at policemen, injuring many of them. As per the reports, the Pakpattan, Sahiwal, and Chichawatni police lodged three cases against Mr Rizvi, his supporters and workers under the anti-terrorism law and other offences. Another FIR alleged that Mr Rizvi’s speech, broadcast live via social media from Burawla Chowk, incited his followers to block roads, shut down markets, block traffic, and disrupt public order. Separately, the Gujrat police also booked at least 120 TLP activists on terrorism char­ges. The FIR was lodged with the Reh­m­ania police on the report of SI Aftab Rasool. Calls for probe Meanwhile, renowned cleric Mufti Mun­eebur Rehman urged the formation of a judicial commission, led by a serving superior judge, to investigate the crackdown on the TLP to disperse the protesters. “There is a growing demand that a judge of the high court or the SC should lead a thorough and independent investigation into this heart-wrenching and brutal incident. The aim is to identify those responsible and to recommend appropriate punishments based on the findings,” he said while reading out a joint declaration issued at the conference of clerics in Karachi. He also urged the Punjab government and administrations across the province to hand over the bodies of the deceased TLP workers to their families and to cease raids on the homes of its activists. Mufti Muneeb also urged the TLP leaders to reconsider their strategy and refrain from resorting to violence, instead focusing on securing their rightful place through the democratic parliamentary system. The Human Rights Comm­ission of Pakistan said the it was deeply concerned by the events that had unfolded since Oct 8, culminating in violent cla­shes between security forces and the TLP, causing multiple deaths and casualties among protesters and policemen. “We are equally concerned by the lack of transparency and credible, independent infor­mation surrounding the operation, providing which was the government’s responsibility. While state authorities have neglected to address the TLP’s consistent role in promoting hate speech and inciting mob viole­nce against individuals and groups, particularly religious minorities, this does not justify the alleged use of excessive force,” it said. Both the Constitution as well as international law mandate that security forces, even when dispersing violent assemblies, use the minimum necessary force, it said.

      "summary_orig": "Fighting flared up again on Tuesday night between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, reported state media. “Afghan Taliban and Fitna al-Khawarij opened unprovoked fire in Kurram. Pakistani Army responded with full force and intensity,” reported state broadcaster PTV News , quoting security sources on X. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. It added that Taliban regime posts suffered heavy damage and a tank caught fire after being hit, with Taliban fighters fleeing from their posts. In a subsequent post, PTV said: “Another post and tank position of the Afghan Taliban destroyed in Kurram sector.’’ PTV added that a fourth tank position at Shamsadar post was destroyed. “There are reports of the killing of an important commander of Fitna al-Khawarij in this important operation of the Pakistan Army.’’ Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said that Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch gave a ‘‘comprehensive briefing’’ to resident ambassadors in Islamabad on recent developments along the Pak-Afghan border. ‘‘She underscored Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.’’ Afghan Taliban forces launched an unprovoked attack on posts situated on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. The Inter-Services Public Relations said 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries. US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism. Speaking on Geo News , Asif had said a day ago that there were ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”. The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.” Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained.",

For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries. US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism. Speaking on Geo News , Asif had said a day ago that there were ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”. The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.” Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained.",

      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Tuesday that the government has decided to take a firm stand against the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), and that action against the protesters will be taken in a manner similar to that of May 9. Speaking to Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, the state minister said that since the formation of the current administration under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, TLP has attempted to march on Islamabad twice. “In every march, the government signed agreements with them; many of the terms of were not favourable for the state,” he said. However, he added, the state has taken a decisive stance. “We have to move forward and learn from past mistakes. We will not be blackmailed anymore. Those who bring extremism and violence into politics, whether it’s May 9, November 26 , or the TLP dharnas, will not be tolerated. Action against them will be similar to what was taken after May 9 ,” he said, referring to the 2023 protests following Imran Khan’s arrest. The minister maintained that the state had exhausted all peaceful options before acting against the group. “They say no dialogue was held, but backdoor channels were open. One of Pakistan’s major political and religious leaders was involved in those talks; they embarrassed him, too. Even when they stayed for two days, they were given a way to withdraw peacefully, and women and children who had been arrested were released.” Rejecting claims that the protests were about Gaza or Palestine, he termed the TLP’s actual demands as “shocking”. “They wanted money, demanded government positions for their clerics, and called for the release of their members convicted in criminal cases,” he said. He accused the group of emotionally exploiting religious sentiments and trying to weaken the state at a time when Pakistan was “fighting on both its eastern and western borders”. “Even when Afghanistan attacked, they did not call off their sit-in,” he said. Responding to reports that he had received over 1,700 threats online, Chaudhry said state institutions were taking legal action. “Cybercrime, FIA, and police are all active. Around 2,800 people have been barred from travelling,” he said, warning that fake news was again being spread in a manner similar to the November 26 events. Talal also mentioned that a large number of TLP members had been deported from Saudi Arabia for misconduct. “They are ruining the name of both the country and religion abroad,” he said. Law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religious party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests. The operation, which began around 3:30am, quickly spiralled into one of the most serious confrontations between police and TLP in recent months, continuing for nearly six hours. According to officials, some 1,500 police personnel in full anti-riot gear, supported by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons, surrounded the protest camp along the GT Road. By morning, authorities said they had detained hundreds of demonstrators, though exact figures remained unclear.",

      "summary_orig": "A Levies constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Tuesday, according to the police. The attack comes a day after the government launched a nationwide polio eradication campaign, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children. A special order was issued for the campaign, with the deployment of 285 police personnel across the country to provide security to the vaccination teams. According to Swat’s District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan, the martyred Levies constable was performing his duty along with a polio team comprising two female health workers. “The workers were administering vaccines inside a house while the constable was standing guard outside when he was attacked,” he said. “The assailants fled the scene after the incident.” Khan added that police and law enforcement officials had reached the area and launched an investigation. “The area has been cordoned off, and a search operation is underway to arrest the culprits. No anti-state elements will be allowed to sabotage peace in Swat,” he said, adding that those involved in the attack would be brought to justice. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and paid tribute to the official who was martyred in the shooting. In a statement, he expressed his heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the family of the deceased. “The assailants who fired on the team that was securing the future of children do not deserve any concession,” the statement quoted him as saying. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also condemned the “tragic attack”. “Those who target polio workers strike at the very future of our nation. My deepest condolences to the bereaved family,” he said on X. “Such cowardly acts will never deter our resolve to protect our children from polio and secure a healthier, stronger Pakistan,” he added. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed grief over the attack, APP reported . “The government is committed to the complete eradication of polio from the country. Despite such resistance from terrorists, the anti-polio campaign continues with full momentum and will go on until the disease is completely eradicated,” the PM resolved, as per APP . Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP. Data from September showed that the number of vaccine refusals in KP dropped in the most recent immunisation drive. However, in some areas, such as Lowi Mamund tehsil, residents announced a boycott of the drive. In May, a policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was martyred in a gun attack by unidentified assailants in Balochistan’s Noshki district, while another was killed in KP’s Bajaur district in February . Meanwhile, in August, two more polio cases were reported in KP, bringing the national tally to 23 this year. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had previously claimed similar attacks on polio teams, falsely portraying the inoculation campaigns as a Western conspiracy to sterilise children. Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts.",

      "summary_orig": "Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday offered to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan to ease tensions, days after border clashes heightened friction between the two neighbours. On Sunday , 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). It said clashes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, after Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “In the past, I played a role in reducing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can do it now, too,” Fazl told reporters in Islamabad. The JUI-F chief, the only Pakistani political leader who has met the Taliban supreme leader, Shaikh Hibatullah, has an influence on the Afghan Taliban. “I have been in contact with the Afghan leadership, and they want to resolve the issues through understanding,” the JUI-F chief said. Fazl said that with a ceasefire now in place between Pakistan and Afghanistan, both sides should refrain from blaming each other for the recent hostilities. “Both countries should try to cool things down instead of provoking each other, including on social media,” he added. Talking about Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s visit to India , the JUI-F chief insisted that instead of “making a fuss over Muttaqi’s statement on Kashmir being part of India, “we should also look at our own role in Kashmir.” “How many policies has Pakistan changed on Kashmir? Does Pakistan want a solution to Kashmir in accordance with the spirit of UN resolutions, and what progress has it made on this?“ Maulana asked. He said Afghanistan’s intelligence and other military capabilities were still in their initial phase.

      "summary_en": "Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday offered to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan to ease tensions, days after border clashes heightened friction between the two neighbours. On Sunday , 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). It said clashes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, after Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “In the past, I played a role in reducing tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and I can do it now, too,” Fazl told reporters in Islamabad. The JUI-F chief, the only Pakistani political leader who has met the Taliban supreme leader, Shaikh Hibatullah, has an influence on the Afghan Taliban. “I have been in contact with the Afghan leadership, and they want to resolve the issues through understanding,” the JUI-F chief said. Fazl said that with a ceasefire now in place between Pakistan and Afghanistan, both sides should refrain from blaming each other for the recent hostilities. “Both countries should try to cool things down instead of provoking each other, including on social media,” he added. Talking about Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s visit to India , the JUI-F chief insisted that instead of “making a fuss over Muttaqi’s statement on Kashmir being part of India, “we should also look at our own role in Kashmir.” “How many policies has Pakistan changed on Kashmir? Does Pakistan want a solution to Kashmir in accordance with the spirit of UN resolutions, and what progress has it made on this?“ Maulana asked. He said Afghanistan’s intelligence and other military capabilities were still in their initial phase.

      "summary_orig": "A day after experiencing a significant downturn, the Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 index rebounded by 7,000 points on Tuesday, recouping the previous day’s losses. Bearish sentiment had taken hold of the market on Monday, with the 100-Index plummeting 4,600 points, wiping out Rs534 billion from market capitalisation, amid rising tensions with Afghanistan, political instability in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and violent protests in Punjab. The market had closed at 158,443 points, lower by 4,654 points, or 2.85 per cent. Today, the KSE-100 index surged 7,032.6 points, or 4.44pc, to close at 165,476.02 points. Of 483 active scrips, 391 advanced , 69 declined while 23 remained unchanged. Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com that the market had rebounded today as “ tensions with Afghanistan and domestic unrest following the breakup of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protests had eased overnight”. “After entering a corrective phase following the trade data released on October 2, participants are now focused on next week’s current account print and progress toward a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund,” he said. Stating that 12,334 new investor accounts were opened in the month of September, Farooq suggested that retail investors take a “long-term approach, build positions gradually, and consider exchange-traded funds or mutual funds if inexperienced”. “While valuations are reasonable, potential slippage on the current account and fiscal side could pose near-term headwinds, and a repeat of the last two years’ returns over the next two years appears unlikely,” he added. Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the market had “rebounded after correction”. He also said the “easing of geopolitical conditions” had supported the market. Intense border fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan that started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning cast a shadow over the bourse yesterday. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. Separately, a crackdown against protesters of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in multiple cities and political uncertainty in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had added more pressure.",

      "summary_orig": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Tuesday dismissed the presence of an insurgency in the province, blaming “India-backed so-called separatist movements” for the worsening security situation. In recent months, Balochistan has witnessed a rise in terrorist attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces. Addressing participants of the 17th National Workshop in Quetta, the chief minister maintained that there was “no insurgency in Balochistan but so-called separatist movements” in the province. “The purpose of these anti-state elements is to harm and divide Pakistan,” he said. He added that the Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was behind the deterioration of the security situation in the province. “The Indian agency RAW has a clear role behind the deteriorating situation in Balochistan,” he said. “Separatists are pleased with India but want to harm Pakistan.” CM Bugti added that the war against terrorism was not only the armed forces’ prerogative but “the whole nation’s joint fight”. He added that a “false impression of uneven development” was deliberately created in the province to sow division, adding that terms like “disgruntled Baloch were coined to justify terrorism”. “A person who resorts to violence and takes up arms is not angry but a terrorist,” he said. The chief minister also said that distances were created between the youth and the state through social media propaganda. “The government is going to universities and every forum to hear the grievances of the youth,” he maintained. Bugti said that in order to improve the security situation in the province and deal with terrorism, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD)’s capacity was being enhanced. “For this purpose, Rs100 million has been allocated. Security forces are conducting operations in areas where it is difficult to distinguish between friends and foes,” he said. According to recent reports issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), the first three quarters of 2025 in the country saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024. In 2024, KP recorded the highest number of terrorist incidents with 295 attacks; meanwhile, attacks by various outlawed Baloch insurgent groups, primarily the BLA and the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), saw a staggering 119 per cent increase , accounting for 171 incidents in Balochistan.",

Addressing participants of the 17th National Workshop in Quetta, the chief minister maintained that there was “no insurgency in Balochistan but so-called separatist movements” in the province. “The purpose of these anti-state elements is to harm and divide Pakistan,” he said. He added that the Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was behind the deterioration of the security situation in the province. “The Indian agency RAW has a clear role behind the deteriorating situation in Balochistan,” he said. “Separatists are pleased with India but want to harm Pakistan.” CM Bugti added that the war against terrorism was not only the armed forces’ prerogative but “the whole nation’s joint fight”. He added that a “false impression of uneven development” was deliberately created in the province to sow division, adding that terms like “disgruntled Baloch were coined to justify terrorism”. “A person who resorts to violence and takes up arms is not angry but a terrorist,” he said. The chief minister also said that distances were created between the youth and the state through social media propaganda. “The government is going to universities and every forum to hear the grievances of the youth,” he maintained. Bugti said that in order to improve the security situation in the province and deal with terrorism, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD)’s capacity was being enhanced. “For this purpose, Rs100 million has been allocated. Security forces are conducting operations in areas where it is difficult to distinguish between friends and foes,” he said. According to recent reports issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), the first three quarters of 2025 in the country saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024. In 2024, KP recorded the highest number of terrorist incidents with 295 attacks; meanwhile, attacks by various outlawed Baloch insurgent groups, primarily the BLA and the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), saw a staggering 119 per cent increase , accounting for 171 incidents in Balochistan.",
