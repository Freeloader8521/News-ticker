      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year. The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time of acute financial strain and as Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about US commitments in the Middle East. The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel’s strikes on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region. One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion. The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion. The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal. Pakistan’s Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, including on “military cooperation between the two sides”, Saudi media outlet SaudiNews50 said on social media platform X on Monday. Tested in combat Amir Masood, a retired air marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment, including JF-17s and electronic and weapons systems for the jets. He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations. The JF-17’s marketability has been increased because “it is tested and has been used in combat,” he told Reuters , adding that it’s also cost-effective. The aircraft was deployed during the conflict with India last May, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades. The military or finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s government media office also did not respond. The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership. Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress. In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn support package for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment. Saudi Arabia has since rolled over deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures. Arms sales outreach Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry. Last month, Islamabad struck a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft. Pakistan has also held talks with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East. On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook. “Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif told Geo News . Pakistan is currently under a $7bn IMF programme , its 24th, which followed a short-term $3bn deal that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund’s support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Wednesday jibed at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi while recounting a meeting between the two, where the Indian PM had asked to meet the US president. While addressing the House GOP (Grand Old Party) Members’ Retreat, Trump recounted a meeting with Modi, stating that Modi had ordered 68 Apache attack helicopters from the US and had waited five years. “Prime Minister Modi came to see me. [He said] ‘Sir, may I see you, please?’ Yes,” Trump recalled. “I have a very good relationship with him. He’s not that happy with me because, you know, they’re paying a lot of tariffs now, because they’re not doing the oil,” he added, referring to India halting imports of Russian oil. Trump also noted that the US is “getting rich because of tariffs”. Meanwhile, India’s opposition Congress party took to X and uploaded a caricature of the scene, showing a timid Modi. In a separate post in Hindi, Congress claimed that Modi went to the US uninvited to meet Trump after he took office last January, quoting the Indian PM’s request to meet him. “You must remember - among the world‘s leaders, Modi is the only one whom Trump did not come to receive at the gate,” the party wrote, attaching a video of Trump’s remarks. In response to the remarks, Indian lawmaker Priyanka Chaturvedi took to X and wrote, “His (Trump’s) condescending tone for India’s PM is demeaning. The GoI’s (Government of India) silence to all his insulting statements is bizarre because it reflects poorly on our nation.” Former Indian minister Subhramanian Swamy shared this post. The US is imposing 50 per cent tariffs on New Delhi over its purchase of Russian oil, causing tensions to rise between the world’s two largest democracies and strategic partners. A punitive 25pc tariff was imposed due to India’s purchases of Russian oil, adding to Trump’s prior 25pc tariff on many products from India. It took total duties as high as 50pc for goods such as garments, gems and jewellery, footwear, sporting goods, furniture and chemicals — among the highest imposed by the US and on par with Brazil and China. However, Trump said during a press gaggle on Air Force One that he could raise the tariffs already in place. “Modi is a good guy. He knew I was not happy, and it was important to make me happy,” Trump said on Sunday. “They do trade, and we can raise tariffs on them very quickly,” Trump said in response to a question on India’s Russian oil purchases.",

      "title_orig": "AJK govt has implemented all points of JAAC agreement within its jurisdiction: info minister",
      "summary_orig": "The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government on Wednesday stated that it had accepted and implemented in letter and spirit almost all points of its agreement with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) that fell within its jurisdiction, adding that issues relating to the federal government could take some time. The federal government on October 4, 2025, signed an agreement with the JAAC to end the tense situation prevailing in the region since late September. The AJK government claimed it had resolved or was moving towards resolution of more than 90 per cent of the issues outlined by the JAAC. “We have implemented all matters that were within our domain. However, federally funded projects are approved through a defined process, and that naturally takes time,” Minister for Information and Religious Affairs Muhammad Rafique Nayyar said at a press conference. “Similarly, matters related to constitutional amendments also take time because they pass through different stages,” he added. Nayyar said the PPP-led government, under AJK Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, had worked day and night during its one-and-a-half months in power to resolve public issues. “The prime minister is young and energetic. He has removed the word ‘rest’ from his lexicon and has kept himself and his team constantly on their toes for public welfare,” he said. Nayyar added that the atmosphere of inertia in the prime minister’s office and the ministers’ block had come to an end and the government had held a record five cabinet meetings within 90 days, approving measures to resolve public matters on a fast-track basis. “The biggest challenge for the present government has been restoring public trust, a task in which, by the grace of Allah, it is succeeding.” Listing steps taken by the government in connection with the agreement, Nayyar said that since PM Rathore himself was among the signatories on behalf of the AJK government, it placed an even greater responsibility on the government to ensure its implementation. Regarding the reduction in the property transfer tax, he said the cabinet had already approved reducing the property transfer tax to 8.5pc, and a notification would be issued after the required legislation was enacted. As for health cards, Nayyar said the government was not facing any financial constraints and that negotiations with the relevant company were underway. The prime minister, he said, set a deadline of January 20 to resolve the issue. Responding to a question as to why the government was not holding talks with the JAAC, Nayyar said the government was always ready for negotiations and wanted to move forward by taking all stakeholders on board. “Our sincerity can also be gauged from the fact that the prime minister himself went to the house of a core member of the Action Committee. We are available 24 hours a day. If talks are to be held, just give us half an hour’s notice,” he said. Nayyar clarified that the AJK government was not functioning under the agreement with the JAAC but under the public mandate. However, he added, the government remained fully committed to implementing all commitments made in the public interest. The minister expressed regret that talks held in Islamabad on January 2 were attended by representatives of the federal and AJK governments, but members of the JAAC did not turn up. Describing AJK as a highly sensitive region, Nayyar said the ancestors of its people had made immense sacrifices for its freedom. “Our objective is to maintain an atmosphere of peace and order in the state and to resolve all legitimate public issues, and we will spare no effort to achieve this,” he added. In response to another question, Nayyar said the PPP would contest the next elections based on its performance and would once again seek the people’s trust. He said elections would be held on time, as there was no provision in the Constitution for their cancellation. The information minister said that when he had previously held the information portfolio two-and-a-half years ago, he had visited press clubs across AJK and made efforts to resolve their issues. “We will seek guidance from the media and will take every possible step to strengthen it,” he added. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down towards the end of September last year. Rival groups then staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. After two rounds of talks, an agreement between the JAAC, the AJK government and the federal government was reached. On December 29, the federal government notified a nine-member committee to deliberate on a contentious clause of the agreement, the abolition of elite privileges and 12 seats reserved for Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir. Under its terms of reference, the committee will deliberate on the issue of “members of the AJK Legislative Assembly other than the AJK constituencies (sic)” and has been auth­orised to meet as frequently as required and submit its recommendations to the Monitoring and Implementation (M&I) Commit­tee constituted under the Muzaf­farabad Agreement.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian on Wednesday ordered security forces not to crack down on economic protests, drawing a distinction between peaceful demonstrators and armed “rioters”. Pezeshkian’s statement comes as Iranian cities continue to see a wave of protests against economic hardship triggered by price rises and currency collapse. Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) claimed on Tuesday at least 27 protesters have been killed during the demonstrations that kicked off with a shopkeeper’s strike in Tehran on December 28. Iranian media outlets, relaying official announcements, have reported 13 deaths, including members of the security forces and a policeman who was shot dead on Tuesday. In a video released by the news agency Mehr after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Iran Vice President Mohammad Jafar Ghaempanah said Pezeshkian had “ordered that no security measures be taken against the demonstrators”. “Those who carry firearms, knives and machetes and who attack police stations and military sites are rioters, and we must distinguish protesters from rioters,” Ghaempanah added. Army chief warns Iran’s foes General Amir Hatami, commander of the Iranian army and one of its most senior military officers, warned Tehran will not tolerate outside threats “without responding”. .Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Army, Amir Hatami speaks during a meeting with military academy students, in Tehran, Iran, in this handout image obtained on January 7, 2026. — Reuters According to the Fars news agency, Hatami said “if the enemy makes a mistake,” Iran’s response would be more robust than during last June’s 12-day war with Israel. In recent days, US President Donald Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran if demonstrators were killed, while Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed support for the protests. The demonstrations have yet to reach the scale of a 2022 to 2023 movement , let alone that of the mass 2009 street protests that followed disputed elections. But the economic protests have attracted international attention, including from the leaders of the Iran’s international foes. “We’re watching it very closely. If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump told reporters on Sunday. Netanyahu, meanwhile, told Israel’s cabinet: “We stand in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom, liberty and justice.” The war in June began with an unprecedented Israeli attack on Iranian military and nuclear facilities. The United States briefly took part in the strikes, hitting three major Iranian nuclear sites. Tear gas in Grand Bazaar The latest demonstrations have spread to the heart of the economy in Iran, the capital’s Grand Bazaar, and several more towns and cities, especially in the west of the country. On Tuesday, clashes erupted in the Grand Bazaar for the first time since the protests began, with police using tear gas to disperse crowds. In one case, gas drifted into a hospital. To disperse a crowd, “tear gas was used in the alley adjacent to the Sina Hospital”, the ISNA news agency reported, citing a statement from the Tehran University of Medical Sciences. The Sina Hospital is affiliated with the university and is about two kilometres from the Grand Bazaar. The university denied claims that tear gas had been deliberately fired at the hospital. Elsewhere in the Iranian capital, calm appeared to have returned on Wednesday. AFP reporters saw residents conducting business as normal in the shops of Vali Asr, the grand thoroughfare that crosses the city from north to south.",

      "summary_orig": "Featuring for Pakistan for the first time since June last year, Shadab Khan impressed with the ball, teaming up with Abrar Ahmed as Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the opening fixture of the three-match Twenty20 International series at the Rangiri Dambulla Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. The all-rounder took two wickets, while Abrar hunted three victims to restrict Sri Lanka to a paltry 128-run total before Sahibzada Farhan’s half century helped Pakistan chase down the target with 20 balls to spare. Shadab gave away only 25 runs in his four overs, bagging both his wickets in his very first over and could have gone on to take a third had it not been for a dropped catch later on. Coming into bowl in the seventh over, after Mohammad Wasim and Salman Mirza’s pace — that accounted for a wicket for each — saw Sri Lanka post 35-2 in the powerplay, Shadab trapped a sweeping Kusal Mendis lbw and induced an inside edge off Dhananjaya de Silva’s bat for wicket-keeper Usman Khan to take a good catch. With Sri Lanka looking to break the stranglehold while at 59-4 by the halfway stage, it was an opportunity for Abrar to pounce on. The mystery spinner deceived Charith Asalanka into playing a googly across, only to be caught behind, leaving Sri Lanka reeling at 72-5 halfway through the 12th over. The incoming Wanindu Hasaranga initiated a counterattack of sorts lofting Abrar for a boundary in the 14th over.  Liyanage joined in a slap off Mohammad Nawaz through the covers before dispatching the left-arm spinner past long-on, bringing up the 100-run mark for Sri Lanka. Luck followed for Liyanage as an edge flew off his bat for another boundary as 16 runs came in the 15th over. Hasaranga targetted Abrar once again, clubbing him straight down the ground for another four, but holed the spinner to Fakhar Zaman at deep cover to depart for 18 off 12, ending the only partnership that looked to threaten Pakistan. Liyanage (40 off 31) followed suit in the 18th, finding Nawaz in the deep off Abrar (3-25) as he tried to clear the long-on fence. Salman Mirza (3-18) returned to dismiss Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka and the incoming Dushmantha Chameera before Wasim (2-7) wrapped up the first innings proceedings. Pakistan, in response, took off with a flurry of brilliant attacking shots by openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada lead the side to a 59-1 by the end of the powerplay, with Saim departing on the penultimate ball of the sixth over. The left-hander was castled by Theekshana but only after having hit three fours and a six — a lofted drive over cover — for his 18-ball 24. Sahibzada, on the other end, had used brute power to dispatch Chameera for sixes down the ground and over square-leg. Sahibzada continued the onslaught, welcoming Chameera back with a straight drive for four more before captain Salman Ali Agha, having just joined him, danced down the ground to play Hasaranga’s leg-spin over his head for another boundary. The skipper pushed Theekshana for his second boundary in the next over as Pakistan posted 92-1 by the halfway stage, but holed a juicy full toss by Hasranga to long-on to depart for 16 off 10. Sahibzada (51 off 36) brought up his third half century in five matches with a cut for three off Chameera in the 12th over, reaching the milestone in 35 balls. But the right-hander perished three balls later, finding Shanaka at mid-off off Chameera. Pakistan received yet another blow when Fakhar was stumped off Dhananjaya de Silva with 23 runs needed off 40 balls. The incoming Shadab (18 not out off 12), however, brought Pakistan within touching distance of a win with a square-drive and a pull for consecutive boundaries off Chameera in the 15th over before Pakistan crossed the finish line with 20 balls to spare.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednesday sought a “policy shift” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terror policy-making. Federal authorities have criticised the PTI-led KP government for failing to ensure security in the province, with KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi saying that the party was in disarray and unable to achieve any of its policy goals. In a speech at Peshawar University’s convocation ceremony, the CM said that the people of KP had warned about the resurgence of terrorism in the province, but were brushed off as propaganda. “We would issue warnings that they (terrorists) were in the mountains and they were coming, that they had reached our markets and homes,” CM Afridi said. “We were told that we are spreading propaganda.” He highlighted that if there was going to be a military operation, then the people of KP needed to be taken into confidence and made part of the policy process. “There needs to be a policy shift, but not behind closed doors,” he explained. “It [policy] needs to be formed after consulting KP’s government, people and stakeholders.“ “A clear policy formed in this manner will play a role in lasting and enduring peace; a decision made behind closed doors will leave our people suffering, as they have for the past 17 years.” The CM noted that the KP government and the government had “different intentions”, adding, “If they wanted to eradicate terrorism, then they would have sat with us and formed a policy. “We came out of our homes, so they committed that they would give Rs400,000 to people whose homes have been lost to terrorism,” he said. “Imagine hearing that after sacrificing so much. They still have not received that money.” Highlighting the impact of military operations, CM Afridi noted that families would lose breadwinners in collateral damage or terrorist attacks, causing them to suffer economically. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveal a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism-linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2,555 in 2024 to 3,417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34 per cent year-on-year surge in violence. Per the report, “the most significant surge in violence was recorded in KP, where the fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.” Meanwhile, on January 2, KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said police thwarted hundreds of terrorism-related incidents, particularly in southern and merged tribal districts, while police personnel risked their lives but stood firm against the enemy. Last year, the police neutralised 459 terrorists in several engagements and arrested over 1,300 militants, including 29 with head money, in 3,277 intelligence-based operations across the province. The police said a large quantity of hand grenades, explosives, pistols, various weapons and ammunition was recovered.",

According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveal a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism-linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2,555 in 2024 to 3,417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34 per cent year-on-year surge in violence. Per the report, “the most significant surge in violence was recorded in KP, where the fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.” Meanwhile, on January 2, KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said police thwarted hundreds of terrorism-related incidents, particularly in southern and merged tribal districts, while police personnel risked their lives but stood firm against the enemy. Last year, the police neutralised 459 terrorists in several engagements and arrested over 1,300 militants, including 29 with head money, in 3,277 intelligence-based operations across the province. The police said a large quantity of hand grenades, explosives, pistols, various weapons and ammunition was recovered.",

      "summary": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednesday sought a “policy shift” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terror policy-making. Federal authorities have criticised the PTI-led KP government for failing to ensure security in the province, with KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi saying that the party was in disarray and unable to achieve any of its policy goals. In a speech at Peshawar University’s convocation ceremony, the CM said that the people of KP had warned about the resurgence of terrorism in the province, but were brushed off as propaganda. “We would issue warnings that they (terrorists) were in the mountains and they were coming, that they had reached our markets and homes,” CM Afridi said. “We were told that we are spreading propaganda.” He highlighted that if there was going to be a military operation, then the people of KP needed to be taken into confidence and made part of the policy process. “There needs to be a policy shift, but not behind closed doors,” he explained. “It [policy] needs to be formed after consulting KP’s government, people and stakeholders.“ “A clear policy formed in this manner will play a role in lasting and enduring peace; a decision made behind closed doors will leave our people suffering, as they have for the past 17 years.” The CM noted that the KP government and the government had “different intentions”, adding, “If they wanted to eradicate terrorism, then they would have sat with us and formed a policy. “We came out of our homes, so they committed that they would give Rs400,000 to people whose homes have been lost to terrorism,” he said. “Imagine hearing that after sacrificing so much.

      "title_orig": "UN accuses Israel of West Bank ‘apartheid’",
      "summary_orig": "The United Nations on Wednesday said decades-long discrimination and segregation of Palestinians by Israel in the West Bank were intensifying, and called on the country to end its “apartheid system”. In a new report , slammed by Israel, the UN rights office said “systematic discrimination” against Palestinians across the occupied Palestinian territories had “drastically deteriorated” in recent years. “There is a systematic asphyxiation of the rights of Palestinians in the West Bank,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. “Whether accessing water, school, rushing to hospital, visiting family or friends, or harvesting olives — every aspect of life for Palestinians in the West Bank is controlled and curtailed by Israel’s discriminatory laws, policies and practices,” he added. “This is a particularly severe form of racial discrimination and segregation that resembles the kind of apartheid system we have seen before.” A number of independent experts affiliated with the UN have described the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories as “apartheid”, but this marks the first time a UN rights chief has applied the term. Israel’s diplomatic mission to the UN in Geneva slammed the report’s “absurd and distorted accusations of racial discrimination” against Israel, charging it exemplified the UN rights office’s “inherently politically driven fixation […] on vilifying Israel”. Mounting settler violence The report said the Israeli authorities “treat Israeli settlers and Palestinians residing in the West Bank under two distinct bodies of law and policies, resulting in unequal treatment on a range of critical issues”. “Palestinians continue to be subjected to large-scale confiscation of land and deprivation of access to resources,” it added. This had led to “dispossessing them of their lands and homes, alongside other forms of systemic discrimination, including criminal prosecution in military courts during which their due process and fair trial rights are systematically violated”. Turk demanded on Wednesday that Israel “repeal all laws, policies and practices that perpetuate systemic discrimination against Palestinians based on race, religion or ethnic origin”. The discrimination was compounded by continuing and escalating settler violence, in many cases “with the acquiescence, support and participation of Israel’s security forces”, the rights office said. More than 500,000 Israelis currently live in settlements in the West Bank, occupied since 1967 and home to around three million Palestinians. Violence has risen in recent years, surging especially since Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack , which triggered the Gaza conflict. Since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, Israeli troops and settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to an AFP tally based on figures from the Palestinian health ministry. According to official Israeli figures, at least 44 Israelis, both soldiers and civilians, have been killed in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations in the same period. ‘Almost complete impunity’ Since Israel’s offensive in Gaza began, Israeli authorities had also “further expanded the use of unlawful force, arbitrary detention and torture”, the report said. Increased “repression of civil society and undue restrictions on media freedoms (and) severe movement restrictions” had also characterised “an unprecedented deterioration of the human rights situation” in the West Bank, it said. There had also been rapid expansions of settlements, considered illegal under international law, even as unlawful killings of Palestinians were taking place “with almost complete impunity”, the report warned. Of the more than 1,500 killings of Palestinians that took place between the start of 2017 and September 30 last year, Israeli authorities had opened just 112 investigations, resulting in only one conviction, it pointed out. The report said it had found “reasonable grounds to believe that this separation, segregation, and subordination is intended to be permanent […] to maintain oppression and domination of Palestinians”. This, it stressed, amounts to a violation of an international anti-racism convention, “which prohibits racial segregation and apartheid”. The UN rights office on Wednesday urged Israel to end its “unlawful presence in the occupied Palestinian territory, including by dismantling all settlements and evacuating all settlers, and to respect the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination”.",

      "summary_orig": "At least four civilians were killed in coalition strikes in Yemen on Wednesday, two hospital sources told AFP , as the force raided the home province of a separatist leader who was kicked out of the presidency. More than 15 airstrikes hit Dhale, the home governorate of Aidaros Alzubidi, whose Southern Transitional Council (STC) grabbed swathes of territory last month before seeing the advance rolled back by the coalition and forces. “The initial toll from the strikes on the province of al-Dhale is four civilian deaths and six wounded,” medical sources at the Al-Nasr and Al-Tadamon hospitals in al-Dhale told AFP . The coalition said it had given Aidaros Alzubidi a 48-hour ultimatum to come to Riyadh for discussions , after Southern Transitional Council (STC) grabbed swathes of territory last month. But he failed to board the flight carrying his delegation, and the coalition struck his home province of al-Dhale after accusing him of mobilising “large forces” there. Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), which holds executive power, then announced Alzubidi’s removal, accusing him of high treason. The showdown between Yemen’s rival factions raised fears that second city Aden, where the STC insisted its leader was still located, could be drawn into the violence. Alzubidi “fled to an unknown location … after he had distributed weapons and ammunition to dozens of elements inside Aden”, coalition spokesperson Major General Turki al-Maliki said in a statement. The coalition carried out new strikes to prevent Alzubidi from “escalating the conflict” and extending it into Dhale governorate, he said. An STC official told AFP that Alzubidi decided not to join the delegation flying to Saudi Arabia for talks after hearing he would be asked to dissolve his group, which forms part of the PLC. Later, the STC said it had lost contact with the delegation following its arrival in Riyadh, urging Saudi Arabia to “guarantee the safety of its delegation currently in Riyadh”. Alzubidi “continues his duties” in Aden, the group said, calling on the coalition to halt the air strikes. ‘Grave crimes’ The PLC announced Alzubidi’s removal, accusing him of committing several crimes, including “high treason” and “engaging in armed insurgency”. “It has been established that [Alzubidi] has abused the just cause of the South and exploited it to commit grave crimes against civilians in the southern governorates,” it said. More than 100 people have been killed in the Yemeni coalition’s strikes on the separatists’ positions and in clashes on the ground. The coalition and another group said it has asked STC deputy Abdulrahman al-Mahrami, who is in Riyadh and approved Alzubidi’s dismissal from the presidency, to “enforce security and prevent hostilities in Aden”. A security official in Aden told AFP that the forces loyal to Mahrami have been deployed in the streets and government buildings, including the presidential palace. Aden is an STC stronghold and home to the group’s headquarters. After Houthis seized Sanaa in 2014, it became the government’s self-proclaimed temporary capital. As the civil war progressed, the STC’s political and military influence expanded across south Yemen and they became a dominant force in Aden. Another security official told AFP that two days ago, the STC evacuated its headquarters in Aden and moved the operations of its TV channel to an unknown location for fear of bombing. Last week, Alzubidi had announced a two-year transition towards creating a new country, “South Arabia”, in Yemen’s south.",

In the case, registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca), Mazari and Chattha have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. On Wednesday, the two submitted a written application to Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka during the hearing of the case, referring to a press conference addressed by the military spokesperson on January 6. The application said the press briefing was broadcast “on all national media, and the content is readily available online”. During the press conference, “references were made to matters directly pending trial before this learned court”. “This is the exact prosecution case that is pending adjudication before this learned court,” the application said. Mazari and Chattha contended that their request was a “clear requisite of natural justice in line with the Constitutional protection safeguarded for the accused persons with respect to the right to fair trial and due process”. The court subsequently directed that a copy of the application be provided to the prosecution and said a decision on the request would be made after it heard the prosecution. Later, the court said it was issue a decision on the application after the statements of the accused were recorded under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code. During the proceedings, prosecution witness Shahroz Riaz was also cross-examined. He made several admissions regarding the manner in which the inquiry in the case was initiated and the collection of social media content. The hearing has been adjourned till January 8. The case The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday that a special protection unit was being set up in Islamabad for the security of Chinese nationals. According to a press release issued by the interior ministry, Naqvi made the remarks as he met China’s Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong in Beijing. The two met at the headquarters of China’s Ministry of Public Security, where Naqvi received a warm welcome, the interior ministry said. During the meeting, the leaders agreed to develop a joint and rapid response system against terrorism, including expanding training programs aimed at enhancing police capacity, it added. Xiaohong lauded Pakistan’s efforts in countering terrorism and strengthening internal security, the statement said. “We appreciate Pakistan’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism,” he was quoted as saying. During the meeting, “both ministers agreed on a joint strategy for training and enhancing the professional skills of police and security personnel”. They also vowed to maintain “an exchange of information between the police and other institutions of the two countries”. Naqvi apprised the Chinese minister of the measures being taken to ensure the security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan, at which the latter expressed his satisfaction. “The protection of Chinese citizens and projects of mutual interest remains our top priority,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. He further said that “effective measures had been taken to ensure the security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan”. He said that “a special protection unit was being set up in Islamabad for the security of Chinese nationals“. Chinese citizens have come under attack multiple times in Pakistan, and according to data shared by the National Counter Terrorism Authority in December 2024, as many as 20 had been killed and 34 injured in terror attacks in the country from 2021 until then. The information was shared around a month after a security guard shot at two Chinese nationals in Karachi, leaving both of them injured. In October that year, a bombing at the Karachi airport killed two Chinese engineers and left several others injured. In July last year, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif said the government was building a safe and business-friendly environment for the Chinese community in Pakistan by enhancing their security . He made the statement while chairing a meeting regarding security arrangements for Chinese citizens in Pakistan, further highlighting that “the confidence of Chinese companies in the Pakistani economy is extremely important for our economic future”. The PM also said that in light of the development of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor , the protection of Chinese nationals in Pakistan had gained even greater importance, issuing directives that measures be taken on a priority basis at all airports to facilitate their arrival and departure. Cooperation on prevention of cybercrime The pair also discussed cooperation in the prevention of cybercrimes. “Pakistan wants to benefit from the support of Chinese institutions to enhance the capacity of the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA),“ the statement quoted Naqvi as saying, adding that Chinese-based AI technologies could be of “great help in countering terrorism and addressing security challenges”. He said that Pakistan and China shared a bond based on “sustainable cooperation“. Naqvi expressed the desire to expand this cooperation further to tackle security challenges and protect mutual interests, the statement said. During the meeting, it was decided that the two sides will hold meetings of a joint working group every three months, while a meeting at a ministerial level will be held once a year. Naqvi extended an invitation to the Chinese minister to visit Pakistan, and conveyed his best wishes to the Chinese president and prime minister on behalf of President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Xiaohong also invited Naqvi to attend the Global Security Cooperation Forum — to be held in China in September, the statement added. The Chinese minister expressed willingness to cooperate with Pakistan at all levels, stressing that “Pakistan and China are strategic partners”. He also hosted a luncheon in honour of Naqvi and his delegation, the interior ministry said.",

      "summary_orig": "• The Hindu report says lobbying firm headed by former Trump aide Jason Miller led engagement with US officials on New Delhi’s behalf • Former diplomats say use of lobbyists is normal, but important meetings are usually set up directly by diplomats NEW DELHI: Although the government of Narendra Modi has persistently denied that the US played any role in mediating an end to the four-day India-Pakistan conflict following the Pahalgam incident, a report in The Hindu details how a lobbying firm engaged by New Delhi made hectic calls to approach US officials on May 10, and beyond. Although a filing with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) — including 60 entries made in December 2025 — did not divulge whether the calls on May 10 were made before or after the ceasefire, “they indicate close interaction on the day”, The Hindu wrote. It said the embassy approached White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Ricky Gill at the National Security Council to discuss “media coverage” of the conflict. This seems to contradict New Delhi’s stance, which has repeatedly denied several claims by US President Donald Trump, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s decision to award Mr Gill for the role he played in defusing the crisis. In particular, the External Affairs Ministry consistently denied Trump’s contention he had threatened to stop trade if the conflict was not ended, and the call made to Mr Greer to discuss Operation Sindoor is particularly significant, the paper said. The filings by US lobby firm SHW LLC raised eyebrows amongst diplomats in New Delhi as the firm also claimed that it set up meetings for several Indian officials — from External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, Deputy National Security Advisor Pavan Kapoor, and even Indian Ambassador Vinay Kwatra — with top Trump administration officials over the past year. SHW LLC was contracted by the Indian Embassy on April 24, 2025. Dawn had previously reported on May 2 that former Trump aide Jason Miller’s firm had been engaged by New Delhi as a registered foreign agent for $150,000 per month. It had no other clients over the year, according to the six FARA filings it made, and has been paid $900,000 in two quarterly instalments as part of an annual contract for $1.8 million. The practice is a first, say former and current Indian officials, and indicates that rather than normal bilateral channels, the engagements — broadly over India-US trade ties and Operation Sindoor — were set up by the firm, led by former Trump spokesperson Miller, who is listed as the principal of SHW LLC. While the embassy has always contracted two to three lobbyists at a time, to consult them on working with the Democrat and Republican parties, this is the first time a lobby firm has been asked to set up meetings with US officials, as also to schedule calls with government officials. “Such meetings are routinely sought by the mission directly,” at least two Indian government officials told The Hindu . “This seems to indicate that the Trump administration has set new rules of engagement and the government has been left with little choice but to play along,” a former diplomat, who had served at the Indian embassy previously, said. “The Indian Embassy has hired such firms, consistent with local practice and requirements, under successive governments since the 1950s,” a spokesperson for the Indian embassy in Washington said. About the lobbying firm, The Hindu quoted another official as saying that lobbyists are hired “for advice and to understand the landscape, giving advice, and opening some doors,” but that meetings and calls are made between diplomats directly. Apart from the calls on May 10, 2025, the firm billed the Embassy for making requests for the Parli­ame­ntary delegation led by Oppo­sition leader Shashi Tharoor to meet US Vice-President J.D. Vance and others. On June 23, 2025, days before Mr. Jaishankar’s visit to Washington to attend the Quad Foreign Ministers’ meeting, SHW says that it sent emails requesting meetings for the Minister with Mr. Vance, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and CIA chief John Ratcliffe. Of 60 entries detailing requests from the Indian Embassy, 30 reco­rded by SHW were requests for telephone calls to trade officials and White House senior officials to “discuss [the] status of US-India trade conversations”. The calls increased in frequency as relations nosedived over US decisions to impose 25pc reciprocal tariffs and another 25pc in penalty tariffs for India’s oil procurement. As tensions abated after Trump and Modi exchanged cordial words over social media, SHW said it made calls to White House officials to “flag social media post by Prime Minister Modi”. Trump subsequently called Modi for his birthday on September 17, 2025, and the two leaders have spoken several times since then. Published in Dawn, January 7th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar on Wednesday announced a “massive” operation against dacoits in the Katcha areas of the province. Speaking to reporters in Sukkur, Lanjar said a meeting was held wherein it was decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”. “We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits that you see on social media,” he added. Asked when the operation against the riverine dacoits was expected to begin, the minister replied, “You may consider that the operation has begun from today”. Lanjar said dacoits would be “given a chance” to surrender before the courts. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them, there will be a fight, and they will get their just deserts,” he warned. As per the Surrender Policy for Dacoits in Katcha Area of Sukkur and Larkana Divisions, approved by the Sindh cabinet in October 2025, surrendering does not mean pardon or immunity. All surrendering individuals shall face the prevailing law of the land, officials told Dawn , though voluntary surrender may be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing by courts. The Sindh home minister appreciated the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation wherein a no-go Katcha area was vacated. Responding to a question about whether the army’s help will be sought, Lanjar said, “The Sindh police is capable and the Rangers are with us in this, so I do not think we will need the army in our internal matters here.“ The minister further asserted that the required modern equipment will be provided to the personnel. When a reporter mentioned that the dacoits employed drones, Lanjar said, “I do not think drones have reached them. Action is definitely being taken against their facilitators, too.” On the possibility of a joint operation carried out by the Sindh and Punjab police, Lanjar said he has directed the Sindh inspector general to speak with his Punjab counterpart and the Bahawalpur regional police officer regarding the matter. “This will surely happen only after a joint effort,” he stressed, noting that the area of Machka extends into Punjab. “I have strong hopes that we will wipe out these dacoits,” Lanjar said. Asked about tribal disputes , the Sindh minister said this matter was also discussed in today’s meeting, and they had made the relevant contacts regarding the Jatoi-Mahar clash as well. Although the Katcha areas extend to many districts of the central and southern Sindh, the districts such as Kashmore, Ghotki, Shikarpur and Jacobabad are particularly notorious for high prevalence of crimes like dacoity, kidnap for ransom and tribal conflicts. On December 16, around 25 dacoits had attacked a bus near the Sindh-Punjab border and kidnapped 20 passengers after injuring the driver. The police recovered all the travellers unharmed the next day in a large operation. When the Tanvir Indhar gang kidnapped at least 10 people from multiple vehicles on the Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5) in Sadiqabad tehsil on Sept 5, 2025, it marked the first reported instance of Katcha gangs directly accessing M5 within Punjab’s limits. As a safety measure, the police in Rahim Yar Khan later started running escorted night convoys on M-5 to protect motorists from dacoit gangs. The Sindh and Punjab governments had vowed decisive action against the Katcha outlaws in August 2024, after a dozen policemen were martyred in a deadly attack by dacoits in the Machka area.",

      "title_orig": "PTI pushes back against criticism of party leadership, policies",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI has pushed back against criticism of its party leadership and policies, terming such remarks “regrettable”. In a statement posted on the social media platform X late on Tuesday, the party referred to the military spokesperson’s latest press conference . It said that it was “regrettable” that the party, its leadership and an elected provincial government were subjected to such criticism. The PTI maintained that consistent criticism “not only escalates political temperatures but also raises questions about the balance of the state apparatus”. The party said that terming opposition to a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it is in power, as support for terrorists was contrary to ground realities. It recalled that a peace jirga was organised by the provincial government on Nov 12, 2025, where participants “unanimously resolved that a military operation is not a sustainable solution to any problem, and a comprehensive, consensus-based, and inclusive national policy is indispensable for lasting peace”. It also took offence at the statement that terrorists do not target the PTI. “This is completely contrary to ground realities,” it said, adding that raising such questions would only add to the grief of the martyrs, the injured and the affected families. The party maintained that the impression the PTI was safe from terrorism reflected “a disregard for facts and is unfortunate”. The PTI noted that several state departments in the past had issued threat alerts for party founder Imran Khan and other leaders on multiple occasions. The party also objected to the “repeated targeting” of Imran, who it said was “not even allowed meetings and has not had an opportunity to respond to the allegations”. “Publicly criticising a political leader who is unjustly imprisoned, who cannot exercise his fundamental right to defend himself, and whose voice is being deliberately suppressed is not appropriate in any way,” the PTI said. It further stated that the images and speeches shown during the military spokesperson’s press briefing of “one province and one political party” were not “befitting of the country’s defence institution”. “The PTI wants to make it clear that we are against terrorism, believe in the supremacy of the Constitution and are willing to cooperate with all state institutions within the framework of the law,” the party said. It warned that “bringing political differences into press conferences will further stoke instability”. “There should be no politics on serious national issues such as terrorism,” the PTI asserted, stating that “staying united was essential, rather than dividing the nation on an issue like terrorism”. “History bears witness that despite internal political differences, the PTI has always chosen to stand with the state on matters of Pakistan’s security, sovereignty, and national interests,” it said, adding that there could be no compromise on national security. “Whenever the country has come face-to-face with external threats or security challenges, the PTI has played a responsible role on every platform and shown cooperation with the government,“ it said. KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’ in combating terrorism Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement posted on X, said that opposition to a potential military operation in the province was not limited to the PTI. He stressed that “all political and religious parties of KP, as well as individuals from different schools of thought, were in agreement that military operations are not a long-term solution”. “The issue is not merely that the state is not serious about combating terrorism; the problem also lies in decisions being made without taking into confidence the ground realities, elected representatives, local population, and the provincial government,“ he said. The KP CM said that the people in his province were “dealing with insecurity, economic stagnation, fears of displacement and had developed a distrust in state policies”. “Businesses, education, and daily routines are repeatedly disrupted, while the local population is not included in decision-making,” the KP CM said. He went on to say that despite “22 military operations and nearly 14,000 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted in KP, terrorism had not yet been eliminated”. CM Afridi said the situation indicated “serious flaws in policymaking and its implementation”. “In such a scenario, instead of insisting on ineffective policies from closed rooms, a clear policy shift has become inevitable, because the nation’s resources are being squandered endlessly on these failed strategies, and the protection of people’s lives and property remains continuously at risk,” he said. He questioned whether any “concrete guarantees” existed that would ensure that a military operation would result in long-term peace. “If past strategies, despite loss of life and the use of immense resources, failed to deliver the desired results, how are the people and their elected representatives being assured that the same approach will produce different outcomes this time?” CM Afridi asked. “Without transparency in policymaking, clear objectives, and measurable results, any new initiative risks adding to uncertainty rather than peace,” he added. He maintained that “a negative mindset from the representative of a state institution will damage national unity and also stoke instability”. “It is also a bitter reality that, despite repeated warnings, terrorism was allowed to re-enter KP, and its spread was fueled through self-serving narratives,“ he said. The KP CM said that the PTI had also “paid a toll in this war”. “Party officials, elected representatives, and ministers have been targeted by terrorists; some were martyred by bullets, while others were martyred in blasts,” he said. He stressed that instead of press conferences and unilateral decisions, implementation of the KP Assembly’s declaration following the national jirga should be allowed. “It is also essential that future decisions be made, not in closed rooms or based on the whims of individuals, but under policies formulated by all stakeholders and the elected representatives of the people,” Afridi added. The statements from the PTI and the KP chief minister come after Inter-Services Pub­lic Relations (ISPR) chief Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, in a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, accused the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 — ostensibly referring to the PTI — of “internally facilitating terrorists” and deciding to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan”.",

He questioned whether any “concrete guarantees” existed that would ensure that a military operation would result in long-term peace. “If past strategies, despite loss of life and the use of immense resources, failed to deliver the desired results, how are the people and their elected representatives being assured that the same approach will produce different outcomes this time?” CM Afridi asked. “Without transparency in policymaking, clear objectives, and measurable results, any new initiative risks adding to uncertainty rather than peace,” he added. He maintained that “a negative mindset from the representative of a state institution will damage national unity and also stoke instability”. “It is also a bitter reality that, despite repeated warnings, terrorism was allowed to re-enter KP, and its spread was fueled through self-serving narratives,“ he said. The KP CM said that the PTI had also “paid a toll in this war”. “Party officials, elected representatives, and ministers have been targeted by terrorists; some were martyred by bullets, while others were martyred in blasts,” he said. He stressed that instead of press conferences and unilateral decisions, implementation of the KP Assembly’s declaration following the national jirga should be allowed. “It is also essential that future decisions be made, not in closed rooms or based on the whims of individuals, but under policies formulated by all stakeholders and the elected representatives of the people,” Afridi added. The statements from the PTI and the KP chief minister come after Inter-Services Pub­lic Relations (ISPR) chief Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, in a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, accused the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 — ostensibly referring to the PTI — of “internally facilitating terrorists” and deciding to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan”.",
      "title": "PTI pushes back against criticism of party leadership, policies",
      "summary": "The PTI has pushed back against criticism of its party leadership and policies, terming such remarks “regrettable”. In a statement posted on the social media platform X late on Tuesday, the party referred to the military spokesperson’s latest press conference . It said that it was “regrettable” that the party, its leadership and an elected provincial government were subjected to such criticism. The PTI maintained that consistent criticism “not only escalates political temperatures but also raises questions about the balance of the state apparatus”. The party said that terming opposition to a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it is in power, as support for terrorists was contrary to ground realities. It recalled that a peace jirga was organised by the provincial government on Nov 12, 2025, where participants “unanimously resolved that a military operation is not a sustainable solution to any problem, and a comprehensive, consensus-based, and inclusive national policy is indispensable for lasting peace”. It also took offence at the statement that terrorists do not target the PTI. “This is completely contrary to ground realities,” it said, adding that raising such questions would only add to the grief of the martyrs, the injured and the affected families. The party maintained that the impression the PTI was safe from terrorism reflected “a disregard for facts and is unfortunate”. The PTI noted that several state departments in the past had issued threat alerts for party founder Imran Khan and other leaders on multiple occasions. The party also objected to the “repeated targeting” of Imran, who it said was “not even allowed meetings and has not had an opportunity to respond to the allegations”. “Publicly criticising a political leader who is unjustly imprisoned, who cannot exercise his fundamental right to defend himself, and whose voice is being deliberately suppressed is not appropriate in any way,” the PTI said. It further stated that the images and speeches shown during the military spokesperson’s press briefing of “one province and one political party” were not “befitting of the country’s defence institution”. “The PTI wants to make it clear that we are against terrorism, believe in the supremacy of the Constitution and are willing to cooperate with all state institutions within the framework of the law,” the party said. It warned that “bringing political differences into press conferences will further stoke instability”. “There should be no politics on serious national issues such as terrorism,” the PTI asserted, stating that “staying united was essential, rather than dividing the nation on an issue like terrorism”. “History bears witness that despite internal political differences, the PTI has always chosen to stand with the state on matters of Pakistan’s security, sovereignty, and national interests,” it said, adding that there could be no compromise on national security. “Whenever the country has come face-to-face with external threats or security challenges, the PTI has played a responsible role on every platform and shown cooperation with the government,“ it said. KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’ in combating terrorism Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement posted on X, said that opposition to a potential military operation in the province was not limited to the PTI. He stressed that “all political and religious parties of KP, as well as individuals from different schools of thought, were in agreement that military operations are not a long-term solution”. “The issue is not merely that the state is not serious about combating terrorism; the problem also lies in decisions being made without taking into confidence the ground realities, elected representatives, local population, and the provincial government,“ he said. The KP CM said that the people in his province were “dealing with insecurity, economic stagnation, fears of displacement and had developed a distrust in state policies”. “Businesses, education, and daily routines are repeatedly disrupted, while the local population is not included in decision-making,” the KP CM said. He went on to say that despite “22 military operations and nearly 14,000 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted in KP, terrorism had not yet been eliminated”. CM Afridi said the situation indicated “serious flaws in policymaking and its implementation”. “In such a scenario, instead of insisting on ineffective policies from closed rooms, a clear policy shift has become inevitable, because the nation’s resources are being squandered endlessly on these failed strategies, and the protection of people’s lives and property remains continuously at risk,” he said.

      "title_orig": "Trump says Venezuela ‘turning over’ up to 50m barrels of oil to US",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Venezuela’s interim government will deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States, and that the proceeds “will be controlled by me” as president. The development is a strong sign that the Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention. Trump has said he wants interim President Delcy Rodriguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry. Venezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump since mid-December. The blockade was part of rising US pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in US forces launching a “large-scale strike” in the country and kidnapping him this weekend. Top Venezuelan officials have accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves. Venezuela will be “turning over” between 30 and 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil” to the US, Trump said in a social media post. “This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” he added. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday. The Asian country has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020. “Trump wants this to happen early so he can say it is a big win,” an oil industry source said. Venezuelan government officials and Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the government and state oil company***,*** did not provide comment. Chevron in control of Venezuelan oil flows to US US crude prices fell more than 1.5 per cent after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron , PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation. Chevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade. It was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars. Venezuela has been selling its flagship crude grade, Merey, at around $22 per barrel below Brent for delivery at Venezuelan ports, giving a value for the deal at up to $1.9 billion. Rodriguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday, is herself under US sanctions imposed in 2018 for undermining democracy. Talks involve possible auctions with US buyers Venezuelan and US officials this week discussed possible sales mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested US buyers to bid for cargoes, and issuing US licences to PDVSA’s business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources told Reuters . Those licences have in the past allowed PDVSA’s joint venture partners and customers, including Chevron, India’s Reliance, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and European Eni and Repsol, to have access to Venezuelan oil to refine or to resell to third parties. This week, some of those companies have begun making preparations for receiving Venezuelan cargoes again, two separate sources said. The US and Venezuela have also discussed if Venezuelan oil can be used in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said. Trump did not refer to this possibility. Increased oil flows would be ‘great news’ US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that an increased flow of Venezuelan heavy oil to the US Gulf would be “great news” for job security, future gasoline prices in the US and for Venezuela. “Venezuela has an opportunity now to actually have capital come in and rebuild their economy and take advantage,” he told Fox News , when asked about talks between the governments on oil exports. “With American technology, American partnership, Venezuela can be transformed.” US refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela’s heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000bpd before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela. PDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. Without a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said. Oil traders reacted to news of the deal talks on Tuesday. Differentials for some heavy oil grades in the US Gulf slipped around 50 cents per barrel on Tuesday on the prospect of more Venezuelan supplies.",

      "summary_orig": "The sisters of incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan and party supporters ended their sit-in near Adiala jail late on Tuesday after being given assurances of a meeting with the ex-premier being arranged next week. In a video posted by Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on the social media platform X, Imran’s sister Aleema said that Mahmood Khan Achakzai had informed them that a meeting would be arranged next week. Achakzai is the head of the TTAP opposition alliance and chairman of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party. “This is what he reassured us about, that a meeting will be arranged next week,” Aleema said, as she looked at Achakzai, who was standing next to her along with Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir. Achakzai and Nasir had arrived at the site of the protest earlier on Tuesday. “Achakzai sahib has said that because they are saying a meeting will be arranged next week, today we should disperse ourselves before the water cannons show up. That is his advice,” she said. Recently, protests staged by the PTI and Imran’s sisters have been dispersed by authorities with water cannons, which the party has alleged were filled with chemical-laced water. In another video, she said they were grateful for both Achakzai and Nasir, adding that their presence gave a lot of strength to the protesters. However, she warned that the protesters would not willingly disperse next week. “Next week, we will not move,” she said with a smile as people laughed around her. “If they do not allow a meeting, we will not move,” she asserted, calling on people to join their demonstration. She said that her sisters had first refused to end the sit-in. However, they had decided to do so in respect of Achakzai and Nasir. For his part, Achakzai said in a video posted by the PTI that the denial of a meeting with Imran was in contradiction of all international laws. He said that he had spoken to a station house officer (SHO) who had assured him that he would try to arrange a meeting. He further said that at least 10,000 people should gather at next Tuesday’s protest. “If people want that a meeting with Imran should be allowed, especially PTI protesters, if they want that his sisters are respected, [then] this is a test case for them. At least 10,000 people should be here next Tuesday,” he said. “If you don’t come, then forget about everything,” he said. On Tuesday, police had sprayed water at Factory Naka, where an anti-riot fence had been erected to prevent PTI leaders and supporters from moving forward. However, after waiting for the water to dry, the protesters had staged a sit-in at the site. The PTI leadership has provided a list of lawyers approved to meet Imran Khan in accordance with the Islamabad High Court’s order. The approved lawyers included Gohar Ali Khan, Salman Akram Raja, Ali Zaman, Waqas Raza Khan, Malik Faraz, and Sophia Noreen. A letter written by Salman Akram Raja was sent to the superintendent of Central Jail Adiala, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. It should be mentioned that Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said last month that meetings with Imran would remain suspended till Feb 8.",

Achakzai is the head of the TTAP opposition alliance and chairman of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party. “This is what he reassured us about, that a meeting will be arranged next week,” Aleema said, as she looked at Achakzai, who was standing next to her along with Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir. Achakzai and Nasir had arrived at the site of the protest earlier on Tuesday. “Achakzai sahib has said that because they are saying a meeting will be arranged next week, today we should disperse ourselves before the water cannons show up. That is his advice,” she said. Recently, protests staged by the PTI and Imran’s sisters have been dispersed by authorities with water cannons, which the party has alleged were filled with chemical-laced water. In another video, she said they were grateful for both Achakzai and Nasir, adding that their presence gave a lot of strength to the protesters. However, she warned that the protesters would not willingly disperse next week. “Next week, we will not move,” she said with a smile as people laughed around her. “If they do not allow a meeting, we will not move,” she asserted, calling on people to join their demonstration. She said that her sisters had first refused to end the sit-in. However, they had decided to do so in respect of Achakzai and Nasir. For his part, Achakzai said in a video posted by the PTI that the denial of a meeting with Imran was in contradiction of all international laws. He said that he had spoken to a station house officer (SHO) who had assured him that he would try to arrange a meeting. He further said that at least 10,000 people should gather at next Tuesday’s protest. “If people want that a meeting with Imran should be allowed, especially PTI protesters, if they want that his sisters are respected, [then] this is a test case for them. At least 10,000 people should be here next Tuesday,” he said. “If you don’t come, then forget about everything,” he said. On Tuesday, police had sprayed water at Factory Naka, where an anti-riot fence had been erected to prevent PTI leaders and supporters from moving forward. However, after waiting for the water to dry, the protesters had staged a sit-in at the site. The PTI leadership has provided a list of lawyers approved to meet Imran Khan in accordance with the Islamabad High Court’s order. The approved lawyers included Gohar Ali Khan, Salman Akram Raja, Ali Zaman, Waqas Raza Khan, Malik Faraz, and Sophia Noreen. A letter written by Salman Akram Raja was sent to the superintendent of Central Jail Adiala, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. It should be mentioned that Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said last month that meetings with Imran would remain suspended till Feb 8.",

Haroon Siddique reports Kamran Ahmed was arrested in a dawn raid, 19 November 2024. Now he is one of 24 prisoners awaiting trial for allegedly causing more than £1m worth of damage to a research centre in Gloucestershire owned by the Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems. He has been on hunger strike at HMP Pentonville for 59 days, and is one of three remaining Palestine Action activists refusing food. The Guardian’s legal correspondent, Haroon Siddique , has been in touch with him, and tells Nosheen Iqbal that he put some questions to Ahmed via an intermediary. The 28-year-old told Siddique: “I’m worried, but being scared does not mean for one second I am not willing. I intend to continue my hunger strike. Perhaps they wait for me to leave in a body bag. The way my chest hurts when I speak, it doesn’t feel too far in the near future. ” Continue reading...",
