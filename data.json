      "title_orig": "Who is Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela’s president?",
      "summary_orig": "Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who has been in power for nearly 12 years, saw his rule come to a sudden end earlier today. After a lightning raid on Caracas, President Donald Trump said Maduro had been captured by US forces on Saturday. Trump, whose government has accused the Venezuelan president of running drug cartels and other crimes, had been pressuring the strongman to leave office for months. Maduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, the son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Hugo Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992. He campaigned for Chavez’s release from prison and became a fervent supporter of his leftist agenda. According to a BBC report, Maduro held a long and close association with Chavez, which dates back to Chavez’s imprisonment. Maduro won a seat in the legislature following Chavez’s 1998 election. In the years that followed, he rose to become president of the National Assembly and then foreign minister, travelling the globe to build international alliances through oil-financed assistance programs. Maduro, who likes to chug green juices at campaign events, citing their health properties, is heir to his late mentor. In 2012, Chávez named him as his hand-picked successor, and Maduro was narrowly elected president in 2013 following his death. During his tenure, his administration oversaw a spectacular economic collapse characterised by hyperinflation and chronic shortages. His rule became best known for allegedly rigged elections, food shortages and rights abuses, including harsh crackdowns on protests in 2014 and 2017. Millions of Venezuelans emigrated abroad. In 2016, following the release of years of economic data, Maduro declared a state of economic emergency, followed by a constitutional state of emergency, as per a report by CNN. According to a Reuters report from last year, the Venezuelan president has a flair for theatrics, and often calls opposition politicians “fascist demons” and “the surnames,” the latter a jibe at their supposedly wealthy backgrounds. Critics both at home and abroad say he is a dictator who has jailed or persecuted political opponents, repeatedly and unfairly blocking opposition candidates from participating in elections. In 2020, Maduro‘s government was subject to aggressive sanctions by the US and other powers as Washington indicted him on corruption and other charges. According to the US Department of State, an initial reward offer of up to $15 million was placed for Maduro’s capture, which was revised in August 2025 to $50m. Maduro has rejected the accusations. In January 2025, he was sworn in for a third term following a 2024 election that was widely condemned by international observers and the opposition as fraudulent. Thousands of people who protested the government’s declaration of victory were jailed. Last month, a UN Fact-Finding Mission found that the country’s Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a decade in targeting political opponents, often with impunity. Maduro’s government’s repressive measures were also highlighted by the award of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

In a brief phone interview with The New York Times , Trump hailed the “brilliant” operation. “A lot of good planning and a lot of great, great troops and great people,” the paper quoted Trump as saying. Venezuela has since demanded an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the US attacks. “Faced with the criminal aggression committed by the US government against our homeland, we have requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council, which is responsible for upholding international law,” Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil wrote on the Telegram messaging platform. ‘New dawn, the tyrant is gone’ “A new dawn for Venezuela! The tyrant is gone. He will now — finally — face justice for his crimes,” US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said on X. US Senator Mike Lee said the country had completed its military action, quoting Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “He anticipates no further action in Venezuela now that Maduro is in US custody,” Lee, a Republican initially critical of the operation, wrote on X after what he said was a telephone call with Rubio. Rubio, meanwhile, uploaded a screenshot of one of his old posts on X today, which claimed Maduro was not the president of Venezuela. The old post, dated July 27, 2025, reads: “Maduro is NOT the President of Venezuela and his regime is NOT the legitimate government. “Maduro is the head of the Cartel de Los Soles, a narco-terror organization which has taken possession of a country. And he is under indictment for pushing drugs into the United States,” Rubio added. Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, situated in the south of Caracas, and Carlota airbase in the north, were among the targets of the strikes. Blasts were also heard in La Guaira, north of the capital, where Caracas’s airport and port are located. A US official said Maduro was captured by elite US special forces troops. Proof of life Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said the government does not know the whereabouts of President Maduro or his wife Cilia Flores, in an audio played on state TV. “We demand immediate proof of life of President Nicolas Maduro and the first combatant Cilia Flores,” Rodriguez said. Smoke rises near Fort Tiuna, after U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. has struck Venezuela and captured its President Nicolas Maduro, in Caracas, Venezuela, January 3, 2026. — Reuters Meanwhile, Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino López accused the United States of hitting residential areas. The “invading” US forces “have desecrated our soil, going so far as to strike, using missiles and rockets fired from their combat helicopters, residential areas populated by civilians,” Lopez said in a video statement shared on social media. He also said the South American country would launch a “massive deployment of all land, air, naval, riverine and missile capabilities … for comprehensive defence“. The defence minister called for a united front of resistance in the face of “the worst aggression” ever against Venezuela. Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, meanwhile, said that the country “will overcome” the wave of US military strikes. Considered one of the most powerful men in Caracas, Cabello told a local television broadcast, “At the end of these attacks, we will overcome,” adding that “this is not our first battle against our people… we have managed to survive under all circumstances“. The Venezuelan opposition, headed by recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, said in a statement that it had no official comment on the events. Separately, Colombian President Gustavo Petro said he ordered the deployment of military forces to the Venezuelan border. Petro described Washington’s actions as an “assault on the sovereignty” of Latin America and said they would result in a humanitarian crisis. Petro made no mention of Maduro’s capture, despite the Venezuelan leader being one of his government’s closest allies in the region. Action in Venezuela recalls past US interventions While various Latin American governments oppose Maduro and say he stole the 2024 election, direct US action has revived painful memories of past interventions and is generally strongly opposed by governments and populations in the region. Washington has not made such a direct intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega. Trump‘s action recalls the ‘ Monroe Doctrine ’, laid out in 1823 by President James Monroe, laying the US claim to influence in the region, as well as the “gunboat diplomacy” seen under Theodore Roosevelt in the early 1900s. Night view of Caracas taken after a series of explosions heard on January 3, 2026. — AFP Political backlash in the US? Trump’s stunning announcement follows months of steadily mounting US military and economic pressure on leftist leader Maduro and his country’s oil-export-dependent economy. The US president said in December, “it would be smart for [Maduro]” to step down“ and has also said that the Venezuelan leader’s “days are numbered”. It was unclear under what legal authority the latest US strikes were carried out. Legal experts have raised questions about the legality of attacks on suspected drug vessels in the region, which have killed more than 110 people so far. Trump‘s move risks drawing backlash from the US Congress, which has the constitutional right to declare war, and from his own political base, which favours an ‘America First policy’ and largely opposes military intervention abroad. MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said oil prices were likely to jump on the near-term risk to supply, but that the US strike could be bearish in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government results in sanctions being lifted and renewed foreign investment. Picture of fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP Trump’s claim of Maduro’s capture comes two days after Maduro attempted to engage with Trump, offering cooperation on fighting drug trafficking and illegal migration. The US has accused Maduro of running a “narco-state” and rigging an election. Trump had also repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela. The Venezuelan leader, who succeeded Hugo Chavez to take power in 2013, has said Washington wants to take control of its oil reserves, the second-largest in the world.",

Washington has not made such a direct intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega. Trump‘s action recalls the ‘ Monroe Doctrine ’, laid out in 1823 by President James Monroe, laying the US claim to influence in the region, as well as the “gunboat diplomacy” seen under Theodore Roosevelt in the early 1900s. Night view of Caracas taken after a series of explosions heard on January 3, 2026. — AFP Political backlash in the US? Trump’s stunning announcement follows months of steadily mounting US military and economic pressure on leftist leader Maduro and his country’s oil-export-dependent economy. The US president said in December, “it would be smart for [Maduro]” to step down“ and has also said that the Venezuelan leader’s “days are numbered”. It was unclear under what legal authority the latest US strikes were carried out. Legal experts have raised questions about the legality of attacks on suspected drug vessels in the region, which have killed more than 110 people so far. Trump‘s move risks drawing backlash from the US Congress, which has the constitutional right to declare war, and from his own political base, which favours an ‘America First policy’ and largely opposes military intervention abroad. MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said oil prices were likely to jump on the near-term risk to supply, but that the US strike could be bearish in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government results in sanctions being lifted and renewed foreign investment. Picture of fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP Trump’s claim of Maduro’s capture comes two days after Maduro attempted to engage with Trump, offering cooperation on fighting drug trafficking and illegal migration. The US has accused Maduro of running a “narco-state” and rigging an election. Trump had also repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela. The Venezuelan leader, who succeeded Hugo Chavez to take power in 2013, has said Washington wants to take control of its oil reserves, the second-largest in the world.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States early on Saturday launched a “large-scale strike” on Venezuela, with President Donald Trump announcing that US forces had captured the South American country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro and his wife. “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country,“ Trump said in a Truth Social post . Multiple explosions rocked Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, earlier in the day, and columns of black smoke and aircraft could be seen. Responding to the development in a video statement, Venezuela’s Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said the country would resist the presence of foreign troops. The strikes come after months of steadily mounting US military and economic pressure on Maduro and his country’s oil-export-dependent economy. Here is how the world is reacting to the development. View this post on Instagram ‘Violation of territorial integrity’: Iran In a statement, the Iranian foreign ministry condemned the attack on Venezuela. It strongly condemned the “American military attack on Venezuela”, declaring it a “flagrant violation of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country“. Colombia calls for de-escalation In a post on X, Colombian President Gustavo Petro reaffirmed his country’s “unrestricted commitment to the principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nations, in particular the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, the prohibition of the use or threat of use of force, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes”. “In this regard, the Colombian government rejects any unilateral military action that could aggravate the situation or put the civilian population at risk,” he wrote on the social media platform. Petro said that Colombia had adopted a position “oriented toward the preservation of regional peace” and called for de-escalation. He further called on all parties to refrain from actions that deepen the confrontation and to prioritise dialogue and diplomatic channels. “As a preventive measure, the national government has arranged measures to protect the civilian population, preserve stability on the Colombian-Venezuelan border, and promptly address any eventual humanitarian or migratory needs, in coordination with local authorities and competent organisations,” he added. ‘Criminal attack’: Cuba In a sharp condemnation, Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez denounced the “criminal attack by the US on Venezuela”. In a post on X, he called on the international community to react against the US strikes. “Our Zone De Paz (Zone of Peace) is being brutally assaulted,” he wrote, describing the US action as “state terrorism” against not only the Venezuelan people but also “our America”. EU calls for restraint The European Union called for “restraint” and respect for international law after the strikes. “The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition,” the bloc’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote on X after speaking with her US counterpart, Marco Rubio. “Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint,” she wrote. Spain offers to negotiate The Spanish foreign ministry offered in a statement to negotiate and help find a peaceful solution in Venezuela. It further called for de-escalation, moderation and respect for international law in the South American country. ‘Act of armed aggression’: Russia Russia expressed deep concern over the development and condemned what it described as an “act of armed aggression” against Venezuela committed by the United States, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “In the current situation, it is important … to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue,” it said. “We call for immediate clarification of this situation. Such actions, if they did indeed take place, constitute an unacceptable violation of the sovereignty of an independent state, respect for which is a key principle of international law,” the ministry said in a statement. ‘Great concern’: Germany Germany’s foreign ministry said it was watching the situation in Venezuela with great concern. A written communication obtained by Reuters said the ministry was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas, and a crisis team would meet later in the day. Italy monitoring situation in Venezuela Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome and its diplomatic representation in Caracas were monitoring any developments of the situation in Venezuela with particular attention to the Italian community in the country. Tajani said in a post on X that Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was being kept constantly informed and that the foreign ministry’s crisis unit was operational. Earlier, Italy’s Ambassador in Venezuela said that around 160,000 Italians currently live in the country, most of them with dual passports, as well as some who are there for reasons of work and tourism. ‘Services fully mobilised’ Belgium said it was coordinating with European partners in order to closely monitor the situation in Venezuela. “Our embassy in Bogot, which is responsible for Venezuela, and our services in Brussels are fully mobilised. The situation is being closely monitored, in coordination with our European partners,” Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Prevot said in a post on X. Indonesia emphasises importance of UN Charter Indonesia is also monitoring developments in Venezuela to ensure the safety of its citizens. “Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritise peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritising the protection of civilians,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Yvonne Mewengkang said. “Indonesia emphasises the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter.” Header image: Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP",

It strongly condemned the “American military attack on Venezuela”, declaring it a “flagrant violation of the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country“. Colombia calls for de-escalation In a post on X, Colombian President Gustavo Petro reaffirmed his country’s “unrestricted commitment to the principles enshrined in the charter of the United Nations, in particular the respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, the prohibition of the use or threat of use of force, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes”. “In this regard, the Colombian government rejects any unilateral military action that could aggravate the situation or put the civilian population at risk,” he wrote on the social media platform. Petro said that Colombia had adopted a position “oriented toward the preservation of regional peace” and called for de-escalation. He further called on all parties to refrain from actions that deepen the confrontation and to prioritise dialogue and diplomatic channels. “As a preventive measure, the national government has arranged measures to protect the civilian population, preserve stability on the Colombian-Venezuelan border, and promptly address any eventual humanitarian or migratory needs, in coordination with local authorities and competent organisations,” he added. ‘Criminal attack’: Cuba In a sharp condemnation, Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel Bermudez denounced the “criminal attack by the US on Venezuela”. In a post on X, he called on the international community to react against the US strikes. “Our Zone De Paz (Zone of Peace) is being brutally assaulted,” he wrote, describing the US action as “state terrorism” against not only the Venezuelan people but also “our America”. EU calls for restraint The European Union called for “restraint” and respect for international law after the strikes. “The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition,” the bloc’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas wrote on X after speaking with her US counterpart, Marco Rubio. “Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint,” she wrote. Spain offers to negotiate The Spanish foreign ministry offered in a statement to negotiate and help find a peaceful solution in Venezuela. It further called for de-escalation, moderation and respect for international law in the South American country. ‘Act of armed aggression’: Russia Russia expressed deep concern over the development and condemned what it described as an “act of armed aggression” against Venezuela committed by the United States, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. “In the current situation, it is important … to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue,” it said. “We call for immediate clarification of this situation. Such actions, if they did indeed take place, constitute an unacceptable violation of the sovereignty of an independent state, respect for which is a key principle of international law,” the ministry said in a statement. ‘Great concern’: Germany Germany’s foreign ministry said it was watching the situation in Venezuela with great concern. A written communication obtained by Reuters said the ministry was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas, and a crisis team would meet later in the day. Italy monitoring situation in Venezuela Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Rome and its diplomatic representation in Caracas were monitoring any developments of the situation in Venezuela with particular attention to the Italian community in the country. Tajani said in a post on X that Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni was being kept constantly informed and that the foreign ministry’s crisis unit was operational. Earlier, Italy’s Ambassador in Venezuela said that around 160,000 Italians currently live in the country, most of them with dual passports, as well as some who are there for reasons of work and tourism. ‘Services fully mobilised’ Belgium said it was coordinating with European partners in order to closely monitor the situation in Venezuela. “Our embassy in Bogot, which is responsible for Venezuela, and our services in Brussels are fully mobilised. The situation is being closely monitored, in coordination with our European partners,” Belgian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Prevot said in a post on X. Indonesia emphasises importance of UN Charter Indonesia is also monitoring developments in Venezuela to ensure the safety of its citizens. “Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritise peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritising the protection of civilians,” Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Yvonne Mewengkang said. “Indonesia emphasises the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter.” Header image: Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela’s largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas on January 3, 2026. — AFP",

      "summary": "The United States early on Saturday launched a “large-scale strike” on Venezuela, with President Donald Trump announcing that US forces had captured the South American country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro and his wife. “The United States of America has successfully carried out a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country,“ Trump said in a Truth Social post . Multiple explosions rocked Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, earlier in the day, and columns of black smoke and aircraft could be seen. Responding to the development in a video statement, Venezuela’s Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said the country would resist the presence of foreign troops.

Here is what we know so far: Donald Trump has claimed the US has “captured” Venezuela’s dictator, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them out of the South American country after a pre-dawn assault on Caracas and the surrounding region. The US president said a press conference will be held in Florida at 11am local time (4pm GMT). Venezuela’s government accused the US of launching a series of attacks against civilian and military targets in the South American country, after explosions rocked its capital, Caracas, before dawn on Saturday. In a statement, Venezuela’s government urged citizens to rise up against the assault and said Washington risked plunging Latin America into chaos with “an extremely serious” act of “military aggression”. “The entire country must mobilise to defeat this imperialist aggression,” it added. Explosions and low-flying aircraft were heard in Caracas in the early hours of Saturday. In its statement, Venezuela’s government confirmed that the city had come under attack, as well as three other states: Miranda , La Guaira and Aragua . Venezuela has accused the US of trying to “seize control” of the country’s resources, in particular its oil and minerals. Venezuela has called on the international community to denounce what it called a flagrant violation of international law that puts millions of lives at risk. In the early hours of Saturday, the president of neighbouring Colombia, Gustavo Petro, called for an immediate emergency session of the UN security council , saying on social media that Venezuela had come under attack.

      "summary": "Venezuela has accused the United States of launching attacks after a series of explosions struck Caracas and other regions, prompting President Nicolás Maduro to say his government had repelled what he called U.S. military aggression and to declare a state of emergency. The blasts were reported around 2 a.m. local time, accompanied by the sound of aircraft overhead, with smoke seen rising from a military base hangar and power outages affecting parts of the capital.

      "title_orig": "BCCI instructs Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh’s Mustafizur after pressure from BJP",
      "summary_orig": "Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders have been told to release fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia said on Saturday, amid growing tensions between the countries. The development comes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticed Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise, calling Khan a traitor. Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR had come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus. Last month, hundreds protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi after Hindu factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). A total of 12 people were arrested in connection with his death. “Due to recent developments going on all across, the BCCI has instructed the franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad,” Saikia told Indian news agency ANI . “They can ask for a replacement if needed. And upon request, BCCI will allow a replacement player.” “BCCI will allow Kolkata Knight Riders a replacement player in line with IPL regulations, and further details will be communicated in due course,” the team added in a statement. Reuters has approached Mustafizur for comment. Mustafizur, 30, has played for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals in previous seasons of the IPL, taking 65 wickets in 60 matches. He was signed by Kolkata in last month’s auction for a fee of 92 million Indian rupees ($1.02 million), making him the most expensive player from Bangladesh in IPL history. According to the Hindustan Times , opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Som’s criticism of Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise. While calling Khan a “gaddar” (traitor), former Uttar Pradesh MLA Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”. The Hindustan Times quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there. “Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.” The incident worsened relations between India and its neighbour, with ties already strained after Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to New Delhi following protests against her in 2024. The 19th edition of the IPL begins on March 26, after India and Sri Lanka co-host the Twenty20 World Cup starting in February.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Air Force (PAF) has successfully conducted the flight test of the indigenously developed “Taimoor” weapon system, the military’s media affairs wing said on Saturday. In a statement , Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the development marked another significant milestone in the advancement of national aerospace and defence capabilities. “Taimoor air-launched cruise missile is capable of engaging enemy land and sea targets with high precision at a range of 600 kilometres, carrying a conventional warhead,” it said. “Equipped with state-of-the-art navigation and guidance system, Taimoor is designed to fly at very low altitudes, enabling it to effectively evade hostile air and missile defence systems,” it said. “Its precision-strike capability significantly enhances the conventional deterrence and operational flexibility of PAF, further strengthening the country’s overall defence posture,” it added. “The successful flight test underscores the technical maturity, innovation and self-reliance achieved by Pakistan’s defence industry. The launch was witnessed by senior officers of the Pakistan Armed Forces, along with distinguished scientists and engineers who played a pivotal role in the development of this advanced weapon system,” ISPR said. PAF Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu also extended congratulations to the scientists, engineers and PAF team on the achievement, the statement said. “He lauded their professional excellence, dedication and unwavering commitment to strengthening Pakistan’s defence capabilities,” it added. The air chief also reaffirmed that such accomplishments “are a testament to the nation’s resolve to achieve technological self-sufficiency and maintain a credible conventional deterrent in the evolving regional security environment”. “The successful test of the Taimoor weapon system reflects Pakistan Air Force’s continued pursuit of operational readiness, technological superiority and national security objectives,” he was quoted as saying. President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to PAF for the successful test. “The preparation of modern weapons at the local level is a clear reflection of national capability, resolve, and institutional expertise,” the president was quoted as saying. The president said that the success of the test has “further strengthened national defence and bolstered Pakistan’s responsible defence policy for ensuring stability in the region“. He lauded the “hard work, dedication, and spirit of national service of scientists, engineers, and the officers and personnel of the PAF”. He added that the achievement marked a “significant milestone in Pakistan’s journey toward self-reliance in the arena of national defence”. “The promotion of modern technology in the defence sector exhibited Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding its security and sovereignty,” the statement added. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also congratulated the PAF for the successful test, stating that the weapon system will “further enhance the country’s defence”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.",

Police and local residents said the attack on the police post, located in the hilly Kohi Sar area about 22 kilometres from Khar, the district headquarters, occurred at around 2am. Israr Khan, the spokesperson for the district police, told Dawn that the deceased was identified as 60-year-old Naseem Gul, a local resident. He added that the injured included two cops, 35-year-old Constable Suliman Khan and 58-year-old Constable Saz Muhammad, and 28-year-old Sahibzada, a school watchman. He said the injured were taken to the District Headquarter Hospital in Khar for treatment, where their condition was said to be stable. He said terrorists used both heavy and light weapons in the attack. The police spokesperson said that soon after the attack, a joint team comprising security forces and police reached the area and launched a clearance operation. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year. This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday rejected the “irresponsible assertions” made by Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar, saying that New Delhi was again seeking to “deflect attention from its own troubling record as a neighbour that promotes terrorism and contributes to regional instability”. Although the FO statement did not make a specific mention of the remarks by the Indian minister, its rebuke came after Indian media reported Jaishankar as saying on Friday that New Delhi had a right to defend itself against terrorism while talking about “bad neighbours”. “You can also have bad neighbours … unfortunately, we do. When you have bad neighbours … if you look to the one to the West — if a country decides that they will deliberately, persistently, unrepentantly continue with terrorism, we have a right to defend our people against terrorism,” he was quoted as saying by The Hindu . He also spoke about the Indus Water Treaty (IWT), which has been a major bone of contention between the two countries following an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22 blamed by India on Pakistan without evidence, saying: “Many years ago we agreed to a water-sharing arrangement — the belief was it was gesture of goodwill — because of good neighbourliness we were doing it … but if you have decades of terrorism there is no good neighbourliness and you don’t get the benefit of good neighbourliness.” “You can’t say … Please share water with me but I will continue terrorism – that’s not reconcilable,” he was quoted as saying by the publication. In a statement issued on Saturday, the FO said, “Pakistan firmly rejects the irresponsible assertions made by the Indian external affairs minister. Once again, India seeks to deflect attention from its own troubling record as a neighbour that promotes terrorism and contributes to regional instability.” The FO said that India’s “documented involvement in promoting terrorist activities in the region, particularly in Pakistan, is well known”. “The case of Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav remains a stark example of organised, state-sponsored terrorism directed against Pakistan,” it added. Jadhav was captured in Balochistan in March 2016 and later confessed to his association with the Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing and his involvement in espionage and terrorism in Pakistan. He remains imprisoned in Pakistan. “Equally concerning are recurring instances of extraterritorial killings, sabotage through proxies, and covert support to terrorist networks. This pattern is consistent with the extremist ideology of Hindutva and its violent proponents,” the FO said. “India continues its illegal and violent military occupation of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to extend full political, moral, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their just struggle to realise their right to self-determination, as enshrined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” the statement added. On the topic of the IWT, the FO said that it was an international agreement “concluded in good faith and at considerable cost”. “Any unilateral violation of the treaty by India would undermine regional stability and call into question its credibility as a state that claims to respect international legal obligations. Pakistan will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights under the treaty,” it added. The development comes after National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday during the funeral of the country’s former premier Khaleda Zia, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: A fresh round of diplomatic talks on the formation of a proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza is expected to be held in a Middle Eastern capital in the coming days, diplomatic sources told Dawn as Muslim countries, including Pakistan, continue to press for clarity on the force’s mandate, operational scope, and political objectives. The ISF, a central element of a US-brokered Gaza peace plan , is envisioned to stabilise the territory following over two years of Israeli atrocities in the Gaza Strip, protect civilians and humanitarian corridors, and assist in establishing transitional governance through a proposed “Board of Peace”. However, several core issues remain unresolved, including the force’s legal authority, chain of command, funding, duration, and whether it would play a role in disarming Hamas or other Palestinian groups. Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other states have expressed willingness to participate in a stabilisation effort that genuinely restores order and facilitates humanitarian access. “They are prepared to join any credible international force that brings stability to Gaza,” a diplomatic source said. “But they will not be part of a mission whose primary focus is disarming Palestinian resistance groups.” Hamas has rejected the idea of an international force tasked with disarmament, warning that such a deployment would be considered a party to the conflict rather than a neutral stabilising presence. This stance complicates efforts to secure broad regional participation and raises concerns about the safety and legitimacy of any deployed troops. Last month, Reuters reported that international troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as 2026 to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force. US signals gratitude, Pakistan remains cautious Three weeks ago, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Pakistan’s willingness to consider particpating as “key” to the initiative and expressed gratitude for Islamabad’s engagement. Pakistani officials, however, emphasise that no final decision has been taken yet, and that Islamabad has neither committed troops nor received a formal request. In December 2025, Pakistan also attended a US Central Command–hosted conference in Qatar, with representatives from nearly 45 countries, where the operational framework of the ISF was discussed. Reports suggesting Pakistan might deploy up to 3,500 troops remain speculative. Diplomatic sources stressed that any troop commitment would depend on a mandate that is fully transparent, politically neutral, and focused on humanitarian stabilisation rather than disarmament or law enforcement inside Gaza. ‘2025 saw positive trends in Pak-US ties’ Meanwhile, in a press briefing at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington on Friday, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh framed discussions on the ISF alongside broader Pak–US relations. He said that 2025 had been a year of positive trends in bilateral ties and that 2026 would be a year where concrete results were expected. “The opportunities are positive and clear but 2026 will be a critical year for translating these possibilities into practical outcomes across every sector of our bilateral partnership,” he said. The ambassador highlighted economic cooperation in minerals, energy, information technology, health, education, and counterterrorism as areas of particular promise. Ambassador Sheikh also emphasised Pakistan’s competitive advantages, noting that the country’s production costs were lower than China’s. He drew attention to the skills of Pakistan’s youth, particularly in technology and English-language proficiency, which have earned global recognition. Highlighting trade relations, he said Pakistan’s goods trade with the US rose 16.3pc in 2025, exports increased by 11.5pc, and services trade grew by 39.7pc. Remittances from the US also rose by 5.4pc. He stressed that while these achievements were commendable, sustained effort and institutional coordination would be required to translate potential into tangible results. “Our partnership with the US is not just a matter of choice or convenience; it is a strategic necessity rooted in geography, economics, population, and shared interests,” the ambassador said. Strategic and operational considerations The ISF discussions, combined with Pakistan’s broader engagement with Washington, reflect the delicate balancing act Islamabad faces: supporting humanitarian stabilisation in Gaza while safeguarding Pakistan’s principles on Palestinian sovereignty. Analysts say that unless a mandate acceptable to all stakeholders is clearly defined, the force may struggle to attract broad participation and could encounter operational and political obstacles on the ground. Experts also note that the involvement of countries like Pakistan is politically significant. Islamabad has traditionally played a mediating role in Middle Eastern conflicts, balancing ties with Arab states, the US and the broader Muslim world. Any misstep in defining the ISF’s role could complicate Pakistan’s regional diplomacy, affect its credibility with partners in the Gulf, and influence its perception among Palestinians. The coming meetings will be closely watched by both regional actors and Washington, as they may determine the pace at which the ISF is deployed. While humanitarian objectives remain central, the debates over mandate, command, and responsibilities illustrate the inherent complexity of deploying a multinational stabilisation force in a highly contested environment. Israel has banned 37 foreign humanitarian organizations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they had refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials, a move that the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said will “further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians”. It is worth mentioning that eight Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, have expressed concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, saying that severe winter weather has further worsened conditions and stressing the need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts. In a joint statement, Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates — which had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza — have demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs can operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip.

      "summary_orig": "Australian police said they would bolster staffing at the Sydney Cricket Ground for the fifth Ashes Test starting on Sunday, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city. The father-and-son gunmen are alleged to have carried out the attack at a Hanukkah event at the famed Bondi Beach on December 14. Australia’s worst mass shooting in almost three decades shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country. The massacre has sparked more active policing in Sydney, Australia’s most populous city and the capital of New South Wales state. Authorities on Saturday announced a “high-visibility” police presence for the marquee cricket series between Australia and England, which is held every two years. Measures at the cricket ground, some 5km from Bondi Beach, would include the riot patrol unit, officers on horseback and officers carrying rifles. “The difference will be in the visibility of long arms and a stronger presence,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said in a statement . Police said they expected a capacity crowd for day one of the fixture, the final encounter in the five-match series already claimed by Australia. “Many people may not be used to seeing police carrying rifles at sporting events, but our objective here is to help the public feel safe,” Lanyon said. Cricket Australia said first responders to the attack and “community members who bravely acted” would be honoured before the start of play on Sunday. There will be a guard of honour on the field and a round of applause for “emergency response agencies and members of the community in the face of extreme danger”, the governing body said in a statement. On Wednesday, around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during New Year celebrations, which typically attract over a million revellers. Several New Year events planned at Bondi were cancelled, while traditional Christmas celebrations there were muted, following the attack that authorities believe was inspired by Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State.",

      "summary_orig": "Mirwaiz Umar Farooq • Mirwaiz Umar Farooq says ‘enforced silence’ hides widening trust deficit; urges renewed dialogue • Hurriyat leader calls for ‘humanity’ after being denied access to Srinagar’s Jama Masjid • Says locals facing ‘existential crisis’ amid fears of demographic changes JAMMU: In a hard-hitting statement posted on social media on the first Friday of the year, the chief cleric of India-held Kashmir, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, said that despite unilateral changes made in 2019, the reality is that the conflict continues to keep the region in a state of uncertainty that can erupt at any time. Mirwaiz, who said he was not allowed to go to the Jama Masjid in Indian-occupied Srinagar to deliver the Friday sermon, wrote: “That is why wars are paused, not ended, and dialogue finds no takers.” “Yet beyond these incidents, in which Kashmiris find themselves at the receiving end of suspicion and attacks in parts of India, not much has changed for them. The trust deficit between them and New Delhi has widened, not shrunk. Enforced silence is projected as acquiescence. Wounds remain open, problems unaddressed, and an elected government of a Union Territory complains of being powerless,” he said. “A sense of hopelessness prevails, along with an existential crisis of losing one’s identity through demographic change since the state was downgraded to a Union Territory, constitutional guarantees withdrawn, and rules and laws tweaked.” Highlighting his inherited role as a channel of lasting peace, brotherhood and reconciliation for his people and the region, Mirwaiz said: “In the past, I have engaged with leadership across the subcontinent and successive Indian governments — including former prime ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh, as well as L.K. Advani — in sincere efforts at dialogue. My path remains the same.” “Is real peace possible? Yes. Kashmiris are natural optimists. Dialogue has worked elsewhere, and our hope remains alive. When there is sincere willingness to engage in the spirit of ‘Insaniyat’ and ‘Jamhooriyat’, as Vajpayee ji once said, peace gets the best chance,” he wrote. “As another year begins and we look ahead, painful memories of 2025 stay with us. It was a year marked by tragedy and uncertainty. The horrific Pahalgam attack shook us deeply. Unequivocally condemned by all in the Valley, it led to widespread anxiety as people were targeted and homes demolished. This was followed by another India–Pakistan war, a stark reminder of how fragile peace in the region continues to be. “Today, we are operating in an environment where any expression of views contrary to the state, or any disagreement, is increasingly criminalised, branded as ‘anti-national’, and penalised,” Mirwaiz remarked. “No public space is available to us, and mediums of communication, including most local media, are not ready to provide any platform for expressing people’s demands or views. I do not have the privilege of addressing press conferences. I cannot move without official clearance, and people cannot meet me without permission. My access to the pulpit of Jama Masjid — the spiritual heart of Kashmir — is also curtailed. Even last Friday, I was placed under house arrest, and again this Friday too. “With Hurriyat constituents banned, all offices sealed and institutions closed, leaders and activists either in jail or under constant surveillance, social media remains the only platform that offers some space to connect with people and the outside world,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "• US president says ready to intervene if Iran kills protesters; Tehran warns intervention will put US troops, regional stability at risk • Israel mounts online campaign urging Iranians to revolt; shares fake AI-generated videos, images DUBAI: Donald Trump warned on Friday that the US was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran’s security forces killed protesters, prompting Tehran to caution that any intervention would destabilise the region already on edge as unrest spread across the country amid a spiralling economic crisis. Clashes between demonstrators and security forces were reported in Iran’s several cities on Thursday, with at least six people said to have been killed in the first fatalities since protests over prices and the plunging rial escalated this week. What began with shopkeepers striking in Tehran on Sunday has since rippled to at least 15 cities, largely in the west, in the most serious challenge to Iran’s clerical establishment since the nationwide protests of 2022. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump issued a blunt ultimatum. “If Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,” he wrote. “We are locked and loaded and ready to go.” The comments drew an immediate rebuke from Iran’s leadership. Supreme National Security Council head Ali Larijani warned that American involvement would threaten US forces in the Middle East. “US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilising the entire region and destroying America’s interest,” Mr Larijani said in a post on the social platform X. ‘‘The US president “should be mindful of their soldiers’ safety”. Other officials echoed the warning. Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei scoffed at Trump’s offer to “rescue” protesters. “Iranians will resolve their challenges through dialogue and mutual engagement, and will not permit any form of foreign interference,” Mr Baghaei said, citing the 1988 US downing of an Iranian passenger plane as evidence of American hostility. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s adviser Ali Shamkhani said Iranian security is a “red line” and any interventionist hand would be “cut”. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the Iranian parliament speaker, wrote on X that if the US interferes, “all American bases and forces across the entire region will be legitimate targets”. Israel backs protesters While Tehran lashed out at Washington, it also faced an aggressive social media campaign from Israel. Israeli government accounts and officials publicly encouraged the demonstrators, framing the unrest as the beginning of the end for the Islamic Republic. The Mossad’s official Farsi-language account posted on Monday: “Come together to the streets. It’s time. We are with you — not just from afar and in words. We are with you on the ground as well.” Israel’s foreign ministry posted a cartoon on X depicting a lion and sun — symbols of pre-revolutionary Iran — crushing the current regime’s emblem. “The rise of Iranian lions and lionesses to fight against darkness,” the post read. “Light triumphs over darkness.” Gila Gamliel, Israel’s minister of innovation, shared a video declaring that the protests by “mothers and fathers are justified”. Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli posted an image of a demonstrator waving the lion and sun flag, though some content shared by Israeli officials has faced scrutiny. Several images and videos posted by Israeli accounts on social media platforms have been modified with the help of artificial intelligence tools. One image posted by the Israel’s foreign ministry on X confirmed to have been manipulated using AI, according to detection tools. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly commented, reportedly to avoid giving Tehran an excuse to blame the unrest on “Zionist” meddling.

Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei scoffed at Trump’s offer to “rescue” protesters. “Iranians will resolve their challenges through dialogue and mutual engagement, and will not permit any form of foreign interference,” Mr Baghaei said, citing the 1988 US downing of an Iranian passenger plane as evidence of American hostility. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s adviser Ali Shamkhani said Iranian security is a “red line” and any interventionist hand would be “cut”. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, the Iranian parliament speaker, wrote on X that if the US interferes, “all American bases and forces across the entire region will be legitimate targets”. Israel backs protesters While Tehran lashed out at Washington, it also faced an aggressive social media campaign from Israel. Israeli government accounts and officials publicly encouraged the demonstrators, framing the unrest as the beginning of the end for the Islamic Republic. The Mossad’s official Farsi-language account posted on Monday: “Come together to the streets. It’s time. We are with you — not just from afar and in words. We are with you on the ground as well.” Israel’s foreign ministry posted a cartoon on X depicting a lion and sun — symbols of pre-revolutionary Iran — crushing the current regime’s emblem. “The rise of Iranian lions and lionesses to fight against darkness,” the post read. “Light triumphs over darkness.” Gila Gamliel, Israel’s minister of innovation, shared a video declaring that the protests by “mothers and fathers are justified”. Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli posted an image of a demonstrator waving the lion and sun flag, though some content shared by Israeli officials has faced scrutiny. Several images and videos posted by Israeli accounts on social media platforms have been modified with the help of artificial intelligence tools. One image posted by the Israel’s foreign ministry on X confirmed to have been manipulated using AI, according to detection tools. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not publicly commented, reportedly to avoid giving Tehran an excuse to blame the unrest on “Zionist” meddling.

      "summary": "• US president says ready to intervene if Iran kills protesters; Tehran warns intervention will put US troops, regional stability at risk • Israel mounts online campaign urging Iranians to revolt; shares fake AI-generated videos, images DUBAI: Donald Trump warned on Friday that the US was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran’s security forces killed protesters, prompting Tehran to caution that any intervention would destabilise the region already on edge as unrest spread across the country amid a spiralling economic crisis. Clashes between demonstrators and security forces were reported in Iran’s several cities on Thursday, with at least six people said to have been killed in the first fatalities since protests over prices and the plunging rial escalated this week. What began with shopkeepers striking in Tehran on Sunday has since rippled to at least 15 cities, largely in the west, in the most serious challenge to Iran’s clerical establishment since the nationwide protests of 2022. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump issued a blunt ultimatum. “If Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,” he wrote. “We are locked and loaded and ready to go.” The comments drew an immediate rebuke from Iran’s leadership. Supreme National Security Council head Ali Larijani warned that American involvement would threaten US forces in the Middle East. “US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilising the entire region and destroying America’s interest,” Mr Larijani said in a post on the social platform X. ‘‘The US president “should be mindful of their soldiers’ safety”.

      "summary_orig": "With the political impasse continuing among the country’s main stakeholders, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said on Friday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had not imposed any “minus Imran” condition on political engagement. A day earlier, the premier’s adviser had proposed “ confidence-building measures ” between the leadership of the PML-N, the PTI, and the PPP could bring down political temperatures. “Prime Minister Shehbaz has not set any condition of minus Imran Khan [from politics]. We neither seek to minus anyone nor consider it politically viable. Similar efforts were made to sideline us in the past,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan. As the leader of the House, PM Shehbaz has offered negotiations to the opposition, saying they [PTI] should sit with him as dialogue is key to parliamentary democracy, Sanaullah added. Maintaining that the opposition PTI had to take a step forward, the senior PML-N leader said that dialogue on behalf of the president, the PML-N supremo and the establishment was the premier’s “responsibility”. “The PM has invited the opposition to meet in the National Assembly chamber if they do not want to visit [his office],” he added. When asked about the statement he made a day earlier, Sanaullah said the prime minister must have taken Nawaz Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardari and the establishment in to confidence before extending the offer of dialogue to the opposition. Sanaullah added that despite efforts by Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) and PTI’s second- and third-tier leadership to initiate talks, nothing could materialise unless “Imran Khan’s policy changes in favour of dialogue”. The PM’s adviser noted that the PTI founder had not authorised anyone to hold negotiations, adding that his message, conveyed by his sister Aleema Khan, was that “anyone who talks about negotiations is not among us”. “He sent a message of street agitation and a wheel-jam strike, and also asked Sohail Afridi to visit Punjab, Balochistan and Sindh for mobilisation,” he said, reiterating that Imran was the sole “hindrance” in negotiations. Earlier in December, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Gunmen on Friday attacked the convoy of Jhang Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Sheikh Fawad Akram — the brother of PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram — leaving one of his guards dead and three others injured near Jhang’s General Bus Stand (GBS), said police. Reports said the incident took place near a petrol pump near GBS, as Fawad was headed to his office. The four security guards who were injured in the attack were rushed to DHQ Hospital. However, hospital authorities referred a critically injured guard to Faisalabad, but he succumbed to his injuries. Jhang police, meanwhile, arrested four suspects, including two alleged gunmen and Fawad’s stepbrother, a statement from a police spokesperson read. Police said that Fawad and his stepbrother were travelling in separate convoys when their vehicles collided with each other. The collision triggered a scuffle between guards from both groups. The gunmen of another suspect, who was travelling with the stepbrother, allegedly opened fire on Fawad’s group, shooting four of his guards, the statement added. Quoting Jhang District Police Officer Bilal Iftikhar Kayani, the statement read that strict action is being taken against the suspects and that “no concession would be made to those who challenge the law”. “Turning a minor dispute into violence and firing is a threat to the peace of the society,” DPO Kayani was quoted as saying. Recounting the incident on camera, Fawad said that he and his guards were unarmed at the time, as they were not allowed to carry weapons. Meanwhile, Waqas issued a statement on his X account condemning the incident as a “cowardly and planned attack”. “It is extremely alarming that a peaceful city, which had become a cradle of peace due to our collective efforts over the past several years, is today being dragged back into unrest due to a few miscreants and rogue elements,” Waqas wrote. “I make an unequivocal demand from the Punjab Police that all suspects involved in the incident be arrested immediately, transparent and impartial investigations be ensured, and those responsible be given exemplary punishment in accordance with the law,” he added. In a later statement, Waqas said that the deceased guard’s family blocked Gujranwala Road and placed his body in front of Jhang Civil Hospital. “We stand with his family and will fully support him,” the PTI information secretary wrote. “We will never leave them alone—we will ensure Mohsin’s family gets justice and will knock on every door of justice.” Reports said that over the past six months, Fawad’s stepbrother had joined hands with the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) to contest elections against Waqas and his father, provincial lawmaker Sheikh Muhammad Akram. The GDA had also recently announced they would contest all future elections against the Sheikh family.",

      "title_orig": "Yemen’s government launches operation against southern separatists",
      "summary_orig": "Yemen’s Saudi-backed government launched an operation to take back military positions from southern separatists on Friday and said it had reclaimed one of the largest military camps in Hadramout province. The operation in Hadramout marks the latest escalation in Yemen. Hadramout’s governor, Salem Ahmed Saeed al-Khunbashi, said in a statement on Friday that his forces had taken control of a military camp in al-Khasha’a, the largest and most important base in the province. The governor had earlier said his forces were launching what he called a “peaceful” operation. A senior official of the Southern Transitional Council told Reuters the operation had not been peaceful. Yemen’s government said it had appointed Hadramout’s governor to take overall command of the “Homeland Shield” forces in the eastern province, granting him full military, security and administrative authority in what it said was a move to restore security and order. This is not a declaration of war, the governor said in a speech on Yemen TV, adding that the move aims to prevent the use of camps to threaten security and to protect Hadramout from sliding into chaos. The oil-producing Hadramout province borders Saudi Arabia and many prominent Saudis trace their origins to it, lending it cultural and historical significance for the kingdom. A spokesperson for the STC, Mohammed al-Naqeeb, said on Friday that forces were on full alert across the region and warned that it was ready to respond forcefully in a post on X. The STC told Reuters that three of the airstrikes targeted the al-Khasha’a military camp. Three Yemeni sources told Reuters armoured vehicles belonging to the government had been moving towards the Khasha’a camp, which has the capacity to house thousands of troops and was taken over by the STC in December. The STC, which seized large swathes of southern Yemen last month from the internationally recognised government, which in turn saw the move as a threat. The UAE last week said it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for its forces to leave within 24 hours. OPEC+ members will meet online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates have said they will extend a policy of maintaining first-quarter production unchanged. Aden airport shut Today, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Yemen blamed STC leader Aidarus Al-Zubaidi for refusing to grant landing permission the previous day for a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden. A halt in flights at Aden international airport on Thursday continued into Friday as both sides traded blame as to who was responsible for the air traffic shutdown. “For several weeks and until yesterday, the Kingdom sought to make all efforts with the Southern Transitional Council to end the escalation … but it faced continuous rejection and stubbornness from Aidarus Al-Zubaidi,” the Saudi ambassador, Mohammed Al-Jaber, said on X. Zubaidi issued directives to close air traffic at Aden’s airport on Thursday, the ambassador added, saying that a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden aiming to find solutions to the crisis was denied permission to land. Aden’s international airport is the main gateway for regions of the country outside Houthi control.",

      "summary_en": "Yemen’s Saudi-backed government launched an operation to take back military positions from southern separatists on Friday and said it had reclaimed one of the largest military camps in Hadramout province. The operation in Hadramout marks the latest escalation in Yemen. Hadramout’s governor, Salem Ahmed Saeed al-Khunbashi, said in a statement on Friday that his forces had taken control of a military camp in al-Khasha’a, the largest and most important base in the province. The governor had earlier said his forces were launching what he called a “peaceful” operation. A senior official of the Southern Transitional Council told Reuters the operation had not been peaceful. Yemen’s government said it had appointed Hadramout’s governor to take overall command of the “Homeland Shield” forces in the eastern province, granting him full military, security and administrative authority in what it said was a move to restore security and order. This is not a declaration of war, the governor said in a speech on Yemen TV, adding that the move aims to prevent the use of camps to threaten security and to protect Hadramout from sliding into chaos. The oil-producing Hadramout province borders Saudi Arabia and many prominent Saudis trace their origins to it, lending it cultural and historical significance for the kingdom. A spokesperson for the STC, Mohammed al-Naqeeb, said on Friday that forces were on full alert across the region and warned that it was ready to respond forcefully in a post on X. The STC told Reuters that three of the airstrikes targeted the al-Khasha’a military camp. Three Yemeni sources told Reuters armoured vehicles belonging to the government had been moving towards the Khasha’a camp, which has the capacity to house thousands of troops and was taken over by the STC in December. The STC, which seized large swathes of southern Yemen last month from the internationally recognised government, which in turn saw the move as a threat. The UAE last week said it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for its forces to leave within 24 hours.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) handed out two life sentences each to YouTuber Adil Raja, journalists Wajahat Saeed Khan, Sabir Shakir and Shaheen Sehbai, anchorperson Haider Raza Mehdi, analyst Moeed Pirzada and former army official Akbar Hussain in cases related to riots in the country on May 9, 2023. The riots — during which government and military installations were also vandalised — had erupted following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan. The prosecution had accused the convicted individuals of “digital terrorism against state institutions” in relation to the events of May 9, 2023. The cases stemmed from allegations that the accused used digital platforms to incite, facilitate and amplify attacks against state institutions during the May 9 unrest. Reserved verdicts in the cases were announced by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on Friday after the completion of trials in absentia. The trials were conducted in absentia at the prosecution’s request and by means of invoking the relevant provisions of anti-terrorism laws. According to court orders issued by Judge Sipra — copies of which are available with Dawn — cases against Raja, Khan, Sehbai and Mehdi were registered at Islamabad‘s Ramna police station. Similarly, cases against Shakir, Hussain and Pirzada were registered at the Aabpara police station. The court sentenced the individuals to rigorous life imprisonment on two counts — waging or attempting to wage or abetting in waging war against Pakistan and criminal conspiracy. They have also been directed to pay Rs500,000 in fines for each of the two offences. They have been further handed out 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs200,000 for committing an offence under Section 121-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The said provision deals with the subject of conspiracy to commit offences that are punishable under Section 121 (waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan) of the PPC. Moreover, they have also been penalised with another 10-year sentence of rigorous imprisonment and Rs200,000 fine for committing an offence under Section 131 (abetting mutiny or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from their duty) of the PPC. They have also been handed out triple 5-year sentences of rigorous imprisonment on three counts under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. They are also required to pay Rs200,000 for each of the three offences. In case they fail to pay the fine for any of the offences they have been found guilty of committing, the period of their imprisonment will extend by six months, according to the court orders. The orders further stated that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was being extended to the convicts, and that all sentences handed out to them were to run concurrently. “The convict is informed that he has the right to file/prefer an appeal in the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court, Islamabad within seven days,” each of the orders said. The court also authorised and instructed the relevant station house officers to arrest the convicts “upon his availability and to forward him to jail for the commitment of his sentence”. During the trials in the cases, the prosecution produced 24 witnesses. Public prosecutor Raja Naveed Hussain Kayani represented the prosecution while Advocate Gulfam Ashraf Goraiya appeared on behalf of the accused. Records show that Advocate Goraiya was appointed as the defence counsel by the court. A detailed written judgement, which is yet to be issued by the court, is expected to outline the evidentiary basis and legal reasoning underpinning the multiple convictions and sentences. The cases against the seven convicted individuals were registered in 2023. The case against Shakir, Pirzada and Hussain was registered by Islamabad police on charges of sedition and terrorism for their alleged involvement in the violence and vandalism amid protests that erupted in the wake of PTI chief Imran’s arrest. Similarly, Sehbai, Khan, Raja and Mehdi were booked for “abetting mutiny” and inciting people to attack military installations across the country on May 9, 2023. Rights organisation Amnesty International and global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) had raised concerns and called out Pakistani authorities in June 2023, following the registration of these cases. “At least seven journalists and commentators have been charged with offences against the state and anti-terror laws in the past four days,” Amnesty International had said in a statement, expressing concern over “the crackdown on voices critical of the state and military”. “The use of these laws to silence commentators and journalists is a violation of the right to freedom of expression,” the statement said.",
