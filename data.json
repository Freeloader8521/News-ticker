      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said that the much-talked about 27th Constitutional Amendment will be tabled soon in Parliament. Specul­ation and debate over a possible 27th Constitutional Amend­ment reached fever pitch on Monday after the PPP claimed the government had sought its support for the proposed changes to the Constitution. The proposed changes have sparked a nationwide debate , with political parties weighing their positions amid concerns that the move could roll back some powers devolved under the landmark 18th Constitution Amendment. The opposition PTI has announced its intention to oppose the proposed amendment ‘tooth and nail’. Addressing the matter while speaking in the Senate session today, the deputy PM said: “Of course, the government is bringing it and will bring it … the 27th Amendment will arrive … and is about to arrive. We will try that it is tabled in accordance with principles, laws and the Constitution.” He reassured the opposition that the amendment would pass through the required steps, such as a robust debate in Parliament and sub-committees. View this post on Instagram “The government does not have reservations against anything. It will not be that the amendment is tabled and there is voting on it in a haphazard, ad hoc manner; this will not happen,” he reassured PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar. Dar said the government was following the “standard process” of legislative activity, saying it was consulting the PPP for now since it was the biggest ally of the government. “I have had at least three rounds [of consultations] and the law minister has also held (consultations),” he added. The deputy PM added that the government would also approach its other allies and take them on board before presenting the document of the amendment. Referring to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s X post announcing that the government had approached his party over the issue, Dar said he had a complete right to post on the matter. “The areas he identified are not in the air. Let me also confess, there have been discussions on those topics.” He urged Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar that the amendment be tabled in the Senate first, since it had more “professionalism and value input” than the National Assembly. Dar also urged Senate Deputy Chairman Syedaal Khan Nasar to request Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani to appoint the opposition leader in the Upper House soon. He assured that the process for the amendment would be “transparent”. Dar added that other stakeholders would also be consulted about the amendment. The deputy PM also addressed the current situation with Afghanistan and rued the persistent deterioration in relations despite what he said were his own outreach efforts, as well as by Pakistan in general. Explaining the reasons for the above development, he criticised the government in power circa 2021 for “doing so much outreach that we go there and say: ‘I’m here for a cup of tea’ … but that cup of tea proved to be very costly for us. That cup of tea opened the borders again, the 35-40,000 Taliban who had fled from here came back and the government of that time released 100 hardened criminals who had burnt the Pakistani flag in Swat and martyred hundreds of people. This was the biggest mistake.” Dar said problems had increased so much for the country that it had regressed back to 2012. Referring to the ongoing negotiations with Afghanistan, Dar said Afghan Taliban FM Amir Muttaqi called him six times a day earlier. “I told him: ‘We asked only one thing of you, that there should be no terrorist activities from your soil in our country and you have brought even me to that point where a supporter like me who wants to help you and hold your hand as an Islamic country, neighbour and as per Islam is helpless.’” PPP to give its position after CEC meeting: Sherry Rehman Meanwhile, PPP Senator and Senior Vice President Sherry Rehman said the party would give its position on the amendment after a meeting of its central executive committee. She also downplayed concern about the amendment impacting provincial autonomy, saying there was “absolute clarity” in the PPP about it, adding that the government also understood this. Rehman, speaking on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, said the party had agreed with the government that the document tabled in Parliament would go to the sub-committees for deliberation and debate. The senator added that everything about the amendment would take place in the “public eye”, adding that it was decided that Bilawal would make his social media post and share the information with the public. Two-thirds majority A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in both houses. In the 336-member National Assembly, the ruling coalition has 233 members, while the opposition holds 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each. In the Senate, which comprises 96 members, the ruling coalition does not enjoy the two-thirds majority of 64 senators required to pass a constitutional amendment. With 61 senators, the coalition would need at least three votes from the opposition to ensure its passage. In such situations, the government usually turns to the JUI-F to seek its support.",

      "summary_orig": "After the bowlers had done their job, the batters came good for Pakistan — albeit an all too familiar late collapse — at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad on Tuesday. In the first international match at the venue in 17 years, Pakistan marked the start of Shaheen Shah Afridi’s era as One-day International captain with a two-wicket victory over South Africa to strike the opening blow in the three-match series. Shaheen had won the toss and elected to field with his side riding on inspired spells of bowling by pacer Naseem Shah and spinners Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed to bowl South Africa out for 263. South Africa had got off to the ideal start with half-centuries for debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius (57) and the returning Quinton de Kock (63) — the duo sharing a 98-run opening stand. But with the exception of skipper Matthew Breetzke (42) and Corbin Bosch (41) in the end, none of their batters could get going as Naseem (3-40), Saim (2-39) and Abrar (3-53) scythed through their line-up. Half-centuries by Salman Ali Agha (62) and Mohammad Rizwan (57) then steadied Pakistan midway through their chase after Fakhar Zaman and Saim had laid the platform with a solid 87-run opening partnership. Salman and Rizwan combined for another 91 after Pakistan had lost three quick wickets. Rizwan fell with Pakistan needing 68 more to win but Salman struck a breezy partnership with Hussain Talat and after the hosts had an all to familiar late collapse, Mohammad Nawaz and Shaheen  saw them through to a confidence-boosting victory. South Africa, meanwhile, will rue they were unable to capitalise on a storming start by Pretorius and De Kock. Pretorius and De Kock, playing his first ODI since returning from retirement after the ODI World Cup, laid into the Pakistan attack from the start as South Africa reached 94-0 by the end of the 15th over. Pakistan needed a breakthrough and it was provided by Saim as Pretorius’ slash found a diving Nawaz; the left-hander departing after having hit seven fours and a six in his 60-ball stay. De Kock, however, was proving a thorn for the hosts, dispatching anything loose to the fence and raised his half century with his fifth four — a sweep off Saim — in exactly 50 balls. Shaheen, however, brought back Naseem into the attack and after just three runs came off overs 23 and 24, the pacer struck when De Kock chopped him onto his stumps, having hit six fours and two sixes in his 72-ball knock. Pakistan got a foothold they wanted and one-drop Tony De Zorzi (18) departed in the next over, offering Saim a tame return. Breetzke and debutant Sinethemba Qeshile began the rebuilding job but just when the Proteas seemed to be gaining momentum, Nawaz struck to remove Qeshile (22) and Donovan Ferreira soon became Abrar’s first victim. Naseem cleaned up Breetzke off a no-ball but bounced back after that disappointment by getting George Linde caught behind two balls later.\nSouth Africa reached the 40-over mark at 211-6. The visitors were eyeing a closing flourish with Breetzke and Bosch but Pakistan hit back again when Abrar ended the former’s stay and then had Bjorn Fortuin lbw on the next ball. Bosch, however, got stuck in and took South Africa past 250 — muscling away Shaheen for consecutive boundaries in the 45th over and repeating the trick in the next over by Abrar — before seeing his stumps dismantled by a searing yorker by Shaheen in the penultimate over. Naseem picked up his third wicket in the last over when he cleaned up tailender Lizaad Williams. Saim and fellow opener Fakhar’s measured approach saw the side reach 53-0 in the first 10 overs. The duo stayed compact, avoiding any rash shots, but when opportunities came, they pounced on them. After the pair added 34 more to the partnership, Saim (39 off 42, four fours and six) was trapped leg-before by South African spinner Linde, who surprised the left-hander with a quicker one. Fakhar (45 off 57, four fours and two sixes) then holed Ferreira out to Fortuin in the deep before Fortuin struck gold with the ball, shooting in one to get Babar out lbw as Pakistan felt the heat at 106-3 by the end of the 20th over. The hosts reached 129-3 halfway through the innings before Salman, and Rizwan at the other end amped up the run-rate, the latter flourishing with a lofted cover drive and a sweep for fours as Pakistan crossed the 150-run mark in the 29th over. Boundaries, though, were at a premium after that – only three coming from overs 30 to 36; all of them from Rizwan’s bat. He raised his half century off 66 balls in the 37th over but fell soon after, having hit six fours in his 74-ball knock, finding Pretorius in the deep off Bosch. Hussain, though, got going with a cracking cover drive for four, which left Pakistan needing 58 off the last 10 overs. South Africa had restricted the boundaries in the next three overs but there was no stopping the singles as Hussain and Salman kept rotating the strike, chipping away at the total until the latter hoisted Ferreira down the ground for a sumptuous six to bring up his half-century off 56 balls. Hussain made 22 off 25 with two fours before falling in the 46th over and was soon followed by Hasan Nawaz, stumped off Linde, before Salman departed on the last ball of the 48th over when he skied Lungi Ngidi to Ferreira – having only got the fifth four of his 71-ball innings on the previous delivery. Nawaz, though, settled any nerves or creeping doubts when he launched Ferreira down the ground for six and despite him falling with the scores level, Pakistan got through with two balls to spare.",

Shaheen had won the toss and elected to field with his side riding on inspired spells of bowling by pacer Naseem Shah and spinners Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed to bowl South Africa out for 263. South Africa had got off to the ideal start with half-centuries for debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius (57) and the returning Quinton de Kock (63) — the duo sharing a 98-run opening stand. But with the exception of skipper Matthew Breetzke (42) and Corbin Bosch (41) in the end, none of their batters could get going as Naseem (3-40), Saim (2-39) and Abrar (3-53) scythed through their line-up. Half-centuries by Salman Ali Agha (62) and Mohammad Rizwan (57) then steadied Pakistan midway through their chase after Fakhar Zaman and Saim had laid the platform with a solid 87-run opening partnership. Salman and Rizwan combined for another 91 after Pakistan had lost three quick wickets. Rizwan fell with Pakistan needing 68 more to win but Salman struck a breezy partnership with Hussain Talat and after the hosts had an all to familiar late collapse, Mohammad Nawaz and Shaheen  saw them through to a confidence-boosting victory. South Africa, meanwhile, will rue they were unable to capitalise on a storming start by Pretorius and De Kock. Pretorius and De Kock, playing his first ODI since returning from retirement after the ODI World Cup, laid into the Pakistan attack from the start as South Africa reached 94-0 by the end of the 15th over. Pakistan needed a breakthrough and it was provided by Saim as Pretorius’ slash found a diving Nawaz; the left-hander departing after having hit seven fours and a six in his 60-ball stay. De Kock, however, was proving a thorn for the hosts, dispatching anything loose to the fence and raised his half century with his fifth four — a sweep off Saim — in exactly 50 balls. Shaheen, however, brought back Naseem into the attack and after just three runs came off overs 23 and 24, the pacer struck when De Kock chopped him onto his stumps, having hit six fours and two sixes in his 72-ball knock. Pakistan got a foothold they wanted and one-drop Tony De Zorzi (18) departed in the next over, offering Saim a tame return. Breetzke and debutant Sinethemba Qeshile began the rebuilding job but just when the Proteas seemed to be gaining momentum, Nawaz struck to remove Qeshile (22) and Donovan Ferreira soon became Abrar’s first victim. Naseem cleaned up Breetzke off a no-ball but bounced back after that disappointment by getting George Linde caught behind two balls later.\nSouth Africa reached the 40-over mark at 211-6. The visitors were eyeing a closing flourish with Breetzke and Bosch but Pakistan hit back again when Abrar ended the former’s stay and then had Bjorn Fortuin lbw on the next ball. Bosch, however, got stuck in and took South Africa past 250 — muscling away Shaheen for consecutive boundaries in the 45th over and repeating the trick in the next over by Abrar — before seeing his stumps dismantled by a searing yorker by Shaheen in the penultimate over. Naseem picked up his third wicket in the last over when he cleaned up tailender Lizaad Williams. Saim and fellow opener Fakhar’s measured approach saw the side reach 53-0 in the first 10 overs. The duo stayed compact, avoiding any rash shots, but when opportunities came, they pounced on them. After the pair added 34 more to the partnership, Saim (39 off 42, four fours and six) was trapped leg-before by South African spinner Linde, who surprised the left-hander with a quicker one. Fakhar (45 off 57, four fours and two sixes) then holed Ferreira out to Fortuin in the deep before Fortuin struck gold with the ball, shooting in one to get Babar out lbw as Pakistan felt the heat at 106-3 by the end of the 20th over. The hosts reached 129-3 halfway through the innings before Salman, and Rizwan at the other end amped up the run-rate, the latter flourishing with a lofted cover drive and a sweep for fours as Pakistan crossed the 150-run mark in the 29th over. Boundaries, though, were at a premium after that – only three coming from overs 30 to 36; all of them from Rizwan’s bat. He raised his half century off 66 balls in the 37th over but fell soon after, having hit six fours in his 74-ball knock, finding Pretorius in the deep off Bosch. Hussain, though, got going with a cracking cover drive for four, which left Pakistan needing 58 off the last 10 overs. South Africa had restricted the boundaries in the next three overs but there was no stopping the singles as Hussain and Salman kept rotating the strike, chipping away at the total until the latter hoisted Ferreira down the ground for a sumptuous six to bring up his half-century off 56 balls. Hussain made 22 off 25 with two fours before falling in the 46th over and was soon followed by Hasan Nawaz, stumped off Linde, before Salman departed on the last ball of the 48th over when he skied Lungi Ngidi to Ferreira – having only got the fifth four of his 71-ball innings on the previous delivery. Nawaz, though, settled any nerves or creeping doubts when he launched Ferreira down the ground for six and despite him falling with the scores level, Pakistan got through with two balls to spare.",

      "title_orig": "Dick Cheney, former US vice president who pushed for Iraq war, dies at 84",
      "summary_orig": "Dick Cheney, a driving force behind the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, who was considered by presidential historians as one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history, has died at age 84, his family said in a statement on Tuesday. Cheney died on Monday night from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said. The Republican — a former Wyoming congressman and secretary of defence — was already a major Washington player when then-Texas governor George W Bush chose him to be his running mate in the 2000 presidential race that Bush went on to win. As vice president from 2001 to 2009, Cheney fought vigorously for an expansion of the power of the presidency, having felt that it had been eroding since the Watergate scandal that drove his one-time boss Richard Nixon from office. He also expanded the clout of the vice president’s office by putting together a national security team that often served as a power centre of its own within the administration. Cheney was a strong advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was among the most outspoken of Bush administration officials warning of the danger from Iraq’s alleged stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were found. He clashed with several top Bush aides, including Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and defended “enhanced” interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects that included waterboarding and sleep deprivation. Others, including the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the UN special rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights, called these techniques “torture”. His daughter Liz Cheney also became an influential Republican lawmaker, serving in the House of Representatives but losing her seat after opposing Republican President Donald Trump and voting to impeach him in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Her father agreed with her and said he would vote for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in 2024. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” said the man who had long been a foe of the left. Cheney was troubled much of his life by heart problems, suffering the first of a number of heart attacks at age 37. He had a heart transplant in 2012. Taking on Iraq Cheney and then-defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who had been colleagues in the Nixon White House, were key voices pushing for the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the run-up to the war, Cheney suggested there might be links between Iraq and Al Qaeda and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. A commission on the 9/11 attacks later discredited this theory. Cheney predicted US forces would be “greeted as liberators” in Iraq and that the troop deployment — which would last around a decade — would “go relatively quickly … weeks rather than months”. Although no weapons of mass destruction were found, Cheney in later years insisted that the invasion was the right decision based on the intelligence at the time and the removal of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power. Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney (L) points out something to Texas Governor and Republican presidential candidate George W Bush during a campaign stop July 26, 2000 in Casper, Wyoming, the US. — Reuters/File More than a decade earlier, as defence secretary under President George HW Bush, Cheney had directed the US military operation to expel an Iraqi occupation army from Kuwait in the first Gulf War. He urged Bush senior to take an uncompromising line against Iraq after Saddam Hussein sent his troops to occupy Kuwait in August 1990. But at that point, Cheney did not support an invasion of Iraq, saying the United States would have to act alone and that the situation would become a quagmire. Because of Cheney’s long ties to the Bush family and experience in government, George W Bush chose him to head his vice presidential search in 2000. Bush then decided the man doing the search was the best candidate for the job. Upon his re-entry into politics, Cheney received a $35 million retirement package from oil services firm Halliburton, which he had run from 1995 to 2000. Halliburton became a leading government contractor during the Iraq War. Cheney’s oil industry links were a subject of frequent criticism by opponents of the war. The first Republican in generations Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, to Marjorie Lorraine and Richard Herbert Cheney on January 30, 1941, the day then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned 59. His mother was a waitress turned softball player, his father a federal worker with the Soil Conservation Service. Both sides of the family were staunch New Deal Democrats, he wrote in his 2011 book In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir . Convinced that the president would want to know that he shared a birthday with the newborn, Cheney’s grandfather urged Marjorie and Richard to share the news by telegram with the White House. In his family, he “was the first Republican probably since my great-grandfather who fought in the Civil War on the Union side,” he told the PBS documentary Dick Cheney: A Heartbeat Away . He moved as a boy to Wyoming with his family before attending Yale University. “I was a mediocre student, at best,” he said. He dropped out. ‘A deadly allergy to olive drab’ Back in Wyoming in 1962, he worked on building electrical transmission lines and coal-fired power stations, before eventually earning undergraduate and master’s degrees in political science from the University of Wyoming. Of that time, he recalled a visit by then-US president John F Kennedy, who addressed students on the importance of using what they were learning to build a better nation and a better world. “He had inspired us all, and at a time when I was trying to put my life back together, I was particularly grateful for the sense of elevated possibilities he described,” Cheney wrote in his memoir. US Vice President Dick Cheney speaks to Air Force personnel at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, the US on March 21, 2006. — Reuters In his 20s, Cheney strongly disagreed with the students who shut down campuses in protest against the Vietnam War, he recalled in his memoir. “As a general proposition, I supported our troops in Vietnam and the right of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to make the decision to be involved there,” he wrote. He himself was never drafted. According to his biographer, John Nichols, Cheney repeatedly applied for deferments and exemptions to avoid conscription. “Cheney reacted to the prospect of wearing his country’s uniform like a man with a deadly allergy to olive drab,” Nichols wrote in The Nation magazine in 2011. Cheney stated that he would have been happy to serve. Embracing Darth Vader Cheney went to Washington in 1969 as a congressional intern and held various White House jobs during the Republican administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. One of his earliest mentors was Rumsfeld, who worked as the secretary of defence in both the Ford and George W Bush administrations. When Cheney became Ford’s chief of staff, he succeeded Rumsfeld. During the 10 years he served as Wyoming’s only congressman, Cheney had a highly conservative record, consistently voting against abortion rights. He also voted against the release of imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela and against gun control and environmental and education funding measures. His wife, Lynne, who had been his high school sweetheart, became a conservative voice on cultural issues. Liz, the couple’s eldest daughter, was elected to the House in 2016 after building a reputation for pushing hawkish foreign policy views similar to her father’s. During his time as vice president, late-night television comedians referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. He shrugged it off by joking that he was honoured to be compared to the Star Wars villain, even dressing as Vader for an appearance on ‘The Tonight Show’ to promote his memoir. ‘Thank you to satan’ Even before the rise of Trump, his support for conservative issues was not uniform. His second daughter, Mary, a Republican fundraiser, is a lesbian. Cheney spoke supportively of same-sex relationships, which put him at odds with the Bush administration’s push for a constitutional amendment against gay marriage. That amendment ultimately failed. In 2006, he made headlines during a hunting trip in Texas when he accidentally wounded his friend, Texas lawyer Harry Wittington, in the face with a spray of birdshot. Controversy continued to dog Cheney even after he left the Bush administration. He was the subject of a scathing biographical film in 2018 titled Vice , starring Christian Bale, who gained 18 kilogrammes and shaved his head to mimic the former vice president’s paunchiness and baldness. “Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration on how to play this role,” Bale said in accepting a Golden Globes award for his Cheney portrayal. During a book tour for his memoir, Cheney seemed to relish raising the ire of critics. Just before its release, he gleefully predicted it would leave heads “exploding” all over Washington.

      "summary_en": "Dick Cheney, a driving force behind the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, who was considered by presidential historians as one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history, has died at age 84, his family said in a statement on Tuesday. Cheney died on Monday night from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said. The Republican — a former Wyoming congressman and secretary of defence — was already a major Washington player when then-Texas governor George W Bush chose him to be his running mate in the 2000 presidential race that Bush went on to win. As vice president from 2001 to 2009, Cheney fought vigorously for an expansion of the power of the presidency, having felt that it had been eroding since the Watergate scandal that drove his one-time boss Richard Nixon from office. He also expanded the clout of the vice president’s office by putting together a national security team that often served as a power centre of its own within the administration. Cheney was a strong advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was among the most outspoken of Bush administration officials warning of the danger from Iraq’s alleged stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were found. He clashed with several top Bush aides, including Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and defended “enhanced” interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects that included waterboarding and sleep deprivation. Others, including the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the UN special rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights, called these techniques “torture”. His daughter Liz Cheney also became an influential Republican lawmaker, serving in the House of Representatives but losing her seat after opposing Republican President Donald Trump and voting to impeach him in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters. Her father agreed with her and said he would vote for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in 2024. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” said the man who had long been a foe of the left. Cheney was troubled much of his life by heart problems, suffering the first of a number of heart attacks at age 37. He had a heart transplant in 2012. Taking on Iraq Cheney and then-defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who had been colleagues in the Nixon White House, were key voices pushing for the March 2003 invasion of Iraq. In the run-up to the war, Cheney suggested there might be links between Iraq and Al Qaeda and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. A commission on the 9/11 attacks later discredited this theory. Cheney predicted US forces would be “greeted as liberators” in Iraq and that the troop deployment — which would last around a decade — would “go relatively quickly … weeks rather than months”. Although no weapons of mass destruction were found, Cheney in later years insisted that the invasion was the right decision based on the intelligence at the time and the removal of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power. Republican vice presidential candidate Dick Cheney (L) points out something to Texas Governor and Republican presidential candidate George W Bush during a campaign stop July 26, 2000 in Casper, Wyoming, the US. — Reuters/File More than a decade earlier, as defence secretary under President George HW Bush, Cheney had directed the US military operation to expel an Iraqi occupation army from Kuwait in the first Gulf War. He urged Bush senior to take an uncompromising line against Iraq after Saddam Hussein sent his troops to occupy Kuwait in August 1990. But at that point, Cheney did not support an invasion of Iraq, saying the United States would have to act alone and that the situation would become a quagmire. Because of Cheney’s long ties to the Bush family and experience in government, George W Bush chose him to head his vice presidential search in 2000. Bush then decided the man doing the search was the best candidate for the job. Upon his re-entry into politics, Cheney received a $35 million retirement package from oil services firm Halliburton, which he had run from 1995 to 2000. Halliburton became a leading government contractor during the Iraq War. Cheney’s oil industry links were a subject of frequent criticism by opponents of the war. The first Republican in generations Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, to Marjorie Lorraine and Richard Herbert Cheney on January 30, 1941, the day then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned 59. His mother was a waitress turned softball player, his father a federal worker with the Soil Conservation Service. Both sides of the family were staunch New Deal Democrats, he wrote in his 2011 book In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir . Convinced that the president would want to know that he shared a birthday with the newborn, Cheney’s grandfather urged Marjorie and Richard to share the news by telegram with the White House. In his family, he “was the first Republican probably since my great-grandfather who fought in the Civil War on the Union side,” he told the PBS documentary Dick Cheney: A Heartbeat Away . He moved as a boy to Wyoming with his family before attending Yale University. “I was a mediocre student, at best,” he said. He dropped out. ‘A deadly allergy to olive drab’ Back in Wyoming in 1962, he worked on building electrical transmission lines and coal-fired power stations, before eventually earning undergraduate and master’s degrees in political science from the University of Wyoming. Of that time, he recalled a visit by then-US president John F Kennedy, who addressed students on the importance of using what they were learning to build a better nation and a better world. “He had inspired us all, and at a time when I was trying to put my life back together, I was particularly grateful for the sense of elevated possibilities he described,” Cheney wrote in his memoir. US Vice President Dick Cheney speaks to Air Force personnel at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois, the US on March 21, 2006. — Reuters In his 20s, Cheney strongly disagreed with the students who shut down campuses in protest against the Vietnam War, he recalled in his memoir. “As a general proposition, I supported our troops in Vietnam and the right of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to make the decision to be involved there,” he wrote. He himself was never drafted. According to his biographer, John Nichols, Cheney repeatedly applied for deferments and exemptions to avoid conscription. “Cheney reacted to the prospect of wearing his country’s uniform like a man with a deadly allergy to olive drab,” Nichols wrote in The Nation magazine in 2011. Cheney stated that he would have been happy to serve. Embracing Darth Vader Cheney went to Washington in 1969 as a congressional intern and held various White House jobs during the Republican administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. One of his earliest mentors was Rumsfeld, who worked as the secretary of defence in both the Ford and George W Bush administrations. When Cheney became Ford’s chief of staff, he succeeded Rumsfeld. During the 10 years he served as Wyoming’s only congressman, Cheney had a highly conservative record, consistently voting against abortion rights. He also voted against the release of imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela and against gun control and environmental and education funding measures. His wife, Lynne, who had been his high school sweetheart, became a conservative voice on cultural issues. Liz, the couple’s eldest daughter, was elected to the House in 2016 after building a reputation for pushing hawkish foreign policy views similar to her father’s. During his time as vice president, late-night television comedians referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. He shrugged it off by joking that he was honoured to be compared to the Star Wars villain, even dressing as Vader for an appearance on ‘The Tonight Show’ to promote his memoir. ‘Thank you to satan’ Even before the rise of Trump, his support for conservative issues was not uniform. His second daughter, Mary, a Republican fundraiser, is a lesbian. Cheney spoke supportively of same-sex relationships, which put him at odds with the Bush administration’s push for a constitutional amendment against gay marriage. That amendment ultimately failed. In 2006, he made headlines during a hunting trip in Texas when he accidentally wounded his friend, Texas lawyer Harry Wittington, in the face with a spray of birdshot. Controversy continued to dog Cheney even after he left the Bush administration. He was the subject of a scathing biographical film in 2018 titled Vice , starring Christian Bale, who gained 18 kilogrammes and shaved his head to mimic the former vice president’s paunchiness and baldness. “Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration on how to play this role,” Bale said in accepting a Golden Globes award for his Cheney portrayal. During a book tour for his memoir, Cheney seemed to relish raising the ire of critics. Just before its release, he gleefully predicted it would leave heads “exploding” all over Washington. He devoted parts of the book to settling scores with former colleagues such as Rice, whom he depicted as naive.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf has been suspended for Pakistan’s first two ODI matches against South Africa on November 4 and 6 after the ICC sanctioned several Indian and Pakistani players on Tuesday for breaching the Code of Conduct during matches played at the Asia Cup. Haris and Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in September for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against arch-rivals India, ESPNCricinfo reported . “Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.” In a press release today, ICC confirmed the outcomes of several Code of Conduct proceedings arising duirng the Asia Cup. “The hearings were conducted by members of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees following incidents in the matches between India and Pakistan on September 14, 21 and 28,” the press release said. During the Sept 14 India v Pakistan match, India’s Suryakumar Yadav “was found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to conduct that brings the game into disrepute”. He was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and received two demerit points. The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its Sept 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”. Sahibzada was found guilty of the same offence and was issued an official warning, receiving one demerit point. Haris was also found guilty of the same offence and fined 30pc of his match fee, resulting in two demerit points. The hearing  was conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson. During the Sept 21 encounter between the neighbouring countries, India’s\nArshdeep Singh was found not guilty of an alleged breach of Article 2.6, “which pertains to using a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting, and therefore no sanction was imposed.” The hearing was conducted by ICC Match Referee Andy Pycroft. During the Asia Cup final on Sept 28, Jasprit Bumrah (India) accepted a charge under Article 2.21 for conduct that brings the game into disrepute and the proposed sanction of an official warning, which resulted in one demerit point, ICC said. “As he accepted the sanction, no formal hearing was required.” The ICC said that following a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson, Haris was again found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21. He was fined 30pc of his match fee and received two additional demerit points. “This takes Rauf’s total to four demerit points within a 24-month period, resulting in two suspension points under the ICC’s disciplinary framework. “In accordance with the Code, Rauf is therefore suspended for Pakistan’s ODI games against South Africa on Nov 4 and 6 2025,” ICC said.",

Haris and Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in September for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against arch-rivals India, ESPNCricinfo reported . “Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.” In a press release today, ICC confirmed the outcomes of several Code of Conduct proceedings arising duirng the Asia Cup. “The hearings were conducted by members of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees following incidents in the matches between India and Pakistan on September 14, 21 and 28,” the press release said. During the Sept 14 India v Pakistan match, India’s Suryakumar Yadav “was found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to conduct that brings the game into disrepute”. He was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and received two demerit points. The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its Sept 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”. Sahibzada was found guilty of the same offence and was issued an official warning, receiving one demerit point. Haris was also found guilty of the same offence and fined 30pc of his match fee, resulting in two demerit points. The hearing  was conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson. During the Sept 21 encounter between the neighbouring countries, India’s\nArshdeep Singh was found not guilty of an alleged breach of Article 2.6, “which pertains to using a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting, and therefore no sanction was imposed.” The hearing was conducted by ICC Match Referee Andy Pycroft. During the Asia Cup final on Sept 28, Jasprit Bumrah (India) accepted a charge under Article 2.21 for conduct that brings the game into disrepute and the proposed sanction of an official warning, which resulted in one demerit point, ICC said. “As he accepted the sanction, no formal hearing was required.” The ICC said that following a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson, Haris was again found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21. He was fined 30pc of his match fee and received two additional demerit points. “This takes Rauf’s total to four demerit points within a 24-month period, resulting in two suspension points under the ICC’s disciplinary framework. “In accordance with the Code, Rauf is therefore suspended for Pakistan’s ODI games against South Africa on Nov 4 and 6 2025,” ICC said.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Tuesday said it has restored flight operations with some alternate arrangements after delays due to what it called a “strike” by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP). However, the SAEP stated there was no strike from their side and the engineers were only adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols. PIA’s flight operations were disrupted across the country last night after the engineers’ group refused to issue clearances to aircraft, claiming that they could not compromise on travel safety. The PIA said in a statement today: “A de-recognised entity, SAEP, in order to pressurise the management, tried to halt the operations during late hours of yesterday (Monday) night with their nefarious design to sabotage the privatisation process.“ It asserted that the PIA’s management team, along with key officials of the engineering department, immediately responded to the situation. “By using alternative means and working tirelessly overnight and day, [the airline] restored the operations, thus mitigating the impact of already delayed flights for subsequent operations,” the statement added. The airline assured the public that “flight operations are being fully restored and customer convenience is our utmost priority and that our operations run smoothly”. According to the PIA, a total of seven flights — three from Islamabad, two from Karachi, and one each from Lahore and Sialkot — departed after delays ranging from four to 14 hours. Five flights were cancelled by readjusting the load, and alternates were offered to the passengers. A protest had been ongoing for the last two-and-a-half months, with the engineers fastening black ribbons around their arms while working. However, the situation escalated when the SAEP members discontinued issuing clearance to airplanes, disrupting the flight operations and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded at the Islamabad, Lahore and Kara­chi airports. SAEP president Abdullah Jadoon told Dawn that more than 570 aircraft engineers associated with the PIA were on strike and vowed to continue it until their demands were fulfilled. Earlier today, a senior SAEP member had denied that the society was staging a strike. They insisted that the engineers were only adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols as per their responsibilities. “Unfortunately, instead of addressing long-pending professional and financial concerns, the PIA management has chosen to label lawful compliance as disruption, which is misleading,” the SAEP member said. A spokesperson for the PIA had said the SAEP had no legal status and alleged that the main aim of this movement was to sabotage PIA’s privatisation, which was in its final stages. Similar delays have occurred at nearly all major airports in the last two months due to engineers’ protests seeking a pay hike and other issues. Flights impacted According to the details provided by the PIA, flights that departed after the adjustment of revised slots/crew arrangement included the following: These images show the flight path and details for PK761, which departed from Karachi for Jeddah after a delay of 12 hours. — screengrab via flightradar24 Delayed departure: PK747 Lahore to Madina, with 316 passengers after 14 hours’ delay PK761 Karachi to Jeddah, with 160 passengers after 12 hours’ delay PK300 Karachi to Islamabad, with 139 passengers after 4 hours’ delay PK741 Islamabad to Madina, with 305 passengers after 6 hours’ delay PK233 Islamabad to Dubai, with 162 passengers after 9 hours’ delay PK245 Islamabad to Dammam, with 180 passengers after 7 hours’ delay PK755 Sialkot to Riyadh, with 142 passengers after 7 hours’ delay On-time: PK783 Karachi to Toronto with 104 passengers PK701 Islamabad to Manchester with 329 passengers Separately, five flights were cancelled by readjusting the load, and alternates were offered to the passengers.",

      "title_orig": "‘Threatens the ideals of democracy’: PTI challenges Punjab’s new local government law in LHC",
      "summary_orig": "Punjab Assembly lawmakers affiliated with the opposition party PTI filed a petition in the Lahore High Court on Tuesday, seeking the declaration of several provisions related to the recently promulgated Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) 2025 as ultra vires to the Constitution. Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Muhammad Moeenuddin Riaz, Hafiz Farhat Abbas and Ali Imtiaz filed the petition against the legislation that was bulldozed through the assembly last month amid the opposition’s protest. The Punjab government has been named as a respondent in the plea, and Justice Sultan Tanvir will hear this petition, according to lawyer Abuzar Salman Niazi. The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn , says that Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act are “unconstitutional, unreasonable [and] illegitimate”. These provisions “brazenly and patently contravene” Articles 8 (laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights\nto be void), 9 (security of person), 17 (freedom of association), 32 (promotion of local government institutions) and 140-A (local government) of the Constitution, the petition further states. The petitioners contend that “a careful reading of the PLGA, 2025, makes it crystal clear that the same is a restrictive law aimed at curtailing and limiting the powers of elected representatives of the local governments”. “Furthermore, it also undermines the genuine political process as it limits political choices of the voters. It mandates elections on non-party basis, which [is] tantamount to violating the most basic political freedoms enunciated in the Constitution,” the petition reads. It says, “This newly elected law, which effectively introduced the systematic elimination of political choice, threatens the ideals of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam”. Moreover, the law also “violates the freedom of association and the right to life and dignity”, the petition says, adding, “Such a legal arrangement disenfranchises the people by censoring the spectrum of their choice. This will lead people to feel alienated and marginalised.” The petitioners have moved the court to declare Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act “ultra vires to the Constitution in terms of Article 8 […], being inconsistent with and in derogation of fundamental rights provided under Article 9 and 17 and also in direct conflict with Article 140-A of the Constitution”. The petitioners have also requested the court to suspend the operation of the above-mentioned sections of the PLGA, 2025, during the pendency of the plea. Legislation and election The legislation was bulldozed through the Punjab Assembly on October 13, following the Election Commission of Pakistan’s strong intervention and announcement that much-delayed local government elections in the province would be held under the PLGA 2022 in the last week of December. The ECP had rejected all excuses of the Punjab government in finalising and enacting the new PLGA and launched its delimitation process in the province from October 9. The ECP order, however, was reversed on Oct 21 in light of the new legislation after a request by the Punjab government, which was given more time to finalise the delimitation and demarcation rules. Later, the ECP said local government elections in Punjab would not be possible before the second quarter of next year, as it would not have all the prerequisites to hold the electoral exercise during the current year. PTI’s objections The treasury had steamrolled the PLGA bill through the Punjab Assembly amid strong protests and disruptions by the opposition. Subsequently, the PTI announced on November 2 that the legislation would be challenged in the LHC. PTI leaders have expressed strong reservations about the non-party-based, one-vote, multi-member union council model, saying that the non-party system would weaken the role of political parties and place administrative officers in control rather than elected local representatives, undermining local government powers. They say the centralisation of financial powers goes against the spirit of local autonomy, while the authority to appoint administrators for an indefinite period is unconstitutional. They have demanded the restoration of direct elections for union council chairmen, the establishment of a fixed five-year tenure and a clear election schedule for local governments and strict restrictions on executive interference and administrators’ powers.",

      "summary_en": "Punjab Assembly lawmakers affiliated with the opposition party PTI filed a petition in the Lahore High Court on Tuesday, seeking the declaration of several provisions related to the recently promulgated Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) 2025 as ultra vires to the Constitution. Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Muhammad Moeenuddin Riaz, Hafiz Farhat Abbas and Ali Imtiaz filed the petition against the legislation that was bulldozed through the assembly last month amid the opposition’s protest. The Punjab government has been named as a respondent in the plea, and Justice Sultan Tanvir will hear this petition, according to lawyer Abuzar Salman Niazi. The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn , says that Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act are “unconstitutional, unreasonable [and] illegitimate”. These provisions “brazenly and patently contravene” Articles 8 (laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights\nto be void), 9 (security of person), 17 (freedom of association), 32 (promotion of local government institutions) and 140-A (local government) of the Constitution, the petition further states. The petitioners contend that “a careful reading of the PLGA, 2025, makes it crystal clear that the same is a restrictive law aimed at curtailing and limiting the powers of elected representatives of the local governments”. “Furthermore, it also undermines the genuine political process as it limits political choices of the voters. It mandates elections on non-party basis, which [is] tantamount to violating the most basic political freedoms enunciated in the Constitution,” the petition reads. It says, “This newly elected law, which effectively introduced the systematic elimination of political choice, threatens the ideals of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam”. Moreover, the law also “violates the freedom of association and the right to life and dignity”, the petition says, adding, “Such a legal arrangement disenfranchises the people by censoring the spectrum of their choice. This will lead people to feel alienated and marginalised.” The petitioners have moved the court to declare Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act “ultra vires to the Constitution in terms of Article 8 […], being inconsistent with and in derogation of fundamental rights provided under Article 9 and 17 and also in direct conflict with Article 140-A of the Constitution”. The petitioners have also requested the court to suspend the operation of the above-mentioned sections of the PLGA, 2025, during the pendency of the plea.

      "summary_orig": "Ticket holders and office bearers of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) from central Punjab and Lahore on Tuesday announced that they were severing ties with the now-banned organisation, stating that they were “standing with the state”. On Friday, all election ticket holders of the TLP from south Punjab announced that they had left the party, accusing it of pursuing an anti-state agenda that “aligns with the country’s enemies”. In a press conference at the Lahore Press Club today, multiple TLP ticket holders and office bearers announced their decision to step away from the religiopolitical group, with lawyer Usman Khizr Mangat saying that one can engage in politics within the state, but not against it. “Violence and mobs cannot create an impact by attacking the state,” he said. “Pakistan saw how these people carried out attacks. The government tried to start a dialogue, but the demands laid out were not accepted. “The state is like a mother, it tried to negotiate for six, seven days constantly with these people (the TLP) and outlined Pakistan’s situation and its standing in the international community.” Mangat noted that the unrest took place at a time when the country is “on red alert because of India in the east and Afghanistan in the northwest”. “You saw that buses were stolen, people were armed and school buses carrying girls were hijacked. What kind of politics is this?” he questioned. “Other parties protest under the Constitution and the law; they have the right to freedom of movement and freedom of speech, but you cannot exercise those rights at the cost of causing unrest within the state.” Mangat added that the TLP “always thought themselves above the Constitution, the law and the state”, adding that this attitude could not be tolerated in any case. “I, Barrister Usman Khizer Mangat, along with these ticket holders and officer bearers of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan, announce the end of our time with the TLP,” he stated. “I am here to show my solidarity with the state,” Mangat added. “I stand with my state under any circumstance; it is my state and my state has been established. If my politics compromises my state’s stability and security, it is better I do not engage in politics. “I am making it very clear that I am not under any pressure. With my free will, I am announcing that I am standing alongside the state.”",

      "summary_orig": "India is ramping up aid to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and branding itself as the region’s “first responder” after Monday’s deadly earthquake , seeking to counter China’s efforts to fill the void left by the West, officials and analysts said. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was among the first to call his Taliban counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi on Monday, pledging more support after New Delhi shipped 15 tonnes of food. Medical supplies would follow soon, he said, as his ministry promoted the hashtag #IndiaFirstResponder on X. China on Tuesday said it too was ready to assist after the quake near Mazar-i-Sharif killed at least 20 people and injured more than 900. India wields soft power Both Asian giants are keen to deepen engagement with the Taliban, said Harsh Pant, head of foreign policy studies at the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi. India’s ties with Afghanistan have warmed in recent weeks, even as relations between both countries and Pakistan have soured. “Behind India’s outreach to Afghanistan is the idea to create a certain resonance and goodwill among the local population as a form of soft power,” Pant said. “It’s unlikely India can fill the gap left by Western nations, but if it does not make an effort then China will.” India hosted Muttaqi last month for six days and announced plans to reopen its embassy in Kabul, shut since 2021. It also pledged cooperation on hydroelectric projects and support for healthcare and public infrastructure. “The reopening of the Indian embassy sends a political signal, short of India’s recognition of the Taliban, of a stronger Indian presence on the ground,” an Indian official said, adding that more aid would follow. Muttaqi’s visit coincided with worsening Afghan Taliban-Pakistan relations after border clashes . Last week, India secured a six-month US sanctions waiver to operate Iran’s Chabahar port, boosting trade with Afghanistan and reducing Kabul’s reliance on Pakistan’s Karachi port. Beijing eyes mining opportunities China, which maintains close ties with Pakistan, told Afghanistan in August it was keen to explore mining and mineral opportunities and urged Kabul to formally join its Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese and Indian support is crucial for the Taliban, which seized power after US-led Nato forces withdrew in 2021, but remains shunned by Western nations over restrictions on women and UN sanctions. “Afghanistan’s isolation from the international banking system and the absence of normal coordination channels have made it far harder for aid and development funds to move,” said Ibraheem Bahiss of the International Crisis Group. “Afghanistan’s humanitarian needs are not reducing — if anything, they’re rising because the population keeps growing while economic growth remains stagnant.”",

      "summary_orig": "Twelve people were injured in a “gas” explosion at the Supreme Court building in Islamabad on Tuesday, police said. “A gas blast occurred at a canteen in the basement of the Supreme Court building at around 10:55am,” Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said while speaking to the media after the incident. He added that of the 12 injured, nine were taken to the Polyclinic hospital and three to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). IG Rizvi further told the reporters that the condition of two of the injured was “serious” who had sustained 80 per cent and 30pc burns. “The rest suffered minor injuries, most of which are burn injuries.” In multiple videos received by Dawn following the incident, the damaged interior of parts of the SC building is visible with blood stains on the floor. In other videos recorded outside, people, including lawyers, could be seen spilling out of the building. The IG said police, including special branch and along with bomb disposal squad and Rescue 1122 personnel, had visited the scene of the incident and carried out an investigation. “Initial probe revealed that there had been complaints of gas leakage in the canteen located in the basement and a tea room for around past three days. Plumbers and technicians who work at the Supreme Court were looking into those,” he said. He further stated that there was considerable leakage in the canteen today as well. Meanwhile, two of the air conditioners in the canteen were not working properly, he added. “Technicians were repairing them, during which gas accumulated […] and a blast occurred.” The IG said among the injured, the technicians repairing the air conditioners were most affected. He also assured that no traces of any kind of explosives were found at the site. Additional reporting by Umer Mehtab",

      "summary_orig": "Four Indian-sponsored terrorists were killed after security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Tuesday. In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on the night of November 1, security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of militants belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan . The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and resultantly, four Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said. “Weapons and ammunition [were] also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” it added. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area,” the statement said, adding that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to wipe out foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country. President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for eliminating the terrorists, his official account posted on social media platform X. “The nation stands firmly with its forces in their resolve to root out terrorism under Operation Azm-i-Istehkam ,” he said. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also hailed the armed forces, reiterating that the entire nation stood in their support with an unwavering resolve to protect the homeland, APP reported . “Pakistan would continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication from the country,” the premier reaffirmed. The development comes a day after the ISPR said at least three terrorists were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States is seeking approval from the United Nations for the establishment of an International Security Force (ISF) in Gaza with a mandate of at least two years, Axios reported on Tuesday. According to the report, the US sent several UN Security Council (UNSC) members a draft resolution yesterday outlining the establishment of its proposed security force to maintain security in the Palestinian enclave. Axios , which obtained a copy of the draft, said that the resolution was designated “sensitive but unclassified”. It reported that the resolution would give the US and other participating countries a broad mandate to deploy security forces to govern Gaza until the end of 2027, and allowed the possibility of extensions beyond that time. The force would be established “in consultation with the Gaza ‘Board of Peace’”, to be chaired by US President Donald Trump, the publication reported. The Board of Peace is also to remain in place “at least through the end of 2027”. However, a US official told Axios that the ISF was to be an “enforcement force and not a peacekeeping force”. The official said that the goal was to vote to establish the force in the next few weeks and deploy the first troops to Gaza by January. The publication said the draft would serve as the basis for upcoming negotiations between UNSC members. It further said that the proposed resolution tasked the ISF with “securing Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt, protecting civilians and humanitarian corridors, and training a new Palestinian police force, with which it’s to partner in its mission”. The ISF would also “stabilise the security environment in Gaza by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” the draft stated, as well as taking on “additional tasks” as required to support the Gaza peace deal. Axios said that this suggested that the mandate included disarming Hamas if it does not do so of its own volition. The resolution further said that the ISF would deploy in Gaza “under unified command acceptable to the Board of Peace” and stressed that there would be “close consultation and cooperation with Egypt and Israel”. The proposed force would have the power “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate consistent with international law, including international humanitarian law”. According to Axios , the ISF was intended to provide security in Gaza during a transition period during which Israel would gradually withdraw from additional parts of Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority would conduct reforms that would enable it to take over Gaza longer-term. The draft resolution also called for the empowerment of the Board of Peace as “a transitional governance administration”. The draft resolution said that the board would be “supervising and supporting a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip … which shall be responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza’s civil service and administration”. It added that aid would be delivered by organisations working with the Board of Peace, including the UN, Red Cross and Red Crescent; meanwhile, any organisation that misuses or diverts this aid it will be banned“. Muslim nations’ meeting in Istanbul The establishment of the ISF is a cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement , which paved the way for the October 10 ceasefire in the Palestinian territory. The ceasefire, which halted two years of continuous bloodshed, has been tested by fresh Israeli strikes in Gaza. The ceasefire was achieved with the efforts of eight Muslim countries —Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — that worked with the Trump administration on the Gaza peace plan. Foreign ministers from seven of these countries, namely Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — met in Istanbul yesterday and agreed to back a post-war framework for Gaza, where Palest­ine’s governance and security is ensured by Palestinians. They also stressed the importance of a UN mandate for the proposed task force for stabilisation in Gaza. After the meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters that the propsoed taskforce to monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UNSC and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries would decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave. Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” Fidan said yesterday. “First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council. “And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington. Top-level consultations are reportedly also underway in Pakistan over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella.",

Foreign ministers from seven of these countries, namely Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — met in Istanbul yesterday and agreed to back a post-war framework for Gaza, where Palest­ine’s governance and security is ensured by Palestinians. They also stressed the importance of a UN mandate for the proposed task force for stabilisation in Gaza. After the meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters that the propsoed taskforce to monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UNSC and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries would decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave. Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” Fidan said yesterday. “First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council. “And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington. Top-level consultations are reportedly also underway in Pakistan over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella.",
