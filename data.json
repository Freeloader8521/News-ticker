      "summary_orig": "The United States and Iran are set to hold indirect talks in Switzerland on Thursday, aiming to strike a deal to avert fresh conflict and bring an end to weeks of threats. The new round of negotiations in Geneva comes after the US carried out a massive military build-up in the region and President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if a deal is not reached. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”. He also claimed Tehran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”. The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”. The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed. However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000km — less than a third of the distance to the continental US. The dispute between the countries mostly revolves around Iran’s nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb but Tehran insists is peaceful. However the US has also been pushing to discuss Iran’s ballistic missile programme, as well as Tehran’s support for armed groups hostile towards Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran’s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons “a big, big problem” on the eve of the talks. He followed up by saying, “the president wants diplomatic solutions”. Iran has taken anything beyond the nuclear issue off the negotiating table and has demanded that the US sanctions crippling its economy be part of any agreement. ‘Neither war nor peace’ Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday he had a “favourable outlook for the negotiations” that could finally “move beyond this ‘neither war nor peace’ situation”. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, has called them “a historic opportunity”, adding that a deal was “within reach”. In a foreign ministry statement that followed a meeting with his Oman counterpart, Araghchi said the success of the US negotiations depends “on the seriousness of the other side and its avoidance of contradictory behaviour and positions”. The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka. The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, which is mediating the negotiations, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week. A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. In January, fresh tensions between the US and Iran emerged after Tehran engaged in a bloody crackdown on widespread protests that had posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception. Trump has threatened several times to intervene to “help” the Iranian people. Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that “the region seems to expect a war at this point”. In January, there was “a big push by a number of Middle Eastern states to convince the US not to” strike Iran. “But there’s a lot of apprehension at this point, because the expectation is that this time, a war would be bigger” than the one in June. Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict. Homemaker Tayebeh noted that Trump had “said that war would be very bad for Iran”. “There would be famine and people would suffer a lot. People are suffering now, but at least with war, our fate might be clear,” the 60-year-old said.",

The new round of negotiations in Geneva comes after the US carried out a massive military build-up in the region and President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if a deal is not reached. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”. He also claimed Tehran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”. The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”. The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed. However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000km — less than a third of the distance to the continental US. The dispute between the countries mostly revolves around Iran’s nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb but Tehran insists is peaceful. However the US has also been pushing to discuss Iran’s ballistic missile programme, as well as Tehran’s support for armed groups hostile towards Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran’s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons “a big, big problem” on the eve of the talks. He followed up by saying, “the president wants diplomatic solutions”. Iran has taken anything beyond the nuclear issue off the negotiating table and has demanded that the US sanctions crippling its economy be part of any agreement. ‘Neither war nor peace’ Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday he had a “favourable outlook for the negotiations” that could finally “move beyond this ‘neither war nor peace’ situation”. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, has called them “a historic opportunity”, adding that a deal was “within reach”. In a foreign ministry statement that followed a meeting with his Oman counterpart, Araghchi said the success of the US negotiations depends “on the seriousness of the other side and its avoidance of contradictory behaviour and positions”. The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka. The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, which is mediating the negotiations, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week. A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. In January, fresh tensions between the US and Iran emerged after Tehran engaged in a bloody crackdown on widespread protests that had posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception. Trump has threatened several times to intervene to “help” the Iranian people. Emile Hokayem, senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said that “the region seems to expect a war at this point”. In January, there was “a big push by a number of Middle Eastern states to convince the US not to” strike Iran. “But there’s a lot of apprehension at this point, because the expectation is that this time, a war would be bigger” than the one in June. Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict. Homemaker Tayebeh noted that Trump had “said that war would be very bad for Iran”. “There would be famine and people would suffer a lot. People are suffering now, but at least with war, our fate might be clear,” the 60-year-old said.",

      "summary_orig": "The US Justice Department announced the arrest on Wednesday of a former Air Force fighter pilot who allegedly trained Chinese military personnel without authorisation. Gerald Brown, 65, was arrested in Indiana after having recently returned to the United States from China, where he had been since December 2023, a Justice Department statement said. He is accused of having “conspired with foreign nationals to provide combat aircraft training to pilots in the Chinese Air Force” without a required license from the US State Department, the statement said. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel posted on X: “Major story… the FBI and our partners have arrested a former US Air Force Pilot who was allegedly training pilots in the Chinese military.” Brown had a 24-year career in the US Air Force during which he “commanded sensitive units with responsibility for nuclear weapons delivery systems, led combat missions, and served as a fighter pilot instructor and simulator instructor on a variety of fighter and attack aircraft”. He had retired from the military in 1996 and worked as a cargo pilot, the statement said, but he later began a role as a US defence contractor training pilots to fly the A-10 and state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets. He allegedly began negotiating a contract in August 2023 with Stephen Su Bin — a Chinese national who was imprisoned in the United States for four years beginning in 2016 over another espionage scheme — and travelled in December 2023 to China to begin his training job. “The Chinese government continues to exploit the expertise of current and former members of the US armed forces to modernise China’s military capabilities,” said Roman Rozhavsky, an official with the FBI’s Counterintelligence and Espionage Division. “This arrest serves as a warning that the FBI and our partners will stop at nothing to hold accountable anyone who collaborates with our adversaries to harm our service members and jeopardise our national security,” he added.",

      "summary_orig": "SUSIYA: Israeli settlers set fire to vehicles and tents in the Palestinian village of Susiya on Tuesday night, residents said, in the latest incident of settler violence against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Videos verified by this news agency showed a masked group of men, who residents said were Israeli settlers, approaching the village near the city of Hebron, and later burning vehicles and Palestinian property. “They attack us almost every day, repeatedly, because we live near the main road…Last night they burned everywhere,” Halima Abu Eid, a Susiya resident said on Wednesday. The Israeli military said they had dispatched soldiers to deal with rep­orts of “deliberate burnings of Pa­l­­e­s­t­inian property” and had ope­n­ed an investigation into the incident. UN has documented 86 instances of violence from Feb 3 to 16, leading to displacement of 146 Palestinians Violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank has increased sharply since the beginning of the conflict in Gaza in October 2023, with over 800 Palestinians displaced due to settler attacks in 2026 according to United Nations data. Attacks where masked settlers arrive at night to destroy Palestinian property or attack residents have become common, as Israeli settlers seek to control large swathes of land in the West Bank. An Israeli official previously blamed settler violence on a “fringe minority”, although reporting has shown well-organised plans to take Palestinian land in public settler social media channels. The United Nations has documented at least 86 instances of settler violence from February 3 to 16, leading to the displacement of 146 Palestinians and the injury of 64. Israeli indictments of settler violence are rare. At the end of 2025, Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it had documented since October 7, 2023, only 2pc resulted in indictments. Israel’s far-right governing coalition has enabled the rapid spread of settlements, with some ministers openly stating they want to “bury” a Palestinian state. Most world powers deem Israel’s settlements, on land it captured in a 1967 war, illegal, and numerous UN Security Council resolutions have called on Israel to halt all settlement activity. Israel disputes the view that its settlements are unlawful and it cites biblical and historical ties to the land. Published in Dawn, February 26th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "COLOMBO: Sri Lankan investigators arrested a former intelligence chief on Wednesday, the most high-profile official netted in the long-running investigation into the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings . Police said retired Major General Suresh Sallay was taken into custody at dawn in a suburb of the capital, Colombo. “He was arrested for conspiracy and aiding and abetting the Easter Sunday attacks,” an investigating officer told AFP . “He has been in touch with people involved in the attacks, even recently.” The coordinated bombings targeted three upmarket hotels in the capital, two Roman Catholic churches and an evangelical Protestant church outside Colombo. The attacks killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners, and were blamed on a homegrown jihadist group. Police, in a statement, said that Sallay was arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act and would be detained for at least three days for questioning. His arrest was welcomed by the Catholic church, and criticised by his still powerful supporters. “What we need is the truth behind the Easter attacks,” church spokesman Father Cyril Gamini Fernando told AFP . ‘We want to see justice for all the victims.” The church has accused successive governments of failing to identify the masterminds. The April 21, 2019 attacks were the worst to target civilians in the country, where at least 100,000 people were killed in nearly four decades of civil war. Sallay, who was promoted to State Intelligence Service (SIS) chief in 2019 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president , is accused of involvement in organising the suicide bombings, a charge he denies. His long-expected arrest came ahead of the seventh anniversary of the bombings. British broadcaster Channel 4 reported in 2023 that Sallay was linked to the bombers and had met them prior to the attack. A whistleblower told the network that Sallay had permitted the attack to proceed with the intention of influencing that year’s presidential election in favour of Rajapaksa. Two days after the bombings, Rajapaksa declared his candidacy and went on to win the November vote in a landslide after promising to stamp out extremism. Published in Dawn, February 26th, 2026",

Two days after the bombings, Rajapaksa declared his candidacy and went on to win the November vote in a landslide after promising to stamp out extremism. Published in Dawn, February 26th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "WITHIN hours of the bombing of an Islamabad Imambargah on Feb 6, Pakistani intelligence and law enforcement zeroed in on a home in Hakimabad, Nowshera, 49km east of Peshawar. “It was a race against time. Sifting through technical data, establishing coordinates and isolating the target,” a senior security official said. “It didn’t take long before we knew the location.” By late evening, they had already laid siege to the residence, taken up position and called out those inside to come out, hands raised, and surrender. For a moment, there was no movement. But then, someone showed a raised hand from behind the door, indicating their willingness to surrender. Except that he didn’t. Aiming a 9mm gun straight at the security cordon, the lone gunman fired straight shots, hitting an assistant sub inspector of the police right in the chest, killing him on the spot, and injuring two intelligence officers. The exchange of fire didn’t last long, though. Within minutes, the gunman, said to be in his mid-thirties, was shot and killed. But the brief distraction offered by the gun battle gave those inside the house sufficient time to destroy cellphones and any other evidence of communication that could possibly betray them. The gunman turned out to be a high-value target — identified as Yousaf alias Qasim aka Idrees — the leader of the militant Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group in the Bajaur region, and the main handler of the Imambargah suicide bomber, carrying a reward of Rs12 million. What followed was more startling, as the counter-terrorism department dug further into this cell’s activities. The gang, it turned out, had been involved in a series of assassinations and suicide bombings before stepping out of the tribal district to relocate to Gujranwala, Lahore and finally to Nowshera’s Hakimabad. Investigators now have enough evidence to link them to the targeted assassination of all 20 men involved in the lynching to death of an IS-K operative, out to kill a local JUI-F leader for issuing a scathing attack against it. They were also linked to the assassination of senior JUI-F figure Mufti Sultan Mahmood in Bajaur in October 2019, a suicide bombing at the party’s convention on July 30, 2021 that left more than 54 dead and over a hundred wounded, and the bombing and assassination of ANP leader Maulana Khanzeb on July 10, 2025. Additionally, investigators say, the group was involved in the killings of at least 15 policemen, as well as the murder of the Nawagai assistant commissioner in a bombing on July 2, 2025. Investigators say that Idrees — a tailor by profession — had been on their radar for some time, but had managed to evade capture by changing locations, moving with women and children, and avoiding staying at one location for longer periods. “Pretty much living like nomads, leaving whatever little they had behind before moving onto the next location without notifying the landlord,” was how one official described his movements. What surprised investigators the most was the role of the women in the group. Investigators have now established that not only did the suicide bomber travel to Afghanistan’s Kunar in May 2025, the women had also crossed the border using tampered passports. Not only that, but one of the women had carried the suicide vest from Bajaur to Islamabad, and handed it over to another woman in the group. “They are all indoctrinated. The whole family is radicalised,” a senior investigator said. As investigators dig deeper into the working and operations of IS-Khorasan, there is a realisation that its network is far bigger and more spread out than previously thought — from the Middle East to Central Asian Republics, and onwards into Afghanistan and Pakistan. They use cryptocurrency for money transfer and employ encrypted communication apps, making their communications very hard to break. Based on what they have learned, investigators now consider IS-Khorasan a much bigger threat than the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan in terms of its capability for mass killing, compartmentalisation, commitment to ideology, resources and the sophistication of their operations.

The protesters blocked the Karakoram Highway at several points in Gilgit, calling for action against the culprits. The demonstrators dispersed peacefully after the authorities assured them that steps would be taken to arrest the individuals responsible for offending religious sensibilities. The arrests came during a crackdown against “elements spreading communal hatred and blasphemous material” on social media, according to a police statement. “Police took action und­er a zero-tolerance policy against elements offending religious sentiments or undermining harmony through social media,” the statement said. Police did not name the four arrested individuals. The authorities have requested the public to cooperate with police in identifying such elements. According to a separate statement, police arrested a resident of Gil­git’s Naumal area on a charge of sharing “derogatory content” on social media. A case was registered against him under sections 298 and 153 of the PPC and also under the Anti-Terrorism Act. Caretaker home minister Sajid Ali Baig said at a press conference that the government would carry out a thorough investigation to nab the people involved in stoking disharmony and “exemplary punishment” would be given to them.

      "summary_orig": "Iran sees the chance of a good outcome from a third round of talks with the United States, its President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday, as a delegation left for Geneva for negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme. A senior US official said on Monday that envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner are slated to meet with the Iranian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, in Geneva on Thursday. The two countries resumed negotiations over the long-disputed nuclear programme earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East ahead of possible strikes on the Islamic Republic. Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked. Trump on February 19 said he was giving Tehran about 10 to 15 days to make a deal. “In relation to the talks, we see a good outlook, tomorrow in the meeting that Dr Araqchi will hold in Geneva … we have tried, with the guidance of the supreme leader, to manage this process to get out of the no war, no peace situation,” Pezeshkian said in comments carried by state media. Araqchi said on Tuesday that a deal with the US was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”. Meanwhile, Witkoff told a private gathering that the Trump administration is demanding any nuclear deal with Iran should remain in effect indefinitely, Axios has reported, citing a US official and two others with knowledge of the comments. The US and Israel believe Iran aspires to build a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel’s existence. Iran says its nuclear programme is purely peaceful, even though it has enriched uranium far beyond the purity needed for power generation, and close to what is required for a bomb. Vance’s warning Trump is pressuring the Iranian government in the wake of its violent crackdown on protesters and has amassed a large US naval presence in the region while threatening military strikes if Tehran does not reach a deal to solve a longstanding dispute over its nuclear programme. US Vice President JD Vance told Iran on Wednesday to take Washington’s threats of military action “seriously,” a day after President Donald Trump appeared to build the case for war in his State of the Union address. As US forces mass in the Middle East, Trump claimed in his speech to Congress on Tuesday that Iran was seeking to develop missiles that can strike the United States. Trump also accused Iran of having “sinister nuclear ambitions” and working to rebuild a nuclear programme that was targeted by US strikes last year. Vance told Fox News that while Trump was going to try to “accomplish it diplomatically,” the US president also had the “right” to use military action. “You can’t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,” said Vance. “The president has a number of other tools at his disposal to ensure this doesn’t happen. He’s shown a willingness to use them and I hope the Iranians take it seriously in the negotiations tomorrow because that’s certainly what the president prefers.” His comments came as the United States announced fresh sanctions targeting Iran, pressing on with what Washington calls its “maximum pressure” campaign.",

Trump on February 19 said he was giving Tehran about 10 to 15 days to make a deal. “In relation to the talks, we see a good outlook, tomorrow in the meeting that Dr Araqchi will hold in Geneva … we have tried, with the guidance of the supreme leader, to manage this process to get out of the no war, no peace situation,” Pezeshkian said in comments carried by state media. Araqchi said on Tuesday that a deal with the US was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”. Meanwhile, Witkoff told a private gathering that the Trump administration is demanding any nuclear deal with Iran should remain in effect indefinitely, Axios has reported, citing a US official and two others with knowledge of the comments. The US and Israel believe Iran aspires to build a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel’s existence. Iran says its nuclear programme is purely peaceful, even though it has enriched uranium far beyond the purity needed for power generation, and close to what is required for a bomb. Vance’s warning Trump is pressuring the Iranian government in the wake of its violent crackdown on protesters and has amassed a large US naval presence in the region while threatening military strikes if Tehran does not reach a deal to solve a longstanding dispute over its nuclear programme. US Vice President JD Vance told Iran on Wednesday to take Washington’s threats of military action “seriously,” a day after President Donald Trump appeared to build the case for war in his State of the Union address. As US forces mass in the Middle East, Trump claimed in his speech to Congress on Tuesday that Iran was seeking to develop missiles that can strike the United States. Trump also accused Iran of having “sinister nuclear ambitions” and working to rebuild a nuclear programme that was targeted by US strikes last year. Vance told Fox News that while Trump was going to try to “accomplish it diplomatically,” the US president also had the “right” to use military action. “You can’t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,” said Vance. “The president has a number of other tools at his disposal to ensure this doesn’t happen. He’s shown a willingness to use them and I hope the Iranians take it seriously in the negotiations tomorrow because that’s certainly what the president prefers.” His comments came as the United States announced fresh sanctions targeting Iran, pressing on with what Washington calls its “maximum pressure” campaign.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi told lawmakers in Jerusalem on Wednesday that India stands “firmly” with Israel following Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023. Modi also met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a two-day visit aimed at deepening trade and defence ties that has drawn criticism at home. “I … carry with me the deepest condolences of the people of India for every life lost and for every family whose world was shattered in the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7,” Modi said in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. “We feel your pain, we share your grief. India stands with Israel firmly with full conviction in this moment and beyond.” In his speech, Modi did not explicitly mention the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza during the more than two-year-long Israeli onslaught. But he said that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”. Modi also told Israeli lawmakers that his country’s economic growth and Israel’s leadership in technological innovation formed a “natural foundation for our forward-looking partnership”. “I see a lot of synergies in areas such as quantum technologies, semiconductors and artificial intelligence,” he added. It is Modi’s second visit to Israel as prime minister since he took office in 2014. ‘A real friendship’ Earlier on Wednesday, a red carpet was rolled out at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport and Modi was greeted with a hug by Netanyahu as he disembarked the plane. “The two leaders share a special and a personal relationship,” Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for Netanyahu’s office, said in a video posted on X. “The bond between Israel and India is a powerful alliance as we are partners in innovation, security and a shared strategic vision,” she added. Netanyahu’s office said the two right-wing leaders held a private meeting after the welcoming ceremony, with the Israeli premier hailing “a real friendship”. In a post on X, Modi described the meeting as “excellent”. “We discussed a wide range of topics aimed at deepening and strengthening the bilateral relations between our two countries,” he said. The pair “held an in-depth conversation about major developments in the region”, he added. Modi is also scheduled to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog during the visit. New Delhi has steadily expanded cooperation with Israel across the defence, agriculture, technology and cybersecurity sectors, while balancing diplomatic interests in the Middle East. Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that merchandise trade reached $3.62 billion in 2024-2025. Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Ties deepened after Hindu-nationalist leader Modi took office in 2014. Criticism at home Modi first visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year. In 2023, grand plans were unveiled in New Delhi for an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor — to link railways, ports, electricity, data networks and pipelines, including through Saudi Arabia and Israel. Those plans were stalled by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which responded with a devastating onslaught on the Gaza Strip, killing over 71,000 Palestinians. Months after his 2017 visit to Israel, Modi travelled to Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority. His current visit has sparked criticism at home. Senior Congress party figure Priyanka Gandhi — sister of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — posted on social media on Wednesday that she hoped Modi would mention the killing of “thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza” during his address to the Israeli parliament. Congress parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh said Modi will be displaying “moral cowardice” when the entire world is critical of his “dear friend” Netanyahu. He said Modi was “brazenly embracing” his Israeli counterpart, who has “reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and who is orchestrating the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank”. “On May 20, 1960, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Gaza and met with the Indian contingent of the UN Emergency Force there,” Ramesh recalled. Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “ hexagon of alliances ” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations. India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people, is majority Hindu, but an estimated 220 million Indians are Muslim.

      "summary_orig": "BAJAUR: Four cops were martyred and two others were wounded when unidentified attackers opened fire at a patrol party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district on Wednesday evening. Khar Police Station House Officer Gul Zada told Dawn that the attackers targeted the Ababeel Squad — an exclusive patrolling force — at the time of Iftar near the Nawai Kallay area. The squad was on a routine patrol when unidentified attackers opened fire on them, he said, adding that four policemen died on the spot while two others were “seriously injured”. Separately, Bajaur police spokesperson Israr Khan told Dawn that the personnel were on their way to the Bajaur police lines from Inayat Kallay bazaar, with their duty hours about to end, when they were attacked. As a result, four cops — Yar Zada, Dawood Khan, Imran Khan and Siraj Khan — were martyred while Irshad Khan and Azizur Rehman were injured, he added. SHO Gul Zada said the injured policemen were immediately taken to the district headquarters hospital in Khar for treatment. Meanwhile, a police team led by senior officials immediately rushed to the site of the incident and launched a search operation to hunt down the attackers, who had fled after the shooting, Israr Khan said. The attack in Bajaur took place a day after seven police personnel were martyred in two attacks in KP, where law enforcers have increasingly come under attack in recent days. On Tuesday, six law enforcement personnel, including Deputy Superintendent of Police Asad Mehmood, were martyred in a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Kohat district. A police officer told Dawn that the DSP, an inspector and four constables were martyred when their vehicle was ambushed near Shakardara Road while transporting two individuals for a court appearance. One of the two individuals being transported was also killed in the attack. The assailants later set the vehicle on fire. In a separate incident, a constable was martyred after unidentified men opened fire in the Mughal Khel village of Wana tehsil in Lower South Waziristan. On Monday, three Federal Constabulary men were martyred when terrorists attacked rescue teams in the Karak district. Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in Bajaur district resulted in the martyrdom of 11 security personnel .",

      "title_orig": "34 terrorists killed in separate engagements in KP and Balochistan: ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Wednesday that a total of 34 terrorists were killed in separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that over the last few days, security forces had conducted a series of “high tempo, intelligence-driven operations” aimed at eliminating Indian proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. The statement said that on Feb 24, 26 terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in four separate engagements in KP, while eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were killed in an operation in Balochistan’s Sambaza. Giving a breakdown, ISPR said that the movement of a group of terrorists trying to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border was picked up by security forces in KP’s North Waziristan. It said troops engaged the terrorists, killing one in the process. “It is significant to highlight that the killed kharji has been identified as an Afghan national,” the statement said. It went on to say that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in KP’s Lakki Marwat district. During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and after an intense fire exchange, three militants were killed, it said. According to ISPR, 10 terrorists were killed in Narmi Khel in KP’s Bannu district while 12 were killed in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali. It went on to say that troops also conducted an IBO in Sambaza in Balochistan’s Zhob district. “After an intense fire exchange, eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were successfully neutralised,” it said. “Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian sponsored killed khwarij and terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” it said. “The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers,” the statement said, adding that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate other terrorists. The statement concluded that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to act against terrorism at full pace. In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for their successful operations against Fitna Al Hindustan and Fitna Al Khwarij terrorists. He said that the killing of the terrorists and the recovery of weapons reflected the professional performance of security forces. He stressed that the security forces and law enforcement agencies should continue their efforts to eradicate terrorism in line with the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam . “There should be no let-up in operations against terrorists who are active with external backing, to ensure national security and the protection of the people,” he said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a statement, also paid tribute to Pakistan’s security forces. He further stated that Pakistan’s security forces continued to achieve battlefield successes against terrorist organisations each day. He reaffirmed that the government was determined to eliminate terrorism from the country. Earlier this week, security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during IBOs in Balochistan and KP.",

Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. The statement said that on Feb 24, 26 terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in four separate engagements in KP, while eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were killed in an operation in Balochistan’s Sambaza. Giving a breakdown, ISPR said that the movement of a group of terrorists trying to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border was picked up by security forces in KP’s North Waziristan. It said troops engaged the terrorists, killing one in the process. “It is significant to highlight that the killed kharji has been identified as an Afghan national,” the statement said. It went on to say that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in KP’s Lakki Marwat district. During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and after an intense fire exchange, three militants were killed, it said. According to ISPR, 10 terrorists were killed in Narmi Khel in KP’s Bannu district while 12 were killed in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali. It went on to say that troops also conducted an IBO in Sambaza in Balochistan’s Zhob district. “After an intense fire exchange, eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were successfully neutralised,” it said. “Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian sponsored killed khwarij and terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” it said. “The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers,” the statement said, adding that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate other terrorists. The statement concluded that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to act against terrorism at full pace. In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for their successful operations against Fitna Al Hindustan and Fitna Al Khwarij terrorists. He said that the killing of the terrorists and the recovery of weapons reflected the professional performance of security forces. He stressed that the security forces and law enforcement agencies should continue their efforts to eradicate terrorism in line with the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam . “There should be no let-up in operations against terrorists who are active with external backing, to ensure national security and the protection of the people,” he said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a statement, also paid tribute to Pakistan’s security forces. He further stated that Pakistan’s security forces continued to achieve battlefield successes against terrorist organisations each day. He reaffirmed that the government was determined to eliminate terrorism from the country. Earlier this week, security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during IBOs in Balochistan and KP.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistanis, including tourists, travelling to the United Kingdom (UK) will now be able to do so with an e-visa, receiving confirmation by email rather than stickers in passports, according to a statement issued by the British High Commission on Wednesday. In July 2025, the UK government introduced an e-visa system for Pakistanis; however, it was limited to study or work visas. Applicants applying for general visitor visas were still required to obtain a physical visa. In the statement released on Wednesday, the high commission said visitors would continue to submit their applications online and attend a visa application centre to provide biometrics. It said that successful applicants would have a digital record of their immigration status provided through an e-visa, accessible through an online UK Visas and Immigration account. “It means applicants no longer need to attend a visa application centre a second time to collect their passport, instead holding on to it after their biometrics session,” the commission said. It said that e-visas provided a more secure way to manage immigration status and reduce the risk of lost or damaged documents. “Applicants can generate a share code to prove their visa status at borders and elsewhere. There is no change to visa processing times, eligibility criteria or conditions,” it said. The statement also quoted British High Commissioner Jane Marriott as saying that this was a “hugely exciting step” for Pakistanis travelling to the UK. “As well as being able to save time by holding on to your passport, the new share code system makes it easier than ever to demonstrate your visa status,” she said. Separately, in a video message posted on her X account on Wednesday, Marriot said that “nearly all visitors going to the UK can now use the new e-visa service when they travel”. She said that under the new system, travellers will be able to keep their passports with them as they will not be required to hand them in. She added that the “major difference is that you get to keep your passport with you and you no longer need to visit a visa centre for a second time (to pick up your passport)”. She further said that “the process and application timelines have not changed”. In 2024, the UK government had announced that the country’s immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.",
