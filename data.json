      "summary_orig": "In another fatal incident involving a heavy vehicle, a dumper of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board carrying garbage struck and killed a motorcycle rider in the Nagan area of Karachi on Monday, according to police. New Karachi Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammed Saud said the deceased, Hameedur Rehman, was riding a motorcycle under the Nagan bridge when the dumper crushed him to death. People gathered at the spot where the incident occurred, caught the dumper driver, Allah Rakha, and beat him until the police arrived. The police then took the accused into custody. The body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities. The spot did not have closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to capture the incident, the SHO said. However, the deceased was riding on the wrong side of the road, eyewitnesses told police. Rise in heavy vehicle accidents In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumpers and water tankers. Nearly 500 people lost their lives and 4,879 were injured in 2024 in road accidents resulting from various reasons, from reckless driving to construction activities, hospital data showed . On November 4, angered citizens set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it killed a man and injured his wife, resulting in some people opening fire on them. On October 12, a reckless dumper driver smashed into six vehicles , including three ambulances of the Edhi Foundation, near Merewether Clock Tower, killing a man and injuring two others. The driver, who possessed a “fake” licence, was arrested. On August 10, two siblings were killed and their father was injured when a dumper truck ran over them on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall. A mob then set seven trucks on fire, which sparked protests from transporters. August 15 recorded two accidents involving heavy vehicles, including one where a speeding water tanker ran over and killed a four-year-old boy in Orangi Town. In another accident, a young couple lost their lives when a fast-moving dumper truck hit their motorcycle in the Sultanabad area on M.T. Khan Road.",

      "summary_orig": "Police on Monday recovered the body of a doctor who had been missing since Thursday in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Abbottabad from a nearby forest. Police sources told Dawn that the body of Dr Warda Mushtaq was recovered from the nearby forests of Thandiyani. Her body has now been shifted to the hospital for an autopsy. Police also arrested a friend of the deceased and her husband in relation to the case. Mushtaq — a doctor at the Benazir Bhutto Shaheed hospital — had been missing since Thursday, prompting her colleagues and the leaders of the Provincial Doctors Association and Grand Health Alliance to stage a demonstration and boycott hospital duties. They had announced that if she was not found by Monday, protests would be extended to hospitals across the province. Following the news of the death, the hospital staff staged a protest and blocked the main Karakoram Highway (KKH) road from Fawara Chowk, assailing the police for “delayed action.” FIR As per the first information report (FIR), filed by her father under Section 365 (kidnapping or abducting) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), Mushtaq left the hospital with the wife of a well-known Abbottabad businessman and went to Jadoon Plaza, Mandian, within the jurisdiction of Mirpur Police Station, after which all contacts with her were lost. The FIR further detailed that Mushtaq had given her friend 67 tolas of gold for safekeeping in 2023 and went to Dubai. However, due to a lack of accommodation, she returned and demanded the return of the gold from her; however, the suspect kept evading it. Police have initiated action against the three suspects named in the FIR, arresting Mushtaq’s friend, her husband and the deceased’s driver. Subsequently, the suspect filed a petition with the district police officer (DPO), stating that she had returned the 67 tolas of gold to Mushtaq the day she went missing. She further alleged that Mushtaq had “borrowed Rs8.3 million, for which she gave me five cheques”, and the two parted ways. “I have no contact with her and I have no information about her,” she said, adding that she came to know about the incident while she was at a wedding.” The suspects alleged that “this was a conspiracy to defame her husband, who is a businessman.” “DPO Abbottabad should conduct an impartial inquiry into this so that the real facts can come out,” she said. KP governor orders probe Expressing sympathy over the death of Mushtaq, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report into the incident. In a statement issued today, he termed it a “serious and unforgettable incident, vowing to punish the perpetrators.“ “As the governor, I share the grief of the doctors’ community across the province and the family of the martyred doctor over the said incident,” Kundi was quoted as saying.",

      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said on Monday that the PTI’s “unjustified” criticism of the army had pushed the institution to respond. In remarks aired on the media, he also accused the opposition party of repeatedly criticising the army and its leadership for its own political gains. Referring to arguments by the PTI that the army should not interfere in politics, Chaudhry said, “The army is not intervening in politics. You, in order to further your own politics or to come into power by riding on someone else’s shoulders, repeatedly try to drag the army and its head into politics. “You direct unjustified and unnecessary criticism [at them]. You level allegations without any reason,” he said. He said the army had been serving the country and recalled that it defeated a “big power in the world” recently — an apparent reference to the conflict between Pakistan and India in May. The state minister further said that the army took pride in its martyrs, victories and in protecting Pakistan, “and you criticise it and its head for no reason”. “For how long will the institution remain silent? Eventually, it had to respond. The PTI pushed them to respond,” he added. “The army and its head showed patience and overlooked [the criticism] for a very long time. But every other day, the PTI founder in his tweets and messages, and others in press conferences after meeting Imran, would make unjustified accusations and criticise.” The state minister also alleged that the PTI never criticised India’s aggression or condemned terrorists. “Having a soft spot for those terrorists […] and directing all criticism toward Pakistan’s institutions, Pakistan’s army and its head, warrants an answer,” he asserted.“How long can it be ignored, how long can it be overlooked?” He further stated that the government had invited the PTI to Parliament for talks multiple times. “But we are now embarrassed to have invited these types of people for talks, those who are not worthy of it.” Chaudhry went on to allege that Imran “came into power by riding on someone else’s shoulders”. He further said that after that only a “mentally ill patient” would consider himself a “know-it-all” and “necessary” for the country. He further alleged that Imran had come into power in 2018 with the support of the military establishment. “And since no one is supporting you today, you are levelling criticism in an effort to blackmail the army […] so that you can compel them into supporting your rise to power again,” Chaudhry alleged. The state minister also questioned the PTI’s performance in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the last 13 years. “Why will the people vote for you? Why will they bring you into power again? Those who couldn’t win the by-election in Haripur, how will they succeed in polls in Lahore, Faisalabad or the rest of Pakistan? “It is because of this that you are taking out your anger and criticising one institution and its head. This will not be tolerated now,” Chaudhry added. The state minister warned that those raising their voice against Pakistan, its institutions and their heads would now be silenced. “Come put on a show outside Adiala (jail), and you will be told how the law is implemented,” he said, seemingly referring to PTI’s protests outside the prison for Imran’s visitation rights. “It cannot be that you disturb peace […], speak the language of our enemy after meeting [with Imran at the jail], and it is all tolerated.” He further warned that in case such a scene was created outside Adiala jail, “the prisoners in the jail would have to be shifted to a place where they can stay safe”. The minister also alleged that the KP chief minister was changed in October because the previous one, Ali Amin Gandapur, had refused to obey Imran’s directives. He also alleged that the new CM and the KP government were being used for efforts for a “jailbreak and riots” so that Imran could “escape his punishment”. “This will not happen now. KP’s resources will be used for KP,” he said. He further said that a Peshawar High Court order, as well as the law and Constitution, stated that “you cannot use your resources for your politics”. He ended his talk with a warning that the response to the PTI would now match the party’s actions. “And it is clear now that nothing that will be a source of anarchy in Pakistan will be tolerated. It will not be tolerated that unjustified criticism is directed toward institutions.” The minister’s censure is the latest in a string of admonishments directed toward the PTI from the country’s politicians, who have been rallying behind the armed forces after a fiery press conference by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaurdhry on December 5. The press conference, where the army spokesperson assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, followed the former prime minister’s latest outburst against the military leadership, delivered last week through his sister Uzma Khan during a jail visit after weeks of restricted access.",

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday said it had arrested 12 suspected terrorists allegedly working for the Indian intelligence agency Research Analysis Wing (RAW) in intelligence-based operations conducted in Lahore, Faisalabad, and Bahawalpur. According to a statement issued by the CTD spokesperson, the arrests were made in collaboration with sensitive agencies. He said security personnel recovered photos, videos, weapons, and explosives from the suspects, preventing large-scale terrorism activities in the aforementioned cities. He said the recovered material reportedly also included images and video recordings of sensitive locations, including a religious seminary. He said the terrorists were planning to incite “fear and religious hatred” in the province and had plans to target “places of worship and other important sites”. The CTD spokesperson said suspects identified as Sukhdeep Singh, Azmat, Faizan, Nabil, Abrar, Usman, and Sarfaraz were arrested in Lahore. Another suspect, Danish, was arrested in Faisalabad, while four others — identified as Rajab, Hashim, Saqib, and Arif — were arrested in Bahawalpur. He said that arrests came after the CTD investigated a Facebook account allegedly being operated from India to coordinate terrorist activities. All of these terrorists were being funded by the Indian agency RAW, the CTD spokesperson said. “Seven improvised explosive devices, two detonators, 102 feet of safety fuse wire, explosives, weapons, mobile phones, and cash were recovered from the possession of the terrorists,” he added. “Cases have been registered against the terrorists and further investigation is underway,” he said. The CTD regularly carries out operations across Pakistan to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. In August, Sindh’s CTD had found the involvement of RAW in the target killing of a man in Badin district and arrested six suspects in the case, who were allegedly funded by RAW. In June, four suspected Indian agents were arrested in a raid carried out in Karachi’s Quaidabad area.",

      "summary_orig": "Thailand has launched air strikes along its disputed border with Cambodia, the Thai military said on Monday, after both countries accused the other of breaching a ceasefire agreement brokered by US President Donald Trump. At least one Thai soldier has been killed and four wounded in the fresh clashes that broke out around two areas in the easternmost province of Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand’s military said in a statement, after its troops came under Cambodian fire. “The Thai side has now begun using aircraft to strike military targets in several areas,” the statement said. Cambodia’s defence ministry said in a statement that the Thai military had launched dawn attacks on its forces at two locations, following days of provocative actions, and added that Cambodian troops had not retaliated. Thailand’s army said Cambodia’s military had fired BM-21 rockets towards Thai civilian areas, adding there were no reports of casualties. Meanwhile, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim urged Thailand and Cambodia to exercise restraint, warning the fighting risked undoing the careful work that went into a ceasefire he helped to broker. “We urge both sides to exercise maximum restraint, maintain open channels of communication and make full use of the mechanisms in place,” Anwar, the chair of the regional bloc ASEAN, said in a post on X. Ceasefire breakdown The border dispute had erupted into a five-day conflict in July , before a ceasefire deal brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Trump, who also witnessed the signing of an expanded peace agreement between the two countries in Kuala Lumpur in October. At least 48 people were killed and an estimated 300,000 temporarily displaced during the July clashes, with the neighbours exchanging rockets and heavy artillery fire. Following a landmine blast last month that maimed one of its soldiers, Thailand said it was halting the implementation of the ceasefire pact with Cambodia. Cambodia’s influential former longtime leader Hun Sen, father of current premier Hun Manet, said Thailand’s military were “aggressors” seeking to provoke a retaliatory response and urged Cambodian forces to exercise restraint. “The red line for responding has already been set. I urge commanders at all levels to educate all officers and soldiers accordingly,” Hun Sen said on Facebook, without elaborating. In Thailand, more than 385,000 civilians across four border districts are being evacuated, with over 35,000 already housed in temporary shelters, the Thai military said. Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817km land border, first mapped in 1907 by France when it ruled Cambodia as a colony. Simmering tension has occasionally exploded into skirmishes, such as a weeklong artillery exchange in 2011, despite attempts to peacefully resolve overlapping claims.",

      "summary_orig": "A first information report (FIR) has been registered under terrorism charges after one of the many rallies taken out in Karachi to mark Sindh Culture Day on Sunday turned violent , it emerged on Monday. Police on Sunday resorted to tear gas shelling to prevent participants of the rally from moving towards the Red Zone via Sharea Faisal and detained 45 people, 12 of whom were later released. According to the  police, participants of the rally attacked personnel, who then responded with baton-charging and tear gas shelling. According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn , a case has now been registered against 12 named individuals arrested at the scene and “300-400” unidentified individuals. The case has been registered under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 324 (attempted murder), 186 (obstructing public servants), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant), 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). The complainant, Inspector Abdul Majeed Abro, said that he and other police personnel were present near the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover on Sharae Faisal at 2:30pm on Sunday when a rally, consisting of around 300-400 people on motorcycles and cars, appeared from the direction of the airport, heading toward Saddar. “Keeping in view the ban on gatherings due to the imposition of Section 144 in the province, police personnel attempted to stop the participants of the rally,” he said. However, the participants of the rally blocked the main thoroughfare on both sides and began pelting police with stones while also opening fire, he said. He further said that the participants of the rally also damaged cars that were passing by, including a rescue ambulance and a police mobile, adding that they were also shouting “anti-state” slogans. “Subsequently, police personnel, with the help of officers present on the scene, fired tear gas at the participants to prevent them from damaging property,” he said. Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar had taken strict notice of Sunday’s incident and ordered immediate action against those involved. South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn on Sunday that law enforcers had asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”. “They allegedly pelted stones at the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he had said, adding that this prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them. When asked why the law enforcers had blocked the road at the FTC flyover, the DIG had said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the cultural day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intended to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal. He had said that around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached Fawara Chowk/KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants.",

When asked why the law enforcers had blocked the road at the FTC flyover, the DIG had said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the cultural day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intended to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal. He had said that around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached Fawara Chowk/KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants.",

      "summary": "A first information report (FIR) has been registered under terrorism charges after one of the many rallies taken out in Karachi to mark Sindh Culture Day on Sunday turned violent , it emerged on Monday. Police on Sunday resorted to tear gas shelling to prevent participants of the rally from moving towards the Red Zone via Sharea Faisal and detained 45 people, 12 of whom were later released. According to the  police, participants of the rally attacked personnel, who then responded with baton-charging and tear gas shelling. According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn , a case has now been registered against 12 named individuals arrested at the scene and “300-400” unidentified individuals. The case has been registered under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 324 (attempted murder), 186 (obstructing public servants), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant), 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). The complainant, Inspector Abdul Majeed Abro, said that he and other police personnel were present near the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover on Sharae Faisal at 2:30pm on Sunday when a rally, consisting of around 300-400 people on motorcycles and cars, appeared from the direction of the airport, heading toward Saddar. “Keeping in view the ban on gatherings due to the imposition of Section 144 in the province, police personnel attempted to stop the participants of the rally,” he said. However, the participants of the rally blocked the main thoroughfare on both sides and began pelting police with stones while also opening fire, he said. He further said that the participants of the rally also damaged cars that were passing by, including a rescue ambulance and a police mobile, adding that they were also shouting “anti-state” slogans. “Subsequently, police personnel, with the help of officers present on the scene, fired tear gas at the participants to prevent them from damaging property,” he said. Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar had taken strict notice of Sunday’s incident and ordered immediate action against those involved. South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn on Sunday that law enforcers had asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”. “They allegedly pelted stones at the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he had said, adding that this prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them.

      "summary_orig": "• Think tank says the narrative attempts to justify unilateral strikes • Terms Western belief in India as a counter to China flawed ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad-based think tank on Sunday warned that India’s “ new normal ” military doctrine is a destabilising force in nuclear-armed South Asia, saying New Delhi’s posture risks triggering a serious escalation in any future crisis. The assessment from the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) came during a dialogue with Australian scholars and officials, the research institute said in a media statement. Delegates from CISS argued that India’s narrative of a “New Normal” aims to normalise escalatory actions and justify unilateral military strikes under the guise of counterterrorism. The security doctrine, central to India’s policy since 2019 and reasserted this year, signals a shift toward conventional military responses such as Operation Sindoor to alleged cross-border attacks, the think tank said. The approach indicates India will not be constrained by Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent, a stance that directly challenges the region’s long-standing nuclear balance, according to the CISS assessment. Risk of miscalculation “Institutionalising assured military retaliation in a nuclearised region is inherently destabilising,” the CISS mentioned. The think tank argued that by leveraging its conventional military advantage for limited war strategies, New Delhi raises the risk of miscalculation. Pakistani scholars at the dialogue questioned India’s logic of blaming Pakistan for every violent incident while facing more than two dozen separatist and insurgent movements on its own territory. Using such claims as a pretext for military strikes undermines crisis stability, they maintained. The delegation said Pakistan’s true new normal “Full Spectrum Deterrence” continues to restrain India. They noted that Pakistan wou­ld be prepared to deliver a “Quid Pro Quo Plus” response to any future Indian military action, as it did during a confrontation in May 2025. CISS also contended that Western support for India’s military modernisation is based on a flawed assumption that New Delhi will serve mainly as a counterweight to China. The think tank argued India’s enh­anced capabilities remain largely directed toward Pakistan. Australian experts, in turn, outli­ned their country’s rationale for joi­ning alliances like AUKUS and the Quad. The Australian delegation stressed that AUKUS is a trilateral partnership and there are no plans for expansion. While policy debates occasionally reference possible future members such as Norway, South Korea, Can­ada or India, they said such prospects remain limited. They also emphasised that the alliance adheres to nonproliferation standards fully aligned with IAEA safeguards. Participants included Justin Burke of the Australian National Uni­versity’s National Security Col­lege; Mike Hughes of the Aust­r­alian Strategic Policy Institute; officials from the Australian High Com­m­i­ssion in Islamabad; and CISS Exe­cutive Director Ali Sarwar Naqvi.
