      "summary_orig": "The chief of South Korea's nuclear safety watchdog on Friday visited the Wolsong nuclear power plant in the southeastern city of Gyeongju to check its safety readiness ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. Choi Won-ho, chair of the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, visited the plant in Gyeongju, 330 kilometers southeast of Seoul, as the historic city is set to host the APEC summit from Oct. 31 to Nov. 1. During the visit, Choi was briefed on the plant's readiness against illegal drones and unidentified vessels. \"As terrorist attacks against nuclear plants can lead to serious radiation accidents, it is important to maintain a strong defense posture,\" Choi said during the visit, urging related organizations, including Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., to maintain a robust security system. The APEC summit is expected to bring together nearly 20,000 participants from across the region, including the heads of state and some 3,500 other government delegates from the 21 APEC member economies.",

      "summary_orig": "The National Assembly is set to vote Friday on a government reorganization bill fiercely protested by the main opposition party following an end to its filibuster. The revision to the Government Organization Act, the first of its kind under the Lee Jae Myung administration, centers on abolishing the prosecution office and establishing two new agencies to take on its investigative and indictment powers. It also calls for stripping the Ministry of Economy and Finance of its budget planning role and setting up an office for budget management under the prime minister's office, transferring the industry ministry's oversight of energy policy to the environment ministry, and renaming the environment ministry to the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment. The main opposition People Power Party has opposed the bill, saying it is being pushed hastily without sufficient debate.

      "summary_orig": "A day after commotion and chaos at the Sindh High Court (SHC) during a hearing of seven petitions challenging the cancellation of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s law degree, a written order of the court was released on Friday, stating that the SHC could “not be held hostage to the whims/ wishes of the advocates as to the manner in which the petitions shall be heard”. The order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , also said that the seven petitions had been dismissed over non-prosecution. It also mentioned that it was for the court to determine how to regulate its proceedings and “it cannot be dictated to by the advocates”. Yesterday, commotion was witnessed at the SHC after a two-judge  constitutional bench, comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, dec­lined to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea\nto become a party in proceedings on the seven petitions. The bench set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions. Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first. The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many shouting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges. The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea. In its order released today, the SHC bench recalled that when Advocate Ebrahim Saifuddin was called from among the petitioners’ lawyers for arguments on maintainability, he declined to present his arguments. “According to him this court was required to first decide the preliminary objections raised by Salahuddin Ahmed and Faisal Siddiqui.” The order also referred to Advocate Saifuddin with regards to another petition, mentioning that when he was directed to present arguments on the maintainability of the plea, he left the courtroom. Similarly, the bench observed, when Advocate Siddiqui was called to address the court on the question of maintainability, he argued that objections regarding the jurisdiction of the court should be decided first. “When his request was declined by the bench, he left the courtroom stating that he would not proceed any further.” About Advocate Salahuddin Ahmed, the order stated that upon being called for arguments on the issue of maintainability, the lawyer insisted that objections he had raised regarding an earlier order dated September 22 be decided first. Advocate Ahmed, too, refused to address the matter of maintainability and left the court, the order added. Regarding other pleas, the bench noted that the counsels for the petitioners were not present at the time and might have left the court room. On these grounds, the court dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution. The order stated that the counsels were given the opportunity to be heard and address the maintainability of the pleas, which they “deliberately” did not avail. In its order, the court also touched upon the dismissal of Justice Jahangiri’s application to become a party in the proceedings on pleas against the cancellation of his degree. Justice Jahangiri, “with the permission of the court, addressed this court with dignity and patience, however not on the point of any petition or listed application, which, if any, are accordingly dismissed for non-prosecution as he also left the courtroom despite being given an opportunity of being heard on any petition or listed application”. “The petitioners and the intervener (Justice Jahangiri) have wilfully refused to pursue this matter and walked out during the hearing when asked to argue on the maintainability of these petitions. The reasons are obvious, demonstrating a deliberate lack of interest and constituting a gross abuse of the process of the court,” the order read. It further stated that superior courts had the “inherent power” to dismiss constitutional petitions for non-prosecution or default to regulate proceedings under Article 199 of the Constitution — which defines the jurisdiction of a high court — in cases where “a persistent lack of diligence justifies [the] dismissal”. Regarding yesterday’s proceedings, the order further stated that the lawyers “began raising slogans against the judiciary and completely disrupted the decorum of the court. Such conduct is highly unbecoming and not expected from senior members of the legal profession. Prima facie, such conduct amounts to contempt of court”. However, it continued, “by way of indulgence and by showing maximum judicial restraint, we have decided to refrain ourselves from issuing any such notices”. The order also explained that objections raised by Advocates Ahmed and Siddiqui largely pertained to a court order dated September 22. “It was a judicial order that was still in the field,” the court observed, adding that the appropriate course for the lawyers would have been to approach the Supreme Court. Addressing objections regarding the “bias of the bench”, the court stated that “it is well settled now that whether a judge recuses or not is his decision based on his conscience. Neither of us were of the view that any ground for recusal was made out”. Referring back to the “rumpus” during the proceedings, the court directed the registrar to preserve all CCTV recordings and any audio recording of inside and outside the courtroom from September 25. Filing of the petitions The case pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s degree centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations. The seven petitions that have been dismissed were filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU’s decision, restraining the university from taking coercive measures. The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority. The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order.",

The seven petitions that have been dismissed were filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU’s decision, restraining the university from taking coercive measures. The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority. The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order.",

      "summary": "A day after commotion and chaos at the Sindh High Court (SHC) during a hearing of seven petitions challenging the cancellation of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s law degree, a written order of the court was released on Friday, stating that the SHC could “not be held hostage to the whims/ wishes of the advocates as to the manner in which the petitions shall be heard”. The order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , also said that the seven petitions had been dismissed over non-prosecution. It also mentioned that it was for the court to determine how to regulate its proceedings and “it cannot be dictated to by the advocates”. Yesterday, commotion was witnessed at the SHC after a two-judge  constitutional bench, comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, dec­lined to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea\nto become a party in proceedings on the seven petitions. The bench set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions. Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first. The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many shouting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges. The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea. In its order released today, the SHC bench recalled that when Advocate Ebrahim Saifuddin was called from among the petitioners’ lawyers for arguments on maintainability, he declined to present his arguments. “According to him this court was required to first decide the preliminary objections raised by Salahuddin Ahmed and Faisal Siddiqui.” The order also referred to Advocate Saifuddin with regards to another petition, mentioning that when he was directed to present arguments on the maintainability of the plea, he left the courtroom. Similarly, the bench observed, when Advocate Siddiqui was called to address the court on the question of maintainability, he argued that objections regarding the jurisdiction of the court should be decided first. “When his request was declined by the bench, he left the courtroom stating that he would not proceed any further.” About Advocate Salahuddin Ahmed, the order stated that upon being called for arguments on the issue of maintainability, the lawyer insisted that objections he had raised regarding an earlier order dated September 22 be decided first. Advocate Ahmed, too, refused to address the matter of maintainability and left the court, the order added. Regarding other pleas, the bench noted that the counsels for the petitioners were not present at the time and might have left the court room. On these grounds, the court dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution. The order stated that the counsels were given the opportunity to be heard and address the maintainability of the pleas, which they “deliberately” did not avail. In its order, the court also touched upon the dismissal of Justice Jahangiri’s application to become a party in the proceedings on pleas against the cancellation of his degree. Justice Jahangiri, “with the permission of the court, addressed this court with dignity and patience, however not on the point of any petition or listed application, which, if any, are accordingly dismissed for non-prosecution as he also left the courtroom despite being given an opportunity of being heard on any petition or listed application”. “The petitioners and the intervener (Justice Jahangiri) have wilfully refused to pursue this matter and walked out during the hearing when asked to argue on the maintainability of these petitions. The reasons are obvious, demonstrating a deliberate lack of interest and constituting a gross abuse of the process of the court,” the order read. It further stated that superior courts had the “inherent power” to dismiss constitutional petitions for non-prosecution or default to regulate proceedings under Article 199 of the Constitution — which defines the jurisdiction of a high court — in cases where “a persistent lack of diligence justifies [the] dismissal”. Regarding yesterday’s proceedings, the order further stated that the lawyers “began raising slogans against the judiciary and completely disrupted the decorum of the court. Such conduct is highly unbecoming and not expected from senior members of the legal profession. Prima facie, such conduct amounts to contempt of court”. However, it continued, “by way of indulgence and by showing maximum judicial restraint, we have decided to refrain ourselves from issuing any such notices”. The order also explained that objections raised by Advocates Ahmed and Siddiqui largely pertained to a court order dated September 22. “It was a judicial order that was still in the field,” the court observed, adding that the appropriate course for the lawyers would have been to approach the Supreme Court. Addressing objections regarding the “bias of the bench”, the court stated that “it is well settled now that whether a judge recuses or not is his decision based on his conscience. Neither of us were of the view that any ground for recusal was made out”. Referring back to the “rumpus” during the proceedings, the court directed the registrar to preserve all CCTV recordings and any audio recording of inside and outside the courtroom from September 25. Filing of the petitions The case pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s degree centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations.

      "summary_orig": "An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Friday refused to extend the physical remand of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers, according to the group’s lawyer. Advocate Israr Jatak, a member of BYC’s legal team, told Dawn.com , “Quetta ATC-1 refused to extend the physical remand of five accused, namely Mahrang, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Beberg Baloch and Gulzadi and ordered them to be sent to jail on judicial remand.” In a hearing presided over by Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) produced Mahrang and others in court today after the completion of their 15-day physical remand granted on September 11. Advocate Shoaib Mengal, along with Advocate Jatak, appeared in the court on behalf of the accused. The CTD requested the court for an extension to the physical remand of the accused, but Judge Mubeen refused, asking for the accused to be handed over to jail custody. On September 11, a Quetta ATC judge extended the physical remand of Dr Mahrang and other organisers of the group on the police’s request. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.  Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. She was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April. After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order , extending their imprisonment by another 15 days. Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.",

      "summary_orig": "FOR all the talk about their apparent mediocrity after their twin thrashings against India in the Asia Cup, Pakistan have at least upheld the status of being the second best team in the continent. The status was sealed on Thursday, when Pakistan edged Bangladesh by 11 runs in a tense, low-scoring Super Four encounter. The win meant Pakistan have beaten all their opponents in the campaign apart from India, and that the archrivals will meet for the third time in three weeks in the Asia Cup final — the first between the two side’s in the tournament’s 17-edition history. To make it to the title clash, Pakistan needed to get past defending champions Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and the national side did that in the space of three days. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan had come into Thursday’s encounter on the back of their respective wins against Sri Lanka. The contest, therefore, was finely poised before Pakistan flexed their muscle, however, in bits and pieces in what was a show of poor batting throughout the 40 overs. Shaheen, Haris in the groove Batting may still remain a headache for Pakistan, but what must be pumping the team’s dugout up is how the fast bowlers have come into their element at just the right time in the tournament. While Shaheen — who looked better with the bat than ball at the start of the tournament — picked up his bowling rhythm from Tuesday’s win against Sri Lanka (3-28), Haris, returned from the bench, to fire 2-26 in Sunday’s six-wicket loss to India. Both combined against Bangladesh to deliver six scalps, putting up on display a classic, trademark Pakistan pace bowling show. After Shaheen dismantled Bangladesh’s powerplay, Haris arrived later on to finish the job, and made impact with the wicket of Saif Hassan, Bangladesh’s most dangerous batter in the tournament. There was calculated aggression on display from the duo, who mixed up hitting hard lengths with searing yorkers and deceptive slower ones to shine in the wickets columns and given their form, Shaheen and Haris could show up as box office items in the final. Batting Weaknesses persist Although Pakistan were clinical with the ball, they struggled big time with the bat, regardless that it was a tricky surface to play on. It was expected from Pakistan’s top-three to build onto their decent shows against India the last time the side played in Dubai, but both failed miserably against Bangladesh. Sahibzada Farhan seemed in touch when he cracked a backfoot cover drive early on but how he casually drove the next ball into the fielder’s hands was poor decision-making from the right-hander. Fakhar Zaman, meanwhile, looked clueless against the Bangladesh spin attack before departing cheaply. And Saim Ayub added a ninth duck to his T20 career stats trying to pick the wrong delivery up over the infield. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s poor run in the Asia Cup continued as his credentials as a T20 batter were questioned once again, while Hussain Talat was also dismissed on a loose delivery. Lower-order flourish Had it not been a lower-order flourish, ignited by Shaheen’s 13 off 19 — which included two massive sixes — and marshalled by Mohammad Haris, who stuck around to add a 23-ball 31 before Mohammad Nawaz smashed 25 off 15 (a four and two sixes), Pakistan wouldn’t have been able to cross even the 100-mark. The effort deep into the innings, infact, saw Pakistan add 80 off the last eight over after having reeling at 49-5 by the end of the 11th over. Despite the top-ordee failure, the lower-order’s utility came in handy for Pakistan, which is a huge confidence-boostimg point ahead of a clash which would require heaps of it. Bangladesh were poor too Bangladesh, for their part, were ordinary. Chasing 136, they never found rhythm. Regular wickets crippled their response, with Shamim Hossain’s 30 the only notable resistance. Saif Hassan briefly threatened before Haris accounted for him, and the rest folded without offering a fight. Crucially, Bangladesh also let Pakistan off the hook in the field, spilling chances that could have swung momentum. In a game decided by slim margins, such sloppiness proved costly. Pakistan’s spinners also deserve credit for applying the brakes. Saim Ayub’s tidy spell of 2-16 kept Bangladesh on the leash, while Nawaz bowled with control to choke the middle overs. It was the kind of collective effort that ensured the pace bowlers’ early breakthroughs did not go to waste. For Bangladesh, the failure to chase down a modest target underlines a gulf in execution. For Pakistan, the win reinforces the formula that has carried them so far: pace potency, lower-order grit and just enough from the rest. But against India in a final, where mistakes are punished ruthlessly, more will be needed.

      "summary_orig": "• Two-judge bench declines Justice Jahangiri’s plea to join proceedings • Insists court will first hear and decide maintainability of petitions • Petitioners and their lawyers walk out of courtroom, stage protest KARACHI: Heated sce­nes were witnessed at the Sindh High Court on Thursday as a two-judge bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Islamabad High Court Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on seven petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree. The two-judge constitutional bench (CB) comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, however, set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions before it. Justice Jahangiri, accompanied by IHC Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, pleaded for a right of hearing, saying he was the aggrieved party and Karachi University (KU) had not issued him a notice before canceling his degree. Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first. The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many chanting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges. The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea. Some lawyers later claimed that the bench had dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution, though the written order is expected to be issued today (Friday). The petitions had been filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that canceled Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU decisions, restraining the university from taking coercive measures. The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority. The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order. Justice Jahangiri also appeared in person, filing an application to intervene in the proceedings. However, Justice Agha remarked that the court would first examine the issue of maintainability. Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, representing a petitioner, questioned how the issue could be decided without hearing the aggrieved person. Justice Jahangiri introduced himself at the rostrum and reiterated that, as the affected party, he had a fundamental right to be heard. Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed pointed out that Justice Memon was also part of a division bench that, in September last year, had suspended KU’s cancellation order. He added that the matter had originally been fixed before another constitutional bench headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed for Sept 30, but was later transferred without explanation to the present bench. He argued that the matter should return to CB-II, as transfers of cases are the domain of a three-judge committee, and questioned how a constitutional bench could override an administrative order. Advocate Siddiqui also argued that the case should be heard by a regular bench rather than a constitutional bench. The petitioners’ lawyers further questioned the SHEC’s urgent application, arguing that the commission itself had admitted it had no role in the matter and should be removed as a respondent. They expressed surprise that the SHEC was now seeking an urgent hearing. Justice Jahangiri told the bench that he had always upheld his oath as a high court judge, testifying that his degree was genuine. “I did not act as a puppet, nor did I make decisions at the behest of any sector commander,” he asserted. The IHC judge, recently barred from exercising judicial powers by an IHC division bench, asked the SHC to grant him the right of hearing. The petitioners and their lawyers, however, left after the bench maintained it would decide maintainability first. Later, speaking to the media, Barrister Ahmed demanded that the bench recuse itself, voicing strong resentment over the transfer of the case, the conduct of the hearing and the court’s refusal to hear the aggrieved judge. In a pointed remark aimed at the ruling PPP, he said: “The Sindh High Court should remain a court of law and not turn into a ‘People’s High Court’.” Published in Dawn, September 26th, 2025",
