      "summary_orig": "• Sessions court grants pre-arrest bail to PTI founder in six cases and to Bushra Bibi in one case • ATC declares 30 PTI workers proclaimed offenders in Nov 26 protest cases ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Tuesday sought final arguments on an application seeking the closure of the X (formerly Twitter) account of the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan. Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir heard the matter. Advocate Muhammad Ali Bukhari appeared on behalf of the PTI founder, while Barrister Zafarullah Khan represented the petitioner. Advocate General Islamabad Ayaz Shaukat also appeared before the court. At the outset of the hearing, Mr Bukhari informed the court that PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja could not appear due to ill health. He stated that the court had earlier directed that a meeting be arranged with the PTI founder in jail; however, he complained that jail authorities had not facilitated the meeting. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority lawyer told the court that a report had already been submitted in the case. Justice Tahir asked Barrister Zafarullah what relief the petitioner was seeking. The petitioner’s counsel responded that they were ready to advance arguments and requested that copies of replies be provided to the other side. Mr Bukhari contended that neither the PTI founder nor the party had received the reply. He requested time to first meet the PTI founder in jail before submitting a formal response. The court asked whether PTI intended to file a reply in the matter. Justice Tahir observed that the party was also a respondent and needed to clarify its position. After brief exchanges, the court adjourned the hearing until the first week of May and sought final arguments from the parties. Pre-arrest bails In a separate development, the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka approved pre-arrest bail applications of the PTI founder in six cases, and of Bushra Bibi in one case. During the hearing, prosecutors Raja Naveed Hussain Kiani, Mazhar Bashir and Assistant Inspector General (Legal) Tahir Kazim appeared on behalf of the state, while Barrister Salman Safdar represented the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi. Barrister Safdar argued that the delay in deciding the bail applications was unprecedented in his legal career. He said that 63 adjournments had been granted to the state. On 30 occasions, the court had directed jail authorities to produce the accused, but compliance was not ensured. He added that five show-cause notices had been issued to the jail superintendent. The prosecution opposed the bail pleas, arguing that there was solid evidence against the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi and that they were not entitled to relief. During proceedings, the court asked whether the receipt related to the Toshakhana case had been recovered. The prosecution replied in the negative. Judge Majoka further questioned whether the allegedly fake receipts shown in the media had been sent for forensic examination. After completion of arguments, the court granted pre-arrest bail against surety bonds of Rs50,000 each. Meanwhile, an Anti-Terrorism Court declared 30 PTI workers as proclaimed offenders (POs) in cases registered at Khanna police station in connection with the November 26 protest. At the previous hearing, proceedings had been initiated against 31 workers. However, after one PTI worker appeared before the court, proclamation proceedings against him were terminated.

      "summary_orig": "• Independent research agency claims 15 Palestinian aid workers were killed ‘execution-style’ • Forensic findings, satellite imagery reveal bulldozers crushed, buried emergency vehicles along with victims; earth berms were constructed to hide massacre ISRAELI soldiers fired more than 900 bullets at a convoy of clearly marked Palestinian emergency vehicles in Gaza before advancing to kill the surviving aid workers, some of whom were shot “execution-style” at close range, in March last year, a new joint investigation has revealed. According to Al Jazeera , the report released on Monday by independent research agency Forensic Architecture and audio investigation group Earshot offers the most detailed reconstruction to date of the massacre in Tal as-Sultan, a neighbourhood west of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, on March 23, 2025. Fifteen aid workers were killed in the attack, including paramedics from the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), firefighters from the Palestinian Civil Defence (PCD) and a staff member of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). The slain aid workers were then buried along with their vehicles. The Israeli military first called the vehicles “uncoordinated” and later a “professional error,” but forensic analysis indicates a coordinated ambush with no return fire, aimed at killing survivors. Science of the massacre The investigation uses “situated testimony” and audio ballistics to determine the gunfire’s distance, weapon type, and direction. Investigators analysed footage recovered from the phone of slain paramedic Rifaat Radwan, a PRCS paramedic who began recording at 5:09am, when the ambush began. In a video lasting five and a half minutes, at least 844 gunshots were recorded. Combined with other recordings, the total documented count reached at least 910 gunshots. In the video from one of the last ambulances, Radwan is heard asking his mother for forgiveness and reciting the shahada before dying. According to Earshot’s analysis, 93 per cent of these shots featured a specific acoustic signature: a “supersonic shockwave”, followed by a muzzle blast. This combination confirms that the camera — and the aid workers huddled around it — were directly in the line of fire. “The density of gunfire … frequently exceeds 900 rounds per minute,” the report states, noting that, at one point, five shots were fired in just 67 milliseconds. This rate of fire confirms that at least five shooters, likely many more, were firing simultaneously from an elevated sandbank approximately 40 metres away. “Israeli soldiers ambushed and subjected Palestinian aid workers to continuous assault by gunfire for over two hours”, between 5:09am and 7:13am, the report says. From ambush to execution The report challenges the Israeli narrative of a chaotic “combat zone”. Instead, it describes a methodical massacre of Palestinian aid workers on their way to help people injured in Israeli strikes. The report states there was no exchange of fire or immediate threat to the soldiers, contradicting claims that the incident occurred in a “hostile and dangerous combat zone.” By analysing the time delay between the sound of the gunshots and their echoes bouncing off a nearby concrete wall, investigators tracked the movement of the soldiers. For the first four minutes, the soldiers remained positioned on a sandbank before advancing about 50 metres downhill toward the convoy while continuing to fire, according to audio analysis. This corroborates the testimony of survivor Assaad al-Nassasra, a PRCS worker, who told investigators: “They were walking between [the aid workers] and shooting.” The most chilling finding relates to the attack’s final moments, as a phone call by paramedic Ashraf Abu Libda reportedly captured soldiers arriving at the vehicles. The audio analysis identifies specific gunshots where the distinct “supersonic crack” of the bullet disappears, leaving only the muzzle blast. Ballistically, this indicates the shooter was within 1-4 metres (3-13 feet) of the victim. The shots coincide with Abu Libda’s final sounds of movement, suggesting he was shot while lying on the ground. Hiding the evidence The report alleges that Israeli forces attempted to conceal the massacre by deploying bulldozers to the site, crushing and burying emergency vehicles, and constructing earth berms to block visibility, according to satellite imagery from that morning. The forensic findings match satellite images obtained by Al Jazeera’s Sanad unit, which reported on March 30, 2025, that at least five rescue vehicles were completely destroyed and buried in sand by Israeli forces on al-Muharrarat Street, the site of the massacre.

      "summary_orig": "US AIR Force tanker aircraft are lined up at Ben Gurion airport, near Tel Aviv.—Reuters • CSIS report terms current convergence of US military hardware largest since 2003 Iraq war, but smaller than 1991’s ‘Desert Storm’ • Ahead of Geneva talks, Iran says it is ready to take any steps towards a nuclear deal WASHINGTON: As the world’s largest aircraft carrier sails to join a massive military build-up in the Middle East, a new study reveals that the deployment looks to be structured for “limited action” rather than a “large-scale war”. The assessment comes as US President Donald Trump’s reported consideration of a short, coercive strike to pressure Tehran into accepting his demands has triggered intense debate in Washington and beyond over the likelihood of conflict, the definition of objectives, and the danger of a wider regional war. In the meantime, oil prices are hovering near seven-month highs, with traders assessing risks to supply from any military escalation as another round of US-Iran nuclear talks looms. Ahead of Thursday’s planned nuclear talks between Iran and the US, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday that his country was ready to take any necessary steps to reach a deal with the United States. The talks are set to take place on Thursday in Geneva. We are ready to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen. We will enter the negotiating room in Geneva with complete honesty and good faith,” Takht-Ravanchi said in comments carried by state media. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary. “If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans… A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added. Trump confident US can easily beat Iran President Donald Trump on Monday denied reports that the top US military officer had flagged the risks of a major operation against Iran, saying Washington would “easily” beat Tehran in any war. US media reported that General Dan Caine, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had warned of various risks associated with strikes against Iran including a long-term entanglement. But Trump said on his Truth Social network that it was “100 percent incorrect” that Caine was “against us going to war with Iran.” “General Caine, like all of us, would like not to see War but, if a decision is made on going against Iran at a Military level, it is his opinion that it will be something easily won,” Trump wrote. “He has not spoken of not doing Iran, or even the fake limited strikes that I have been reading about, he only knows one thing, how to WIN and, if he is told to do so, he will be leading the pack.” The US president, however, accused the media outlets of writing “incorrectly, and purposefully so.” “I am the one that makes the decision, I would rather have a Deal than not but, if we don’t make a Deal, it will be a very bad day for that Country and, very sadly, its people,” Trump added. In response to a separate report in The New York Times suggesting that Trump is weighing a near-term limited strike — with the possibility of a broader campaign later — Middle Eastern scholar Vali Nasr wrote: “Trump is signaling Iranians via New York Times. He is trying to force a deal by threatening war.” Nasr cautioned that continued pressure, even after a deal, could push Tehran toward confrontation, quoting Middle East analyst Ali Hashem as saying: “Washington assumes military pressure buys diplomatic leverage. Tehran sees a challenge to ideological survival.” Build-up The USS Gerald R. Ford, meanwhile, has reached the US naval base of Souda Bay on Crete, en route to the Persian Gulf. US Naval Support Activity Souda Bay is home to approximately 1,000 people, including active duty military, US civilian employees, local national employees, contractors, and family members. Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers and three littoral combat ships. It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers — which carry dozens of warplanes and are crewed by thousands of sailors — in the Middle East. However, a recent study by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) provides a detailed picture of what current US deployments can and cannot do. It notes that the naval “armada” in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean is the largest US maritime presence in the region since five carrier strike groups were assembled at the start of the 2003 Iraq war. The force is sufficient for targeted strikes and for defending US allies and partners. However, it lacks Marine units, special operations forces for raids or ground missions, and the logistics required for a prolonged air campaign. The study also stresses that the current deployment is far smaller than the forces used in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the US conducted major combat operations and regime change. A surge in cargo aircraft and aerial refueling tankers does not indicate the movement of ground combat units, the report says, making scenarios such as capturing or killing Iran’s leadership unrealistic — particularly given the distance from likely launch points to Tehran. The available force package is also deemed insufficient for regime change, and the report argues that even a decapitation strike would be unlikely to destabilise Iran’s political system, which has shown resilience under pressure. For a sustained, multi-week air campaign, CSIS concludes, Washington would need a much larger logistical buildup that would take additional time. Published in Dawn, February 25th, 2026",

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary. “If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans… A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added. Trump confident US can easily beat Iran President Donald Trump on Monday denied reports that the top US military officer had flagged the risks of a major operation against Iran, saying Washington would “easily” beat Tehran in any war. US media reported that General Dan Caine, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had warned of various risks associated with strikes against Iran including a long-term entanglement. But Trump said on his Truth Social network that it was “100 percent incorrect” that Caine was “against us going to war with Iran.” “General Caine, like all of us, would like not to see War but, if a decision is made on going against Iran at a Military level, it is his opinion that it will be something easily won,” Trump wrote. “He has not spoken of not doing Iran, or even the fake limited strikes that I have been reading about, he only knows one thing, how to WIN and, if he is told to do so, he will be leading the pack.” The US president, however, accused the media outlets of writing “incorrectly, and purposefully so.” “I am the one that makes the decision, I would rather have a Deal than not but, if we don’t make a Deal, it will be a very bad day for that Country and, very sadly, its people,” Trump added. In response to a separate report in The New York Times suggesting that Trump is weighing a near-term limited strike — with the possibility of a broader campaign later — Middle Eastern scholar Vali Nasr wrote: “Trump is signaling Iranians via New York Times. He is trying to force a deal by threatening war.” Nasr cautioned that continued pressure, even after a deal, could push Tehran toward confrontation, quoting Middle East analyst Ali Hashem as saying: “Washington assumes military pressure buys diplomatic leverage. Tehran sees a challenge to ideological survival.” Build-up The USS Gerald R. Ford, meanwhile, has reached the US naval base of Souda Bay on Crete, en route to the Persian Gulf. US Naval Support Activity Souda Bay is home to approximately 1,000 people, including active duty military, US civilian employees, local national employees, contractors, and family members. Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers and three littoral combat ships. It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers — which carry dozens of warplanes and are crewed by thousands of sailors — in the Middle East. However, a recent study by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) provides a detailed picture of what current US deployments can and cannot do. It notes that the naval “armada” in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean is the largest US maritime presence in the region since five carrier strike groups were assembled at the start of the 2003 Iraq war. The force is sufficient for targeted strikes and for defending US allies and partners. However, it lacks Marine units, special operations forces for raids or ground missions, and the logistics required for a prolonged air campaign. The study also stresses that the current deployment is far smaller than the forces used in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the US conducted major combat operations and regime change. A surge in cargo aircraft and aerial refueling tankers does not indicate the movement of ground combat units, the report says, making scenarios such as capturing or killing Iran’s leadership unrealistic — particularly given the distance from likely launch points to Tehran. The available force package is also deemed insufficient for regime change, and the report argues that even a decapitation strike would be unlikely to destabilise Iran’s political system, which has shown resilience under pressure. For a sustained, multi-week air campaign, CSIS concludes, Washington would need a much larger logistical buildup that would take additional time. Published in Dawn, February 25th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "EVERY body part is important, but few are as important as an eye. I use the singular for a body part that comes in pairs because its function is so crucial that one outweighs the combined functions of many others. Even diminished sight is so essential that ‘in the land of the blind, one-eyed man is king’ has become an idiom. Its vernacular version goes something like ‘andhon mein kana raja’ (‘among the blind, the one-eyed rules’). In an old interview, one of Imran Khan’s sisters reminisced that even as a child he likened himself to a tiger. It’s a coincidence that a very charismatic Indian cricketer of the 1960s and 1970s, Nawab Mansoor Pataudi, was nicknamed Tiger Pataudi. He was a stylish right-handed batsman and considered the best fielder of his day, despite losing vision in his right eye in a traffic accident. He was named captain of the national team at the age of 21. Gen Amir Abdullah Niazi, who surrendered during the 1971 war, also styled himself as ‘Tiger Niazi’. Though his sight was not impaired, he was handicapped in vision and character. Some physical features are stereotyped in history as characteristics; some archetypes are restricted to a geographical region, while others have universal appeal. For instance, what would a pirate be without an eyepatch? In modern times, the look became notorious when Israeli Gen Moshe Dayan wore an eyepatch. Salman Rushdie lost an eye to a knife attack and uses a dark lens on that side of his spectacles. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the famous Sikh ruler who extended Punjab’s borders to Kashmir and the Khyber Pass, did not cover his bad eye. In his early years, he may have been conscious of it, leading to his profile portraits which show only the good eye. Later in life, he wore his disability with aplomb and turned it to his advantage, asserting, “I look at all my subjects with one eye.” Some physical features are stereotyped in history. In the olden days, disabilities were described by their attributes, as in the Central Asian tyrant Temur’s name, ‘Lang’, which refers to the limp he walked with. In the Western canon, ‘lame’ became ‘lane’; Tamerlane is the distorted version of Temur-lang. It is another matter, though, that his brutal ways could have earned him the epitaph ‘Temur-out-of-lane’. There was a time when cinegoers were enticed by vernacular translations of English titles. A blockbuster martial arts movie One-Armed Boxer was translated as Tunda Badmash in Pakistan. Etymology, an utterly fascinating field, does not always make it entirely clear how a particular word or term develops. For instance, in colloquial Urdu, making someone an accomplice to keep them in check is referred to as ‘ kana karna ’ (blinding someone in one eye). Another proverb in this vein is ‘ kana mujhey bhai nahin; kaney bina suhaey nahin ’. It roughly translates to ‘cannot live with them, and without them.’ Its applicability in the current political context cannot be denied. In the game of thrones, especially in South Asia, succession politics included blinding the heir apparent or a pretender by gouging out their eyes. This barbaric practice of rendering the opponent unfit to rule in the rough-and-tumble of dynastic politics and the battlefield demands of physical fitness is generally thought to be a male preserve; however, mothers and even grandmothers are known to have resorted to this. Allama Iqbal, in his poem ‘ Ghulam Qadir Rohilla ’, depicts the revenge the Afghan chieftain exacted against the Mughal king Shah Alam II — gouging out his eyes and ordering the women of the royal household to dance in court to entertain the victor. The Rohilla was captured from the battlefield as an eight-year-old boy when the uprising by his father Zabita Khan, an erstwhile army chief of Shah Alam, was crushed. The boy was raised in the royal household and was purportedly castrated. He was returned to his father as a youth after a patch-up with the Mughal ruler. After the elder Rohilla’s death, Ghulam Qadir attacked Delhi and exacted his revenge on the king. As he retreated, he was pursued and captured by the Maratha. Shah Alam II was restored to the throne. He demanded that the Maratha leader, Mahadaji Shinde, send him the Rohilla’s eyes, who obliged. The first line of Iqbal’s poem goes, ‘Rohilla kis qadar zalim, jafaju, keena parwar tha …’ (how brutal, unjust, and begrudging was the Rohilla…). One hopes that an eye-for-an-eye vendetta stops. As for the pirates, they didn’t always wear an eyepatch because of injury; it gave them a tactical advantage in combat. The human eye takes time to adapt between bright light and pitch darkness. Moving between the mayhem on the upper and lower decks of ships, all they had to do was to switch the patch and strike. The writer is a poet. His latest publication is a collection of satire essays titled Rindana. shahzadsharjeel1@gmail.com Published in Dawn, February 24th, 2026",

Etymology, an utterly fascinating field, does not always make it entirely clear how a particular word or term develops. For instance, in colloquial Urdu, making someone an accomplice to keep them in check is referred to as ‘ kana karna ’ (blinding someone in one eye).

It roughly translates to ‘cannot live with them, and without them.’ Its applicability in the current political context cannot be denied.

This barbaric practice of rendering the opponent unfit to rule in the rough-and-tumble of dynastic politics and the battlefield demands of physical fitness is generally thought to be a male preserve; however, mothers and even grandmothers are known to have resorted to this. Allama Iqbal, in his poem ‘ Ghulam Qadir Rohilla ’, depicts the revenge the Afghan chieftain exacted against the Mughal king Shah Alam II — gouging out his eyes and ordering the women of the royal household to dance in court to entertain the victor. The Rohilla was captured from the battlefield as an eight-year-old boy when the uprising by his father Zabita Khan, an erstwhile army chief of Shah Alam, was crushed. The boy was raised in the royal household and was purportedly castrated. He was returned to his father as a youth after a patch-up with the Mughal ruler. After the elder Rohilla’s death, Ghulam Qadir attacked Delhi and exacted his revenge on the king. As he retreated, he was pursued and captured by the Maratha. Shah Alam II was restored to the throne. He demanded that the Maratha leader, Mahadaji Shinde, send him the Rohilla’s eyes, who obliged. The first line of Iqbal’s poem goes, ‘Rohilla kis qadar zalim, jafaju, keena parwar tha …’ (how brutal, unjust, and begrudging was the Rohilla…). One hopes that an eye-for-an-eye vendetta stops. As for the pirates, they didn’t always wear an eyepatch because of injury; it gave them a tactical advantage in combat. The human eye takes time to adapt between bright light and pitch darkness.

      "title": "Eye for an eye",
      "summary": "EVERY body part is important, but few are as important as an eye. I use the singular for a body part that comes in pairs because its function is so crucial that one outweighs the combined functions of many others. Even diminished sight is so essential that ‘in the land of the blind, one-eyed man is king’ has become an idiom. Its vernacular version goes something like ‘andhon mein kana raja’ (‘among the blind, the one-eyed rules’). In an old interview, one of Imran Khan’s sisters reminisced that even as a child he likened himself to a tiger. It’s a coincidence that a very charismatic Indian cricketer of the 1960s and 1970s, Nawab Mansoor Pataudi, was nicknamed Tiger Pataudi. He was a stylish right-handed batsman and considered the best fielder of his day, despite losing vision in his right eye in a traffic accident. He was named captain of the national team at the age of 21. Gen Amir Abdullah Niazi, who surrendered during the 1971 war, also styled himself as ‘Tiger Niazi’. Though his sight was not impaired, he was handicapped in vision and character. Some physical features are stereotyped in history as characteristics; some archetypes are restricted to a geographical region, while others have universal appeal. For instance, what would a pirate be without an eyepatch? In modern times, the look became notorious when Israeli Gen Moshe Dayan wore an eyepatch. Salman Rushdie lost an eye to a knife attack and uses a dark lens on that side of his spectacles. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the famous Sikh ruler who extended Punjab’s borders to Kashmir and the Khyber Pass, did not cover his bad eye. In his early years, he may have been conscious of it, leading to his profile portraits which show only the good eye. Later in life, he wore his disability with aplomb and turned it to his advantage, asserting, “I look at all my subjects with one eye.” Some physical features are stereotyped in history. In the olden days, disabilities were described by their attributes, as in the Central Asian tyrant Temur’s name, ‘Lang’, which refers to the limp he walked with. In the Western canon, ‘lame’ became ‘lane’; Tamerlane is the distorted version of Temur-lang. It is another matter, though, that his brutal ways could have earned him the epitaph ‘Temur-out-of-lane’.

Bhakkar District Police Officer (DPO) Shahzad Rafiq told Dawn that a suicide attack was carried out near the Dajil checkpost. He said that two policemen were martyred and one was injured, while three passersby were also injured in the blast. “The suicide attacker came near the check post and blew himself up, while we were conducting a search operation in the area to maintain law and order,” he added. The deceased policemen were identified as Muhammad Faheem and Muhammad Shehbaz, and the injured as Arshad. The identities of the injured passersby have not yet been ascertained. The injured were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital, DPO Rafiq said. In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the terrorist attack. He expressed grief at the deaths of the officials and offered his condolences to the bereaved families. He also prayed for the swift recovery of the police personnel injured in the attack. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep sorrow and grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the attack, Radio Pakistan reported. He said the sacrifices rendered by the police in the war against terrorism would not be allowed to go in vain, and reiterated the government’s resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz strongly condemned the attack on the police checkpost. In a statement, she paid tribute to the martyred policemen and saluted their sacrifice in the line of duty. The chief minister expressed heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the bereaved families. She directed authorities to ensure the best possible medical treatment for the injured policeman and others wounded in the incident. The development comes on the same day six law enforcement personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police, were martyred after a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district. It is worth mentioning that the Dajil checkpost is at the border of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday that a nuclear deal was “within reach”, ahead of talks with the United States scheduled for later this week. “We have a historic opportunity to strike an unprecedented agreement that addresses mutual concerns and achieves mutual interests,” said Araghchi, in a post on the social media site X. He added that a deal was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”. The talks are set to take place on Thursday in Geneva, a senior US official said on Monday, with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner slated to meet with an Iranian delegation for the negotiations. The two countries resumed negotiations earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East. Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked. Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said on Tuesday Iran is ready to take any necessary steps to reach a deal with the US. “We are ready to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We will do whatever it takes to make this happen. We will enter the negotiating room in Geneva with complete honesty and good faith,” Takht-Ravanchi said in comments carried by state media. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s first option was always diplomacy but that he was willing to use lethal force if necessary. A senior Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday that Tehran would seriously consider a combination of sending half of its most highly enriched uranium abroad, diluting the rest and taking part in creating a regional enrichment consortium — an idea periodically raised during years of Iran-linked diplomacy. Iran would do this in return for US recognition of Iran’s right to “peaceful nuclear enrichment” under a deal that would also include lifting economic sanctions, the official said. “If there is an attack or aggression against Iran, we will respond according to our defence plans … A US attack on Iran is a real gamble,” Takht-Ravanchi added. Indirect talks between the two sides last year brought no agreement, primarily due to friction over a US demand that Iran forgo uranium enrichment on its soil, which Washington views as a pathway to a nuclear bomb. Iran has always denied seeking such weapons. The US joined Israel in hitting Iranian nuclear sites last June, with Trump saying its key nuclear sites were “obliterated”.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The security detail provided to former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur has been withdrawn, it emerged on Tuesday. It is worth mentioning that while the security detail from Peshawar was withdrawn, the ex-CM has a police detail from his native Dera Ismail Khan district. It was not immediately clear who ordered the withdrawal of the security from Peshawar, with incumbent chief minister Sohail Afridi’s press secretary denying that orders to this effect were issued. According to the sources, a 16-member security squad assigned to Gandapur was recalled late last night. The contingent comprised two jammer operators, eight gunmen and six drivers, who had been working in shifts. All personnel belonged to the police department. Of them, 14 officials had been deployed for Gandapur’s security, while two were assigned to his brother, MNA Faisal Amin Gandapur. Sources close to the ex-chief minister said that one jammer and one pickup carrier had been returned to the provincial government. The sources said that Gandapur and his brother had personally spoken with the officer who had conveyed KP CM Afridi’s orders to confirm and authenticate the withdrawal of the police escort. In a statement, Gandapur said that at 11pm last night, Afridi’s deputy chief security officer (CSO) called his security personnel, saying that it was the CSO’s order to withdraw the security. “I had one jammer and one double-cabin vehicle provided by the provincial government,” he said, adding, “There were 14 personnel deployed with that vehicle.” “When these personnel informed me, I told them to pack up everything. This is the actual truth,” he said. He stated that even if this security were now restored, he would not accept it. “I want to tell the chief minister that there is no need to return this security to me now. I do not need it,” Gandapur said. Gandapur’s spokesperson, Faraz Ahmed Mughal, insisted that the withdrawal was initiated on the instructions of KP CM Afridi. He said the Chief Minister’s Office contacted the security in-charge and directed that the detail be withdrawn, adding that Gandapur followed the directives within minutes. Meanwhile, in a statement, the KP chief minister’s press secretary said that there was no truth in reports about Gandapur’s security detail being withdrawn by Afridi. “No such decision has been taken, nor have any instructions been issued to the relevant authorities in this regard,” he said. Further, an official at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat clarified that the former CM was asked to return two jammers and the associated personnel, which were required for the use of the incumbent chief minister. “Under the rules, the former chief minister was not entitled to retain the jammers. He was supposed to return the jammers and vehicle”, the official said, insisting that no security detail had been withdrawn from Gandapur. “He continues to retain a police escort,” the official maintained. Gandapur had previously faced multiple security threats, and a hand grenade attack also took place at his residence in the past. Official sources maintained that decisions regarding security deployment and withdrawal were made in accordance with threat assessments and administrative requirements. Political observers said that the development was also significant in the context of the recent differences between Gandapur and CM Afridi.",

      "title_orig": "Afghan Taliban initiated unprovoked firing along Pak-Afghan border: PM’s spokesperson",
      "summary_orig": "Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, said on Tuesday said that the Afghan Taliban regime initiated unprovoked firing along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Torkham and Tirah. In a post on the social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan’s security forces responded immediately and effectively, silencing the Taliban aggression.” He said that any further provocation would be responded to “immediately and severely”. He said Pakistan would “continue to protect its citizens and guard its territorial integrity”. The development comes after Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year. According to an information ministry statement , issued in the early hours of Sunday, the strikes were carried out in res­ponse to a number of terrorist attacks inside Pakistan — such as the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad and a number of attacks in Bannu and Bajaur . “Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers,” it said. The information ministry said that in a retributive response, Pakistan carried out “intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts belonging to Pakistani Taliban [ Fitna al Khw­arij ] and its affiliates, and [Islamic State-Khorasan] at the border region of Pakistan-Afghan border with precision and accuracy”. Fitna al Khwarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “Despite repeated efforts by Pak­istan to urge the Afghan Tali­ban Regime to take verifiable mea­sures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted. Souring relations There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded. Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire. Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast. Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault. Then, on Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district. In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”. “Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij , irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted. On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable. In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR. The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Six law enforcement personnel, including a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), were martyred after a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district on Tuesday. A senior police officer told Dawn that six police personnel — the DSP, an inspector and four constables — were martyred when the vehicle, which was transporting two individuals for a court appearance, was attacked. He added that one of the two individuals was also killed in the attack. The attackers also torched the vehicle after the ambush. Earlier in the day, state-run APP reported that heavy firing by armed assailants targeted the DSP of Lachi police station near Shakardara Road. Following the attack, additional police contingents were dispatched to the area, and a search operation was launched to apprehend the attackers. Authorities have cordoned off the area, while investigations into the incident have begun. Condemnations In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack. Paying tribute to the fallen police personnel, he expressed heartfelt sympathy and condolences to their families. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also strongly condemned the terrorist attack. The governor paid glowing tribute to the DSP and other police officials who embraced martyrdom in the line of duty and prayed for their elevated ranks. He also extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wished for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel. Kundi noted that the law and order situation in KP’s southern districts had deteriorated significantly. He said the police were fighting on the front lines in the war against terrorism and rendering immense sacrifices. The governor termed the sacrifices of police officers and soldiers for establishing peace a source of pride for the nation. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack and expressed sorrow over the loss of lives, as per a statement issued via the PPP’s media cell. As per the statement, Bilawal paid tribute to the KP police for their “unwavering resolve and sacrifices in the war against terrorism”. KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. On Monday, three Federal Constabulary (FCN) men were martyred in a terrorist attack in KP’s Karak district, officials said. According to Karak police spokesperson Shaukat Khan, Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the site of the incident, but their ambulances were ambushed by the terrorists near Ghole Banda Dam. As a result, three FCN personnel were martyred, and three Rescue 1122 officials were injured, while the ambulances caught fire and were destroyed. Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel. The military’s media wing said that an “innocent young girl” was also martyred during the incident, while another seven people were also injured, including women and children.

A senior police officer told Dawn that six police personnel — the DSP, an inspector and four constables — were martyred when the vehicle, which was transporting two individuals for a court appearance, was attacked. He added that one of the two individuals was also killed in the attack. The attackers also torched the vehicle after the ambush. Earlier in the day, state-run APP reported that heavy firing by armed assailants targeted the DSP of Lachi police station near Shakardara Road. Following the attack, additional police contingents were dispatched to the area, and a search operation was launched to apprehend the attackers. Authorities have cordoned off the area, while investigations into the incident have begun. Condemnations In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack. Paying tribute to the fallen police personnel, he expressed heartfelt sympathy and condolences to their families. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also strongly condemned the terrorist attack. The governor paid glowing tribute to the DSP and other police officials who embraced martyrdom in the line of duty and prayed for their elevated ranks. He also extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wished for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel. Kundi noted that the law and order situation in KP’s southern districts had deteriorated significantly. He said the police were fighting on the front lines in the war against terrorism and rendering immense sacrifices. The governor termed the sacrifices of police officers and soldiers for establishing peace a source of pride for the nation. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack and expressed sorrow over the loss of lives, as per a statement issued via the PPP’s media cell. As per the statement, Bilawal paid tribute to the KP police for their “unwavering resolve and sacrifices in the war against terrorism”. KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. On Monday, three Federal Constabulary (FCN) men were martyred in a terrorist attack in KP’s Karak district, officials said. According to Karak police spokesperson Shaukat Khan, Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the site of the incident, but their ambulances were ambushed by the terrorists near Ghole Banda Dam. As a result, three FCN personnel were martyred, and three Rescue 1122 officials were injured, while the ambulances caught fire and were destroyed. Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel. The military’s media wing said that an “innocent young girl” was also martyred during the incident, while another seven people were also injured, including women and children.

      "summary_orig": "The Israeli opposition has planned to boycott the address of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Knesset during his visit to the country, top Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Tuesday. The Indian prime minister will visit Israel from February 25 to 26, India’s foreign ministry said on Tuesday. It will be Modi’s second visit to Israel. According to the report, the opposition — led by Yair Lapid — is in a “standoff” with Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana due to his decision not to invite the Israeli Supreme Court President Isaac Amit to attend a special session of the parliament “as is customary”. The report said that Lapid on Monday urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ensure Amit’s invitation. According to Haaretz , Lapid, in a post on X, said: “We want to be in the session, we need to be in the session. Prime Minister Netanyahu must instruct Ohana to allow us to participate in the session.” As per the report, Lapid, while speaking in the Knesset last week, warned that “boycotting Justice Amit is also a boycott of the opposition, and will not allow us to attend the session”. He further said that the opposition “does not want India to be embarrassed, with the leader of a nation of one and a half billion people standing here before a half-empty Knesset”. Haaretz quoted him as claiming that “the Indian embassy was ‘in a panic’”. “Knesset speaker Ohana, however, in response to the boycott, maintained that he plans to invite former lawmakers to fill the seats of boycotting opposition lawmakers,” Haaretz reported, citing Israel’s public broadcaster Kan. According to the report, Ohana also urged Lapid not to harm Israel’s foreign relations with “one of the most significant powers in the world,” terming the boycott an “illegitimate weapon in a political struggle”. The report further added that the decision came amid the Israeli government’s efforts to “advance legislation to overhaul the powers of Israel’s judiciary”. Additional input by Reuters.",

Local authorities reiterated their commitment to ensuring the safety of educational institutions and maintaining peace in the region. Meanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi strongly condemned the incident. In his statement, the governor said that those responsible for targeting an educational institution in South Waziristan are enemies of knowledge, development, and the younger generation. He added that the entire nation stands with the state and its institutions to thwart the malicious designs of Fitna al-Khawarij. The governor further stated that such cowardly attacks cannot weaken the nation’s resolve. Instead, these acts would only strengthen national unity against forces seeking to disrupt peace and progress, he said. In December, 2025, terrorists blew up a government primary school in the Mirali tehsil of North Waziristan district, spreading fear and anxiety among students. According to police, the incident occurred in Eppi village, where unknown assailants planted explosive material inside the building of the government girls’ primary school during the night, triggering a powerful blast that destroyed the structure.",

The 264-to-133 vote was only one vote shy of the two-thirds of the House lawmakers needed to send the legislation to President Trump’s desk. 2/3s of the House needed to vote in favor to override a VETO by the Executive. The Senate vote was unanimous. The fate of an air safety bill written in the wake of a deadly midair collision outside Washington last year seemed less certain on Monday, after the Pentagon pulled support from the bill and key House members took to the House floor to object to its passage. The bipartisan bill, known as the ROTOR Act, is aimed at addressing certain factors that contributed to last year’s midair collision between a commercial jet and a military helicopter at Ronald Reagan National Airport, killing 67. It passed the Senate unanimously in December, just hours after the Pentagon issued an endorsement.
