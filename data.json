      "summary_orig": "LONDON: British counter-terrorism police have charged three men in connection with a series of “highly targeted” attacks against Pakistani dissidents living in the United Kingdom, including a former minister in the Imran Khan government. The alleged assaults took place in Cambridgeshire and Buckinghamshire between Dec 24 and 31 and were directed at two prominent supporters of the jailed former Pakistani prime minister. Counter-terrorism police took over the investigation from local forces, citing the deliberate and targeted nature of the incidents. One of the victims, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, a former accountability adviser in Mr Khan’s cabinet, said he was brutally assaulted at his home after an attacker confirmed his identity. He told British media that he had been punched repeatedly and is now in hiding, fearing for his and his family’s safety. On Friday, police confirmed that three British nationals had been charged. Karl Blackbird, 40, and Clark McAulay, 39, face charges of conspiracy to cause actual bodily harm in relation to separate incidents. A third man, Doneto Brammer, 21, has been charged in connection with the attack on Akbar’s home and faces additional charges, including possession of a prohibited weapon and conspiracy to commit arson. All three appeared before Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Saturday. Several other suspects have been arrested during coordinated raids across London, the Midlands and Essex and later released on bail. Police said the investigation remains ongoing and that detectives are keeping an open mind regarding motive and possible links between the attacks. Published in Dawn, January 25th, 2026",

The civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue service under Hamas authority, said the drone strike killed the two teenagers near Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, in northern Gaza.

      "summary_orig": "CISARUA: A predawn landslide killed at least eight people and left more than 80 missing on Indonesia’s main island of Java on Saturday, a disaster official said. Triggered by heavy rainfall, it struck villages in Java’s West Bandung region in the early hours — at around 2.30am (1930 GMT Friday) — and buried residential areas. Floods and landslides are common across the vast archipelago during the rainy season, which typically runs from October to March. “There was a rumbling noise, like thunder,” Oyoh, a resident of Pasirlangu village who, like many Indonesians, only has one name, told AFP. “It had been raining non-stop since the morning, and then it [the landslide] happened. I immediately felt scared.” Triggered by heavy rainfall, it struck villages in Java’s West Bandung region The 52-year-old had been evacuated to the village’s government office along with dozens of others, mainly women and children. She said her house survived the landslide, but her niece, her niece’s husband and their two children were missing. Abdul Muhari, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, confirmed that eight people were killed and 82 were unaccounted for. West Bandung’s mayor Jeje Ritchie Ismail told reporters that the military, police and volunteers were assisting in the search. However, he warned that the terrain was extremely difficult and the ground remained unstable. The local search and rescue agency said it was conducting manual excavation, spraying the soil with water pumps and using drones to search for the victims. Forest loss The disaster comes after tropical storms and intense monsoon rains late last year triggered flooding and landslides that killed around 1,200 people and displaced more than 240,000 in Indonesia’s Sumatra island, according to official figures. Environmentalists, experts and the government have pointed to the role forest loss played in the flooding and landslides that washed torrents of mud into villages. Forests help absorb rainfall and stabilise the ground held by their roots, and their absence makes areas more prone to flash flooding and landslides, David Gaveau, founder of conservation start-up The TreeMap, told AFP in December. Indonesia lost more than 240,000 hectares of primary forest in 2024, according to analysis by The TreeMap’s Nusantara Atlas project. It is regularly among the countries with the largest annual forest loss as mining, plantations and fires have caused the clearance of large tracts of lush vegetation in recent decades, NGOs have said. The government filed multiple lawsuits following the Sumatra floods, seeking more than $200 million in damages against six firms. It also stripped more than two dozen permits this week from forestry, mining and hydroelectric companies in Sumatra. This month, torrential rains battered Indonesia’s Siau island, causing a flash flood that killed at least 16 people. Published in Dawn, January 25th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "Rescue workers extinguish a blaze, which claimed three lives, at a hotel in Gulberg.—White Star LAHORE: At least three people were killed and seven others sustained burn injuries after a fire broke out at a hotel in the Gulberg area of Lahore on Saturday. Rescue 1122 firefighters swiftly launched a major rescue operation and evacuated 275 occupants from the building. The fire erupted at the Indigo Hotel on Noor Jehan Road while a school event was underway on the premises. According to Rescue 1122, an emergency call was received at 12:25pm, after which multiple firefighting and rescue teams were dispatched from the Command and Control Centre. Rescue officials said that 21 emergency vehicles and around 80 rescuers and officers took part in the operation. Seven people were pulled out from the severely affected area, some of whom had sustained burn injuries. One of the injured, identified as 46-year-old Mubeen, was shifted to Services Hospital for treatment, while another victim reportedly suffered 30 to 40 per cent burns. Deputy Commissioner Lahore, retired Capt Ali Ejaz, reached the site and was briefed by the Model Town assistant commissioner, Rescue 1122, Fire Brigade, and Civil Defence officials. He dire­cted the authorities to ensure immediate evacuation of all individuals from the building and to provide first aid before shifting the injured to Services or Jinnah Hospital. Rescue 1122 stated that the hotel building comprises 19 storeys with three basements and is spread over four kanals. Basement one was the most affected, with heavy smoke posing serious challenges for firefighters and rescuers. Initial findings suggested that the fire may have been caused by a gas leak in the basement. Officials confirmed that around 275 staff members and guests were safely evacuated from the hotel. Police said crew members of several foreign airlines were also staying at the hotel at the time of the incident. During the initial phase of the operation, two people who died from burn injuries were identified as 25-year-old Imran and 30-year-old Shehryar, according to an Edhi Foundation spokesperson. Edhi volunteers shifted their bodies to the morgue in ambulances and continued assisting in relief efforts at the site. In a later update, Rescue 1122 said that during a secondary search operation, another body was recovered from the building. The deceased was identified as 30-year-old Riaz, whose body was shifted to Services Hospital. Response hailed Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz commended the emergency response, saying timely action by Rescue 1122 helped prevent further loss of life. She said senior provincial officials were immediately directed to reach the site and supervise the rescue and firefighting operation. The chief minister also shared several updates about the incident on social media platform X. She said the fire had occurred in the basement of the hotel and that 280 people, including 180 guests and 100 staff members, were rescued. She added that she monitored the evacuation and rescue operation through the Safe City drone system. The chief minister said the incident was caused by the “explosion of the air-conditioning system boiler”, terming it “severe”. “Strict directives have been issued: all commercial boiler and cylinder installations across Punjab must fully comply with safety standards. Any premises found compromising public safety will be sealed immediately, without exception,” she said. Authorities said a detailed investigation had been launched to determine the exact cause of the fire, while cooling and safety inspection work at the building continued. On Thursday, the Punjab government gave stakeholders two weeks to implement standard operating procedures (SOPs) in plazas, schools and hospitals in the wake of Gul Plaza inferno. “A building grading system has now been introduced across the province, under which safe buildings will be categorised as A-grade, while others will be graded according to their condition. The firefighting sector is being upgraded with modern technology, drones and state-of-the-art equipment,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference in Lahore.

      "summary_en": "Rescue workers extinguish a blaze, which claimed three lives, at a hotel in Gulberg.—White Star LAHORE: At least three people were killed and seven others sustained burn injuries after a fire broke out at a hotel in the Gulberg area of Lahore on Saturday. Rescue 1122 firefighters swiftly launched a major rescue operation and evacuated 275 occupants from the building. The fire erupted at the Indigo Hotel on Noor Jehan Road while a school event was underway on the premises. According to Rescue 1122, an emergency call was received at 12:25pm, after which multiple firefighting and rescue teams were dispatched from the Command and Control Centre. Rescue officials said that 21 emergency vehicles and around 80 rescuers and officers took part in the operation. Seven people were pulled out from the severely affected area, some of whom had sustained burn injuries. One of the injured, identified as 46-year-old Mubeen, was shifted to Services Hospital for treatment, while another victim reportedly suffered 30 to 40 per cent burns. Deputy Commissioner Lahore, retired Capt Ali Ejaz, reached the site and was briefed by the Model Town assistant commissioner, Rescue 1122, Fire Brigade, and Civil Defence officials. He dire­cted the authorities to ensure immediate evacuation of all individuals from the building and to provide first aid before shifting the injured to Services or Jinnah Hospital. Rescue 1122 stated that the hotel building comprises 19 storeys with three basements and is spread over four kanals. Basement one was the most affected, with heavy smoke posing serious challenges for firefighters and rescuers. Initial findings suggested that the fire may have been caused by a gas leak in the basement. Officials confirmed that around 275 staff members and guests were safely evacuated from the hotel. Police said crew members of several foreign airlines were also staying at the hotel at the time of the incident. During the initial phase of the operation, two people who died from burn injuries were identified as 25-year-old Imran and 30-year-old Shehryar, according to an Edhi Foundation spokesperson. Edhi volunteers shifted their bodies to the morgue in ambulances and continued assisting in relief efforts at the site.

      "summary_orig": "• Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi facilities up for grabs; Privatisation Commission assures domestic, foreign firms of level-playing field; abandons G2G mode amid investors’ high interest • Seeks proposals to appoint financial adviser for Roosevelt Hotel; plans joint venture for mixed-use development; aims to finalise transaction in a year ISLAMABAD: The Privatisation Commission announced on Saturday that the outsourcing operation for the country’s three major airports — Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi — will move to an open bidding mode following a high level of interest from various investors. The commission said the shift from a government-to-government (G2G) mode to open bidding aims to generate a competitive process wherein all domestic and foreign investors will have a level playing field to participate in the bidding process. According to a commission statement, the envisaged competitive process priorities inclusivity by welcoming participation from all eligible entities, including those from partner nations, while affording equal opportunities to local and foreign investors. This approach is designed to promote transparency and fair competition, deliver the most advantageous results for Pakistan’s economy and reinforce relationships with international partners, the commission said. The government has been actively considering options for Islamabad International Airport, Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport and Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport through appropriate modes, including management contracts and long-term commercial concessions. As part of this strategy, the Islamabad airport has been included in the active privatisation program, consistent with the ongoing process for the airports at Karachi and Lahore. This follows constructive dialogue with entities from partner nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia, as well as other international stakeholders. The commission noted that the primary objectives are to enhance efficiency, improve service delivery, maximise revenue generation, upgrade infrastructure and attract private sector investments. These efforts align with the nation’s economic vision to cultivate collaboration to modernise the aviation sector. Roosevelt Hotel Separately, the Privatisation Com­m­ission has invited technical and financial proposals for the appointment of a financial adviser for the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, aiming to secure a joint venture for mixed-use development of the elite Manhattan property owned by the Pakistan government. According to the commission’s website, proposals can be submitted by Feb 16. The government intends for the transaction regarding the Roosevelt Hotel to be completed in one year. The commission intends to offer the property for setting up a joint venture project through the “best suited transaction structure and mode of privatisation”. The appointed financial adviser will be tasked with conducting market sounding to validate investor interest in the hotel. The adviser must identify potentially interested parties and assess the level of interest in the transaction structure options covered in the transaction structure report and recommendations of the earlier financial adviser. Additionally, the financial adviser will develop and implement an effective marketing strategy with the approval of the Privatisation Commission. This includes developing and implementing a plan for introducing the Roosevelt’s site and projecting its image to bolster its value, “enabling expression of interest in the property from prospective investors”. The adviser will also be required to arrange meetings with potential investors in order to develop a better understanding of investor profiles and the investment climate. Located in midtown on Madison Avenue, the Roosevelt Hotel is the only real estate entity on the government’s privatisation program. The 19-storey property is considered among the elite hotels in Manhattan, comprising 1,025 rooms with a covered area of over 600,000 square feet. It is wholly owned by PIA Investments Ltd (PIAIL), which is owned and managed by the Pakistan government. Published in Dawn, January 25th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that the federal cabinet had approved Pakistan joining the Board of Peace, which is led by US President Donald Trump. A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — had gathered on stage on Thursday with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland, to put their names to the founding charter of the body. Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, the Board of Peace’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts. Speaking to the media outside the Pakistan High Commission in London on Saturday, the premier said that he had a “very good trip” to Davos. He said that Pakistan had received an invitation from Trump to join the Board of Peace, adding that he accepted with the approval of the cabinet. “We signed with the hope that there will be peace in Gaza, that Palestinians will receive the respect they deserve, and that Gaza will be reconstructed,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said the humanitarian situation in Gaza required urgent international attention and reiterated Pakistan’s long-standing position in support of Palestinian rights. The premier also highlighted his meeting with International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Kristalina Georgieva, describing it as positive. He did not share details of the discussion but said Pakistan would continue to engage constructively with international financial institutions as it works to stabilise its economy. Commenting on regional security, PM Shehbaz said he had thanked Mr Trump for what he described as his role in “saving millions of lives in South Asia by ending the India-Pakistan war”, without elaborating further. Meanwhile, the prime minister’s aide, Rana Sanaullah, also said on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan ’ that the federal cabinet had endorsed the decision to join the Board of Peace. “There was much discussion on this and the cabinet endorsed it. After the cabinet’s endorsement, the prime minister accepted this [invitation],” he said. “The development happened in the past week to 10 days. Based on this, the government signed after consultations with the cabinet. I know this, I was in that consultation,” he said. The decision to join the board was criticised, with politicians and analysts saying that the decision was “unwise” and Pakistan had “jumped the gun”. In response, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry had defended the move in the National Assembly, saying the country joined the body meant to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding in the interest of the Palestinian people. The issue was also raised during a joint sitting of Parliament on Friday, with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman claiming the decision was taken because of the “fear of Trump”. The government had again defended the move, with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal saying that Pakistan being at the “centre stage” along with its brother Muslim countries to contribute towards peace in Gaza and Palestine was a “diplomatic win”.",

A statement by the navy said that PNS ships Tabuk and Moawin successfully conducted the medical evacuation of a Sri Lankan national requiring “urgent medical attention” on an Indonesian-flagged merchant vessel (MV) Grey Palm. ​”The operation was initiated following a formal request from [the] Sri Lankan Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) for [the] provision of medical assistance to a Sri Lankan national crew member in critical condition onboard MV Grey Palm, positioned 800 nautical miles (approximately 1,500 kilometres) from Pakistan’s coast,” the statement said. The Pakistan Navy dispatched its ships as first responders and evacuated the Sri Lankan crew member along with an attendant, it said. Subsequently, the patient was immediately provided with the necessary treatment aboard the navy vessel, it added. “The Sri Lankan authorities and family of the individual thanked Pakistan for [the] prompt response and support,” the statement said. “​The successful medical evacuation is yet another testament to operational readiness and [the] longstanding commitment of Pakistan for the safety of life at sea, irrespective of nationality.” President Asif Ali Zardari praised the rescue operation, which took place 1,500 km off the coast of Gwadar, according to a statement from the Presidency. Paying tribute to the two vessels and their crews for their professionalism and prompt response, President Zardari was quoted as saying, “Pakistan Navy has fulfilled its international responsibilities by transcending nationality to protect human life at sea.”",

      "summary_orig": "Police on Saturday registered a first information report (FIR) over the devastating Gul Plaza inferno, citing the incident as an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”. The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished , has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some sections collapsed. It has so far claimed 71 lives. South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the FIR had been registered on behalf of the state, through a police official, under relevant laws. According to the FIR, Nabi Bux Station House Officer (SHO) Inspector Nawaz Ali Zardari said the police received information about the fire in the plaza at around 10:30pm on January 17. The FIR added that the fire was “rapidly spreading and engulfed the entire plaza” while firefighters and other rescue personnel were engaged in efforts to extinguish the blaze. It further stated that the fire erupted in shop number 193, a flower and gift shop, located on the ground floor, and quickly spread in the shopping plaza. “Rescue work is ongoing and there are apprehensions of more deaths,” said the FIR. The police also blamed the lack of firefighting equipment and “no reasonable arrangements” in the case of an emergency for the tragedy. The report added that there were “no emergency exits” and that electricity had been switched off, complicating the evacuation of those inside the shopping plaza. “Due to these reasons, precious human lives were lost and substantive financial losses also occurred.” The FIR has been registered under Sections 322 (murder without intention), 337-H(i) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). Police have not nominated anyone in the case; therefore, the FIR has been registered against unknown persons. Sindh home minister says tragedies should not be politicised Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said that tragedies such as the Gul Plaza fire should not be turned into political controversies, according to a statement from his office. Speaking to the media at the Police Training College in Shahdadpur, Lanjar expressed deep sorrow over the Gul Plaza tragedy, stating that precious human lives had been lost and the entire provincial government was in mourning. According to the statement, he added that an FIR had been registered in connection with the incident, including sections related to negligence and carelessness, and assured that action would be taken against those responsible in accordance with the law. “Tragedies such as the Gul Plaza incident should not be turned into political controversies,” he was quoted as saying, regretting that the matter was being linked to the 18th Constitutional Amendment and the NFC Award, which he described as “beyond understanding”. Criticising leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), he added, “Politics over dead bodies are unacceptable under any circumstances. Such incidents could occur in Lahore, Peshawar, or any other city.” The home department stated that Lanjar clarified that Gul Plaza’s lease had been granted in the past and that the Sindh chief minister had already placed all facts of the tragedy before the nation. He was further quoted as saying that the chief minister had announced financial assistance for the families of the deceased, and affected traders would also be provided with rebuilt shops. Need to learn lessons: Khaqan Abbasi Awaam Pakistan Convenor Shahid Khaqan Abbasi paid a visit to Gul Plaza, where he stressed the need to “learn lessons” from the incident and take corrective measures. “This has been a complete failure […] There are thousands of such buildings in Karachi. What will the government do about those?” he said while speaking to the media. The ex-premier remarked that possibly replacing a “few officials” after an investigation was “no compensation” for the loss of lives and property caused by the fire. During the media talk, a citizen decried that the relatives of the deceased who had come for shopping were “not getting any information” or propoer responses. “We had given our DNA report from the first day [of the incident], but we have got nothing so far.” Responding to him and another query, Abbasi said, “Whenever such incidents take place, the government institutions come and analyse how many people have been martyred and how their relatives can be helped. “[…] It takes some time but it appears that such a procedure has not been employed […] how they can be consoled, helped in the identification.” Addressing a press conference at Karachi Press Club later, the Awaam Pakistan chief stressed that it was the responsibility of the government to “at least listen” to the affected people. CM Murad announces major relief, accountability measures On Friday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah briefed the provincial assembly on the incident, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab in attendance. Recalling that Rs10 million had been announced for the family of each deceased individual, CM Murad said the required funds have been released and handed over to the Karachi commissioner for distribution. About the committee formed to estimate the losses faced by the businesses at Gul Plaza, he said the Sindh Assembly would compensate the affected people. The Sindh CM announced Rs500,000 in “immediate” financial assistance for the 1,102 shops approved by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) at Gul Plaza, and if any others had any proper documentation. “This is for their sustenance so that they can stand back on their feet, as the rest of the programme can take two to three months,” he noted. The chief minister further revealed that after some ministers’ efforts, 500 shops were made available in one building and 350 in another, whose owners have said they will not take any rent for one year. “My effort is to make arrangements for them (shop occupants/renters) to get makeshift shops for two years,” Murad said. He went on to announce that the Sindh government, through the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund, would arrange the “security/collateral” for the affected people and pay the interest if someone wanted Rs10m in loans. The Sindh CM said Gul Plaza would likely be demolished and then rebuilt, with each shop getting the same area size it previously had. He added that the Sindh government would aim to reconstruct them within two years. The chief minister also stated that an audit will be conducted and non-compliant buildings would be given a “brief period” to comply, failing which they would be sealed. He further said that he has directed the provincial law minister to draft legislation for making insurance mandatory.",

      "summary_orig": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday thanked his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar for his “ strong support ” and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) amid the prevailing tense situation between Washington and Tehran. On Friday, the UNHRC adopted a resolution — with 25 votes in favour, seven against and 14 abstentions — to extend the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran for two years. The resolution also extended the mandate of the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran by one year and called for an urgent investigation by the mission, in the context of the deadly nationwide protests in Iran that started in December. Pakistan, along with China and India, voted against the resolution. In a post on X on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said Dar, who is on a visit to Dubai, received a telephone call from Araghchi. The Iranian minister thanked the deputy prime minister for “his strong support and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, including its call for a vote as well as voting against the resolution concerning Iran”, the FO added. The ministry said the two dignitaries exchanged views on regional and international developments, while Araghchi conveyed “deep appreciation” for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Pakistani government and the people. Separately, Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam also thanked the country’s leadership for its “historic and unwavering support” at the UNHRC by “calling for a vote and casting a negative vote against the unjustified resolution targeting Iran”. In his post on X, Moghadam also conveyed special appreciation to the representatives of the Permanent Mission of Pakistan in Geneva for “their tireless efforts and dedication” in the pursuit of justice. “This principled stance marks the third consecutive defeat of unprovoked and politically motivated actions against Iran over the past year, including the unprovoked twelve-day aggression, recent foreign-backed riots aimed at destabilising the country, and the misuse of international organisations to pursue capricious and hostile agendas by certain members.” The envoy went on saying that such “steadfast support” was a clear reflection of the country’s “enduring commitment to justice, multilateralism, respect for human rights, and national sovereignty”, adding that it would be “remembered with deep appreciation”. On Friday, a senior Iranian official said the country would treat any attack “as an all-out war against us”, after US President Donald Trump’s comment that a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: After heavy snowfall in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah Valley, rescue teams continued operations to evacuate those trapped by the snow, a spokesperson said on Saturday. A large number of displaced families leaving Tirah in preparation for an operation in the valley were stranded in a snowstorm in Khyber district on Friday. KP’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said in a statement that the rescue operations were ongoing for those trapped in the valley. “Rescue 1122 has so far rescued more than 1,500 people and 350 vehicles and shifted them to safe places during the rescue operation, while more than 100 people have also been provided medical assistance,” he said. Rescue 1122 teams conduct operations in the Tirah Valley to rescue over 1,500 people trapped due to heavy snowfall, in Khyber district on January 24. — photo via author The spokesperson added that over 100 personnel and officers from Khyber, Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera and Swabi’s Rescue 1122 divisions were participating in the operation. In a later statement, Faizi said that the rescue operation had been ongoing for more than 36 hours. “Despite the severe cold, sub-zero temperatures and difficult routes, rescue personnel are in the field and are carrying out rescue activities without interruption,” he said. The Khyber district administration on Thursday suspended the evacuation of more families from Tirah Valley in view of the heavy snowfall, asking them to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather. Citizens advised to avoid travel Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) said that the Murree Expressway had been opened to limited traffic due to an improvement in the weather conditions. “However, due to the changing weather conditions and increasing rush, there is a possibility of closing the Murree Expressway,” the spokesperson added, requesting the public to avoid unnecessary travel. The spokesperson said that the motorway police had performed their duties with diligence during the heavy snowfall and that traffic was controlled via the “best strategy according to the situation”, adding that the relevant officers themselves were in the field taking the lead. According to the motorways spokesperson, more rain and snowfall is predicted in Murree and Galiyat on Monday and Tuesday. NHMP’s media department requested that tourists cooperate with the Motorway Police, who would be on alert 24 hours a day to prevent any sudden disaster. “The Motorway Police will be present to guide and protect tourists,” it said. It advised citizens to contact its helpline at 130 in case of emergency and obtain guidance from the Motorway Police’s social media accounts before starting the journey.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran will treat any attack “as an all-out war against us,” a senior Iranian official said on Friday, ahead of the arrival of a US military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days. “This military buildup — we hope it is not intended for real confrontation — but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran,” said the senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “This time we will treat any attack — limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it — as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this,” the official said. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an “armada” heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program. “If the Americans violate Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond,” said the Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like. “A country under constant military threat from the United States has no option but to ensure that everything at its disposal can be used to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran,” the official said. The US military has, in the past, periodically sent increased forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive. However, the US military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran’s nuclear program. Air France suspends service to Dubai as KLM halts Middle East flights At least two European airlines suspended flights to cities in the Middle East on Friday, with Air France saying it will temporarily stop service to Dubai due to the geopolitical situation. Dutch airline KLM also halted flights until further notice to cities in the Middle East and would not fly through the airspace of several countries in the region, including Iraq and Iran, according to the Netherlands’ state broadcaster. “Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the company has decided to temporarily suspend its service to Dubai,” France’s national carrier said in a statement to AFP. The airline added it was “constantly monitoring the evolution of the geopolitical situation in the territories served and overflown by its aircraft” to ensure “the highest level of safety and security” for its flights. “Air France is monitoring the situation in real time and will provide further updates on its flight schedule,” the French airline said. KLM told Dutch public broadcaster NOS on Friday that it had suspended flights until further notice to Tel Aviv, Dubai, Dammam and Riyadh and would not fly through the airspace of Iraq, Iran, Israel and several countries in the Gulf. The airline did not disclose the reason for the suspensions and said it was in touch with Dutch authorities, according to NOS. Trump has repeatedly threatened US strikes on Iran over the crackdown on the protest movement that recently erupted across the Islamic republic. The prospect of military action appeared to recede last week after the White House said Tehran had halted planned executions of demonstrators, but Trump on Thursday confirmed continuing military preparations. “You know we have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case… We have a big force going toward Iran,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the United States will meet in Abu Dhabi on Saturday for the second day of negotiations on a plan being pushed by US President Donald Trump to end the almost four-year-long war. The first known direct contact between Ukrainian and Russian officials on the proposal began Friday. Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said the discussions focused “on the parameters for ending Russia’s war and the further logic of the negotiation process”. An initial US draft drew heavy criticism in Kyiv and western Europe for hewing too closely to Moscow’s line, while later iterations prompted pushback from Russia for floating the idea of European peacekeepers. Both sides say the fate of territory in the eastern Donbas region is one of the main outstanding issues in the search for a settlement to a war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and decimated parts of Ukraine. The UAE foreign ministry said in a statement that the talks were scheduled to last two days and were “part of ongoing efforts to promote dialogue and identify political solutions to the crisis”. Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday and US envoy Steve Witkoff later held talks with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. Donbas dispute The Emirates meeting began as thousands of people in Kyiv were without heating in sub-zero temperatures due to Russian strikes. The European Union, which has sent hundreds of generators, accused Moscow of “deliberately depriving civilians of heat”. Further Russian strikes killed one person and injured 22 others in Ukraine’s capital and the northeastern city of Kharkiv overnight, authorities said early Saturday. “Kyiv is under a massive enemy attack,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko posted on Telegram, adding that several non-residential buildings had been hit and telling residents to remain in shelters. While diplomacy to end Europe’s worst conflict since World War II has gained pace, Moscow and Kyiv appear deadlocked over the issue of territory. Hours after Putin met Witkoff — and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — in Moscow, the Kremlin said its maximalist demand that Kyiv withdraw from the eastern Donbas region still stood. “Russia’s position is well known on the fact that Ukraine, Ukrainian armed forces, have to leave the territory of the Donbas,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “This is a very important condition,” he added. Kyiv, which still controls around 20 per cent of the eastern region, has rejected such terms. ‘Desire to end the war’ Ahead of the talks Zelensky told reporters territory remained a “key issue” — with Moscow having said it is not dropping its demand that Kyiv pull out of its eastern Donbas region. In a post online, he later added: “It is necessary that not only Ukraine has the desire to end the war and achieve full security, but that a similar desire somehow emerges in Russia as well.” Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are last known to have met face-to-face in Istanbul last summer, in talks that ended only in deals to exchange captured soldiers. The Abu Dhabi meeting is the first time they have faced each other to talk about the Trump administration’s plan. Putin has repeatedly said Moscow intends to get full control of eastern Ukraine by force if talks fail. After the Russia-US talks in the Kremlin, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov insisted Moscow was “genuinely interested in resolving” the war diplomatically. But he added: “Until that happens, Russia will continue to achieve its objectives… on the battlefield.” Trump has in the past pressured Ukraine to agree to terms that Kyiv sees as capitulation. Trump repeated on Wednesday his belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal. “I believe they’re at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don’t, they’re stupid — that goes for both of them,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "India and Europe hope to strike the “mother of all deals” when European Union (EU) chiefs meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi next week, as the two economic behemoths seek to forge closer ties. Facing challenges from China and the United States, India and the European Union have been negotiating a massive free trade pact — and talks, first launched about two decades ago, are nearing the finishing line. “We are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week. Von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa will attend Republic Day celebrations on Monday before an EU-India summit on Tuesday, where they hope to shake hands on the accord. Securing a pact, described by India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal as “the mother of all deals”, would be a major win for Brussels and New Delhi as both seek to open up new markets in the face of US tariffs and Chinese export controls . But officials have been eager to stress there is more to it than commerce. “The EU and India are moving closer together at the time when the rules-based international order is under unprecedented pressure through wars, coercion and economic fragmentation,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on Wednesday. ‘Untapped potential’ Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and US President Donald Trump’s punitive tariffs have brought momentum to the relationship between India and the EU, said Praveen Donthi, of the International Crisis Group think tank. “The EU eyes the Indian market and aims to steer a rising power like India away from Russia, while India seeks to diversify its partnerships, doubling down on its strategy of multi-alignment at a time when its relations with the US have taken a downward turn,” he said. Spain’s Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares shakes hand with India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar during a visit to New Delhi, India on Jan 21, 2026. — Spain’s Foreign Ministry via Reuters The summit will offer Brussels the chance to turn the page after a bruising transatlantic crisis over Greenland — now seemingly defused. Together, the EU and India account for about a quarter of the world’s population and GDP. Bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion ($139bn) in 2024, an increase of nearly 90 per cent over the past decade, according to EU figures, with a further €60bn ($69bn ) in trade in services. But both parties are eager to do more. “India still accounts for around only around 2.5 per cent of total EU trade in goods, compared with close to 15 per cent for China,” an EU official said, adding the figure gave a sense of the “untapped potential” an agreement could unlock. EU makers of cars, machinery and chemicals have much to gain from India lowering entry barriers, said Ignacio Garcia Bercero, an analyst at Brussels think tank Bruegel, who led EU trade talks with New Delhi over a decade ago. “India is one of the most heavily protected economies in the world, with very, very high tariffs, including on many products where the European Union has a competitive advantage,” he told AFP . With its economy in the doldrums, the 27-member EU is also pushing to ease exports of spirits and wines and strengthen intellectual property rules. India — the fastest-growing major economy in the world — wants easier market access for products such as textiles and pharmaceuticals. Defence pact EU officials were tight-lipped about the deal’s contents as negotiations are ongoing. But agriculture, a sensitive topic in both India and Europe, is likely to play a limited role, with New Delhi eager to protect its dairy and grain sectors. Talks are focusing on a few sticking points, including the impact of the EU’s carbon border tax on steel exports and safety and quality standards in the pharmaceutical and automotive sectors, according to people familiar with the discussions. Still, EU officials said they were confident negotiations could be concluded in time for the summit. An accord on mobility to facilitate movement for seasonal workers, students, researchers and highly skilled professionals, is also on the menu, alongside a security and defence pact. The latter envisages closer cooperation in areas including maritime security, cybersecurity and counter-terrorism, an EU official said. It is also a “precondition” for the possible joint production of military equipment, said a second EU official. New Delhi, which has relied on Moscow for decades for key military hardware, has tried to cut its dependence on Russia in recent years by diversifying imports and pushing its own domestic manufacturing base . Europe is doing the same vis-à-vis the US. “We’re ready to open a new chapter in EU-India relationships, and really to unlock what we think is the transformative potential of this partnership,” said another EU official.",
