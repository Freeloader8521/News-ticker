      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari have reached the National Assembly (NA), with the house expected to vote on the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment bill today. The bill was tabled by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar yesterday. The PML-N-led coalition government had succeeded in manoeuvring the passage of the bill through the Senate amid the opposition’s protest on Monday. It now needs the NA’s approval, which means the support of a two-thirds majority in the 336-member house, followed by the president’s assent. The ruling coalition commands the required number, with the PML-N holding 125 seats, PPP 74, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan 22, Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and the Pakistan Muslim League-Zia and Balochistan Awami Party and National Peoples Party one seat each. Meanwhile, the opposition has 103 seats. Bilawal condemns spate of terrorist attacks Bilawal is currently addressing the assembly after getting up from his seat to meet PM Shehbaz and Nawaz. Bilawal’s speech was marred by sloganeering by the opposition benches and PTI in favour of party founder Imran Khan while carrying his photos. They also shouted to disrupt his speech and tore up copies of the bill. The PPP chief began his address by condemning yesterday’s terrorist attacks in the country. “I want to remind the elected representatives in this house, whether in opposition or treasury benches, that we can have political and ideological differences, but as far as this country’s security and enemies, and combatting these terrorists [is concerned], not only this house but the entire country should unite in facing them.” He said terrorism was once again on the rise in the country, but added that Pakistan had managed to defeat the menace before and would do so again. Coming to the 26th Amendment, he said the PPP had strove to ensure that legislative activity took place with consensus, adding that the party had done the same at the time of the 18th Amendment and the 1973 Constitution. He pointed out that both the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl were on board with the decision to form the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, adding that the PTI’s other protestations were also catered to. “In the 27th Amendment, we are about to fulfil the unfulfilled promises of the Charter of Democracy. We are about to establish constitutional courts and in Article 243 — after defeating India, the prime minister decided to make the army chief the field marshal — not only are we providing constitutional protection to that rank of field marshal, but also bringing some changes to the defence institutions.” Tarar castigates opposition Earlier, referring to opposition members’ speeches before his, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said it seemed the others could not recall any events preceding 2022, when Imran Khan, whose party is now in the opposition, was removed as the prime minister. He took an exception to the opposition protest movement against the 27th Amendment under the slogan of Aise dastoor ko subh-e-be-nur ko main nahi manta main nahi janta (This constitution, this morning bereft of light, I refuse to accept, I refuse to acknowledge). They read this but fail to say “ Iss khule jhoot ko zehen ki loot ko main nahi manta main nahi janta ”. (This blatant lie, this stealth of intellect, I refuse to accept, I refuse to acknowledge). “When they read this couplet of Habib Jalib, they do it selectively. When they talk about fascism, they talk about what they deem fascist,” he said. He alleged that the PTI had been accepting of “fascism” in the past, saying that in contrast, they had a problem today when Parliament — the highest institution of the country — was on its way to pass a constitutional amendment through a legal strategy, political process and consultation. “This selective morality, selective justice, double standards —  what exactly is their politics other than this?” Tarar said, asking why the PTI did not chant such slogans when former NA deputy speaker Qasim Khan Suri made the unconstitutional move of dismissing the no-confidence motion against Imran in 2022. View this post on Instagram “This is their selective memory,” the PML-N leader added. He noted that many politicians were once part of the PML-N, including PTI’s Shahid Khattak, and said a person “who cared more about his own self than national interests sowed the seeds of hatred”. “Will he apologise now? […] Will he apologise today for violating the Constitution? It was violated in this very assembly, in this chair. They talk about an apology, so I would like to hand them the list of their sins,” Tarar said. The minister questioned whether PTI’s Shehryar Khan Afridi gave any suggestions for “improving” any clause in the proposed 27th Amendment. “Their selective memory and thinking do not go back any further than 2020,” Tarar said, referring to the PTI. “They should apologise for what they did in 2017 and the way they came into power through the back door.” The PML-N leader also criticised the PTI for consistently bringing up the Form-47 controversy following the 2024 general elections. He taunted the opposition party for having different factions: “There is one faction which brings laptops inside the assembly, but it is Zain Qureshi who suffers, and these people who are sitting here turn on their YouTube camera and preach to people.” Tarar quipped that some leaders would be part of the government cabinets but would “flee on the first flight they can find when things get even slightly difficult”. “It is a policy of their party to play good cop, bad cop. They will sit here and talk about the political process while someone out there in different countries will attack state institutions.” He regretted that “most of Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s speech today was all about Kabul”. “It is a new trend now to say something that will become a headline in India or Kabul,” he decried. He then accused the PTI of “polluting the minds of political workers and inciting them to commit crime for political interests”, and later “ditching them” — a reference to the May 9, 2023, protests and their consequences for the party. Continuing his criticism, he said the PTI had not given any recommendation for the proposed amendment and boycotted parliamentary committee meetings. “They refuse to become a part of the process.” He said the PTI had not learned anything in the past four years. “If they had, they would have held talks on the 27th Amendment and become a part of the political process. “Had they done some research […] we would have had a productive discussion here in the house. We would have sent out a message to the world that Pakistan’s Parliament had held a very fruitful debate on the matter.” Speaking of Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he mentioned the improved perception of Pakistanis worldwide. Referring to Achakzai’s speech again, he said the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan would not be tolerated. He argued that the primary purpose of the 27th Amendment was to improve governance, defence and the delivery of justice. The minister also maintained that the amendment was not being passed in haste and all issues included in it were being discussed for years under the Charter of Democracy. However, speaking before him, PTI’s Sheh­r­yar Khan Afridi had alleged that the government was “protecting themselves in their haste”. Referring to a proposed change under the amendment to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings, he said had President Asif Ali Zardari refused this relief, his respect and honour would have increased. “But today, his actions have resulted in not just the funeral of his honour, but also the PPP’s.” He termed the 27th Amendment “a simple mockery of the people of Pakistan” and called for the government to learn from past instances. He said the 27th Amendment was a “scar on the face of democracy. The 27th Amendment will humiliate us globally at all levels”. PPP’s Nafisa Shah defends her party’s role PPP’s Nafisa Shah also addressed the house, defending her party’s role in the proposed legislation. Responding to the opposition’s criticism, she said the PPP’s role in the 26th or 27th Constitutional Amendments would have to be viewed taking into consideration the clauses that had not been included in those bills. “I want to make a list of those. Some of them are a work in progress, but some of them are those that the PPP had already crushed,” Shah continued. “And for that, you will have to acknowledge and laud the PPP’s role”. She then went on to say that some of the provisions that had not been included in the amendment bill were those regarding the federal structure and resources. Shah then held up a paper, apparently the draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill, and said: “Article 163-A is not mentioned in here. Why is it so, and why is it important? It is important because whether it is the 18th Amendment [or the] NFC (National Finance Commission) award, 163-A is a very important provision.” She said the proposed changes pertaining to this subject had not been included in the bill because the PPP refused to accept them. The provincial autonomy has to remain intact, she emphasised. “So, 163-A, which is limiting the provincial share in the NFC, has not been tabled,” she asserted, adding, “I think you have to credit the PPP for that.” Shah further stated that changes had also been recommended to “enhance executive powers, executive magistracy”. The PPP, she said, had also raised objections to this proposal and did not let it become a part of the bill. Likewise, the PPP had also ensured the exclusion of amendments pertaining to dual nationality in the bill. Moving on to the appointment of the chief election commissioner (CEC), she called for the opposition to engage on this matter. “There is an ongoing debate on this, and all political parties should sit together on this,” she emphasised, adding that the provision relating to the CEC’s, too, had not been tabled. On the proposed amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which deals with the command of armed forces, she said the suggested changes were about the “command structure”. “The reform of this command structure just has to be viewed in the perspective of [us] winning a war, winning a difficult war,” Shah said, adding that the other war that the country was engaged in could not be pinned down. Referring to yesterday’s bomb blast in Islamabad, she said, “This asymmetric war is not just on wars. It is neither [being fought] in the east or the west. Neither it is being fought on our frontiers with Afghanistan nor on the eastern border. “This is going on internally. And to face these proxy wars, asymmetric wars, we not just need national unity, but also we need to support our armed forces.” On the basis of these ground realities, Bilawal took the stance to “support this change in command”, she explained. Shah then went on to address the “most contentious” issue of judicial structure under the proposed amendment. She highlighted two key matters in this regard: the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court and the transfer of judges. “We have a historical baggage, having faced the consequences of such judicial judgements that are quoted in jurispudence world over because they are strange concoctions. This is the doctrine of necessity,” she said, adding: “It was a concept that had been buried in jurisprudence. In fact, it had been buried in the annals of history.” But then, she continued, “some judge — I think you will better remember his name, justice Munir I think — he brought it out of nowhere. And this dictum means that which is illegal by law is law by necessity”. This dictum was used to dismiss elected parliaments, constituent assemblies\nand several prime ministers, she added. In view of this, late prime minister Benazir Bhutto and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif maintained in their wisdom that “we do not want a judiciary that rationalises unconstitutional rule, that dismisses elected prime ministers, dismisses parliaments”. It was in this perspective that the establishment of an FCC was suggested, and therefore, “we are talking about a constitutional court here”. On the transfer of judges, she said the PPP endorsed the relevant proposed changes to the extent that transfers should not be used to “arm twist the judges”. Earlier in her speech, she admitted that many provisions of the proposed 27th Amendment “are something that really need a lot of discussion, that may be a little bit controversial”. But, she continued citing PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, “the circumstances that we are in, you cannot let go off whatever space you are getting — be it a mile or an inch — if you have to move toward civilian supremacy”. “We have to take whatever space we get. Boycott is not an option,” she asserted. She added that the PPP had “always engaged positively with the Constitution, with the parliament”. According to a post on the PPP’s Twitter, Bilawal, along with sister and MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, has also reached Parliament. Speaker urges opposition to hold dialogue The NA proceedings began today with NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq giving the floor to Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai. At this point, the live feed from the NA on its YouTube channel was disrupted. When the live feed restored, Speaker Sadiq appeared on the screen, thanking Achakzai. He said Prime Minister Shehbaz had repeatedly invited the opposition in the house to hold talks. “As the speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, I am ready to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition. We will find ways out when you hold talks,” he continued. The stream was then briefly disrupted again, and when it resumed, Sadiq was saying if “you want to find an excuse not to hold negotiations, then it is our bad luck. Accept my offer, hold talks. You will get results through talks.” Following that, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan asserted that “we never gave up on dialogue”. “When our mandate was stolen, [Imran] Khan sahib had nominated Shibli sahib , Omar sahib and Ali Amin Gandapur to hold dialogue. People then started saying that we wanted to talk to the establishment and not politicians. “So I visited Khan sahib , and we announced outside Adiala Jail that Achakzai sahib had the complete mandate if he wanted to engage the party and make any suggestions from his platform. Achakzai sahib is present here [today]. Efforts were made, but nothing transpired,” Gohar said, with the live stream being disrupted again at this point. When it resumed, the PTI chairman was reiterating his party’s request to let Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi meet PTI founder Imran Khan in jail. Responding to him, the speaker said: “Gohar sahib, when your offer was made, you did not even come to me personally. The prime minister showed grace and formed a high-powered committee of the allies.” The committee held three meetings, but they were not boycotted by this side, Sadiq said, pointing towards the treasury benches. The meetings were boycotted from this side, he added, pointing towards the opposition benches. ‘If bill is tabled today, it will surely be passed’ Speaking to the media outside Parliament today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said if the amendment bill was tabled in the NA for voting today, it would surely be passed. He also expressed his wish for the opposition to have “engaged in a fruitful clause-by-clause discussion” on the bill. Creating an uproar without even going through the bill and spinning a narrative would not result in any gain, he said. Upon being asked whether PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif would be visiting Parliament today, he said: “We will also have him meet you”. Opposition to the bill The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) as well as changes to the military leadership structure. Taking exception to the proposed tweaks, opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pak­­istan has ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the proposed am­­end­ment, urging the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution. While debating it in the NA yesterday, PTI Chairperson Barrister Gohar Ali Khan accused the government of attempting to “create another elite class” by means of the bill. He made these remarks particularly in reference to a proposal in the bill to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests, except for the period during which he holds public office following the end of their tenure. Gohar also warned that “with the passing of the [27th] Amendment, democracy here will only exist in name,” adding that his party “will not accept” it. Sardar Latif Khosa from his party accused the PPP of “playing naughtily” with the Constitution at the behest of the ruling PML-N. Similarly, PTI leader Amir Dogar warned the 27th Amendment would paralyse the judiciary, adding that none of its clauses served the public interest. On the other hand, PML-N’s Barrister Daniyal Chaudhry defended during yesterday’s NA session the planned establishment of the FCC, saying the move was aimed at preventing extra-judicial decisions and reducing the Supreme Court’s (SC) workload. Speaking on the occasion, PPP leader Shazia Marri asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari did not seek immunity as he had already endured eight years of imprisonment without conviction. She said the PPP would never compromise on the 18th Ame­n­dment or the rights of the people. Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal of the MQM referred to Article 140-A, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments to the article “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of a 28th amendment. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif endorsed the MQM’s call for strengthening local governments to address people’s issues at the grassroots level. Former and sitting judges , as well as lawyers , have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court. Passage of the bill so far The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution is taking shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved . The 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court , the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment. The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari announced on social media platform X on November 3 that a Prime Minister Shehbaz-led delegation had sought his party’s support for the amendment. Subsequntly, PM Shehbaz had also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment. The bill was then tabled in the Senate on Nov 8, just hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet in a meeting chaired by PM Shehbaz via a video link from Baku. It was subsequently referred to the Senate and NA standing committees on law and justice, which approved it the very next day with some minor changes to the initial draft. Law Minister Tarar tabled it in the Senate for voting on Nov 10. The contentious bill was approved by the upper house of Parliament after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The PML-N led coalition government had managed to secure a two-thirds majority to get the bill passed with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines.",

The meetings were boycotted from this side, he added, pointing towards the opposition benches. ‘If bill is tabled today, it will surely be passed’ Speaking to the media outside Parliament today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said if the amendment bill was tabled in the NA for voting today, it would surely be passed. He also expressed his wish for the opposition to have “engaged in a fruitful clause-by-clause discussion” on the bill. Creating an uproar without even going through the bill and spinning a narrative would not result in any gain, he said. Upon being asked whether PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif would be visiting Parliament today, he said: “We will also have him meet you”. Opposition to the bill The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) as well as changes to the military leadership structure. Taking exception to the proposed tweaks, opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pak­­istan has ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the proposed am­­end­ment, urging the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution. While debating it in the NA yesterday, PTI Chairperson Barrister Gohar Ali Khan accused the government of attempting to “create another elite class” by means of the bill. He made these remarks particularly in reference to a proposal in the bill to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests, except for the period during which he holds public office following the end of their tenure. Gohar also warned that “with the passing of the [27th] Amendment, democracy here will only exist in name,” adding that his party “will not accept” it. Sardar Latif Khosa from his party accused the PPP of “playing naughtily” with the Constitution at the behest of the ruling PML-N. Similarly, PTI leader Amir Dogar warned the 27th Amendment would paralyse the judiciary, adding that none of its clauses served the public interest. On the other hand, PML-N’s Barrister Daniyal Chaudhry defended during yesterday’s NA session the planned establishment of the FCC, saying the move was aimed at preventing extra-judicial decisions and reducing the Supreme Court’s (SC) workload. Speaking on the occasion, PPP leader Shazia Marri asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari did not seek immunity as he had already endured eight years of imprisonment without conviction. She said the PPP would never compromise on the 18th Ame­n­dment or the rights of the people. Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal of the MQM referred to Article 140-A, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments to the article “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of a 28th amendment. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif endorsed the MQM’s call for strengthening local governments to address people’s issues at the grassroots level. Former and sitting judges , as well as lawyers , have also voiced opposition to the proposed amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court. Passage of the bill so far The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution is taking shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved . The 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court , the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment. The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari announced on social media platform X on November 3 that a Prime Minister Shehbaz-led delegation had sought his party’s support for the amendment. Subsequntly, PM Shehbaz had also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment. The bill was then tabled in the Senate on Nov 8, just hours after it was approved by the federal cabinet in a meeting chaired by PM Shehbaz via a video link from Baku. It was subsequently referred to the Senate and NA standing committees on law and justice, which approved it the very next day with some minor changes to the initial draft. Law Minister Tarar tabled it in the Senate for voting on Nov 10. The contentious bill was approved by the upper house of Parliament after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The PML-N led coalition government had managed to secure a two-thirds majority to get the bill passed with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines.",

      "summary": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari have reached the National Assembly (NA), with the house expected to vote on the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment bill today. The bill was tabled by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar yesterday. The PML-N-led coalition government had succeeded in manoeuvring the passage of the bill through the Senate amid the opposition’s protest on Monday. It now needs the NA’s approval, which means the support of a two-thirds majority in the 336-member house, followed by the president’s assent. The ruling coalition commands the required number, with the PML-N holding 125 seats, PPP 74, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan 22, Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and the Pakistan Muslim League-Zia and Balochistan Awami Party and National Peoples Party one seat each. Meanwhile, the opposition has 103 seats. Bilawal condemns spate of terrorist attacks Bilawal is currently addressing the assembly after getting up from his seat to meet PM Shehbaz and Nawaz. Bilawal’s speech was marred by sloganeering by the opposition benches and PTI in favour of party founder Imran Khan while carrying his photos. They also shouted to disrupt his speech and tore up copies of the bill. The PPP chief began his address by condemning yesterday’s terrorist attacks in the country. “I want to remind the elected representatives in this house, whether in opposition or treasury benches, that we can have political and ideological differences, but as far as this country’s security and enemies, and combatting these terrorists [is concerned], not only this house but the entire country should unite in facing them.” He said terrorism was once again on the rise in the country, but added that Pakistan had managed to defeat the menace before and would do so again. Coming to the 26th Amendment, he said the PPP had strove to ensure that legislative activity took place with consensus, adding that the party had done the same at the time of the 18th Amendment and the 1973 Constitution. He pointed out that both the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl were on board with the decision to form the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, adding that the PTI’s other protestations were also catered to. “In the 27th Amendment, we are about to fulfil the unfulfilled promises of the Charter of Democracy. We are about to establish constitutional courts and in Article 243 — after defeating India, the prime minister decided to make the army chief the field marshal — not only are we providing constitutional protection to that rank of field marshal, but also bringing some changes to the defence institutions.” Tarar castigates opposition Earlier, referring to opposition members’ speeches before his, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said it seemed the others could not recall any events preceding 2022, when Imran Khan, whose party is now in the opposition, was removed as the prime minister. He took an exception to the opposition protest movement against the 27th Amendment under the slogan of Aise dastoor ko subh-e-be-nur ko main nahi manta main nahi janta (This constitution, this morning bereft of light, I refuse to accept, I refuse to acknowledge). They read this but fail to say “ Iss khule jhoot ko zehen ki loot ko main nahi manta main nahi janta ”. (This blatant lie, this stealth of intellect, I refuse to accept, I refuse to acknowledge). “When they read this couplet of Habib Jalib, they do it selectively. When they talk about fascism, they talk about what they deem fascist,” he said. He alleged that the PTI had been accepting of “fascism” in the past, saying that in contrast, they had a problem today when Parliament — the highest institution of the country — was on its way to pass a constitutional amendment through a legal strategy, political process and consultation. “This selective morality, selective justice, double standards —  what exactly is their politics other than this?” Tarar said, asking why the PTI did not chant such slogans when former NA deputy speaker Qasim Khan Suri made the unconstitutional move of dismissing the no-confidence motion against Imran in 2022. View this post on Instagram “This is their selective memory,” the PML-N leader added. He noted that many politicians were once part of the PML-N, including PTI’s Shahid Khattak, and said a person “who cared more about his own self than national interests sowed the seeds of hatred”. “Will he apologise now? […] Will he apologise today for violating the Constitution? It was violated in this very assembly, in this chair. They talk about an apology, so I would like to hand them the list of their sins,” Tarar said. The minister questioned whether PTI’s Shehryar Khan Afridi gave any suggestions for “improving” any clause in the proposed 27th Amendment. “Their selective memory and thinking do not go back any further than 2020,” Tarar said, referring to the PTI. “They should apologise for what they did in 2017 and the way they came into power through the back door.” The PML-N leader also criticised the PTI for consistently bringing up the Form-47 controversy following the 2024 general elections. He taunted the opposition party for having different factions: “There is one faction which brings laptops inside the assembly, but it is Zain Qureshi who suffers, and these people who are sitting here turn on their YouTube camera and preach to people.” Tarar quipped that some leaders would be part of the government cabinets but would “flee on the first flight they can find when things get even slightly difficult”. “It is a policy of their party to play good cop, bad cop. They will sit here and talk about the political process while someone out there in different countries will attack state institutions.” He regretted that “most of Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s speech today was all about Kabul”. “It is a new trend now to say something that will become a headline in India or Kabul,” he decried. He then accused the PTI of “polluting the minds of political workers and inciting them to commit crime for political interests”, and later “ditching them” — a reference to the May 9, 2023, protests and their consequences for the party. Continuing his criticism, he said the PTI had not given any recommendation for the proposed amendment and boycotted parliamentary committee meetings. “They refuse to become a part of the process.” He said the PTI had not learned anything in the past four years. “If they had, they would have held talks on the 27th Amendment and become a part of the political process. “Had they done some research […] we would have had a productive discussion here in the house. We would have sent out a message to the world that Pakistan’s Parliament had held a very fruitful debate on the matter.” Speaking of Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he mentioned the improved perception of Pakistanis worldwide. Referring to Achakzai’s speech again, he said the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan would not be tolerated. He argued that the primary purpose of the 27th Amendment was to improve governance, defence and the delivery of justice. The minister also maintained that the amendment was not being passed in haste and all issues included in it were being discussed for years under the Charter of Democracy. However, speaking before him, PTI’s Sheh­r­yar Khan Afridi had alleged that the government was “protecting themselves in their haste”. Referring to a proposed change under the amendment to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings, he said had President Asif Ali Zardari refused this relief, his respect and honour would have increased. “But today, his actions have resulted in not just the funeral of his honour, but also the PPP’s.” He termed the 27th Amendment “a simple mockery of the people of Pakistan” and called for the government to learn from past instances. He said the 27th Amendment was a “scar on the face of democracy. The 27th Amendment will humiliate us globally at all levels”. PPP’s Nafisa Shah defends her party’s role PPP’s Nafisa Shah also addressed the house, defending her party’s role in the proposed legislation. Responding to the opposition’s criticism, she said the PPP’s role in the 26th or 27th Constitutional Amendments would have to be viewed taking into consideration the clauses that had not been included in those bills. “I want to make a list of those. Some of them are a work in progress, but some of them are those that the PPP had already crushed,” Shah continued. “And for that, you will have to acknowledge and laud the PPP’s role”. She then went on to say that some of the provisions that had not been included in the amendment bill were those regarding the federal structure and resources. Shah then held up a paper, apparently the draft of the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill, and said: “Article 163-A is not mentioned in here. Why is it so, and why is it important? It is important because whether it is the 18th Amendment [or the] NFC (National Finance Commission) award, 163-A is a very important provision.” She said the proposed changes pertaining to this subject had not been included in the bill because the PPP refused to accept them. The provincial autonomy has to remain intact, she emphasised. “So, 163-A, which is limiting the provincial share in the NFC, has not been tabled,” she asserted, adding, “I think you have to credit the PPP for that.” Shah further stated that changes had also been recommended to “enhance executive powers, executive magistracy”. The PPP, she said, had also raised objections to this proposal and did not let it become a part of the bill. Likewise, the PPP had also ensured the exclusion of amendments pertaining to dual nationality in the bill. Moving on to the appointment of the chief election commissioner (CEC), she called for the opposition to engage on this matter. “There is an ongoing debate on this, and all political parties should sit together on this,” she emphasised, adding that the provision relating to the CEC’s, too, had not been tabled. On the proposed amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which deals with the command of armed forces, she said the suggested changes were about the “command structure”. “The reform of this command structure just has to be viewed in the perspective of [us] winning a war, winning a difficult war,” Shah said, adding that the other war that the country was engaged in could not be pinned down. Referring to yesterday’s bomb blast in Islamabad, she said, “This asymmetric war is not just on wars. It is neither [being fought] in the east or the west. Neither it is being fought on our frontiers with Afghanistan nor on the eastern border. “This is going on internally. And to face these proxy wars, asymmetric wars, we not just need national unity, but also we need to support our armed forces.” On the basis of these ground realities, Bilawal took the stance to “support this change in command”, she explained. Shah then went on to address the “most contentious” issue of judicial structure under the proposed amendment. She highlighted two key matters in this regard: the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court and the transfer of judges. “We have a historical baggage, having faced the consequences of such judicial judgements that are quoted in jurispudence world over because they are strange concoctions. This is the doctrine of necessity,” she said, adding: “It was a concept that had been buried in jurisprudence. In fact, it had been buried in the annals of history.” But then, she continued, “some judge — I think you will better remember his name, justice Munir I think — he brought it out of nowhere. And this dictum means that which is illegal by law is law by necessity”. This dictum was used to dismiss elected parliaments, constituent assemblies\nand several prime ministers, she added. In view of this, late prime minister Benazir Bhutto and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif maintained in their wisdom that “we do not want a judiciary that rationalises unconstitutional rule, that dismisses elected prime ministers, dismisses parliaments”. It was in this perspective that the establishment of an FCC was suggested, and therefore, “we are talking about a constitutional court here”. On the transfer of judges, she said the PPP endorsed the relevant proposed changes to the extent that transfers should not be used to “arm twist the judges”. Earlier in her speech, she admitted that many provisions of the proposed 27th Amendment “are something that really need a lot of discussion, that may be a little bit controversial”. But, she continued citing PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, “the circumstances that we are in, you cannot let go off whatever space you are getting — be it a mile or an inch — if you have to move toward civilian supremacy”. “We have to take whatever space we get. Boycott is not an option,” she asserted. She added that the PPP had “always engaged positively with the Constitution, with the parliament”. According to a post on the PPP’s Twitter, Bilawal, along with sister and MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, has also reached Parliament. Speaker urges opposition to hold dialogue The NA proceedings began today with NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq giving the floor to Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai. At this point, the live feed from the NA on its YouTube channel was disrupted. When the live feed restored, Speaker Sadiq appeared on the screen, thanking Achakzai. He said Prime Minister Shehbaz had repeatedly invited the opposition in the house to hold talks. “As the speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan, I am ready to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition. We will find ways out when you hold talks,” he continued. The stream was then briefly disrupted again, and when it resumed, Sadiq was saying if “you want to find an excuse not to hold negotiations, then it is our bad luck. Accept my offer, hold talks. You will get results through talks.” Following that, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan asserted that “we never gave up on dialogue”. “When our mandate was stolen, [Imran] Khan sahib had nominated Shibli sahib , Omar sahib and Ali Amin Gandapur to hold dialogue. People then started saying that we wanted to talk to the establishment and not politicians. “So I visited Khan sahib , and we announced outside Adiala Jail that Achakzai sahib had the complete mandate if he wanted to engage the party and make any suggestions from his platform. Achakzai sahib is present here [today]. Efforts were made, but nothing transpired,” Gohar said, with the live stream being disrupted again at this point. When it resumed, the PTI chairman was reiterating his party’s request to let Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi meet PTI founder Imran Khan in jail. Responding to him, the speaker said: “Gohar sahib, when your offer was made, you did not even come to me personally. The prime minister showed grace and formed a high-powered committee of the allies.” The committee held three meetings, but they were not boycotted by this side, Sadiq said, pointing towards the treasury benches. The meetings were boycotted from this side, he added, pointing towards the opposition benches. ‘If bill is tabled today, it will surely be passed’ Speaking to the media outside Parliament today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said if the amendment bill was tabled in the NA for voting today, it would surely be passed.

Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar told Dawn , “After the incident, the police reached the spot and began a search operation, which is still underway.” According to the official, Khan was on his way to attend a funeral when a pre-planted bomb exploded 300 feet away from his house. However, no casualties have been reported. DPO Umar said that the Swat police were ready to deal with all kinds of situations. Khan was also the senior vice president of the ANP. The party’s central president, Aimal Wali Khan, in a statement on social media, condemned the attack. “The people of Swat have made unparalleled sacrifices against terrorism and extremism,” said ANP’s post on X. “This recent incident clearly shows that terrorists are attempting to silence those voices that speak for peace, tolerance, and democracy through organised planning,” the statement added. “ANP’s stance has been clear from day one that terrorists are not the enemies of any sect, nation, or group, but of all humanity,” it said, adding that the government and law enforcement agencies should conduct a thorough investigation of the incident and take strict action against those responsible. Politicians and ANP workers have been targeted in the past as well. In July this year, Maulana Khan Zeb and a policeman were shot dead by unidentified suspects in KP’s Bajaur district. Two months later, a worker of the party, Mir Azam Khan , was shot dead by unknown assailants in the same district. In 2018, Haroon Bilour , a senior ANP leader and candidate, was killed in a suicide bombing in Peshawar during an election rally.

      "title_orig": "KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’ by including stakeholders in counterterrorism decisions",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednesday called for a “shift” in the Centre’s counterterrorism policies by including all stakeholders in the decision-making process, as his government convened a multi-party jirga. The peace jirga had been called by the KP government to discuss the law and order situation in KP and discuss strategies for re-establishing peace in the province. At the previous jirga held in the Khyber district on October 25, CM Afridi had warned against launching any new military operation in the tribal districts. “I expect that a durable and permanent solution to this menace of terrorism, which has been eating away at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for more than 20 years, will be found,” CM Afridi said while addressing the moot. The KP CM called for a policy shift, which he said would entail “coming out of the closed rooms, considering other individuals intelligent, considering politicians as wise”, and including security forces, stakeholders of KP, leaders of all political parties, and members of all schools of thought in the policymaking process. Afridi added that the policy should not be a short-term one where terrorism could see a resurgence after a few years, but one that “wipes out the menace of terrorism from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for once and for all”. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who is seated on the same stage as Afridi and others, is attending the event at the invitation of the provincial government. Representatives of the Centre were also expected to attend. The Awami National Party (ANP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), all of which are part of the opposition in the KP Assembly, are participating in the moot as well. KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati is chairing the jirga, with PTI MNA Junaid Akbar and PML-N’s Ibadullah Khan, the opposition leader in the KP Assembly, also seated on the stage. At the outset of his remarks, CM Afridi welcomed all attendees from various segments of political circles and civil society. “We repeatedly speak of peace, but unfortunately, some people dislike it,” the chief minister said. Noting that terrorism needed to be eliminated for peace to be achieved, CM Afridi said militancy had not been eradicated by “decisions taken behind closed doors and imposed on us”. “Our politics is each of our own, but our peace is shared,” the chief minister said, highlighting that all political parties and the public of the province had given sacrifices in the war against terrorism. “Our security forces, whether it’s the army, the police or the CTD, they all gave sacrifices and then peace was established in 2018,” Afridi noted. The chief minister said war should be the last option for resolving any issue. CM Afridi reiterated the call for KP being given its complete due share in the National Finance Commission (NFC), which he said amounted to around Rs400 billion. He added that while erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas had been merged administratively with KP, the economic merger was still not complete. ‘Must set aside politics’: Kundi urges unity In his address, Governor Kundi termed the convening of the jirga an “excellent move that evokes our sense of collective wisdom and seriousness and national unity”. He asked Swati to form a committee that would include parliamentary leaders of all parties in the assembly, as well as representatives from those parties not in the provincial legislature, to ensure continuity of such discussions and reduce inter-party differences. The governor underscored the need to think about the province’s future and next generations rather than discussing matters of the past. He mentioned the Afghanistan issue, saying: “Every few years, a superpower comes and tries to conquer it, and when it leaves after failing, it leaves behind its filth in the form of weapons, which is used against us .” Kundi pointed out the usage of modern weapons, such as night-vision thermal snipers, by militants in KP, adding that the province perhaps did not have enough capacity to fight against them. “We must set aside our politics and think about our province’s prosperity and development,” the PPP leader emphasised. “I agree with what Junaid Akbar sahib said, […] but we will have to speak with grounds and facts with Islamabad to get our rights,” he said, assuring that he and the opposition will stand with the KP government for that. “We have a lot of matters, our resources, which we have to discuss with the Centre,” the governor said, calling for the federal and provincial governments, the security forces, and the military to work together. Use diplomatic channels with Kabul: PTI Addressing the jirga, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser urged the Afghan government to address the ongoing issues, and also demanded that the federal government utilise diplomatic channels. “Pakistan and Afghanistan cannot survive without each other,” the former National Assembly speaker emphasised. Akbar said the decision to join the Afghan war in the 1970s was “never a political but a decision by the military”. “They [the military leadership] told us that these are our people and they would be rehabilitated,” he said, claiming that the entire political leadership had expressed reservations. The KP speaker said that while there was “no doubt” that the country possessed brave armed forces, it “makes you think that peace is not being established despite having intelligence [operations]”. The jirga began with prayers for those martyred in terrorism across the province. ANP KP President Mian Iftikhar Hussain, former JI emir Sirajul Haq, PPP provincial leader Akhunzada Chattan, and delegations of the JUI-F and the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) are participating in the peace jirga. Former CM Mehmood Khan, ex-governor Shaukatullah Khan, Pakistan Mazdoor Kisan Party central chairman Afzal Shah Khamosh, lawyers, and stakeholders from various schools of thought are among other attendees. The moot came amid a recent spate of terror attacks across the country, with the federal capital also witnessing a rare deadly blast yesterday that killed at least 12 people. The terrorism situation in KP also remains concerning. In Dera Ismail Khan’s Daraban tehsil, a bomb attack targeted a security forces’ convoy yesterday, injuring at least 14 personnel. On Monday, the Cadet College in South Waziristan’s Wana came under attack . While all students and teachers were reported to have been safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed , the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals. “The actions by the enemies of peace in Bannu, Wana, and Islamabad before the jirga are a conspiracy to sabotage the peace process. The enemies of peace will fail, and peace is our future,” former KP minister Kamran Khan Bangash said on X before the moot began. Swati and Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi were welcomed by a police contingent when they arrived at the venue. JUI-F provincial emir Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman and provincial general secretary Senator Maulana Attaul Haq Dervesh were to represent the party in the jirga, according to party spokesperson Abdul Jalil Jan. From the JI, party leaders Prof Mohammad Ibrahim Khan and former senior minister Inayatullah Khan were to attend the peace moot, a spokesperson had told Dawn . No more good Taliban, bad Taliban: ANP Addressing the jirga, ANP’s Iftikhar said that there should be “no more good and bad Taliban” narrative , and that the policies of the past should be discontinued. “A complete implementation of the National Action Plan is important for eradicating terrorism and establishing peace. We can only make suggestions as the government would have to implement them,” he said. “The government must own it. The ANP bravely faced militancy, and we held talks but also owned the problems. We took all the stakeholders and launched an operation, cleared the Malakand division and rehabilitated the displaced people,” he noted. Regarding Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan, Iftikhar said: “Both countries should respect each other and only dialogue could resolve the issues. All the trade routes with Afghanistan should be reopened immediately, and the border economy promoted. The federal and provincial governments must sit down and resolve issues.” What happened to past peace jirgas, asks ex-CM Mehmood Khan Ex-CM Mehmood, chairman of the PTI-Parliamentarians , shed light on the importance of holding talks and reaching a consensus. “I wonder what happened to the past peace jirgas?” he asked the participants. “You are the government, and people gave you the mandate,” he said, addressing the provincial government. “You will have to sit with the ‘key stakeholders’ and talk to them. A jirga comprising these people should be formed to discuss issues related to the province’s rights with the federal government.” ‘Peace above politics’ “Peace is more important for us than politics,” PTI’s Qaiser said before the jirga began, pointing out that political leaders of the entire province had been gathered today. Qaiser welcomed the participation of all political parties, including those in the opposition. “We will formulate a national policy through this jirga,” he said, adding that his party will present their demands before the Centre related to counter-terrorism. The PTI leader, reiterating his party’s stance, said the Pak-Afghan tensions should be resolved diplomatically. “There will be peace in Pakistan once there is peace in Afghanistan,” he said, adding that the KP government will also present its demands before the Afghan ruling administration. Echoing Qaiser’s sentiments, PML-N’s Ibadullah told the media, “We have set aside a myriad of differences and are sitting with the PTI.” He highlighted that a jirga was being convened in the KP Assembly for the first time and said he was hopeful for a positive outcome of it. The KP opposition leader noted that today’s moot had a single-point agenda of peace. “Terrorism is the number one issue. Amendments are the parliament’s matter,” he said. “There should be no talks with terrorists,” Ibadullah asserted. “There will be no pardon for those who slew our children’s heads.” PPP parliamentary leader in the KP Assembly Ahmad Karim Kundi had hailed the decision to hold the peace jirga, noting that the poor law and order situation was the biggest issue faced by the province. He said that while political parties had held jirgas for peace, a jirga was being held at the provincial assembly for the first time, representing the will of 40 million of the province.",

The PTI leader, reiterating his party’s stance, said the Pak-Afghan tensions should be resolved diplomatically. “There will be peace in Pakistan once there is peace in Afghanistan,” he said, adding that the KP government will also present its demands before the Afghan ruling administration. Echoing Qaiser’s sentiments, PML-N’s Ibadullah told the media, “We have set aside a myriad of differences and are sitting with the PTI.” He highlighted that a jirga was being convened in the KP Assembly for the first time and said he was hopeful for a positive outcome of it. The KP opposition leader noted that today’s moot had a single-point agenda of peace. “Terrorism is the number one issue. Amendments are the parliament’s matter,” he said. “There should be no talks with terrorists,” Ibadullah asserted. “There will be no pardon for those who slew our children’s heads.” PPP parliamentary leader in the KP Assembly Ahmad Karim Kundi had hailed the decision to hold the peace jirga, noting that the poor law and order situation was the biggest issue faced by the province. He said that while political parties had held jirgas for peace, a jirga was being held at the provincial assembly for the first time, representing the will of 40 million of the province.",
      "title": "KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’ by including stakeholders in counterterrorism decisions",
      "summary": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednesday called for a “shift” in the Centre’s counterterrorism policies by including all stakeholders in the decision-making process, as his government convened a multi-party jirga. The peace jirga had been called by the KP government to discuss the law and order situation in KP and discuss strategies for re-establishing peace in the province. At the previous jirga held in the Khyber district on October 25, CM Afridi had warned against launching any new military operation in the tribal districts. “I expect that a durable and permanent solution to this menace of terrorism, which has been eating away at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for more than 20 years, will be found,” CM Afridi said while addressing the moot. The KP CM called for a policy shift, which he said would entail “coming out of the closed rooms, considering other individuals intelligent, considering politicians as wise”, and including security forces, stakeholders of KP, leaders of all political parties, and members of all schools of thought in the policymaking process. Afridi added that the policy should not be a short-term one where terrorism could see a resurgence after a few years, but one that “wipes out the menace of terrorism from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for once and for all”. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who is seated on the same stage as Afridi and others, is attending the event at the invitation of the provincial government. Representatives of the Centre were also expected to attend. The Awami National Party (ANP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), all of which are part of the opposition in the KP Assembly, are participating in the moot as well. KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati is chairing the jirga, with PTI MNA Junaid Akbar and PML-N’s Ibadullah Khan, the opposition leader in the KP Assembly, also seated on the stage. At the outset of his remarks, CM Afridi welcomed all attendees from various segments of political circles and civil society. “We repeatedly speak of peace, but unfortunately, some people dislike it,” the chief minister said. Noting that terrorism needed to be eliminated for peace to be achieved, CM Afridi said militancy had not been eradicated by “decisions taken behind closed doors and imposed on us”. “Our politics is each of our own, but our peace is shared,” the chief minister said, highlighting that all political parties and the public of the province had given sacrifices in the war against terrorism. “Our security forces, whether it’s the army, the police or the CTD, they all gave sacrifices and then peace was established in 2018,” Afridi noted. The chief minister said war should be the last option for resolving any issue. CM Afridi reiterated the call for KP being given its complete due share in the National Finance Commission (NFC), which he said amounted to around Rs400 billion. He added that while erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas had been merged administratively with KP, the economic merger was still not complete. ‘Must set aside politics’: Kundi urges unity In his address, Governor Kundi termed the convening of the jirga an “excellent move that evokes our sense of collective wisdom and seriousness and national unity”. He asked Swati to form a committee that would include parliamentary leaders of all parties in the assembly, as well as representatives from those parties not in the provincial legislature, to ensure continuity of such discussions and reduce inter-party differences. The governor underscored the need to think about the province’s future and next generations rather than discussing matters of the past. He mentioned the Afghanistan issue, saying: “Every few years, a superpower comes and tries to conquer it, and when it leaves after failing, it leaves behind its filth in the form of weapons, which is used against us .” Kundi pointed out the usage of modern weapons, such as night-vision thermal snipers, by militants in KP, adding that the province perhaps did not have enough capacity to fight against them. “We must set aside our politics and think about our province’s prosperity and development,” the PPP leader emphasised. “I agree with what Junaid Akbar sahib said, […] but we will have to speak with grounds and facts with Islamabad to get our rights,” he said, assuring that he and the opposition will stand with the KP government for that. “We have a lot of matters, our resources, which we have to discuss with the Centre,” the governor said, calling for the federal and provincial governments, the security forces, and the military to work together. Use diplomatic channels with Kabul: PTI Addressing the jirga, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser urged the Afghan government to address the ongoing issues, and also demanded that the federal government utilise diplomatic channels. “Pakistan and Afghanistan cannot survive without each other,” the former National Assembly speaker emphasised. Akbar said the decision to join the Afghan war in the 1970s was “never a political but a decision by the military”. “They [the military leadership] told us that these are our people and they would be rehabilitated,” he said, claiming that the entire political leadership had expressed reservations. The KP speaker said that while there was “no doubt” that the country possessed brave armed forces, it “makes you think that peace is not being established despite having intelligence [operations]”. The jirga began with prayers for those martyred in terrorism across the province. ANP KP President Mian Iftikhar Hussain, former JI emir Sirajul Haq, PPP provincial leader Akhunzada Chattan, and delegations of the JUI-F and the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) are participating in the peace jirga. Former CM Mehmood Khan, ex-governor Shaukatullah Khan, Pakistan Mazdoor Kisan Party central chairman Afzal Shah Khamosh, lawyers, and stakeholders from various schools of thought are among other attendees. The moot came amid a recent spate of terror attacks across the country, with the federal capital also witnessing a rare deadly blast yesterday that killed at least 12 people. The terrorism situation in KP also remains concerning. In Dera Ismail Khan’s Daraban tehsil, a bomb attack targeted a security forces’ convoy yesterday, injuring at least 14 personnel. On Monday, the Cadet College in South Waziristan’s Wana came under attack . While all students and teachers were reported to have been safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed , the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals. “The actions by the enemies of peace in Bannu, Wana, and Islamabad before the jirga are a conspiracy to sabotage the peace process. The enemies of peace will fail, and peace is our future,” former KP minister Kamran Khan Bangash said on X before the moot began. Swati and Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi were welcomed by a police contingent when they arrived at the venue. JUI-F provincial emir Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman and provincial general secretary Senator Maulana Attaul Haq Dervesh were to represent the party in the jirga, according to party spokesperson Abdul Jalil Jan. From the JI, party leaders Prof Mohammad Ibrahim Khan and former senior minister Inayatullah Khan were to attend the peace moot, a spokesperson had told Dawn . No more good Taliban, bad Taliban: ANP Addressing the jirga, ANP’s Iftikhar said that there should be “no more good and bad Taliban” narrative , and that the policies of the past should be discontinued. “A complete implementation of the National Action Plan is important for eradicating terrorism and establishing peace. We can only make suggestions as the government would have to implement them,” he said. “The government must own it. The ANP bravely faced militancy, and we held talks but also owned the problems. We took all the stakeholders and launched an operation, cleared the Malakand division and rehabilitated the displaced people,” he noted. Regarding Pakistan’s relations with Afghanistan, Iftikhar said: “Both countries should respect each other and only dialogue could resolve the issues. All the trade routes with Afghanistan should be reopened immediately, and the border economy promoted. The federal and provincial governments must sit down and resolve issues.” What happened to past peace jirgas, asks ex-CM Mehmood Khan Ex-CM Mehmood, chairman of the PTI-Parliamentarians , shed light on the importance of holding talks and reaching a consensus. “I wonder what happened to the past peace jirgas?” he asked the participants. “You are the government, and people gave you the mandate,” he said, addressing the provincial government. “You will have to sit with the ‘key stakeholders’ and talk to them. A jirga comprising these people should be formed to discuss issues related to the province’s rights with the federal government.” ‘Peace above politics’ “Peace is more important for us than politics,” PTI’s Qaiser said before the jirga began, pointing out that political leaders of the entire province had been gathered today. Qaiser welcomed the participation of all political parties, including those in the opposition. “We will formulate a national policy through this jirga,” he said, adding that his party will present their demands before the Centre related to counter-terrorism.

      "summary_orig": "Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said that cowardly acts of terrorism would never weaken Pakistan’s resolve to deal with this menace. He made the remarks while addressing the two-day Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference being held in Islamabad, where he mentioned the suicide blast in the federal capital and the attack on the Cadet College in Wana. “Let me be very clear — these cowardly acts will never shake or weaken our national resolve to deal with this menace [terrorism],” he said. “If anything, they reaffirm our conviction that dialogue, understanding and partnership are the only sustainable path of peace and security,” he asserted. “We just witnessed two heinous acts of terrorism in Wana and Islamabad in the last 48 hours, resulting in the loss of 15 precious lives,” the minister said. Condemning the attacks and extending sympathies to the victims’ families, Dar went on to say: “We categorically reject acts of terrorism in all forms and manifestations, whether these take place in Islamabad or anywhere in the world.” Dar noted that terrorism was “one of the major global challenges of our time,” stressing that “Pakistan has been a bulwark against this menace that does not recognise any boundary or religion, gender, ethnicity or race”. The suicide blast in Islamabad, the first in the federal capital in nearly three years, came against the backdrop of international events being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue , while a tri-nation cricket series featuring Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe was also underway, with a match in Rawalpindi on Tuesday. Officials said the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had claimed responsibility for the suicide attack in Islamabad. According to the police, a lone bomber blew himself up at the main entrance to the complex, located in the G-11 sector, after failing in repeated attempts to enter the premises, where hundreds of litigants and lawyers were present. Meanwhile, security sources said on Wednesday that all the khawarij involved in the attack on Cadet College in Wana had been killed. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel.",

The plane had taken off from Ganja airport in western Azerbaijan on Tuesday afternoon but crashed shortly after crossing the border into eastern Georgia, the defence ministry said after the incident. It said there were 20 people on board, including the flight crew. “Our heroic comrades-in-arms were martyred on November 11, 2025 due to the crash of our C-130 military cargo aircraft, which had taken off from Azerbaijan to return to Turkiye,” Defence Minister Yasar Guler said in a statement posted on his X account alongside 20 photographs of those who died. Turkiye has not said what caused the accident but dramatic footage taken by eyewitnesses and published by Azerbaijani media appeared to show the plane spinning horizontally alongside several bits of debris as it fell. Georgia’s interior ministry had confirmed the plane went down in the Sighnaghi area, “about five kilometres (3.1 miles) from Georgia’s state border” with Azerbaijan. Georgian air traffic control said the plane had disappeared from its radar shortly after entering its airspace “without transmitting a distress signal” and that it had been alerted to the crash by the emergency services. The C-130 Hercules military cargo plane is made by US manufacturer Lockheed Martin. Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said he was “deeply saddened” by the crash and extended his condolences to Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and to the people of Turkiye. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the departed. Pakistan stands in full solidarity with our Turkish brothers and sisters in this hour of grief,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "LAKKI MARWAT: Three people, including a minor child, were killed and four suffered injuries in a quadcopter strike in the Sardikhel Janikhel area of Bannu district on Tuesday. A police official said the bodies and the injured were shifted to the district headquarters hospital. He identified the deceased as Habibullah, 5, a resident of Malikhel Janikhel, and Amjad Ali, 35, and Irfanullah, 35, residents of Sardikhel Janikhel, and said the injured included Rukhniaz, 35, Naheedullah, 24, Mohammad Rauf, 33, and Irshadullah, 35, all residents of Janikhel. Similar quadcopter attacks were carried out by terrorists against police installations and civilians in the district in the recent past. Terrorists kill police official; attack on police station repulsed On July 31, six security personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station amid an operation against terrorists in the Nurar area. In another quadcopter strike that took place four months ago, a woman was killed and three others were wounded in the Sra Bangla area of the district. Police said the Miryan police station had come under multiple quadcopter attacks in the last several months. They said that the attacks were being carried out by terrorists in the district. Meanwhile, a policeman was martyred when terrorists attacked him in the Walkhi Mammakhel area of Bannu district on Tuesday. A police official said the attack was reported within the limits of the Havaid police station. The deceased was identified as Ilyas, who was posted to the investigation wing at the Saddar police station. “Unidentified men opened fire on constable Ilyas near his house when he was coming to the Saddar police station to join his duty,” the official said, adding the assailants fled on motorcycles. He said that the body was transported to the district headquarters hospital to fulfil medico-legal formalities. The official said after the targeted killing of the constable, a large police contingent reached the area and launched a search for attackers. On Monday night, police repulsed a terrorist attack on a police station in the Ahmadzai area of Bannu district. The official said the terrorists carried out the attack with advanced light and heavy weapons in an attempt to breach the building, but the policemen foiled the bid. He added that in the retaliatory action, several terrorists were killed and injured but their accomplices took them away. According to a statement issued by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police director (public relations), Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and DPO Saleem Abbas Kulachi lauded policemen for their bravery and professionalism and said that the region’s police were in the frontline to protect their motherland and defeat terrorism. They said that the police were fully prepared and capable of countering any challenge effectively. Provincial Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed also praised the police for their quick and effective action against terrorists to protect the police station and said the police were always ready and alert for protecting people’s lives and properties. “Bannu police always showed excellent commitment to maintaining law and order and ensuring establishment of lasting peace in the region,” he said. The IGP announced cash rewards and appreciation certificates for the police team which foiled the terrorist attack. Separately, the terrorists torched the furniture in the government primary school in the Paharkhel Pacca area of Lakki Marwat district. The incident occurred at midnight within the limits of Ghaznikhel police station, according to an official. He said that unidentified armed men entered the school building and set the furniture and other goods on fire. The official said that the police had launched a search for culprits.

Security sources on Tuesday had continued the clearance operation against the terrorists hiding inside the educational institute. Early on Wednesday, security sources said that one suicide bomber and four other khawarij were killed in a successful operation. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Security sources said that the college building was currently being cleared due to the threat of landmines. They asserted that no student or teacher at the college was harmed during the successful operation. View this post on Instagram Speaking to Geo News shortly after midnight, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar termed the operation a “huge achievement” of the Pakistan Army, adding that 550 students were safely evacuated. He said that the attack on the college could have been a bigger incident than the attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in 2014. “The lives of these students were successfully saved using perseverance and expertise,” he said. “This was a difficult task and a sensitive operation. And our army has proven once again that it is included among the world’s best,” he said. The minister said that Pakistan had “won two wars” against India and Pakistan, lauding security forces. The minister said that Pakistan had proven its worth in conventional warfare and was also doing the same in the “proxy war”. He reiterated Islamabad’s demand that Afghanistan’s soil not be used for carrying out terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He said that investigations would be carried out into the attack in Wana as well as the suicide attack in Islamabad on Tuesday. “Concrete evidence of the attacks will be shared with friendly countries and international forums,” he said. The minister asserted that Pakistan would uncover those involved in terrorist activities. He said that security forces were alert and ready to deal with any eventuality. “We are in good hands. Our security is in strong hands, so there is nothing to worry about,” he said, reiterating that the operation was a “huge success”. On Tuesday, a report from DHQ Hospital Wana confirmed that nine civilians, including men, women and children, sustained injuries when the explosion caused nearby structures to collapse. Hospital MS Dr Jan Muhammad said all injured individuals were receiving full medical treatment and necessary facilities. PM, president vow action against foreign-backed terrorism Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari met at the Presidency a day earlier, where they discussed the country’s security situation in the wake of the attacks in Wana and Islamabad. Condemning the incidents, the premier and the president had an “exchange of views on the country’s overall political and security situation”, state-run PTV said in a post on X. “Both leaders reaffirm their resolve that actions against foreign-backed terrorists and their facilitators will continue until the complete elimination of terrorism,” PTV added. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past few years, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel. ‘Clear Afghan involvement’ Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Tuesday that it was “clear” that Afghanistan was directly involved in the attack. Noting that the terrorists had been identified as Afghan, the interior minister said the attackers’ “communication with their people in Afghanistan also continued the entire night”. Referring to multiple visits carried out by top Pakistani leadership to Afghanistan, Naqvi said: “The foreign minister, deputy prime minister, defence minister — we all have gone numerous times and presented them with evidence and details on how they (terrorists) are being trained in Afghanistan, how they plan and then come here to carry out attacks.” “We are very clear in this that Afghanistan must stop them under all circumstances. In case of not stopping them, we will have no other option but to deal with the terrorists who are attacking our country,“ he asserted. Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Tuesday that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",

      "summary_orig": "• Opposition alliance vows to step up efforts against controversial amendment • PTI leader alleges senators were pressurised to vote in favour of the bill ISLAMABAD: Leaders of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Tuesday claimed that false gods have been created through the 27th Constitutional Amendment. They also alleged that the false gods, created through the Amendment, have nefarious plans and that those who voted in its favour will suffer the most. Speaking at a press conference held at the National Press Club, the opposition alliance leaders said that the judiciary has been completely bulldozed and warned that there will be dangerous implications as some personalities have become above the law. They announced that they would step up their efforts to resist and repeal the controversial amendment. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said that the Constitution of Pakistan makes it clear that sovereignty rests with Allah alone. However, through the amendment, human beings have been made gods. He said that the President of Pakistan has been granted complete impunity, while, on the other hand, the judiciary has been controlled. He alleged that by passing the amendment, the government has ignored public opinion. However, he announced that the TTAP will not remain silent over the amendment, which he described as nothing but an attack on the rule of law. Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Secretary General Salman Akram Raja condemned the passage of the amendment in haste and alleged that the senators were pressurised to vote in its favour. He claimed that the judiciary has become toothless because of the amendment. On the other hand, the President and the Army Chief have been given impunity, and they will not be accountable for any action, even in cases of human rights abuses such as the abduction of people, he explained. PTI leader Sardar Latif Khosa, who was once an activist of the Pakistan Peoples Party, criticised the priorities of the government, claiming that it was working on the amendment rather than mourning the demise of Senator Irfan Siddiqui. He alleged that the haste of the government showed that it had no regard for the Constitution and human dignity. Advocate Khosa claimed that the amendment will make the Chief Justice powerless and that political interference in the courts will further increase. He said that if judges decide cases against the government, they will be transferred, and those who follow government directives will be rewarded. Former Senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that there is a general opinion among the masses against the 27th Amendment. He called upon the institutions to hear the voice of the people. He warned that the amendment will destroy the foundation of democracy and urged the judiciary to intervene and protect its own independence. Mr Khokhar said that the impunity given to the President and the Army Chief will set a dangerous precedent and will deprive people of their right to seek justice in cases of abuse of power. “So it is a threat to the Constitution and democracy,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "MANAMA: A de facto partition of Gaza between an area controlled by Israel and another ruled by Hamas is increasingly likely, multiple sources said, with efforts to advance US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war beyond a ceasefire faltering. Six European officials with direct knowledge of the efforts to implement the next phase of the plan told Reuters it was effectively stalled and that reconstruction now appeared likely to be limited to the Israel-controlled area. That could lead to years of separation, they warned. Under the first stage of the plan, which took effect on Oct 10, the Israeli military currently occupies 53 per cent of the Mediterranean territory, including much of its farmland, along with Rafah in the south, parts of Gaza City and other urban areas. Nearly all of Gaza’s 2 million people are crammed into tent camps and the rubble of shattered cities across the rest of Gaza, which is under Hamas control. Reuters drone footage shot in November shows cataclysmic destruction in the northeast of Gaza City after Israel’s final assault before the ceasefire, following months of prior bombardments. The area is now split between Israeli and Hamas control. The next stage of the plan foresees Israel withdrawing further from the so-called yellow line agreed under Trump’s plan, alongside the establishment of a transitional authority to govern Gaza, the deployment of a multinational security force meant to take over from the Israeli military, the disarmament of Hamas and the start of reconstruction. But the plan provides no timelines or mechanisms for implementation. Meanwhile, Hamas refuses to disarm, Israel rejects any involvement by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, and uncertainty persists over the multinational force. European officials say reconstruction appeared likely to be limited to Israel-controlled area, can lead to years of separation “We’re still working out ideas,” Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi said at a Manama security conference this month. “Everybody wants this conflict over, all of us want the same endgame here. Question is, how do we make it work?” Without a major push by the United States to break the impasse, the yellow line looks set to become the de facto border indefinitely dividing Gaza, according to 18 sources, among them the six European officials and a former US official familiar with the talks. The United States has drafted a UN Security Council resolution that would grant the multinational force and a transitional governing body a two-year mandate. But ten diplomats said governments remain hesitant to commit troops. European and Arab nations, in particular, were unlikely to participate if responsibilities extended beyond peacekeeping, and meant direct confrontation with Hamas or other Palestinian groups, they said. A State Department spokesperson said that while “tremendous progress” had been made in advancing Trump’s plan, there was more work to do, without responding to questions about whether reconstruction would be limited to the Israeli-controlled area. Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza City, said that the group was ready to hand over power to a Palestinian technocrat entity so that reconstruction could begin. “All the regions of Gaza deserve reconstruction equally,” he said. Gaza City resident Salah Abu Amr, 62, said that if no progress was made on disarming Hamas and redevelopment began across the yellow line, people might think of moving there. But the realities of a divided Gaza were hard to contemplate, he said. “Are we all going to be able to move into that area? Or Israel will have a veto over the entry of some of us,” he said. “Are they also going to divide the families between good people, bad people?” It remains unclear who would finance rebuilding parts of Gaza under Israeli occupation, with Gulf nations loath to step in without involvement of the Palestinian Auth­ority and a path to statehood, resisted by Israel. Reconstruction costs are estimated at $70 billion. Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin also rejected territorial division of Gaza, and said the Palestinian Authority was ready to assume “full national responsibility.” “There can be no genuine reconstruction or lasting stability without full Palestinian sovereignty over the territory,” she said in a statement in response to questions.

      "summary_orig": "• Justice Jawwad asks top court to set aside 27th Amendment • Argues certain constitutional commands can’t be altered in a way that destroys their essence ISLAMABAD: Former chief justice Jawwad S. Khawaja on Tuesday challenged the 27th Amendment , seeking a direction that the Supreme Court (SC) retains exclusive jurisdiction to determine the lawfulness and constitutionality of the proposed amendment. Filed through Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, the petitioner pleaded before the apex court to strike down or suspend any provisions in any Act of Parliament, including the 27th Amendment, which reduce or abolish any constitutional jurisdiction of the SC or which purport to vest any such jurisdiction in any other court or body. The petition also requested the apex court to set aside provisions of the 27th Amendment, which relate to transfer of high court judges with a request that until a final decision of this petition and as a matter of urgency. The ex-CJ explained that he has filed the petition to save the SC that he claimed was on the verge of being abolished as a constitutional court. By the time of hearing of this petition, the petition argued, the Constitution might have already been amended in a manner that purports to take away SC’s constitutional jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the terms of such amendment, it is the petitioner’s case that the country’s top court must hear this petition immediately, as at the date of filing of this petition, the apex cou­rt exists as a constitutional court. The petition seeks to enforce the command of the Consti­tution, which stipulates that “the independence of the judiciary shall be fully secured”. The petition contended the question before this court was whether the constitutional jurisdiction of the apex court could be abolished. The ex-CJ argued that he had “no personal interest” in this case, adding the relief sought was for the benefit of all citizens of Pakistan. “This petition and any adjudication will have an immediate impact on the fundamental rights of citizens,” he stated, adding that if SC’s constitutional jurisdiction was abolished, the people would be deprived of an independent apex forum to approach for enforcement of fundamental rights. Cornerstone of Constitution According to the petitioner, the constitutional jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as an independent apex judicial body was a cornerstone of the 1973 Constitution. Any att­empt to abolish, diminish, or subordinate the apex court undermines the very architecture of the constit­utional order and is inconsistent with the will of the people as expressed in the 1973 Con­stitution, he argued. According to him, the independence and jurisdiction of the SC are constitutional commands and the parliamentarians act as fiduciaries of the people and cannot go against these constitutional commands as set out in the preamble of the Constitution. He was of the opinion that even a constitutional ame­ndment could not abr­ogate SC’s constitutional jurisdiction. Therefore, any attempt to abolish or und­e­rmine the SC’s constitutional aut­hor­ity would violate the foundational principles of Constitution and thr­eaten the continuity of the constitutional order itself, he added. The framers of the Constitution intentionally enshrined SC’s authority in a manner that underscored its independence and centrality to the constitutional system, he said. Its powers and jurisdiction were constitutional imperatives integral to the Con­s­titution, according to the former chief justice. The petitioner argued that the SC had already recognised that certain constitutional commands set out by the people, including judicial independence, could not be altered in a way that destroyed their essence.

      "title_orig": "Attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan ‘cannot be ruled out’, Asif says after attacks rock Pakistan",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after today’s incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. At least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured in a suicide blast in the federal capital. The incident occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a cricket match between the Green shirts and Sri Lanka was also being held in Pindi. Meanwhile, a clearance operation by security forces continues in Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan against terrorists hiding inside the educational institute. When asked during an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ if Pakistan would respond after today’s attacks and statements from the leadership linking them to Afghanistan, Asif said: “God willing”, adding that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan “could not be ruled out” and could definitely happen. The defence minister added that Pakistan was “compelled” to act after today’s attacks. The defence minister said that there should be no more illusions that the Afghan Taliban were sympathisers of Pakistan or were sincere in wanting peace. “Let’s not fool ourselves … there were three rounds of talks,” he said. He elaborated that there was no united government in Kabul and instead it was composed of various groups and factions with different interests and agendas. “Some are linked with India and some have their strings being pulled from elsewhere, so both of these incidents, I think, are a prelude to a coming aggression that could happen from the Afghan side, actually, it will be Indian aggression that is being waged in our country through the route of Afghanistan.” “There should be no misunderstanding about this, it is absolutely clear-cut that the enmity of our neighbour has come out in the open,” he added, saying that Pakistan had asked only one thing of the Afghan Taliban during the dialogue process and nothing else: to prevent terrorism from Afghan soil. “All these terrorists have come from there and their formations have penetrated into Pakistan over many months. They’ve been slowly stationing these groups here for the past year; they’ve sent around 2,500-3,000 people in the past year, and they’re present in various areas.” “Pakistan doesn’t have training camps or their sanctuaries so they come here and live with someone in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. You cannot ignore another factor: that around 55 per cent of terrorists killed were Afghans, not Pakistanis. So how can you deny this reality?” “We have the capacity, we can take care of them. But we don’t want to be bogged down in a war and for our attention to be diverted from our economic recovery and other issues. This is a natural wish of ours that we want peace in our country,” said Asif when asked about reports linking the terrorists involved in the Wana attack to Afghanistan. “If they want to disturb our peace, then we will have to respond in kind to them, there should be no doubt about it.” The minister added that Pakistan could not depend on verbal guarantees by the Afghan side, saying that no one trusted the word of Kabul’s rulers in the neighbouring country itself. Questioned about action against terrorists, the defence minister said there was no uncertainty about the matter. He said when terrorist groups were encountered during their attempts to cross the border, they were often chased in “hot pursuit” into Afghan territory with “physical and aerial retaliation and we will intensify this in the coming period”. Meanwhile, on the blast in New Delhi and the developing narrative from the Indian authorities on the situation, Asif said: “I won’t be surprised if in the next few hours or tomorrow India blames us for this.” Despite this, the defence minister stressed: “I want to assure our eastern and western neighbours that Pakistan is not interested in fighting with them. We are passing through a phase where we are consolidating our economic gains and this is a critical issue for us that we are slowly opening our economic shackles.” “During this period, it would be absolutely crazy for us to go somewhere and start engaging in terrorism. This is not in our interest, whether it is Pahalgam or Kabul or Delhi. This can never happen; logic cannot accept that we do such irresponsible adventures when the situation is in flux.” However, he clarified that the stance did not mean that Pakistan would not respond to any aggression against it. “I assure India. Afghanistan and the international community that Pakistan will never initiate any adventure or war or support any terrorist activity directly or indirectly, but side-by-side, I will say that we will pay back in the same coin if we are targeted,” Asif declared. He further added that any Indian adventure against Pakistan ahead of the second phase of the Bihar elections could not be ruled out, saying that there was a “stark possibility” of such a “drama” being staged. The defence minister reiterated that Pakistan had not lowered its guard since the May conflict between the two countries and was still on high alert to repel any “adventure or military initiative by India”.",

He said when terrorist groups were encountered during their attempts to cross the border, they were often chased in “hot pursuit” into Afghan territory with “physical and aerial retaliation and we will intensify this in the coming period”. Meanwhile, on the blast in New Delhi and the developing narrative from the Indian authorities on the situation, Asif said: “I won’t be surprised if in the next few hours or tomorrow India blames us for this.” Despite this, the defence minister stressed: “I want to assure our eastern and western neighbours that Pakistan is not interested in fighting with them. We are passing through a phase where we are consolidating our economic gains and this is a critical issue for us that we are slowly opening our economic shackles.” “During this period, it would be absolutely crazy for us to go somewhere and start engaging in terrorism. This is not in our interest, whether it is Pahalgam or Kabul or Delhi. This can never happen; logic cannot accept that we do such irresponsible adventures when the situation is in flux.” However, he clarified that the stance did not mean that Pakistan would not respond to any aggression against it. “I assure India. Afghanistan and the international community that Pakistan will never initiate any adventure or war or support any terrorist activity directly or indirectly, but side-by-side, I will say that we will pay back in the same coin if we are targeted,” Asif declared. He further added that any Indian adventure against Pakistan ahead of the second phase of the Bihar elections could not be ruled out, saying that there was a “stark possibility” of such a “drama” being staged. The defence minister reiterated that Pakistan had not lowered its guard since the May conflict between the two countries and was still on high alert to repel any “adventure or military initiative by India”.",

      "summary_orig": "A bomb attack in the Daraban tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan on Tuesday injured at least 14 security personnel. The attack, said to be a remotely controlled improvised explosive device (IED), targeted a security forces convoy, said security sources. The explosion heavily damaged a security forces vehicle. The injured were shifted to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) D.I Khan. The attack came at a time when security forces were battling terrorists who attacked Cadet College Wana in North Waziristan. While all teachers and students were reported on Tuesday evening to have been safely evacuated, a clearance operation remained underway to neutralise three terrorists who managed to infiltrate the building. Security forces added that three of the personnel were said to be in critical condition. Following the attack, a large contingent of police and security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area. A search operation was launched to sanitise the area. Earlier on Monday, security forces killed 20 terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in KP — eight in North Waziristan and 12 in the Dara Adam Khel district. Another four were eliminated in Balochistan’s Kalat. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel. Attack on Bannu police station thwarted Separately, KP police said they thwarted a late-night attack on the Ahmadzai Police Station in the Bannu district. In a press release, KP Police said “miscreants attempted to attack the police station with small and big weapons” in the early hours of Tuesday, but it was foiled due to the cops’ timely response. The statement added that the policemen present inside the building thwarted the attack through their “swift and effective action”, with multiple terrorists killed and injured. The bodies were taken by the attackers, the police said. KP Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed hailed the policemen for their response and asserted that the personnel were “ready and alert at all times to protect the public”. IG Hameed also announced a cash reward and certificates of appreciation for the police team involved in repelling the attack. Pictures shared by KP Police showed multiple kinds of weapons, including hand grenades, lying on the ground in the wake of the attack. Some parts of the police station building were damaged. This photo combo shows weapons lying around the Ahmadzai police station in Bannu. — KP Police Cop gunned down in Bannu; school torched in Lakki Marwat Police on Tuesday night killed two terrorists in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Mamakhel Havaid area of Bannu. The operation was conducted by the police and counter-terrorism department (CTD) personnel following credible information about the presence of terrorists in the area. In a press release, KP police’s director public relations said that the law enforcement personnel swung into action when they received authentic reports that terrorists had come to the area with an intention of executing their nefarious plan. He added that an intense exchange of fire took place when the law enforcers came across the terrorists. “The gun battle lasted for half an hour, resulting in the elimination of two terrorists”, he claimed, adding the bodies of slain militants were found during a search operation launched soon after the gunfight. He identified the killed terrorists as Fazlullah alias Faizullah alias Hanzala and Saifur Rehman and said that they were involved in target killing of policemen and attacks on police stations. Among other acts, the two terrorists had killed a former police official and threw his body near the Naley Bridge in the Daud Shah area of Bannu district on Tuesday night. A police official said that a group of terrorists had kidnapped former ASI Abid Khan from the same area within the limits of the cantonment police station two days ago. Abid Khan, resident of Kurrum Garhi Mamandkhel, who also served as SHO in the Wazir subdivision, had been dismissed from service a week ago. In another incident in Bannu, a policeman embraced martyrdom when unknown terrorists targeted him in the Walkhi Mammakhel area today. The district police office’s (DPO) spokesman Bashir confirmed the incident, adding that it occurred within the limits of the Havaid police station. He identified the deceased cop as Ilyas and said that he was posted to the investigation wing at the Saddar police station. “Unknown gunmen opened fire on Constable Ilyas near his house when he was coming to the Saddar police station to join his duty,“ Bashir said, adding the assailants fled the place on their motorcycles. He said the martyred cop’s body was taken to the District Headquarters Hospital to complete medico-legal formalities. The spokesman added that after the targeted killing, a large police contingent reached the area and launched a search for the assailants. The funeral prayer of a martyred policeman is offered in Bannu on Nov 10, 2025. — via author In Lakki Marwat, terrorists torched the furniture in a government primary school in the Paharkhel Pacca area. A police official said that the incident occurred at midnight within the limits of Ghaznikhel police station.

The official said that the police had launched a search in the area to hunt down the perpetrators of the vandalism.",
