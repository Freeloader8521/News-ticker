      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned the Taliban regime on Wednesday that Islamabad would strike “deep into Afghanistan” if Afghan soil was used to launch terror attacks on Pakistan. In a pre-dawn announcement , Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the latest round of talks between the two countries in Turkiye, which aimed to address cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghan soil, “failed to bring about any workable solution”. “We will conduct strikes, we definitely will,” Asif told reporters at Parliament House, when asked about the options available for Pakistan in case of cross-border attacks from Afghanistan. “If their territory is used and they violate our territory, then, if we need to go deep into Afghanistan to retaliate, we surely will,” he added. The defence minister said Afghanistan neither “fulfils the definition of a state” nor did the interim administration consider it so. “They are benefiting financially by being the rulers.” Asked whether the Afghan Taliban were taking their country towards a similar situation as the United States’ military operation in Tora Bora in December 2001, Asif said, “It is definitely a possibility.” Asif’s latest remarks come hours after he issued a strongly worded warning to the Taliban rulers in Kabul, telling them to test Islamabad’s resolve at their\n“own peril and doom” if they wished to do so. “We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Asif posted on social media platform X. The defence minister said that Pakistan had indulged in talks to give peace a chance on the request of brotherly countries, who were persistently being beseeched by the rulers in Kabul, however, “venomous statements by certain Afghan officials clearly reflect the devious and splintered mindset of Taliban regime”. “Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora , with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region.” Asif further accused the Taliban rulers in Kabul of “blindly pushing Afghanistan into yet another conflict, just to retain its usurped rule and maintain the war economy that sustains them”. “Despite fully knowing their inherent limitations and hollowness of their war cries, they are beating the war drums to maintain their crumbling facade. If the Afghan Taliban regime is madly hell-bent upon ruining Afghanistan and its innocent people once again, then so be it,” he said. In his post, Asif also referred to the phrase “graveyard of empires” used for Afghanistan in connection with the historical instances of several nations failing to conquer the country. “As far as the narrative of ‘graveyard of empires’, Pakistan certainly doesn’t claim it to be an empire but Afghanistan is definitely a graveyard, surely for its own people. Never a graveyard of empires but certainly a playground of empires you have been throughout history,” Asif commented. He said the “war mongers amongst the Taliban regime, who have vested interests in the continuation of instability in the region, should know that they have probably misread our resolve and courage”. “If the Taliban regime wants to fight us, the world will Insha Allah (God willing) see that their threats are only performative circus!” UN expresses concern over talk failure In a separate development, the United Nations voiced concern over the collapse of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, hoping that the “fighting will not renew”. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was asked about the collapse of the negotiations and whether it was a concern for the UN. “Yes, it is, of course. We very much hope that even if the talks are on pause, the fighting will not renew,” he told reporters at the regular noon briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, APP reported. From border skirmishes to talk failure Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter statements and and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from the Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha , which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. The information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists. “The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said. The statement from the information minister came hours after Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations. Earlier, when the second round of talks had begun between the two sides on Oct 25, Asif had warned that failure to reach an agreement would mean “open war”. Additional input from APP",

Pakistan and Iran agreed in August that peace and prosperity in their border regions hinged on effectively combating terrorism. The nearly 900-kilometre border between the two countries has long faced security threats from proscribed groups, such as Jaish al-Adl and the Balochistan Liberation Army. Pakistan and Iran share close ties but persistent issues, including terrorism, smuggling, and mutual accusations of harbouring militants, have periodically strained relations. The interior minister is currently on a visit to Iran at a time of sustained tension with two of Pakistan’s neighbours, Iran and Afghanistan. A press release issued today said he met President Pezeshkian, with the two discussing bilateral and bilateral cooperation. “Iran and Pakistan are partners in regional peace and stability,” the press release quoted Naqvi as saying, adding that he conveyed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s “message of goodwill” to President Pezeshkian. The interior minister also briefed the Iranian president on matters related to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, with Pezeshkian offering to play a “fraternal role” in easing the tensions between the two countries. President Pezeshkian said Iran attached “special importance” to its relations with Pakistan and it could not forget the “immense support” from Islamabad. Expressing satisfaction over bilateral relations, the Iranian president stressed the need for enhanced cooperation between the two countries to take advantage of vast opportunities. Islamabad and Tehran’s renewed commitment to maintaining regional peace comes at a time when Pakistan is witnessing a deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with recent border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.

Meetings with Iranian security officials Naqvi also held separate meetings with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Ardeshir Larijani and Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni during his visit to Tehran. Naqvi and Larijani discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations and enhance cooperation in the field of security. The meeting focused on counterterrorism, anti-narcotics efforts, and improved border management between the two, with both sides emphasising the need for closer collaboration and institutional linkages to address shared challenges. “We are keen to expand cooperation with Iran, especially in the areas of security and counter-narcotics,” Naqvi said. Secretary Larijani described the positive progress in bilateral relations as “encouraging and constructive”. In a separate meeting, the two interior ministers discussed expanding mutual cooperation on internal security matters. Naqvi congratulated his Iranian counterpart on the successful hosting of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) Ministerial Conference, terming it a “significant milestone with far-reaching implications” for member states. “We wish to benefit from each other’s experiences on internal security matters,” Naqvi said, extending an invitation to Momeni to visit Pakistan. Accepting the invitation, Momeni said he would soon travel to Islamabad and also thanked Naqvi for Pakistan’s participation in the ECO conference.

After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. Meetings with Iranian security officials Naqvi also held separate meetings with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Ardeshir Larijani and Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni during his visit to Tehran. Naqvi and Larijani discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations and enhance cooperation in the field of security. The meeting focused on counterterrorism, anti-narcotics efforts, and improved border management between the two, with both sides emphasising the need for closer collaboration and institutional linkages to address shared challenges. “We are keen to expand cooperation with Iran, especially in the areas of security and counter-narcotics,” Naqvi said. Secretary Larijani described the positive progress in bilateral relations as “encouraging and constructive”. In a separate meeting, the two interior ministers discussed expanding mutual cooperation on internal security matters. Naqvi congratulated his Iranian counterpart on the successful hosting of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) Ministerial Conference, terming it a “significant milestone with far-reaching implications” for member states. “We wish to benefit from each other’s experiences on internal security matters,” Naqvi said, extending an invitation to Momeni to visit Pakistan. Accepting the invitation, Momeni said he would soon travel to Islamabad and also thanked Naqvi for Pakistan’s participation in the ECO conference. Interior Secretary Khurram Agha, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Muhammad Mudassir Tipu, senior officials from Iran’s interior ministry and diplomatic representatives were also present during the meetings.",

The cargo arrived aboard the Suezmax vessel MT Pegasus and docked at Cnergyico’s Single Point Mooring (SPM) port situated on the coast of Balochistan. In August, it was reported that Cnergyico will import 1 million barrels of oil from Vitol this month. “The arrival of Pakistan’s first-ever US crude oil cargo marks an important milestone for the country’s energy sector and for Cnergyico,” Vice Chairman of Cnergyico Pk Limited Usama Qureshi told Dawn.com . “This first shipment will be followed by another in mid-November and a third in January 2026,” he stated, adding that collectively, “these three cargoes are expected to improve Pakistan’s trade balance with the United States by around $200 million”. Qureshi said the SPM facility, the country’s only offshore crude handling terminal, the company can efficiently receive large vessels, reduce logistics costs, and enhance refinery operations. “These imports not only diversify Pakistan’s crude supply but also strengthen bilateral trade ties and contribute to the country’s long-term energy security,” the vice chairman added. In September, Cnergyico had ordered a second shipment of US crude after finding its debut purchase commercially viable, according to its vice chairman, paving the way for more imports. In 2023, Cnergyico had imported the country’s first private-sector shipment of Russian crude oil, taking advantage of Moscow’s discounts on its oil exports.",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan calls for cessation of Gaza ceasefire violations after Israeli strikes kill over 100",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Wednesday called for the immediate cessation of Gaza ceasefire violations by Israel after the latter’s strike on the Palestinian enclave killed more than 100 people. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 104 people were killed after Israel carried out air strikes on the Palestinian territory yesterday, accusing Hamas of violating the truce by killing a soldier, which the group denied. The renewed Israeli bombardment prompted strong condemnation from Pakistan, one of the eight Muslim countries that worked with the United States on President Donald Trump’s peace plan . “Pakistan strongly condemns the renewed attacks by the Israeli occupying forces in Gaza, which have reportedly resulted in civilian casualties,” the Foreign Office said in a statement. “These actions constitute a clear and flagrant violation of international law, as well as a breach of the recently concluded peace agreement,” the FO said, warning that such “aggressive measures by the Israeli occupation forces threaten to undermine the international efforts aimed at establishing durable peace and stability in the region”. “Pakistan calls upon the international community to ensure an immediate cessation of ceasefire violations by the Israeli occupation forces,” it added. The statement reiterated Pakistan’s principled position for the establishment of an independent State of Palestine based on the pre-June 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. “At least 101 fatalities were brought to hospitals, including 35 children and a number of women and elderly, as a result of Israeli air strikes in less than 12 hours,” said Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency. “The Israeli strikes targeted tents for displaced people, homes and the vicinity of a hospital in the Strip,” Bassal told AFP . The agency’s toll was confirmed by an AFP tally of reports from medical officials at five Gaza hospitals that received the dead and wounded. The territory’s main Al-Shifa hospital said one of the strikes hit its backyard. Al-Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp. “We had just started to breathe again, trying to rebuild our lives, when the bombardment came back,” said Khadija al-Husni, who lives in a tent at a school in the Al-Shati refugee camp. “It’s a crime. Either there is a truce or a war — it can’t be both. The children couldn’t sleep; they thought the war was over.” Gaza civil defence agency’s Bassal called the strikes “a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”. However, Trump insisted that “nothing“ would jeopardise the truce he helped broker. During a trip to Asia, the US president defended the actions of its longtime ally Israel, saying, “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back.” The Israeli military said today it had reinstated the Gaza ceasefire, claiming that “dozens of terror targets and terrorists were struck”. It said its military forces and the Israel Security Agency, also known as Shin Bet, “struck 30 terrorists holding command positions” within fighter groups operating in Gaza. Israel warns Hamas leadership will have no immunity Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas leaders today that they would have no immunity after a wave of Israeli air strikes on Gaza, which Tel Aviv said was carried out in response to an attack on its troops. “There will be no immunity for anyone in the leadership of the terrorist organisation Hamas — neither for those in suits nor for those hiding in tunnels,” Katz said, referring to several Hamas political leaders residing in Doha. “Whoever raises a hand against an [Israeli] soldier, his hand will be severed. The [Israeli military] has been instructed to act decisively against every Hamas target and will continue to do so.” Qatar has played a key mediating role in indirect talks between Israel and Hamas since the outbreak of the war in October 2023, and is among the guarantors of the fragile peace deal, along with the US, Egypt, and Turkiye. On September 9, Israel targeted Hamas negotiators in Doha, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack triggered widespread condemnation and drew a rebuke from Trump as well. Weeks later, Israel and Hamas accepted a 20-point peace plan presented by Trump that called for the release of Gaza hostages and Palestinian prisoners, as well as a ceasefire after two years of deadly conflict. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will head to Turkiye next week to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers of the eight countries that worked on the Gaza peace plan to discuss the next steps. Officials have said Pakistan is expected to announce soon whether it will contribute troops to the International Stabilisation Force being assembled for Gaza. The reported chances of Islamabad doing so have raised questions among Pakistani politicians and journalists.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again praised both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir while reiterating his role in ending a four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May. Earlier this month, Trump had thanked PM Shehbaz and COAS Munir, his “favourite”, for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza. He had also called both of them “great people” while offering to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Today, while addressing a luncheon at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) — which is being hosted in Gyeongju, South Korea this year — Trump talked about both India and Pakistan, as well as the conflict between the countries earlier this year. “I’m doing a trade deal with India and I have great respect and love as you know for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said. “Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the Field Marshal — they have a Field Marshal. You know why he’s a Field Marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy too. “And so I know them all. And I’m reading that seven planes were shot down — they’re going at it and they’re really starting to go, and it’s a big thing. These are two nuclear nations and they’re really going at it,” Trump said. The US president went on to say that he called Modi and said: “We can’t make a trade deal with you. ‘No, no, we must make a trade deal’. I said, “No we can’t. You’re starting a war with Pakistan, we’re not gonna do it.” He added that he then had a similar conversation with Pakistan’s leadership.\n“I said, ‘We’re not gonna do trade with you because you’re fighting with India’. “And they said, ‘No no no … you should let us fight’. They both said that. You know, they’re warring. They’re strong people.” Trump then called Modi the “nicest looking guy”, and proceeded to do an impression of the Indian leader while adding that “he’s a killer” and “tough as hell”. “But after a while — and they’re good people — and after literally two days, they called up and they said, ‘We understand’. And they stopped fighting. How is that? Isn’t that amazing? “You think Biden would’ve done that? I don’t think so,” he tacked on. “Most people wouldn’t have thought of it.” He said, “We’re doing deals. So you add an extra sentence and you say, ‘You have to stop shooting at each other’. Seven planes were shot down … and they stopped the war.” The president attributed the success to his aggressive approach with tariffs , saying, “I said I was going to put 250 per cent tariffs on each country, which means that you’ll never do business … within 48 hours, we had no war, no people killed,” he said. Meanwhile, the May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.",

      "summary_orig": "A constitutional bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Peshawar High Court (PHC) to decide PTI leader Shibli Faraz’s appeal against his disqualification as a senator. Faraz, along with former National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub, first approached the PHC. However, it had decided to adjourn sine die (for indefinite period) the pleas, directing the petitioners to first surrender before the competent court. Later, the PTI leaders challenged the high court’s decision before the SC. Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, a five-member CB resumed proceedings on Shibli’s appeal, after Ayub had withdrawn his during the last hearing on Monday. The bench also included Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Shakeel Ahmad. Faraz’s appeal challenges the PHC’s decision to indefinitely adjourn its hearings on his petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) notification de-seating him as the Senate opposition leader. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for Faraz, while Additional Attorney General for Pakistan (AAG) Aamir Rehman represented the state. “We were removed by the election commission with great disgrace,” Gohar contended as the hearing began. He requested that a stay order be issued on the ECP notification removing his client as a member of the upper house of Parliament, thereby halting the by-election on the vacant seat. Responding to Justice Rizvi’s question, Gohar replied that a by-election on just one Senate seat was to be held tomorrow. Justice Rizvi also wondered why Faraz was seeking a stay order on the by-election when the PTI had also nominated candidates. Subsequently, the bench dismissed Gohar’s request, stating that it would not interfere in the by-election process. A by-election to fill the general seat of the Senate from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday). PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan and Irfan Saleem are contesting against PPP’s Nisar Khan and independent candidates Taj Mohammad Afridi and Abid Khan Yousafzai. During the hearing, the ECP lawyer contended that convicts needed to surrender before a court prior to seeking any relief. Justice Mazhar asked whether the PHC had decided on the maintainability of Faraz’s petition, to which Gohar replied that the court had not disposed of the case. “We cannot do anything in this case at this point,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. AAG Rehman also stated that the PHC should have decided the case. Here, the ECP lawyer said the PHC had observed that the petitioners were seeking to evade the law. At this, Justice Mandokhail asked, “Do the petitioners come to the PHC? If they do, then why are they not arrested there?” The AAG responded that the petitioners “should have also come to the Supreme Court but they did not”. Justice Mandokhail noted that the case before the bench only pertained to rights, to which AAG Rehman replied, “Rights are directly related to punishment. The petitioner was convicted by an anti-terrorism court.” Justice Rizvi remarked, “The Peshawar High Court wrote 31 pages instead of a short order. It should have simply written a paragraph.” After hearing the arguments of all the parties, the bench struck down the PHC order to adjourn its hearings for an indefinite period and ordered the high court to hear the respondents and decide Faraz’s petition. Subsequently, the bench disposed of the PTI leader’s appeal. PHC denies relief On July 31, Faraz, along with Ayub and other lawmakers, was sentenced to 10 years in jail by a Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) for his involvement in the riots. Subsequently, he was disqualified as the Senate opposition leader under Article 63(1h) (disqualification from parliament due to conviction) of the Constitution. On Aug 25, a Faisalabad ATC again sentenced Faraz and Ayub, among others, to 10 years in prison in a case involving an attack on PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah’s residence during the May 9 protests. The PTI leaders had challenged their disqualifications before the PHC, which initially allowed them interim relief by restraining the ECP from taking any action against them. However, the PHC earlier this month denied the duo, as well as then-MNA Abdul Latif Chitrali, any relief. It ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court and adjourned the petitions for an indefinite period, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats. The court recalled multiple stay orders issued earlier, wherein the ECP , the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker were directed not to proceed further on their impugned notifications. Ayub withdrew his appeal before the SC against his denotification as the NA opposition leader, on the grounds that Mehmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated for the role. Polling on the Haripur (NA-18) seat left vacant due to Ayub’s disqualification will be held on November 23, the ECP has said. According to Gohar, Ayub’s wife would contest the by-election for the seat vacated by her husband.",

      "summary_orig": "An Islamabad district and sessions court on Wednesday upheld a non-bailable arrest warrant issued for former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur around a week ago over his continued absence from the hearings of a 2016 arms and liquor case. Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024 , September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025 , Sept 10, 2025 and October 21, 2025 . During today’s hearing, too, both Gandapur and his lawyer, Raja Zahoor-ul-Hassan, failed to appear in court. Subsequently, Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti upheld the court’s previous order and directed the relevant authorities to arrest and present Gandapur in the court. The court adjourned the hearing till November 11. Arms and liquor case The case dates back to Oct 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located. The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on Nov 2. Gandapur had denied the police allegations, asserting that he was travelling with two licensed Kalashnikov rifles and that the vehicle contained a valid arms licence. He further claimed that the liquor bottle in question actually contained honey. Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the federal capital’s Bhara Kahu police station. During a previous hearing, Gandapur, while speaking to the media outside the courtroom, had dismissed the case as “politically motivated.” “There is nothing in this case. I wasn’t even present when it was filed, and the vehicle in question wasn’t mine,” he had claimed.",

Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024 , September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025 , Sept 10, 2025 and October 21, 2025 . During today’s hearing, too, both Gandapur and his lawyer, Raja Zahoor-ul-Hassan, failed to appear in court. Subsequently, Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti upheld the court’s previous order and directed the relevant authorities to arrest and present Gandapur in the court. The court adjourned the hearing till November 11. Arms and liquor case The case dates back to Oct 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located. The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on Nov 2. Gandapur had denied the police allegations, asserting that he was travelling with two licensed Kalashnikov rifles and that the vehicle contained a valid arms licence. He further claimed that the liquor bottle in question actually contained honey. Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the federal capital’s Bhara Kahu police station. During a previous hearing, Gandapur, while speaking to the media outside the courtroom, had dismissed the case as “politically motivated.” “There is nothing in this case. I wasn’t even present when it was filed, and the vehicle in question wasn’t mine,” he had claimed.",

      "summary_orig": "Millions of supporters of Bangladesh’s Awami League will boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls, ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told Reuters on Wednesday from her exile in New Delhi. Hasina, 78, said she would not return to Bangladesh under any government formed after elections that exclude her party, and plans to remain in India, where she fled in August 2024 following a deadly student-led uprising. An interim government headed by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has governed Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has pledged to hold elections next February. “The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” Hasina said in emailed responses to Reuters . “The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works.” Hopes Awami League will be allowed to contest Bangladesh has over 126 million registered voters. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have long dominated the country’s politics, and the BNP is widely expected to win the upcoming vote. The Election Commission suspended the Awami League’s registration in May. Earlier, the Yunus-led government banned all party activities, citing national security threats and war crimes investigations into senior Awami League leaders. “We are not asking Awami League voters to support other parties,” Hasina said. “We still hope common sense will prevail and we will be allowed to contest the election ourselves.” She did not say if she or anyone else on her behalf was holding any back-channel talks with Bangladeshi authorities to let the Awami League participate in the polls. Separately, in comments to AFP , Hasina also warned that holding elections without her party was “sowing the seeds” of further division in her country. Hasina, credited with transforming Bangladesh’s economy but accused of human rights abuses and suppressing dissent, won a fourth consecutive term in 2024. That election was boycotted by the main opposition, whose top leaders were either jailed or in exile. The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court, has concluded proceedings against Hasina, who faces charges of crimes against humanity over the violent crackdown on student protests in mid-2024. According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most from gunfire by security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence. Prosecutors also allege she oversaw enforced disappearances and torture of opposition activists through clandestine detention centres run by security agencies. A verdict is expected on November 13. Hasina denied the charges, saying she was not personally involved in the use of lethal force or other alleged crimes. “These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” she said. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself.” While, in written responses to AFP , Hasina also condemned her crimes against humanity trial as a “jurisprudential joke” No plans to return home yet Despite the political turmoil, Hasina said the Awami League would eventually return to play a role in Bangladesh’s future — whether in government or opposition — and that her family need not lead it. Her son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, who lives in Washington, told Reuters last year he might consider leading the party if asked. “It’s really not about me or my family,” Hasina said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.“ Hasina, whose father and three brothers were killed in a 1975 military coup while she and her sister were abroad, said she lives freely in Delhi but remains cautious given her family’s violent history. A few months ago, a Reuters reporter saw Hasina taking a quiet stroll through Delhi’s historic Lodhi Garden, accompanied by two individuals who appeared to be her personal security detail. She acknowledged passersby with a nod as some recognised her. “I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” she said. Hasina’s departure triggered targeted violence against Awami League workers, though the streets have since remained largely calm. However, clashes erupted earlier this month during the signing of a charter for state reform. ‘Open fire on crowds’ Hasina was defended by a state-appointed lawyer, but said she would only recognise an “impartial” process, such as one at the ICC. “The charge that I personally directed security forces to open fire on crowds is bogus,” she told AFP , although she admitted that “some mistakes were certainly made within the chain of command”. “But on the whole, the decisions made by senior government officials were proportionate in nature, made in good faith and intended to minimise the loss of life.” The prosecution, who insist the trial was fair, have played audio tapes verified by police that suggested Hasina directly ordered her security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters. Hasina claimed the recordings had been “taken out of context”. She also pointed to a crackdown on her loyalists since her fall, including when security forces in February launched “ Operation Devil Hunt ”, arresting thousands accused of trying to “destabilise” the country. At the same time, she gave no information on the fate of the hundreds, if not thousands, of missing victims reported to have vanished into secret detention centres during her rule. Earlier this month, lawyers for the Awami League requested that the ICC investigate reported “retaliatory violence”. This includes allegations of “beatings and lynchings” which have “no realistic prospect” of being prosecuted in Bangladesh, senior British barrister Steven Powles KC said in a statement. As for the future, when asked by AFP if she plans a return to politics, Hasina replied: “My priority is the welfare and stability of Bangladesh.”",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump said on Wednesday “nothing” would jeopardise the ceasefire in Gaza, after Israel carried out air strikes on the Palestinian territory accusing Hamas of violating the truce, which the group denied. Gaza’s civil defence agency said that Israeli attacks had killed at least 50 people, including 22 children, and wounded around 200. “At least 50 killed, including 22 children and a number of women and children, as a result of the ongoing Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since last night,” Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the agency, told AFP . Around 200 people were wounded “in a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”, he said, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic and terrifying”. Trump defended Israel’s actions on Wednesday, saying it “should hit back” if Israeli soldiers were killed, but added that “nothing’s going to jeopardise” to truce. “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his tour of Asia. US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire was holding despite the “skirmishes”. “We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier …\nbut I think the president’s peace is going to hold,” he said. A Palestinian man inspects the site of an overnight Israeli strike on a house in Gaza City on Oct 29, 2025. — Reuters Yesterday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “ powerful strikes ” on Gaza, after his Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli troops in the enclave. While Katz did not say where the troops were attacked, Hamas said its fighters had “no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah” and reaffirmed its commitment to the US-brokered ceasefire . The Israeli military said today that a soldier was killed during fighting in southern Gaza. Escalations Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least three strikes were carried out, while the territory’s main Al Shifa hospital said one hit its backyard. Al Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp. Hamas announced it would delay handing over the body of another hostage, due on Tuesday, saying Israeli “escalation will hinder the search, excavation, and recovery of the bodies”. A row over the last remaining bodies of deceased hostages has threatened to derail the ceasefire agreement. Israel accuses Hamas of reneging by not returning them, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate the remains buried in Gaza’s war-ravaged ruins. Hamas later said on Telegram it had found the bodies of two hostages on Tuesday, but did not specify when it would hand them over. ‘Act decisively’ Hamas came under mounting pressure on Monday after it returned the partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce. Hamas had said the remains were the 16th of 28 hostage bodies it had agreed to return under the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on October 10. But Israeli forensic examination determined Hamas had in fact handed over partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to Netanyahu’s office. Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian accused Hamas of staging the discovery of the remains. “Hamas dug a hole in the ground yesterday, placed the partial remains …\ninside of it, covered it back up with dirt, and handed it over to the Red Cross,” she told journalists. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the government to “act decisively against these violations” and accused Hamas of knowing the location of the missing hostages. ‘We want to rest’ On the ground in Gaza, 60-year-old Abdul-Hayy al-Hajj Ahmed told AFP he was afraid the bombing would start again. “Now they accuse Hamas of stalling, and that is a pretext for renewed escalation and war,” he said. “We want to rest. I believe the war will come back. “ Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected claims the group knows where the remaining bodies are, arguing that Israel’s two-year military campaign had left locations unrecognisable. “The movement (Hamas) is determined to hand over the bodies of the Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located,” he told AFP . The Palestinian group has already returned all 20 living hostages as agreed in the ceasefire deal. Hamas members carry a dead body during a search for deceased hostages seized by Hamas during the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel, in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, on Oct 28, 2025. — Reuters Hamas’s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s subsequent relentless assault on Gaza killed at least 68,531 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry. Despite the ceasefire, the toll has continued to climb as more bodies are found under the rubble.",

Trump defended Israel’s actions on Wednesday, saying it “should hit back” if Israeli soldiers were killed, but added that “nothing’s going to jeopardise” to truce. “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his tour of Asia. US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire was holding despite the “skirmishes”. “We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier …\nbut I think the president’s peace is going to hold,” he said. A Palestinian man inspects the site of an overnight Israeli strike on a house in Gaza City on Oct 29, 2025. — Reuters Yesterday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “ powerful strikes ” on Gaza, after his Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli troops in the enclave. While Katz did not say where the troops were attacked, Hamas said its fighters had “no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah” and reaffirmed its commitment to the US-brokered ceasefire . The Israeli military said today that a soldier was killed during fighting in southern Gaza. Escalations Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least three strikes were carried out, while the territory’s main Al Shifa hospital said one hit its backyard. Al Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp. Hamas announced it would delay handing over the body of another hostage, due on Tuesday, saying Israeli “escalation will hinder the search, excavation, and recovery of the bodies”. A row over the last remaining bodies of deceased hostages has threatened to derail the ceasefire agreement. Israel accuses Hamas of reneging by not returning them, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate the remains buried in Gaza’s war-ravaged ruins. Hamas later said on Telegram it had found the bodies of two hostages on Tuesday, but did not specify when it would hand them over. ‘Act decisively’ Hamas came under mounting pressure on Monday after it returned the partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce. Hamas had said the remains were the 16th of 28 hostage bodies it had agreed to return under the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on October 10. But Israeli forensic examination determined Hamas had in fact handed over partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to Netanyahu’s office. Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian accused Hamas of staging the discovery of the remains. “Hamas dug a hole in the ground yesterday, placed the partial remains …\ninside of it, covered it back up with dirt, and handed it over to the Red Cross,” she told journalists. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the government to “act decisively against these violations” and accused Hamas of knowing the location of the missing hostages. ‘We want to rest’ On the ground in Gaza, 60-year-old Abdul-Hayy al-Hajj Ahmed told AFP he was afraid the bombing would start again. “Now they accuse Hamas of stalling, and that is a pretext for renewed escalation and war,” he said. “We want to rest. I believe the war will come back. “ Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected claims the group knows where the remaining bodies are, arguing that Israel’s two-year military campaign had left locations unrecognisable. “The movement (Hamas) is determined to hand over the bodies of the Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located,” he told AFP . The Palestinian group has already returned all 20 living hostages as agreed in the ceasefire deal. Hamas members carry a dead body during a search for deceased hostages seized by Hamas during the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel, in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, on Oct 28, 2025. — Reuters Hamas’s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s subsequent relentless assault on Gaza killed at least 68,531 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry. Despite the ceasefire, the toll has continued to climb as more bodies are found under the rubble.",

      "title_orig": "Pak-Afghan talks in Istanbul failed to bring about any workable solution, says information minister",
      "summary_orig": "Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said early on Wednesday that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”, adding that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. After days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, the two countries had come together for a dialogue in Doha which had resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks between the two sides had begun in the Turkish capital. In a post on social media platform X early on Wednesday, the information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by Indian-abetted Fitna-al-Khawarij and Indian proxy Fitna-al-Hindustan . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said. “Since the Taliban regime bears no responsibility towards the people of Afghanistan and thrives on a war economy, it desires to drag and mire the Afghan people into a needless war,” he said. The minister asserted that Pakistan had always desired, advocated, and sacrificed for the peace and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan. “In the same spirit, Pakistan has held countless rounds of talks and parleys with the Afghan Taliban regime but, unfortunately, they have always remained indifferent to Pakistan’s losses. Sadly, after sustaining such huge losses of men and material for four long years, Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” he said. He said that in an effort to “give peace a chance” and at the request of Qatar and Turkiye, Pakistan engaged with the Afghan Taliban earlier in Doha and then in Istanbul on a single-point agenda — soliciting action by the Afghan Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan soil by terrorist organisations as a “training-cum-logistics base and jump off point for terrorist activities in Pakistan”. He thanked Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating this dialogue and their efforts in convincing Kabul to “desist from the use of terror proxies as leverage against Pakistan”, but said that the neighbouring country repeatedly deviated from the core issue. “Over the last four days of dialogue, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against [militant] organisations and terrorists. “Sufficient and irrefutable evidence was provided by Pakistan which was acknowledged by Afghan Taliban and the hosts, however, regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurance,” the minister said. “The Afghan side kept deviating from the core issue, evading the key point upon which the dialogue process was initiated. Instead of accepting any responsibility, the Afghan Taliban resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses. The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution,” he said. The minister again thanked the government of Qatar, Turkiye as well as those of other friendly states for their efforts to “bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of terrorism, for the prosperity and security of the two countries and the region at large”. “The security of its people is of paramount importance to Pakistan. We will continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from the menace of terrorism and assure them that the government of Pakistan will continue to employ all the resources which are required in this regard to decimate the terrorists, their sanctuaries, their abetters and supporters,” he said. The statement from the information minister came hours after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath ’, the defence minister stated that negotiators had backpedalled on an agreement “four or five times” after receiving instructions from Kabul. “Whenever we got close to an agreement — either in the last four days or last week — when negotiators reported to Kabul, then there was intervention and the agreement was withdrawn,” he said. “I believe that the negotiations were sabotaged. We had an agreement, but then they called Kabul and backpedalled from the deal.” “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi,” he added. The defence minister believed that the Kabul government lacked authority, as it had been “penetrated” by India, which was using Afghanistan to stage a proxy war against Pakistan. “India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,” Asif said. “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.” When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out. “They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists.” “There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said. Turkiye, Qatar step in to salvage talks On Tuesday, Turkish and Qatari mediators had tried to salvage negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime after the talks briefly collapsed over what officials described as “unbridgeable differences”. A Pakistani security source told reporters that the talks had “collapsed following the Afghan Taliban’s lack of commitment and seriousness to address terrorism-related issues, as well as their refusal to provide any written guarantees”. From the Afghan side, journalists were informed that the negotiations had ended “inconclusively”, with officials in Kabul accusing the Pakistani delegation of “improper conduct” and making “demands that are unacceptable to Afghanistan”. However, within hours of those reports emerging, the rupture had reportedly been repaired. By noon negotiators were back at the table following intense diplomatic efforts by Turkish and Qatari mediators, who pressed both sides to return for what officials described as a “final attempt” to achieve at least a limited agreement. “The negotiations in Istanbul have resumed at the insistence of the host country and the other mediator,” a Pakistani official confirmed, adding that talks continued late into the evening. Diplomatic sources said the Afghan Taliban delegation’s stance had shifted multiple times over the course of four days, often due to fresh instructions from Kabul. “They came close to a deal four or five times,” one official said, “but each time, new guidance from Afghanistan scuttled the progress.” The divisions within the Taliban’s ranks, split among factions based in Kandahar, Kabul, and Khost was cited as another reason. “If the Kandahar group agrees at some point, the differences of the Kabul group come to the fore,” a source briefed on the negotiations said. Adding to the complications, the Afghan side reportedly introduced a new demand, insisting that Pakistan should prevent US drones from entering Afghan airspace from Pakistani territory. Observers noted the irony that many of those drones originated from Qatar, which itself is mediating the Istanbul dialogue. Despite the latest setback, Turkish and Qatari officials were said to have worked intensively to keep the process alive, warning both sides that the collapse of the talks could lead to renewed border tensions. Pak­istani officials reiterated their long-standing position that no agreement would be acceptable without verifia­ble guarantees that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against Pakistan. “Our stance has been consi­stent,” a senior security source said. “Without concrete assurances on counterterrorism, there can be no deal.”",

      "summary_orig": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped out on attending an Asean summit in Malaysia to avoid broaching the issue of Pakistan in a possible meeting with United States President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Modi had backtracked from his proposed visit to Malaysia over the weekend to attend an Asean summit and opted to join the discussions “virtually” instead. The opposition Congress party had blamed the change of plan on Modi’s fear of meeting Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, was held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur. “Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stayed away from a regional leaders summit in Malaysia this week to avoid meeting US President Donald Trump and having a possible discussion about Pakistan,” people familiar with the matter said. “Officials in the government were apprehensive that Trump would repeat his claim that he mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day armed conflict in May, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private,” Bloomberg reported about the alleged actual reason behind the skipping out on the summit. It added that Modi was campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the crucial Bihar election and he “didn’t want to risk a meeting with Trump that could end up being embarrassing for the prime minister, the people said. “Modi is the main face of his party’s campaign in Bihar state and any comments by Trump, especially regarding Pakistan, could be used by the prime minister’s rivals against him and damage his party’s chances at the polls, they said.” Bloomberg similarly reported in August that Modi had turned down an invitation from Trump to visit the White House over concern that he would set up a meeting with Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil. Also fueling the tensions has been Trump’s insistence of ending the May conflict between Pakistan and India — something that New Delhi adamantly refuses still. Earlier today, Trump again stated that seven aircraft were shot down during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India in May. Tensions between Pakistan and India escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.",

India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.",

      "summary": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi skipped out on attending an Asean summit in Malaysia to avoid broaching the issue of Pakistan in a possible meeting with United States President Donald Trump, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Modi had backtracked from his proposed visit to Malaysia over the weekend to attend an Asean summit and opted to join the discussions “virtually” instead. The opposition Congress party had blamed the change of plan on Modi’s fear of meeting Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, was held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur. “Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stayed away from a regional leaders summit in Malaysia this week to avoid meeting US President Donald Trump and having a possible discussion about Pakistan,” people familiar with the matter said. “Officials in the government were apprehensive that Trump would repeat his claim that he mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day armed conflict in May, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private,” Bloomberg reported about the alleged actual reason behind the skipping out on the summit. It added that Modi was campaigning for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the crucial Bihar election and he “didn’t want to risk a meeting with Trump that could end up being embarrassing for the prime minister, the people said. “Modi is the main face of his party’s campaign in Bihar state and any comments by Trump, especially regarding Pakistan, could be used by the prime minister’s rivals against him and damage his party’s chances at the polls, they said.” Bloomberg similarly reported in August that Modi had turned down an invitation from Trump to visit the White House over concern that he would set up a meeting with Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after Trump raised tariffs to 50 per cent, with US officials accusing India of fueling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying Moscow’s discounted oil. Also fueling the tensions has been Trump’s insistence of ending the May conflict between Pakistan and India — something that New Delhi adamantly refuses still. Earlier today, Trump again stated that seven aircraft were shot down during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India in May. Tensions between Pakistan and India escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.

Sources told Dawn that the names of Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Chaudhry Yasin, Faisal Rathore and Sardar Yaqub are under consideration for the top slot. Under the AJK Constitution, the movers of a no-confidence resolution are required to name a successor to the sitting prime minister. The no-trust motion will be submitted soon after the PPP finalises its candidate. A PPP source said there was ‘no hurry’ to form the new government, adding that the PML-N’s decision not to join the treasury benches was “its democratic right”. The party insists it will move ahead “with consensus”. According to sources, a detailed charge sheet highlighting the AJK prime minister’s alleged governance failures has been prepared. These complaints include his failure to consult cabinet members, his harsh attitude toward bureaucracy, and cuts to development funds for ministers and assembly members. His unilateral decisions and weak handling of public protests have reportedly deepened dissatisfaction within the coalition. In a related development, Faryal Talpur, head of the PPP’s women wing and the AJK political affairs wing, called on AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry to seek support from six members of the forward bloc belonging to his group. She discussed matters pertaining to formation of the new government in Azad Kashmir during the meeting. Speaking to Dawn , PML-N leader Mushtaq Minhas clarified that if the Azad Jammu and Kashmir prime minister resigns, the party will not vote for the PPP candidate, though it will support a no-confidence motion, if tabled. He said the PML-N had been seeking Anwarul Haq’s removal for the past six months over governance concerns. PTI to file references Meanwhile, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has decided to file references against its defected members who have joined other parties or plan to support the no-confidence motion. PTI AJK President Abdul Qayyum Niazi held consultations with Opposition Leader Khawaja Farooq Ahmed and summoned the party’s legal team. According to sources, references will be filed under Section 30 of the Elections Act 2020, which allows the disqualification of members who switch parties. PTI had earlier sent a reference to the speaker against four members — Akmal Sargala, Rafiq Nayyar, and Ali Shan Soni among them. Now, 12 members of the PTI forward bloc who have joined the PPP could face disqualification if they vote for the no-confidence motion. Published in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",
