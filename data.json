      "summary_orig": "The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday that 15 terrorists were killed in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In a statement, the military’s media affairs said that the operations were carried out between November 15 and 16, adding that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). First, an IBO was conducted by security forces in Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said. In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said. It said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, asserting that the counter terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operations. In a statement, he said that work would continue on eliminating foreign-backed terrorists with national consensus. He attributed the killing of the terrorist ringleader to the successful strategy of the security forces. He further said that political moves to divert attention from the national consensus on terrorism would not be tolerated. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces. “Under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are achieving great successes against terrorism,” he said in a statement. “We are determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country,” he said. Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.",

      "summary_orig": "The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Monday voted to adopt a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza and authorising an international stabilisation force for the Palestinian enclave. Israel and Hamas agreed last month to the first phase of Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza — a ceasefire in their two-year war and a hostage-release deal — but the UN resolution is seen as vital to legitimising a transitional governance body and reassuring countries that are considering sending troops to Gaza. Thirteen UNSC members, including Pakistan, voted in favour of the resolution, while Russia and China abstained — notable given earlier signals that Moscow might veto the text. The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Board of Peace, envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza. It also authorises the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which would ensure a process of demilitarising Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure. Trump’s 20-point plan is included as an annex to the resolution. Russia, which holds a veto on the UNSC, earlier signalled potential opposition to the resolution but abstained from the vote, allowing the resolution to pass. After the vote, US Ambassador Mike Waltz thanked UNSC members, calling the decision “an historic and constructive resolution” that sets a new direction for the region. “Thank you for joining us in charting a new course in the Middle East for Israelis and Palestinians and all the people of the region alike,” he said, adding that the adoption of the resolution represents “another significant step” toward a stable and prosperous Gaza and an environment in which Israel could live securely. He emphasized that the ISF and the new investment mechanisms would work in tandem: “The former will support a region free from Hamas’ grip, and the latter Gaza’s reconstruction and development.” Hamas, however, rejected the resolution, saying it failed to meet Palestinians’ rights and demands and seeks to impose an international trusteeship on the enclave that Palestinians and resistance factions oppose. “Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,” the group added. The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of fighting , sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The resolution’s text also says that “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform programme and Gaza’s redevelopment has advanced. That eventuality has already been firmly rejected by Israel. “Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory has not changed,” Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday. Pakistan votes in favour of resolution to ‘stop bloodshed’ Meanwhile, Pakistan, which voted in favour of the US resolution, said it did so in order to halt the fighting, protect civilians, and reinforce a ceasefire that could open the way to humanitarian relief, reconstruction, and a full Israeli withdrawal from the enclave. Speaking after the UNSC adopted the measure, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said Islamabad backed the plan with one overriding purpose: “To stop the bloodshed, to save the lives of innocent Palestinians, including women and children, to maintain the ceasefire, and to secure the full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.” He said Pakistan’s vote was guided by the position of the Palestinians, the Arab Group, and the eight-nation Arab-Islamic grouping — Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, and Türkiye — which endorsed Trump’s initiative earlier this year. “Our vote has been guided by the position of Palestine and the Arab Group,” he said, adding that the joint engagement was aimed at ending the conflict, ensuring humanitarian access, preventing displacement, and supporting “a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood”. The ambassador noted that Pakistan worked actively during negotiations, supporting Arab amendments and proposing its own changes to ensure the text aligned with “international legitimacy” on the Palestinian question. He welcomed the inclusion of some proposals, such as the explicit call for maintaining the ceasefire and the requirement for regular reporting to the UNSC, but said several critical issues remained unaddressed. “A clear political path to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, the central role of the Palestinian Authority in governance and reconstruction, and enhanced involvement of the UN … are crucial aspects,” he said. “We earnestly hope that further details in coming weeks will provide the much-needed clarity,” he added. Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Pakistan’s consistent policy that any peace initiative must lead to a sovereign, independent and contiguous Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. He underscored that existing UNSC resolutions “remain fully valid,” cautioning that the new resolution should not “alter or diminish” the body of established international law on the conflict. He stressed that the right to self-determination is “inherent and unconditional … and cannot be subjected to any conditions”. The ambassador said the proposed Board of Peace must remain a temporary oversight mechanism whose mandate expires in 2027 unless renewed. “Executive and administrative authority in Gaza must remain with the Palestinians through a Palestinian Committee,” he added. He insisted that the Palestinian Authority must play a central role in governance and reconstruction. “Peace cannot be achieved by bypassing the Palestinians. There must be an end to policies that undermine and weaken the Palestinian Authority,“ he said. Talking about the ISF, Ahmad said it could be stabilising only if it operated under a clear UN-consistent mandate. Disarmament, he said, must be carried out through a negotiated political process under a unified Palestinian National Authority. He warned that unilateral violations of the ceasefire could “threaten and thwart the entire process,” and emphasised that the ISF’s mandate would only be effective “once there is complete Israeli withdrawal”. Referring to the scale of devastation in Gaza, the ambassador said more than 69,000 Palestinians had been killed over the past two years. A “ray of hope,” he said, had emerged with the summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh in October — where Egypt, Qatar, Türkiye and the United States signed the peace agreement that underpins the current plan. The UN envoy urged the international community to uphold its responsibilities and support a credible, time-bound process towards Palestinian statehood. He stressed that there must be “no annexation and no forced displacement” and that the territorial contiguity of the West Bank and Gaza was essential for a viable state. Looking ahead, he said the UN, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestinian people must play central roles in governance, reconstruction and institution-building. At the close of his address, the ambassador reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people. “Their suffering is our anguish; their resilience is our pride; their aspirations our cause,“ he said, adding that Pakistan’s support for their right to self-determination would remain “unwavering” until its full realisation.",

      "summary_orig": "LESSONS from the Bihar elections have domestic implications, and they will be studied in the neighbourhood. The call to war Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave from the poll-bound state in April in response to terror killings in distant Pahalgam , was seen as aimed at producing a favourable electoral outcome in last week’s poll verdict. In case the war cry, followed by a four-day flare-up with Pakistan, did help in the stupendous verdict, would the victory for Modi’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in Bihar fuel more tensions on the border or would they abate now that the run-in with Pakistan had served its electoral purpose. Or would success in Bihar prompt repetition in crucial West Bengal polls next year? The narrative from Modi supporters and his rivals is that one or two previous military events did help the prime minister electorally. It is claimed that the Pulwama attack and the aerial skirmish it set off with Pakistan brought rich dividends for Modi in the 2019 elections. Never mind the dubious optics the skirmishes produced to contradict the belief — an Indian pilot’s embarrassing capture in Pakistan in the post-Pulwama episode and widespread claims, not least by President Donald Trump , of Pakistan shooting down several Indian planes in the subsequent Operation Sindoor/Bunyanum Marsoos engagement. The optics were airbrushed or recast by pliable TV channels as major victories. Dampening the enthusiasm for war cries and their electoral linkages is the example of Manmohan Singh . He won a second term while not raising a militarist finger in the aftermath of the Mumbai carnage of November 2008. On the contrary, he changed his home minister and probed peaceful ways to resolve the terror problem with Pakistan. Singh agreed to discuss Balochistan alongside the Kashmir issue in his meeting with his Pakistani counterpart in Egypt. The proposal was shot down by the deep state on both sides. Be that as it may, the opposition in India is crying foul at the Bihar results. The Congress looks scandalised by “the unprecedented 90 per cent strike rate” scored by the BJP and its allies, a reference to the number of seats won against the number of seats contested by the NDA. It says former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi won 404 of the 514 seats the Congress contested for the Lok Sabha after his mother’s assassination in October 1984. But even he didn’t get the strike rate of last week’s Bihar results for the NDA. The implication is that there was foul play at the hustings. India’s opposition parties might want to figure out their priorities at the outset. There are two problems here that the opposition should tackle. If the election results were an outcome of rigging, as is alleged, it is not all bad news. It shows India at least doesn’t face a threat from fascism given that fascism rides popular support, which the BJP needs to scrounge around for. As for military action on the other hand, if it begins to tweak electoral results, a militarised polity could easily become fertile ground for Hindutva to strike deeper roots. In either case, what is the opposition’s strategy to take on the entrenched right wing under Modi’s watch. Rahul Gandhi and his team have carried out deep investigations into some serious electoral malpractices in vogue under the Modi regime. The election commission has been accused of connivance. The probe threw up compelling findings, a classic one being the case of Brazilian hairdresser Larissa Nery, whose photos featured in voters’ lists across India. Having done the homework in a higher cause, Gandhi’s party promptly sullied its image by haggling over seat shares with the local ally. It hurt both. Bereft of context, the result looks unremarkable. Bihar’s main opposition party, Lalu Yadav’s Rashtriya Janata Dal, pouched the highest percentage of vote share but only to win a paltry 25 seats in the 243-member assembly. With 23pc of the total votes cast, the RJD is clearly but strangely ahead of Modi’s ally, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United, JDU) with 19.25pc. The BJP got 20.08pc vote share. Yet, the BJP and JDU won 89 and 85 seats respectively. Likewise, the All India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen with 1.85pc vote share took five seats while the Congress with 8.71pc managed to get just six. Such anomalies were at play with the left’s performance too and has been the feature of many an Indian election, a commentary on the country’s first past the post system. Indira Gandhi was ‘routed’ in 1977 by the Janata Party with a difference of 2pc votes. She took 40.98pc, and the opposition alliance had nothing more than 43pc. Moreover — and this is important for Rahul Gandhi to note — in her rout, Mrs Gandhi still had 154 seats in the 543-member Lok Sabha whereas the Congress in recent outings has struggled to do half as well. And this is what needs to be understood and explained by the struggling behemoth the Congress has become. The BJP under Modi’s leadership is pursuing power at any cost — dismantling state governments with defections in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, winning elsewhere with questionable methods under the election commission’s nose. What then is the most important task before opposition parties? They might want to figure out their priorities at the outset. Should the left, for example, derail Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal or see the back of the BJP first? Similar sacrifices are needed in Kerala to keep the BJP out. Also, do the opposition really believe they are taking part in a genuine democratic event with elections? Or are today’s elections mere choreographed formalities with a predetermined outcome? The complete subjugation of the election commission provides a most visible clue. The opposition had pondered a second independence movement. Should they hit the road as Gandhi would? And like Gandhi, perhaps talk to Pakistan? The most nationalist opposition party can’t beat the BJP on its militarist turf.

      "summary_orig": "FORMER prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed, who once ruled Bangladesh with an iron fist, has been sentenced to death for crimes against humanity allegedly committed by her administration during last year’s popular revolt in that country. Sheikh Hasina, who has been living in India after fleeing her homeland in August 2024, has termed the verdict “biased” and delivered by a “rigged tribunal”. Ironically, the court that convicted her — the International Crimes Tribunal — was set up by Sheikh Hasina herself. During her rule, it sent several of her opponents, mostly from the Bangladesh chapter of Jamaat-i-Islami and the opposition BNP, to the gallows for their supposed role in the 1971 violence. Many people rightly described those trials as unfair. Today, Sheikh Hasina appears to have become a victim of the very institutions she had created to eliminate her opponents. While the fairness of the trial and the hasty manner in which it was conducted can be questioned, there can be little argument that Sheikh Hasina’s dispensation had become increasingly autocratic over the years. Cronies were enriched, while opponents were hounded. Democratic principles were eschewed in favour of a cult of personality surrounding Sheikh Hasina, her father Sheikh Mujeeb and her party the Awami League. Sheikh Hasina’s repressive methods culminated in an explosion of popular rage last year, which eventually led to the toppling of her government, and her self-exile in India — a close ally for decades. It is clear that Sheikh Hasina’s government unleashed excesses on protesters during the 2024 unrest; she herself admitted that “we lost control of the situation”. Earlier this year, her party was banned, while her late father, once revered as ‘Bangabandhu’, also became a target of the protesters’ ire. Over five decades since East Pakistan became Bangladesh, political stability still eludes that country. Whatever economic progress Bangladesh had made during Sheikh Hasina’s rule was overtaken by her repression of dissent, and relentless assaults on the opposition. Today, Bangladesh stands at a crucial juncture. Elections are scheduled for next year, and the interim authorities must ensure that full democratic rule is restored at the earliest. For elections to be credible, the Awami League must be allowed to contest. It should be remembered that the 2024 elections — boycotted by the opposition — that returned Sheikh Hasina to power were not considered fair, which was a major factor behind the downfall of her regime. That is why all political parties must be allowed to contest the next polls to establish the credibility of the process. Those officials guilty of crimes must face justice. But if the process is coloured by vengeance including extreme punishments like the death penalty — which this paper opposes — it will only perpetuate instability. Mature states balance demands for justice with the need for reconciliation. Published in Dawn, November 18th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The government on Monday revised the compensation package for martyred and injured Civil Armed Forces (CAF) personnel, according to a notification issued by the interior ministry. CAFs are defined as a federal paramilitary force working under the interior ministry, according to Section 18, sub-section 21 of Schedule II of the Rules of Business, 1973 , such as the Federal Constabulary, Frontier Corps, Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts and Pakistan Coast Guards. The decision to revise compensation to be on par with the Islamabad police was made by the interior ministry in August this year and approved by the cabinet on August 25. According to today’s notification, the minimum compensation will be Rs10 million (Grade 1-9), while the maximum is now Rs20m (Grade 20 and above). “If a member of the CAFs is shaheed (martyred), permanently disabled, injured with serious injury or minor injury, as the case may be, while on bona fide government duty, an award under these rules may be granted to him or his family, as the case may be,” the notification read. The package also includes Rs3m in cash compensation in the event of being “incapacitated and released from services for having become invalid as a result of injury in encounters, bomb blasts, riots or watch and ward duty or terrorist activity”. Rs1m in compensation would be provided to personnel incapacitated in the aforementioned incidents listed, but who are still serving in the department. Serious injury would award Rs200,000, while minor injury would award compensation of Rs100,000. In 2020, compensation amounts were revised so that the deaths and injuries of civil armed forces personnel “related to security” would award maximum compensation of Rs3m (Grade 1-16) and a maximum of Rs10m (Grade 20 and above).",

      "title_orig": "No-confidence ousts Haq in AJK; PPP’s Rathore takes over premiership",
      "summary_orig": "A no-confidence motion against Azad Jammu and Kashmir Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq succeeded on Monday, with 36 members in the Legislative Assembly voting in favour of it and two against it. Of the 29 PPP members, the speaker could not cast his vote and of the 9 PML-N members, one female member abstained. Two PTI legislators — regional president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and leader of the opposition Khawaja Farooq Ahmed — voted against the move. Haq, who had arrived in the hall along with four loyalists, left along with them soon after delivering his speech. Three PTI members did not attend. One member each of the Muslim Conference and the Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party (JKPP) also abstained. Apart from them, three PTI forward bloc members — Ansar Abdali, Mazhar Saeed and deputy speaker Chaudhry Riaz — also abstained. After the votes were counted, AJK Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, who was chairing the session, announced PPP’s Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore as the new premier. Under the AJK Constitution, a vote of no confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution. Rathore is the 16th prime minister elected in AJK since 1975, when the parliamentary form of government was introduced in the region. The newly elected prime minister said that the change would be felt not only in faces but in the system itself — and that this would be the true measure of success. Announcing several administrative measures, he said secretaries would be entitled to only one official vehicle and that the total number of secretaries would not exceed 20. He also declared the abolition of the posts of special secretary and senior additional secretary. He said the downsizing process would be carried down to the lowest tiers. Rathire announced the merger of the Education Department’s technical wing into the department and the drafting of a fresh transport policy. Until the new policy was finalised, no officer below grade 18 — except those in administration, the police and monitoring assistant engineers — would be permitted to use an official vehicle. All departments, the AJK premier said, would be required to deposit extra government vehicles into the official transport pool within a week. There would be no compromise on biometric verification. He ordered the Public Service Commission (PSC) to be reactivated and announced the cancellation of notifications for posts that had been advertised through the PSC and then withdrawn up to January 1, 2020. The PSC would hold examinations within a month and appoint qualified candidates to those posts. The AJK premier further announced that for appointments up to grade 18 — except where recruitment was 100 per cent quota-based — at least 50pc of vacancies would be filled through direct recruitment. All departments were directed to implement this within a month. He said the government would fully implement the Third-Party Act in accordance with the high court’s decision. The law would be enforced not only in government departments but also in semi-government organisations and autonomous bodies, including the Bank of AJK. A uniform time-scale policy, Rathire said, would be introduced across all departments, with no time-scale increases granted above grade 19. In departments where section officer and assistant director posts existed, all admin officer positions would be abolished. To address public grievances, the prime minister, ministers, the chief secretary, secretaries and department heads would hold open courts in every district. Complaint boxes would be installed in the offices of the prime minister and the chief secretary and opened every 15 days under their joint supervision. Judicial reforms would also be introduced, in consultation with the superior judiciary, to ensure administrative justice. Regarding hydropower projects, the AJK PM said an agreement with the federal government would be secured in cooperation with the PML-N leadership. Improving internet speeds and strengthening the local government system were also listed as priorities. Referring to the needs of low-paid staff, he said that as the son of Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, he felt a duty of care toward junior employees, and had therefore decided to regularise all Grade-1 employees serving in permanent posts — provided they had no pending court cases and the move did not affect anyone’s pension or legal rights. He also announced one month’s additional salary for all Grade-1 employees, to be paid from departmental development budgets. He ordered that all driver posts be upgraded to Grade-5 and said police constables would receive facilities and allowances on par with those in Punjab. Police personnel performing duties alongside important individuals would be eligible for travel and dearness allowance. He also announced a remission of 60 days from the sentences of prisoners in all AJK jails — except those convicted under qisas, diyat, espionage, anti-state activities or terrorism, where the remission would not apply. At the conclusion of his speech, the prime minister reaffirmed AJK’s “unwavering support for the people of occupied Kashmir”. Earlier, when the speaker announced the results of voting and asked Rathore to take the seat reserved for the leader of the house, the prime minister-elect — dressed in qameez shalwar and a black coat — shook hands with or embraced lawmakers in the front row, including the two lone PTI legislators. Before Rathore’s address, PPP regional president Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir, his predecessor Raja Farooq Haider, PTI regional president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and several others also spoke. Earlier still, the outgoing prime minister had delivered a speech shortly after the session began. He said he was leaving “in a dignified manner with a contented heart” and held no grievance against any of the pro-no-trust lawmakers, most of whom were still members of his cabinet. “I came to thank you for relieving me of this responsibility on the one hand and to set the record straight on the other,” he said. While asserting his “commitment to the ideology of the state’s accession to Pakistan, the armed forces and the Kashmir freedom movement”, he said those who had drafted the no-trust resolution should have consulted him first. “My best wishes are with the new government. We will play a constructive role in the opposition. If the government performs well, we will support it shoulder to shoulder. But if there is any attempt to crush the aspirations of the people of AJK, we will resort to such a severe protest that no one has ever seen before.” However, PTI’s Niazi mocked the outgoing premier’s claim, saying his tenure had witnessed “the worst-ever disgrace of the system and state institutions, including the Legislative Assembly”. Niazi also strongly criticised the votes cast in favour of the no-trust motion by PTI renegades, calling it an insult to the public mandate. “This whole process is unlawful. We will take legal action against those who returned to the Assembly on PTI tickets and then crossed the floor,” he warned. No-confidence motion The no-trust motion was tabled by PPP lawmaker Qasim Majeed in the assembly today, after a resolution for a no-confidence vote against outgoing PM Haq was submitted to the Assembly Secretariat on Friday afternoon. The resolution was signed by 25 lawmakers, 23 from the PPP and two from the PML-N. Shortly after today’s session began, Haq also arrived in the house. He went up to Rathore and exchanged greetings with him. Haq left after delivering a speech. People view proceedings of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Assembly live on big screen installed outside the assembly’s building on Nov 17. — Photo by Tariq Naqash Big screens were installed outside the assembly’s building, where people viewed the proceedings live. Haq’s loss seemed certain even before the no-confidence motion was tabled against him today as the PPP had the guaranteed support of at least 29 lawmakers — two more than the requisite number needed for the motion to succeed. In October, the PPP’s ranks in the AJK Legislative Assembly had swelled to 27 after 10 lawmakers from the PTI forward bloc joined the party. On Sunday, two more PTI lawmakers, said to be from the party’s forward bloc — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur. With almost six months remaining in the assembly’s term, Rathore is the fourth prime minister elected in AJK in four years. In August 2021, the PTI picked Niazi as the premier after he was named for the slot by then-PM Imran Khan. Niazi had secured 35 votes against the joint opposition candidate Latif Akbar, who bagged only 15 votes, in the 53-seat house. After nine months, Niazi resigned from the position and was replaced by PTI regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas. In April 2023, Tanveer was disqualified by the full court bench of the AJK High Court from being a member of the legislative assembly for contempt. He was then replaced by Haq.",

The law would be enforced not only in government departments but also in semi-government organisations and autonomous bodies, including the Bank of AJK. A uniform time-scale policy, Rathire said, would be introduced across all departments, with no time-scale increases granted above grade 19. In departments where section officer and assistant director posts existed, all admin officer positions would be abolished. To address public grievances, the prime minister, ministers, the chief secretary, secretaries and department heads would hold open courts in every district. Complaint boxes would be installed in the offices of the prime minister and the chief secretary and opened every 15 days under their joint supervision. Judicial reforms would also be introduced, in consultation with the superior judiciary, to ensure administrative justice. Regarding hydropower projects, the AJK PM said an agreement with the federal government would be secured in cooperation with the PML-N leadership. Improving internet speeds and strengthening the local government system were also listed as priorities. Referring to the needs of low-paid staff, he said that as the son of Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, he felt a duty of care toward junior employees, and had therefore decided to regularise all Grade-1 employees serving in permanent posts — provided they had no pending court cases and the move did not affect anyone’s pension or legal rights. He also announced one month’s additional salary for all Grade-1 employees, to be paid from departmental development budgets. He ordered that all driver posts be upgraded to Grade-5 and said police constables would receive facilities and allowances on par with those in Punjab. Police personnel performing duties alongside important individuals would be eligible for travel and dearness allowance. He also announced a remission of 60 days from the sentences of prisoners in all AJK jails — except those convicted under qisas, diyat, espionage, anti-state activities or terrorism, where the remission would not apply. At the conclusion of his speech, the prime minister reaffirmed AJK’s “unwavering support for the people of occupied Kashmir”. Earlier, when the speaker announced the results of voting and asked Rathore to take the seat reserved for the leader of the house, the prime minister-elect — dressed in qameez shalwar and a black coat — shook hands with or embraced lawmakers in the front row, including the two lone PTI legislators. Before Rathore’s address, PPP regional president Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir, his predecessor Raja Farooq Haider, PTI regional president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and several others also spoke. Earlier still, the outgoing prime minister had delivered a speech shortly after the session began. He said he was leaving “in a dignified manner with a contented heart” and held no grievance against any of the pro-no-trust lawmakers, most of whom were still members of his cabinet. “I came to thank you for relieving me of this responsibility on the one hand and to set the record straight on the other,” he said. While asserting his “commitment to the ideology of the state’s accession to Pakistan, the armed forces and the Kashmir freedom movement”, he said those who had drafted the no-trust resolution should have consulted him first. “My best wishes are with the new government. We will play a constructive role in the opposition. If the government performs well, we will support it shoulder to shoulder. But if there is any attempt to crush the aspirations of the people of AJK, we will resort to such a severe protest that no one has ever seen before.” However, PTI’s Niazi mocked the outgoing premier’s claim, saying his tenure had witnessed “the worst-ever disgrace of the system and state institutions, including the Legislative Assembly”. Niazi also strongly criticised the votes cast in favour of the no-trust motion by PTI renegades, calling it an insult to the public mandate. “This whole process is unlawful. We will take legal action against those who returned to the Assembly on PTI tickets and then crossed the floor,” he warned. No-confidence motion The no-trust motion was tabled by PPP lawmaker Qasim Majeed in the assembly today, after a resolution for a no-confidence vote against outgoing PM Haq was submitted to the Assembly Secretariat on Friday afternoon. The resolution was signed by 25 lawmakers, 23 from the PPP and two from the PML-N. Shortly after today’s session began, Haq also arrived in the house. He went up to Rathore and exchanged greetings with him. Haq left after delivering a speech.

Haq’s loss seemed certain even before the no-confidence motion was tabled against him today as the PPP had the guaranteed support of at least 29 lawmakers — two more than the requisite number needed for the motion to succeed. In October, the PPP’s ranks in the AJK Legislative Assembly had swelled to 27 after 10 lawmakers from the PTI forward bloc joined the party. On Sunday, two more PTI lawmakers, said to be from the party’s forward bloc — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur. With almost six months remaining in the assembly’s term, Rathore is the fourth prime minister elected in AJK in four years. In August 2021, the PTI picked Niazi as the premier after he was named for the slot by then-PM Imran Khan. Niazi had secured 35 votes against the joint opposition candidate Latif Akbar, who bagged only 15 votes, in the 53-seat house. After nine months, Niazi resigned from the position and was replaced by PTI regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas. In April 2023, Tanveer was disqualified by the full court bench of the AJK High Court from being a member of the legislative assembly for contempt. He was then replaced by Haq.",

      "summary_orig": "A Bangladesh court sentenced ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year. The ruling comes months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February. Hasina’s Awami League party has been barred from contesting and it is feared that Monday’s verdict could stoke fresh unrest ahead of the vote. The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court located in the capital Dhaka, delivered the guilty verdict amid tight security and in Hasina’s absence after she fled to India in August 2024. View this post on Instagram Hasina, 78, defied court orders that she return from India to attend her trial about whether she ordered a deadly crackdown against the student-led uprising that ousted her. She called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”. “The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,” Hasina said in a statement issued from hiding in India. “They are biased and politically motivated. “ The verdict can be appealed in the Supreme Court. But Hasina’s son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed , told Reuters on the eve of the verdict that they would not appeal unless a democratically elected government took office with the Awami League’s participation. View this post on Instagram After the verdict, Bangladesh urged India to extradite Hasina and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. Dhaka said New Delhi was obliged to do so under an extradition treaty. India’s foreign ministry said that it had “noted” the verdict, adding it was “committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh”. It did not comment immediately on Bangladesh’s extradition request. Worst violence since 1971 During the trial, prosecutors told the court that they had uncovered evidence of her direct command to use lethal force to suppress a student-led uprising in July and August 2024. According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most of them by gunfire from security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence. Hasina was represented by a state-appointed defence counsel who told the court that the charges against her were baseless and pleaded for her acquittal. Ahead of the verdict, Hasina dismissed the accusations and the fairness of the Tribunal proceedings, asserting a guilty verdict was “a foregone conclusion”. Bangladesh has been tense ahead of the verdict, with at least 30 crude bomb explosions and 26 vehicles torched across the country over the past few days. There have been no casualties, however.",

FM Dar was received by the Russian Deputy FM Mikhail Galuzin, Deputy Director of State Protocol Aleksander Prusov, Deputy Director of Second Asia Department of Russian Foreign Ministry Alexei Surovtsev and Pakistan Embassy officers. The Foreign Office (FO) said he would lead the Pakistani delegation at the summit, being held on November 17-18, at the invitation of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Vladmirovich Mishustin. “The CHG will be attended by the heads of government of Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the vice president of Iran, and the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India,” the statement said. Further, in addition to SCO member states, the heads of the governments of Mongolia, Bahrain, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait and Turkmenistan will also be attending the meeting alongside those of regional/international organisations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, Euro Asian Economic Union, Collective Security Treaty Organisation and Democratic Socialists of America. “In his address to the SCO CHG, the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s perspective on important regional and global issues as well as ways to strengthen the organisation for the benefit of the SCO region,” the statement added. Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with the leaders of other SCO countries on the sidelines of the summit, the FO added. The CHG is the second-highest decision-making institution in the SCO and provides guidance in the areas of economy, finance, trade, connectivity, commerce and socio-economic cooperation, including the organisation’s budgetary matters, according to the FO. The SCO CHG adopts joint communiqué, statements and important decisions. The SCO held a summit in Tianjin, China, from August 31 to September 1 earlier this year. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also announced in September announced that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date.",

      "summary_orig": "Indian army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday issued a pointed warning to Pakistan, comparing the brief May conflict to a “trailer” rather than a full-length film. The Indian army chief’s remarks come a week after an explosion near the Red Fort in New Delhi on November 10, leaving 12 people dead in the first such explosion in the Indian capital since 2011 . Delivering a speech at a defence conference in New Delhi, Gen Dwivedi said, “I’d like to say that the movie hasn’t even started — only a trailer was shown, and, after the trailer, it was over within 88 hours.“ “So, we’re fully prepared for the future, and if Pakistan gives us such an opportunity, we’d like to provide them with a thorough education on how a responsible nation should behave with its neighbours.“ The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Delhi blast suspect presented in court Indian anti-terrorism investigators presented a suspect linked to the bombing in court, one of two men accused of involvement in the suicide attack. Officials have not disclosed any details on the motives or organisational backing of the alleged attackers, both of whom they claim came from India-occupied Kashmir. India’s National Investiagtion Agency (NIA) alleged that Amir Rashid Ali “conspired with the alleged suicide bomber, Umarun Nabi, to unleash the terror attack” last Monday. It remains unclear whether Nabi is included in the tally. Security personnel escort the suspect from a police vehicle at the Patiala House Court, a day after his arrest, in New Delhi, India on November 17. — AFP An AFP photographer saw Ali being taken under heavy guard from a police truck to a New Delhi court to face charges. Indian media reported that the court had ordered that he be held in custody for 10 days by the NIA. Nabi was a medical professor at a university in Haryana state, just outside the capital, while Ali had allegedly travelled to Delhi to “facilitate the purchase of the car which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED)”, according to the NIA. India has provided no further information on the alleged motives or network behind the two suspects. Another suspect apprehended: NIA Later on Monday, the NIA said in a statement that it “arrested another key associate of the terrorist involved in the blast” in Delhi. According to the statement, the suspect was arrested from Srinagar in India-occupied Kashmir by an NIA team, with the agency stating that he “allegedly provided technical support for carrying out terror attacks by modifying drones and attempting to make rockets ahead of the deadly car bomb blast which killed 10 persons and left 32 persons injured”. “The accused, a resident of Qazigund in Anantnag district of [India-occupied Kashmir], was an active co-conspirator behind the attack and had worked closely with the terrorist, Umarun Nabi, to plan the terror carnage,” the statement read. “NIA continues to explore various angles to unravel the conspiracy behind the bombing,” it added. “Several teams of the anti-terror agency are pursuing multiple leads and are conducting searches across states to identify every person involved in the terror attack.” The Indian government has since branded the Delhi car blast a terrorist attack, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowing not to spare anyone involved in the “conspiracy” the day after the blast. Yesterday, the NIA said the blast was a “ suicide bombing ”.",

      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Monday said that Pakistan had become “extremely relevant” on the global stage after its performance during the military conflict against India in May. The conflict between the two countries in May this year was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Both governments launched diplomatic blitzes after the conflict to take their stance on the ordeal to other countries. Elaborating on Pakistan’s image and standing in the world in the conflict’s aftermath while speaking at a function, the information minister said, “In a very short span of time, we have become extremely relevant in our foreign policy. We have seen in the past two years, and especially after the May war, I think that has redefined who we are.” He said the “turning point” after the Pahalgam incident was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s open offer for an impartial and fair investigation because “we were often blamed for terror acts that were not our fault, and in fact, being the biggest victims of terrorism, there was a propaganda against Pakistan, blaming us for terrorism.” The information minister said that “you can’t be a victim and an aggressor at the same time — it’s an oxymoron, an inherent contradiction, it’s just not possible.” He said no other country could lay claim to the loss of 90,000 lives in the war against terrorism or billions in economic losses. “We are also a shield and a wall between the terrorists and the rest of the world,” Tarar added, saying that the sacrifice of any Pakistani was also for the sake of making the world a better place. The minister said the above sacrifices could not go in vain. “So, I think the time was right that the world heard our story and heard it right. By authoring this investigation just before the war, I think we had a point to prove that our hands were clean, and that point was well taken. “That turning point strengthened our fence, our alliances and countries that were on the fence; it made them realise what Pakistan stands for, and by authoring this investigation, Pakistan made a good diplomatic move which was well received the world over. I think after that, there was immense diplomatic engagement … and that constant engagement really helped us prove our point to the world. “So when I say the world was changing, Pakistan also changed; we saw an aggressive diplomatic change. Our diplomacy worked very well because we were taking it and relations with all countries very seriously. There was no laxity, and there was no room for any complacency, and we were right on the job,” the information minister said. He added that Pakistan did all it could on international media outlets. “We had the strength of the truth, so when we told the story and told it right, the world heard it, and it had an impact. So the right kind of aggressive diplomacy with the right kind of marketing campaign with the right kind of information to counter misinformation and disinformation — so we were everywhere all across,” he further said. National synergy and Gen Z Tarar also said he appreciated the “synergy” with the military’s spokesperson in putting out information, saying it would not have been possible otherwise. “So we were winning on the narrative front and the diplomatic front. When it actually came down to the brass tacks, we had already shot down seven planes and when we were confronted with brute force, we gave them a bloody noise and that befitting response proved our military might so … when it came down to the actual war, Pakistan passed with flying colours and, you know, within hours, actually within four hours, India was compelled to request for a ceasefire. “So, when I say Pakistan is changing, Pakistan actually changed. And I must acknowledge the kind of unity that we displayed as a nation. The resilience of our people, the people of Pakistan, came together, forgot our differences. I remember speaking on the floor of the house and saying that, you know, today, there is no critical point scoring, we are all on the same page, and we will fight the enemy together as a unified force, and that’s exactly what we did.” The information minister, in particular, singled out Gen Z and the use of social media and memes during the conflict. “When I say Pakistan has changed, you know, when it came down to the meme war and the enemy was stunned that our youngsters on social media had actually come up with memes in a very serious situation. And the enemy was wondering what is going on. War is a very serious matter, and they were making memes and they were ridiculing the enemy in their own particular way. “So, even our Gen Z, our younger generation, they played a role with regard to social media. And they took it upon themselves to fight for Pakistan on that platform, on that battlefield, because I often say that, you know, the digital world is divided into two kinds of people. You have digital natives and digital immigrants. “And sometimes the immigrants, you know, they take time to comprehend the ground realities of digital media. But people who are born into the digital age and they are digital natives, they understand that world much better than most of us do. So, I think the digital natives had their own war strategy and had their own way of winning that war.” Relevancy in global events Returning to his main point about Pakistan’s increased global relevance after the conflict, the minister pointed to the country’s involvement in the Gaza peace process. “If you see the way forward, Pakistan has become extremely relevant. When it comes to the situation in Gaza, when it comes to the ceasefire, we are included in the list of Arab Islamic countries that brokered that peace and were part of the negotiations which led to an eventual ceasefire. “And I think that’s a big win for Pakistan where the countries of the world have taken us extremely seriously and believe that the things that we have to say, the advice that we have to give is extremely relevant and very very important. And you have seen that we have had a lot of visits this year and people often talk about foreign visits and the dignitaries coming to Pakistan.” Referring to diplomatic engagements in the past year, he said they had been at their “peak”, saying that Pakistan hosted a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. “After 14 years, we had 12 prime ministers coming to Pakistan, coming to Islamabad and talking about strategic ties, talking about regional cooperation, talking about counter-terrorism, talking about regional connectivity. “So, we had all these things going on in succession. And even now, the way the world has engaged Pakistan, we are going to host the SCO Heads of State Summit in 2027, which is going to be a big event. And with regard to improvement of ties with other partners in the region, we saw the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement taking place with Saudi Arabia, which was, I think, one of the best things to happen to Pakistan in recent history.” Elaborating on the Saudi defence deal, he said people had taken great pride in that agreement and the people of the kingdom also celebrated the union. Tarar also mentioned the launching of the Economic Cooperation Framework, saying it had “really cemented” ties with Saudi Arabia. Acknowledgement of economic stability He said Pakistan’s economic turnaround was also acknowledged by the world. “I think that is something phenomenal because our ratings have improved, our macroeconomic indicators have improved. There is stability which the world has acknowledged. The financial institutions, the world over, are praising Pakistan’s performance in terms of the economic turnaround. So, you know, right from default to development and as I said before, from isolation to relevance. “So, these two slogans really mean a lot when it comes to the government’s performance. That we have taken the economy from default towards development and we have taken our foreign relations from isolation to relevance. And that is how I will define this journey. “And I think the future is very bright.” Situation with Afghanistan and ‘playing cards’ right The information minister also touched on the tense relations with Afghanistan after recent skirmishes and the breakdown of talks in Istanbul, saying that “there is a situation with Afghanistan where we now believe that we have an additional forum where we can present evidence of their involvement in acts of terrorism. And we have been constantly saying that we have irrefutable evidence that their land is used for acts of terrorism. “And whenever an incident takes place and when you backtrack and go into the investigations, you will find somewhere or the other an Afghan citizen involved somewhere. So, this is something which we are dealing with and we have given a very loud and clear message in that regard. “So, I think Pakistan’s situation right now in terms of its economy, foreign direct investment, strategic ties, including trade and commerce in the region, outside the region, it’s been very, very optimistic, and we have had great results so far.” Tarar also pointed to growing ties with Malaysia in terms of trade and investment. “So, I think overall in these changing circumstances, Pakistan has played its cards right, and as you saw right after the attack on Doha, the Pakistan delegation was one of the first delegations to reach Doha and express our solidarity with the Qatari leadership. “So, I think Pakistan has not only played its cards right, but Pakistan has formulated a policy where we have had a lot of successes diplomatically. And this could not have been possible without the civil and military leadership being on the same page and without that cohesion and that ideal working relationship that exists between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir. “So, I think it’s also a result, a fruit of that cohesion and synergy that exists between institutions and it’s the stability at home which has enabled us to advocate our case very, very effectively abroad and we see that a lot of other countries are desirous of improving their relations with Pakistan.” US and China The information minister touched upon the burgeoning relations between Pakistan and the United States as well, with President Donald Trump’s frequent praise of PM Shehbaz and the army chief. “I think the way President Donald Trump has more than once praised Pakistan and praised the prime minister and the field marshal and mentioned those seven planes time and time again. So, you know, that’s a point to ponder upon. And we have had a great visit to the US. “Relations have improved immensely. And the recent visit to China. So, I think Pakistan’s relationship with each country has a unique nature. So, one relationship cannot be at the cost of another relationship. And I think that’s where the success of our foreign policy lies. And that’s how we plan to go into the future with a very, very robust, with a very effective and practical foreign policy which will not only give respect to Pakistan but which will also help us to take our economy to new heights so the life of an average Pakistani can also improve.“",

      "title": "‘Pakistan has become extremely relevant,’ Tarar says of foreign policy on global stage after May skirmish",
      "summary": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Monday said that Pakistan had become “extremely relevant” on the global stage after its performance during the military conflict against India in May. The conflict between the two countries in May this year was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Both governments launched diplomatic blitzes after the conflict to take their stance on the ordeal to other countries. Elaborating on Pakistan’s image and standing in the world in the conflict’s aftermath while speaking at a function, the information minister said, “In a very short span of time, we have become extremely relevant in our foreign policy. We have seen in the past two years, and especially after the May war, I think that has redefined who we are.” He said the “turning point” after the Pahalgam incident was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s open offer for an impartial and fair investigation because “we were often blamed for terror acts that were not our fault, and in fact, being the biggest victims of terrorism, there was a propaganda against Pakistan, blaming us for terrorism.” The information minister said that “you can’t be a victim and an aggressor at the same time — it’s an oxymoron, an inherent contradiction, it’s just not possible.” He said no other country could lay claim to the loss of 90,000 lives in the war against terrorism or billions in economic losses. “We are also a shield and a wall between the terrorists and the rest of the world,” Tarar added, saying that the sacrifice of any Pakistani was also for the sake of making the world a better place. The minister said the above sacrifices could not go in vain. “So, I think the time was right that the world heard our story and heard it right. By authoring this investigation just before the war, I think we had a point to prove that our hands were clean, and that point was well taken. “That turning point strengthened our fence, our alliances and countries that were on the fence; it made them realise what Pakistan stands for, and by authoring this investigation, Pakistan made a good diplomatic move which was well received the world over. I think after that, there was immense diplomatic engagement … and that constant engagement really helped us prove our point to the world. “So when I say the world was changing, Pakistan also changed; we saw an aggressive diplomatic change. Our diplomacy worked very well because we were taking it and relations with all countries very seriously. There was no laxity, and there was no room for any complacency, and we were right on the job,” the information minister said. He added that Pakistan did all it could on international media outlets. “We had the strength of the truth, so when we told the story and told it right, the world heard it, and it had an impact. So the right kind of aggressive diplomacy with the right kind of marketing campaign with the right kind of information to counter misinformation and disinformation — so we were everywhere all across,” he further said. National synergy and Gen Z Tarar also said he appreciated the “synergy” with the military’s spokesperson in putting out information, saying it would not have been possible otherwise. “So we were winning on the narrative front and the diplomatic front. When it actually came down to the brass tacks, we had already shot down seven planes and when we were confronted with brute force, we gave them a bloody noise and that befitting response proved our military might so … when it came down to the actual war, Pakistan passed with flying colours and, you know, within hours, actually within four hours, India was compelled to request for a ceasefire. “So, when I say Pakistan is changing, Pakistan actually changed. And I must acknowledge the kind of unity that we displayed as a nation. The resilience of our people, the people of Pakistan, came together, forgot our differences. I remember speaking on the floor of the house and saying that, you know, today, there is no critical point scoring, we are all on the same page, and we will fight the enemy together as a unified force, and that’s exactly what we did.” The information minister, in particular, singled out Gen Z and the use of social media and memes during the conflict. “When I say Pakistan has changed, you know, when it came down to the meme war and the enemy was stunned that our youngsters on social media had actually come up with memes in a very serious situation. And the enemy was wondering what is going on. War is a very serious matter, and they were making memes and they were ridiculing the enemy in their own particular way. “So, even our Gen Z, our younger generation, they played a role with regard to social media. And they took it upon themselves to fight for Pakistan on that platform, on that battlefield, because I often say that, you know, the digital world is divided into two kinds of people. You have digital natives and digital immigrants. “And sometimes the immigrants, you know, they take time to comprehend the ground realities of digital media. But people who are born into the digital age and they are digital natives, they understand that world much better than most of us do. So, I think the digital natives had their own war strategy and had their own way of winning that war.” Relevancy in global events Returning to his main point about Pakistan’s increased global relevance after the conflict, the minister pointed to the country’s involvement in the Gaza peace process. “If you see the way forward, Pakistan has become extremely relevant. When it comes to the situation in Gaza, when it comes to the ceasefire, we are included in the list of Arab Islamic countries that brokered that peace and were part of the negotiations which led to an eventual ceasefire. “And I think that’s a big win for Pakistan where the countries of the world have taken us extremely seriously and believe that the things that we have to say, the advice that we have to give is extremely relevant and very very important. And you have seen that we have had a lot of visits this year and people often talk about foreign visits and the dignitaries coming to Pakistan.” Referring to diplomatic engagements in the past year, he said they had been at their “peak”, saying that Pakistan hosted a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. “After 14 years, we had 12 prime ministers coming to Pakistan, coming to Islamabad and talking about strategic ties, talking about regional cooperation, talking about counter-terrorism, talking about regional connectivity. “So, we had all these things going on in succession. And even now, the way the world has engaged Pakistan, we are going to host the SCO Heads of State Summit in 2027, which is going to be a big event. And with regard to improvement of ties with other partners in the region, we saw the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement taking place with Saudi Arabia, which was, I think, one of the best things to happen to Pakistan in recent history.” Elaborating on the Saudi defence deal, he said people had taken great pride in that agreement and the people of the kingdom also celebrated the union. Tarar also mentioned the launching of the Economic Cooperation Framework, saying it had “really cemented” ties with Saudi Arabia. Acknowledgement of economic stability He said Pakistan’s economic turnaround was also acknowledged by the world. “I think that is something phenomenal because our ratings have improved, our macroeconomic indicators have improved. There is stability which the world has acknowledged. The financial institutions, the world over, are praising Pakistan’s performance in terms of the economic turnaround. So, you know, right from default to development and as I said before, from isolation to relevance. “So, these two slogans really mean a lot when it comes to the government’s performance. That we have taken the economy from default towards development and we have taken our foreign relations from isolation to relevance. And that is how I will define this journey. “And I think the future is very bright.” Situation with Afghanistan and ‘playing cards’ right The information minister also touched on the tense relations with Afghanistan after recent skirmishes and the breakdown of talks in Istanbul, saying that “there is a situation with Afghanistan where we now believe that we have an additional forum where we can present evidence of their involvement in acts of terrorism. And we have been constantly saying that we have irrefutable evidence that their land is used for acts of terrorism. “And whenever an incident takes place and when you backtrack and go into the investigations, you will find somewhere or the other an Afghan citizen involved somewhere. So, this is something which we are dealing with and we have given a very loud and clear message in that regard. “So, I think Pakistan’s situation right now in terms of its economy, foreign direct investment, strategic ties, including trade and commerce in the region, outside the region, it’s been very, very optimistic, and we have had great results so far.” Tarar also pointed to growing ties with Malaysia in terms of trade and investment. “So, I think overall in these changing circumstances, Pakistan has played its cards right, and as you saw right after the attack on Doha, the Pakistan delegation was one of the first delegations to reach Doha and express our solidarity with the Qatari leadership. “So, I think Pakistan has not only played its cards right, but Pakistan has formulated a policy where we have had a lot of successes diplomatically. And this could not have been possible without the civil and military leadership being on the same page and without that cohesion and that ideal working relationship that exists between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir. “So, I think it’s also a result, a fruit of that cohesion and synergy that exists between institutions and it’s the stability at home which has enabled us to advocate our case very, very effectively abroad and we see that a lot of other countries are desirous of improving their relations with Pakistan.” US and China The information minister touched upon the burgeoning relations between Pakistan and the United States as well, with President Donald Trump’s frequent praise of PM Shehbaz and the army chief. “I think the way President Donald Trump has more than once praised Pakistan and praised the prime minister and the field marshal and mentioned those seven planes time and time again. So, you know, that’s a point to ponder upon. And we have had a great visit to the US. “Relations have improved immensely. And the recent visit to China. So, I think Pakistan’s relationship with each country has a unique nature. So, one relationship cannot be at the cost of another relationship. And I think that’s where the success of our foreign policy lies. And that’s how we plan to go into the future with a very, very robust, with a very effective and practical foreign policy which will not only give respect to Pakistan but which will also help us to take our economy to new heights so the life of an average Pakistani can also improve.“",
