      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump repeatedly made an apparent gaffe in a speech Wednesday to world leaders assembled in Switzerland by referring to “Iceland” several times instead of his much coveted “Greenland”, with the White House furiously denying any confusion on his part. The 79-year-old Republican has been clamoring for the United States to acquire Greenland, a large island territory of Denmark, citing what he called security threats from Russia and China in the Arctic Circle. On Wednesday he announced a “ framework ” for a future deal on Greenland and the cancellation of planned tariffs on European countries that had opposed his moves to control the island — but not before ruffling Nato allies and straining transatlantic relations. “I’m helping Nato, and until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,” Trump said during his remarks to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos. “They’re not there for us on Iceland — that I can tell you. I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.” It seemed obvious he was referring to Greenland and not the smaller neighbouring Iceland, an island in the North Atlantic famous for its breathtaking volcanic landscapes. After the speech, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against a post on X by a journalist, Libbey Dean, who wrote that “President Trump appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.” “No he didn’t, Libby. His written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here,” Leavitt fired back on X, misspelling the journalist’s name. During his speech at Davos, Trump, as he often does, frequently strayed from the written script scrolling on the teleprompters. Asked about the events in Davos, Gavin Newsom, California’s Democratic governor and a leading opposition figure in the United States who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028, seized on the moment. “None of this is normal,” Newsom said. “There’s a normalisation, a deviancy of consciousness.” Sensitive subject The issue of mental acuity is a sensitive one for Trump. During the 2024 presidential campaign, he attacked incumbent Joe Biden, claiming the Democrat suffered from dementia. In recent days, some Democratic lawmakers have called for invoking the US Constitution’s 25th Amendment, which allows for removing a president who no longer has the physical or intellectual capacity to carry out the duties of office. The politicians justified their calls by citing a message that Trump had sent to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store. In the message, made public on Monday, Trump expressed his displeasure with not being awarded last year’s Nobel Peace Prize. Trump also reiterated his desire for the US to take control of Greenland. “Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump wrote. However, an independent committee — not the Norwegian government — is the body that awards the peace prize and other Nobel prizes at an annual ceremony in Oslo.",

      "summary_orig": "DAVOS: To muted applause and not a few stony faces, US President Donald Trump took the stage before hundreds of the world’s rich and powerful on Wednesday for the most anticipated speech of this year’s Davos forum. But during the two-hour wait to get in, the excitement to hear the leader of the world’s most powerful nation in person was palpable — “It’s like a rock festival,” one attendee said. Quickly the doors to the World Economic Forum’s packed congress hall closed, forcing hundreds to scramble for spots in overflow rooms to watch him on screens. Even the president of Latvia, Edgars Rinkevics, was stuck in line at one point before an aide guided him elsewhere. “It’s interesting that people were lining up to hear President Trump, like they were not lining to hear any other speaker — none has got such kind of interest,” Rinkevics said. Many were apprehensive about the escalating tensions between Trump and Europe over his bid to seize Greenland , a crisis that has overshadowed the annual schmoozefest’s agenda. “I expect the worst. From what we know from Trump, he always needs to have all the attention and he needs to have a shocker message,” Julia Binder, of the Swiss-based IMD Business School, said. And shock he did. In one overflow room, attendees mockingly laughed and gasped throughout his speech. Guffaws when Trump talked about wind farms killing birds. Nervous laughs when he said he was asking for “a piece of ice”, meaning Greenland. Others said “oh no” when he alleged that “Canada lives because of the United States.” Another exclaimed: “Oh my goodness!” when Trump recalled that Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte once referred to him as “daddy”. More unbelieving laughs broke out when he made fun of French President Emmanuel Macron for wearing sunglasses — due to a burst blood vessel — during his own speech on Tuesday. And howls when he again insisted: “All the US is asking for is a place called Greenland.” “I would say he’s gone from neocon to neo-imperial,” one attendee whispered. An hour into Trump’s rambling speech, people started to leave the overflow rooms. “He’s a nutcase,” one said on the way out. ‘Piece of rock’ Many said Trump was the ideal guest at a forum for hearing provocative voices. “Davos is a platform for and exchange of ideas, of views. So we are here to listen to all views, whether we like them or not,” said Daniel Marokane, chief executive of a South African power company. But others took umbrage at his trademark abrasiveness and attacks, including an insistence that the US deserves Greenland as payback for its massive Nato financing. “Trump got elected because he knows how to read a room, but I’m not sure he read the room this time,” said an American medical technology executive, who like others requested anonymity to protect his company’s identity. “One guy I saw get up and leave, he was visibly shaking with anger.” For Polish President Karol Nawrocki, it was a “very important speech”, not least because Trump claimed he would not use force to acquire Greenland.

      "title_orig": "Fighting fires",
      "summary_orig": "THE Gul Plaza tragedy in Karachi last weekend provided the perfect metaphor and visual example of a lot of what weighs down Pakistan’s economy. This was not the first such fire. Journalist Mahim Maher compiled a list of 60 mall fires in Karachi between 2016 and 2022. “Gul Plaza was a disaster waiting to happen,” she said while re-sharing her interactive map of all these fires on her social media feed. The massive flames engulfing the building were reminiscent of the inflationary fire that engulfed Pakistan between March 2021 and May 2023. The repeated nature of these fires was a parallel to how the economy of Pakistan burns in the fires of a balance-of-payments crisis every few years. New reports talked about how the firefighters were late to the scene. Firefighters attributed this to the traffic mess through which their tenders had to travel to reach the scene. This reminded me of the intense power struggle that has been a constant feature of our politics for decades now, and how the political logjam serves as an obstruction in the path of decision-makers reaching the conclusion they need to reach: the country needs to go to the IMF and swallow the bitter medicine of austerity one more time to douse the economic flames engulfing the country. The firefighters fought heroically. They fought all night. The smouldering remains of the building over the next few days bore testament to the strength they had to muster, the dangers they faced and all that it must have taken to douse the flames. It’s the same when respective governments have fought off a balance-of-payments crisis. The State Bank and the bureaucrats at the finance ministry make some of the toughest choices of their careers during these periods. The high-wire act performed to keep banks afloat in 2008 or to keep the energy supply chain running in 1998 is known only to those who actually performed these deeds. The rest of us may be oblivious to all that it took to keep the country running those days. But we are all in the debt of those who made sure this was the case. The flames consuming Gul Plaza were reminiscent of the inflationary fire that engulfed the country between March 2021 and May 2023. Yet the repeated fires in Karachi mock the efforts of the firefighters, just like the repeated slide into bankruptcy by Pakistan’s economy mocks the efforts of the heroes who had to pull it out of crises in the last episode of bankruptcy. Ms Maher counted 60 fires in six years. That is 10 every year. Yet after Gul Plaza the authorities are once again sending out notices to the Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD) in Karachi to please ensure their buildings have fire exits. I counted almost 25 episodes of bankruptcy for Pakistan since 1988. Yet after each programme ends, every government announces this is the last such programme. The same mistakes are made over and over again. The same flames break out over and over again. The same drama plays out every such fire. And it always has the same ending: everyone gets back to business as usual, no lessons are ever learned, and certainly no lessons ever applied. Pakistan is one of a handful of countries that has spent more time inside an IMF programme than outside in the past quarter century or more. Yet, not once has there been an across-the-board exercise to determine why we keep falling into the same hole every few years, why we keep having to put out the same fire every few years. The reason is simple. Nobody in Karachi, not least in all the administrations the city has had over the decades, is really interested in preventing the next fire. ABAD is not likely to do much to retrofit all buildings in the city that it has built with fire escape plans. According to DIG South, quoted in this paper, the building had 16 exits on the ground floor and 14 of them were closed, while the basement was packed with shoppers. It doesn’t take a lot of brains to know that blocked exits are a fire hazard, but who thinks of preventive maintenance? Who thinks about fire escapes and emergency evacuation plans in a city that literally lives from day to day? Likewise, it doesn’t take a lot of brains to understand that if you burn your foreign currency reserves in a consumptive binge you will go bankrupt. It doesn’t take a lot of brains to realise that if you replenish these reserves with borrowed dollars, you will still go bankrupt but this time with more debt on top of it. It doesn’t take a genius to realise that if you keep doing what everybody before you did, you will land up in the same place as they all did: in bankruptcy, fighting the fires of inflation. Yet they do it over and over again. The Gul Plaza fire was a massive tragedy. Even as the dead are still being counted and identified, it can be said the bigger tragedy will be when the fire is forgotten, when the furore dies down, when normality returns, and people get back to work once again. That is what happened 60 times between 2016 and 2022. It is now gearing up to happen for the 61st time. And exactly the same thing happens with the economy. Every time they put out the fires of inflation, and every time they replenish the foreign currency reserves following a brush with bankruptcy, they spend a year extolling their heroism, reminding everyone how they just put out a fire started by the previous guys. Then they get to work doing the exact same thing the previous guys did, all the while reassuring us that this time the outcome will be different. And because money gets made in these latter periods, nobody complains, except maybe naysaying doomsayers like yours truly. Until the next fire.

      "summary_en": "THE Gul Plaza tragedy in Karachi last weekend provided the perfect metaphor and visual example of a lot of what weighs down Pakistan’s economy. This was not the first such fire. Journalist Mahim Maher compiled a list of 60 mall fires in Karachi between 2016 and 2022. “Gul Plaza was a disaster waiting to happen,” she said while re-sharing her interactive map of all these fires on her social media feed. The massive flames engulfing the building were reminiscent of the inflationary fire that engulfed Pakistan between March 2021 and May 2023. The repeated nature of these fires was a parallel to how the economy of Pakistan burns in the fires of a balance-of-payments crisis every few years. New reports talked about how the firefighters were late to the scene. Firefighters attributed this to the traffic mess through which their tenders had to travel to reach the scene. This reminded me of the intense power struggle that has been a constant feature of our politics for decades now, and how the political logjam serves as an obstruction in the path of decision-makers reaching the conclusion they need to reach: the country needs to go to the IMF and swallow the bitter medicine of austerity one more time to douse the economic flames engulfing the country. The firefighters fought heroically. They fought all night. The smouldering remains of the building over the next few days bore testament to the strength they had to muster, the dangers they faced and all that it must have taken to douse the flames. It’s the same when respective governments have fought off a balance-of-payments crisis. The State Bank and the bureaucrats at the finance ministry make some of the toughest choices of their careers during these periods. The high-wire act performed to keep banks afloat in 2008 or to keep the energy supply chain running in 1998 is known only to those who actually performed these deeds. The rest of us may be oblivious to all that it took to keep the country running those days. But we are all in the debt of those who made sure this was the case. The flames consuming Gul Plaza were reminiscent of the inflationary fire that engulfed the country between March 2021 and May 2023. Yet the repeated fires in Karachi mock the efforts of the firefighters, just like the repeated slide into bankruptcy by Pakistan’s economy mocks the efforts of the heroes who had to pull it out of crises in the last episode of bankruptcy. Ms Maher counted 60 fires in six years. That is 10 every year. Yet after Gul Plaza the authorities are once again sending out notices to the Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD) in Karachi to please ensure their buildings have fire exits. I counted almost 25 episodes of bankruptcy for Pakistan since 1988. Yet after each programme ends, every government announces this is the last such programme. The same mistakes are made over and over again. The same flames break out over and over again. The same drama plays out every such fire. And it always has the same ending: everyone gets back to business as usual, no lessons are ever learned, and certainly no lessons ever applied.

      "summary_orig": "• Rule out use of force, lifts tariff threat against European countries • European Parliament suspends work on EU-US trade deal DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had reached a framework for a deal over Greenland following a meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte, and that he would therefore waive tariffs scheduled to hit European allies. In a speech on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump for the first time ruled out using force, but demanded “immediate negotiations” to acquire the island from Denmark. “We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Meanwhile, the European Parliament decided to suspend its work on a trade deal between the 27-member bloc and the United States, a parliament member said, following President Trump’s repeated threats to take control over Greenland. The US president did not provide any details on the framework, but added that his threatened tariffs against European countries which were resisting his quest to acquire Greenland was now off the table. “Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,” Trump wrote. In a speech that veered from topic to topic, Trump also expressed hope of ending the Ukraine war soon. Trump’s quest to take the strategic Arctic island of Greenland from Nato ally Denmark has deeply shaken the global order and markets. “We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher after his speech, and jumped further following his post. Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China. But Trump appeared to take the threat of military action off the table, in a dramatic turnaround from his previous threats that the US could use force to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island. “We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher on Wednesday after Trump’s comments. Denmark said it was a “positive” sign that Trump had said he wanted to avoid military force — but stressed that the US president had not backed away from his push to acquire Greenland. “What is quite clear after this speech is that the president’s ambition remains intact,” Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said. Greenland’s government meanwhile unveiled a new brochure on Wednesday offering advice to the population in the event of a “crisis” in the territory, saying it was an “insurance policy”. ‘Immediate negotiations’ Trump repeatedly pushed his claims to Greenland — which he mistakenly called Iceland several times — during lengthy remarks on the deepest crisis in transatlantic relations for decades. He said he was “seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States” and added that Washington would “remember” if Denmark said no. Trump says Greenland is under threat from Russia and China. The US president also lambasted Europe on a number of fronts from security to tariffs and the economy, saying it was “not heading in the right direction”. Trump flew into Davos by helicopter, stepping onto a red carpet laid in the snow — but he flew into a growing international storm over Greenland. He arrived some two hours behind schedule, after an electrical issue earlier forced Air Force One to turn back to Washington and the president to switch planes. Europe and Canada had earlier closed ranks against what they view as a threat to the US-led global order from Trump’s territorial ambitions. French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said Europe would not be bullied. But Trump, who was due to meet a number of leaders in Davos, renewed his attacks on the two leaders, mocking Macron in particular for wearing sunglasses at Davos, which the French president said was because of an eye condition. ‘Thoughtful diplomacy’ Trump also repeatedly expressed doubts on Nato during his speech, saying Washington was treated “so unfairly” and questioning whether the alliance would defend the United States if asked. Nato chief Mark Rutte, whom Trump was due to meet in Davos, said that “thoughtful diplomacy” was needed to resolve the crisis. The Greenland row has also soured relations with the European Union, which has threatened countermeasures after Trump vowed tariffs of up to 25pc on eight European countries for backing Denmark. UN chief warns UN chief Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday of world leaders upending international order in a statement made as President Donald Trump said the United States needs to acquire Greenland in a hardline speech at Davos. “When leaders run roughshod over international law, picking & choosing which rules to follow — they are undermining global order & setting a perilous precedent,” Guterres said on X. “When a handful of individuals can bend global narratives, sway elections, or dictate the terms of public debate, we are facing inequality and the corruption of institutions.” Published in Dawn, January 22nd, 2026",

      "summary": "• Rule out use of force, lifts tariff threat against European countries • European Parliament suspends work on EU-US trade deal DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had reached a framework for a deal over Greenland following a meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte, and that he would therefore waive tariffs scheduled to hit European allies. In a speech on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump for the first time ruled out using force, but demanded “immediate negotiations” to acquire the island from Denmark. “We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Meanwhile, the European Parliament decided to suspend its work on a trade deal between the 27-member bloc and the United States, a parliament member said, following President Trump’s repeated threats to take control over Greenland. The US president did not provide any details on the framework, but added that his threatened tariffs against European countries which were resisting his quest to acquire Greenland was now off the table. “Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,” Trump wrote. In a speech that veered from topic to topic, Trump also expressed hope of ending the Ukraine war soon. Trump’s quest to take the strategic Arctic island of Greenland from Nato ally Denmark has deeply shaken the global order and markets. “We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher after his speech, and jumped further following his post. Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China. But Trump appeared to take the threat of military action off the table, in a dramatic turnaround from his previous threats that the US could use force to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island. “We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher on Wednesday after Trump’s comments. Denmark said it was a “positive” sign that Trump had said he wanted to avoid military force — but stressed that the US president had not backed away from his push to acquire Greenland. “What is quite clear after this speech is that the president’s ambition remains intact,” Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said. Greenland’s government meanwhile unveiled a new brochure on Wednesday offering advice to the population in the event of a “crisis” in the territory, saying it was an “insurance policy”. ‘Immediate negotiations’ Trump repeatedly pushed his claims to Greenland — which he mistakenly called Iceland several times — during lengthy remarks on the deepest crisis in transatlantic relations for decades. He said he was “seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States” and added that Washington would “remember” if Denmark said no. Trump says Greenland is under threat from Russia and China. The US president also lambasted Europe on a number of fronts from security to tariffs and the economy, saying it was “not heading in the right direction”. Trump flew into Davos by helicopter, stepping onto a red carpet laid in the snow — but he flew into a growing international storm over Greenland. He arrived some two hours behind schedule, after an electrical issue earlier forced Air Force One to turn back to Washington and the president to switch planes. Europe and Canada had earlier closed ranks against what they view as a threat to the US-led global order from Trump’s territorial ambitions. French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said Europe would not be bullied. But Trump, who was due to meet a number of leaders in Davos, renewed his attacks on the two leaders, mocking Macron in particular for wearing sunglasses at Davos, which the French president said was because of an eye condition. ‘Thoughtful diplomacy’ Trump also repeatedly expressed doubts on Nato during his speech, saying Washington was treated “so unfairly” and questioning whether the alliance would defend the United States if asked. Nato chief Mark Rutte, whom Trump was due to meet in Davos, said that “thoughtful diplomacy” was needed to resolve the crisis. The Greenland row has also soured relations with the European Union, which has threatened countermeasures after Trump vowed tariffs of up to 25pc on eight European countries for backing Denmark.

      "summary_orig": "• PTI opposes law; PML-N supports it despite earlier reservations • House passes CSR bill mandating 1pc profit spending by large firms • Questions raised by minister over 18th Amendment spark controversy • Tallal Chaudhry says Imran is in good health, receiving facilities under jail rules • Illegal occupation of railway land by govt departments being regularised, NA told ISLAMABAD: The National Asse­mbly on Wednesday passed a bill seeking secrecy of lawmakers’ assets, a move that had been opposed by the PML-N and PTI in August last year. Interestingly, the bill, moved by PPP’s Shazia Marri, had faced opposition from both parties during a committee meeting in August, but this time the PTI was the only party to oppose it. The bill was taken up for immediate consideration soon after National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs Chairman Rana Iradat Sharif Khan presented the committee’s report. Under Section 137 of the Elections Act, all members of parliament and provincial assemblies are required to submit to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), on or before Dec 31 each year, a statement of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouses and dependent children. Section 138 of the Act requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette. The proposed amendment to Section 138 seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the Speaker of the concerned Assembly or, as the case may be, the chairman of the Senate may, on an application made by a member and for reasons to be recorded in writing, by a ruling delivered in the chamber, determine that the statement of assets and liabilities of that member shall not be published publicly by the Commission if such publication would pose a serious threat to the life or safety of the member or, as the case may be, his family, for a period not exceeding one year at a time and subject to the condition that a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities shall be submitted confidentially to the Election Commission.” According to the statement of objects and reasons, the amendment aims to strike a balance between transparency and protection of individual rights. It states that while the publication of asset declarations promotes accountability, public trust and good governance, unrestricted disclosure could compromise the personal security and privacy of parliamentarians and their families. Speaking in the House, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar explained that although members would still be required to submit their financial statements to the ECP, these may not necessarily be made public. He said the bill empowered legislative bodies to exercise greater control over the transparency of financial disclosures. Barrister Gohar Ali Khan of the PTI strongly opposed the amendment, arguing that the proposed cha­n­ges would transfer election-related matters from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to a constitutional court, thereby undermining the judiciary’s authority in electoral issues. The House also passed the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) bill, making it mandatory for large companies with significant profits to spend one per cent of their profits on CSR activities. The statement of objects and reasons of the bill, moved by Dr Nafisa Shah and introduced through a supplementary agenda, stated that the corporate sector must contribute to the social and economic wellbeing of the poor and needy and help create a better environment for all. ‘Imran in good health’ Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry told the House that all facilities were being provided to PTI founder Imran Khan in accordance with the jail manual and that he was in good health. He said meetings were allowed as per the rules and shared statistics showing that 850 people, including family members and doctors, had met the former prime minister. Responding to points raised by PTI lawmaker Shahid Khatak regarding an alleged ban on meetings and claims of solitary confinement, the minister said that such a large number of meetings had not been allowed for prisoners in the past three decades. He also criticised PTI leaders for repeatedly questioning whether Imran Khan was alive. Tallal Chaudhry further said the government would proceed with a military operation in certain parts of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, including erstwhile Fata. He said implementation of the National Action Plan was ongoing in consultation with provincial governments and insisted that the KP government was fully on board. “There will be no sympathy for terrorists, and action will be taken at all costs,” he said while blaming the PTI-led provincial government for unrest in KP due to its failure to establish the Counter Terrorism Dep­artment despite ongoing militant activity. 18th Amendment controversy Another highlight of the proceedings was renewed controversy over the 18th Amendment after comments by ministers sparked a heated debate on provincial autonomy. The issue res­urfaced after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s remarks and was further fuelled when Minister for Food Security Rana Tanvir Hussain questioned whether “everything was fine after the 18th Amendment”, referring to a recent fire incident in Karachi. PPP MNA Naveed Qamar reacted sharply, saying Khawaja Asif’s comments should be seen as a government policy statement. He warned that any attempt to transfer municipal services to the Centre would undermine the federal structure. He criticised the defence minister for calling the 18th Amendment a “charade” and accused the government of weakening provincial autonomy. He urged the government to focus on constitutional issues and public welfare instead of destabilising political moves. PPP lawmaker Sehar Kamran asked Khawaja Asif to explain how the 18th Amendment was a drama, remarking that issuing an ordinance without the president’s consent and signature was the real “drama”. Senator Aliya Kamran of the JUI-F also termed criticism of the amendment inappropriate, recalling that it had been passed with the consent of the PML-N. MQM’s Hafeezuddin said there was no harm in discussing the 18th Amendment. Law Minister Tarar clarified that such remarks should be vie­wed as personal opinions rather than official government policy. Earlier, during question hour, the House was informed that unauthorised possession of railway land by government departments was being regularised through leases under the railway land policy. Parliamentary Secr­etary for Railways Usman Awaisi said an anti-encroachment drive had been launched to retrieve valuable land, adding that 781.84 acres of Pakistan Railways land had been recovered between July 2024 and June 2025.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: In a harrowing development, at least 30 bodies were recovered from a gutted shop as rescuers combed through the wreckage of Karachi’s Gul Plaza on Wednesday. Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the remains of 30 humans had been recovered from a shop called “Dubai Crockery” located on the mezzanine floor. He said that earlier in the day, rescue workers had recovered three more bodies, which had taken the toll from 28 to 31. He added that with the discovery of the bodies from the gutted shop, the death toll was estimated to have risen to 61. However, he cautioned that a final conclusion about the death toll could only be reached after receiving the DNA reports. He said that the relatives of those missing as well as the shopkeepers had previously indicated the possibility of there being a large number of people at the shop. Raza said that as per the last contact with the victims, they had believed they would be safe and the fire would be controlled but had suffocated to death while waiting. Regarding the visit of a bomb disposal squad to the scene of the fire, the South police chief said that so far no evidence of mischief had emerged during the initial investigation. A resident of the area, Rasheed, told Dawn that the shop had announced a sale for the wedding season. For this purpose, it had decided to stay open till 2am, even though it usually closed at 10pm. The fire had erupted at the Gul Plaza on Saturday night. While the fire at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. Inquiry committee visits gutted plaza Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the convener of an inquiry committee formed by the Sindh government to probe the circumstances of the fire, visited the gutted plaza. Karachi Additional Inspector General Azad Khan, who is also a member of the committee, accompanied the commissioner. Speaking to the media, the Karachi commissioner said the inquiry had just begun. He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous. Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards. The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far. “We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared. KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots. He said one portion of the building had been cleared while two other portions were in the process of being cleared. “We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable. He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was recieved about the fire on Saturday night. He further added that shopkeepers had created a chaos-like situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops. He said that the door leading to the buildin’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted which was why all the exits were closed. Rimpa Plaza affected due to blaze According to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), a part of the structure of Rimpa Plaza — another shopping mall adjacent to Gul Plaza — has also been affected due to continued exposure to heat and fire. SBCA Director General Muzammil Halepota told Dawn that three floors of the 13-storey building had been affected, and a SBCA technical committee had visited the site on Tuesday. They found that two pillars had been weakened and the SBCA suggested jacketing to strengthen the pillars by adding a layer of steel supports around them. “An SBCA team has started the process,” Halepota said, adding that a notice had also been issued to the owners of Rimpa Plaza regarding the pillars’ repair. Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi also visited Gul Plaza. Speaking to the media at the site, he said the inquiry into the incident was a complicated one as it had multiple angles. He said the matter would have to be probed from all angles, and the inquiry committee would try to make “long-term and far-reaching recommendations” to the government. Tessori meets delegation of traders Separately, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori met a delegation led by Gul Plaza President Tanveer Pasta and Karachi Chamber of Commerce’s Javed Balwani. A statement issued by the governor’s office said Pasta appreciated Tessori’s efforts for the “timely rescue operation and effective measures” after the fire erupted at Gul Plaza and thanked him for “raising his voice for the victims” of the tragedy at every forum. “During the meeting, Tanveer Pasta agreed, in principle, with the recommendations of the Sindh governor and Karachi Chamber of Commerce,” the statement said, without elaborating on the said recommendations. All Gul Plaza records available, SBCA maintains The SBCA, a day earlier, had rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”. “The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”. According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998. “Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said. “A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.” The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies. It is worth noting that South DIG Asad Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire. “The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body. “The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.",

It is worth noting that South DIG Asad Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire. “The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body. “The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.",

      "summary": "KARACHI: In a harrowing development, at least 30 bodies were recovered from a gutted shop as rescuers combed through the wreckage of Karachi’s Gul Plaza on Wednesday. Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the remains of 30 humans had been recovered from a shop called “Dubai Crockery” located on the mezzanine floor. He said that earlier in the day, rescue workers had recovered three more bodies, which had taken the toll from 28 to 31. He added that with the discovery of the bodies from the gutted shop, the death toll was estimated to have risen to 61. However, he cautioned that a final conclusion about the death toll could only be reached after receiving the DNA reports. He said that the relatives of those missing as well as the shopkeepers had previously indicated the possibility of there being a large number of people at the shop. Raza said that as per the last contact with the victims, they had believed they would be safe and the fire would be controlled but had suffocated to death while waiting. Regarding the visit of a bomb disposal squad to the scene of the fire, the South police chief said that so far no evidence of mischief had emerged during the initial investigation. A resident of the area, Rasheed, told Dawn that the shop had announced a sale for the wedding season. For this purpose, it had decided to stay open till 2am, even though it usually closed at 10pm. The fire had erupted at the Gul Plaza on Saturday night. While the fire at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. Inquiry committee visits gutted plaza Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the convener of an inquiry committee formed by the Sindh government to probe the circumstances of the fire, visited the gutted plaza. Karachi Additional Inspector General Azad Khan, who is also a member of the committee, accompanied the commissioner. Speaking to the media, the Karachi commissioner said the inquiry had just begun. He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous. Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards. The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far. “We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared. KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots. He said one portion of the building had been cleared while two other portions were in the process of being cleared. “We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable. He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was recieved about the fire on Saturday night. He further added that shopkeepers had created a chaos-like situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops. He said that the door leading to the buildin’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted which was why all the exits were closed. Rimpa Plaza affected due to blaze According to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), a part of the structure of Rimpa Plaza — another shopping mall adjacent to Gul Plaza — has also been affected due to continued exposure to heat and fire. SBCA Director General Muzammil Halepota told Dawn that three floors of the 13-storey building had been affected, and a SBCA technical committee had visited the site on Tuesday. They found that two pillars had been weakened and the SBCA suggested jacketing to strengthen the pillars by adding a layer of steel supports around them. “An SBCA team has started the process,” Halepota said, adding that a notice had also been issued to the owners of Rimpa Plaza regarding the pillars’ repair. Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi also visited Gul Plaza. Speaking to the media at the site, he said the inquiry into the incident was a complicated one as it had multiple angles. He said the matter would have to be probed from all angles, and the inquiry committee would try to make “long-term and far-reaching recommendations” to the government. Tessori meets delegation of traders Separately, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori met a delegation led by Gul Plaza President Tanveer Pasta and Karachi Chamber of Commerce’s Javed Balwani. A statement issued by the governor’s office said Pasta appreciated Tessori’s efforts for the “timely rescue operation and effective measures” after the fire erupted at Gul Plaza and thanked him for “raising his voice for the victims” of the tragedy at every forum. “During the meeting, Tanveer Pasta agreed, in principle, with the recommendations of the Sindh governor and Karachi Chamber of Commerce,” the statement said, without elaborating on the said recommendations. All Gul Plaza records available, SBCA maintains The SBCA, a day earlier, had rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”. “The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”. According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998. “Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said. “A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.” The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday urged the government to hold “unconditional” talks with the opposition, saying that there should be no conditions in dialogue between political parties. Speaking to the media, Gohar said that it was wrong to say that negotiations would only be held on specific topics. “It is wrong to say that negotiations will be held on this topic but this topic cannot be included in negotiations,” he said. “If you want to hold dialogue, you should speak on all topics,” he said. At the same time, the PTI chairman said that he did not have the authority to negotiate with the government. He said that Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas — who were recently appointed opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate, respectively — had been given the authority to hold talks with the government. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has stated that PTI founder Imran Khan has given Achakzai and Abbas the responsibility of making decisions — be it about talks with the government or protests. “I will give them my consultation if they require it,” Gohar said. He further said that if the government wished to “shake the hand” of the opposition, it should do so with both of its hands. “The stick and carrot policy does not work. [Throwing] a punch with one hand and extending the other one does not work,” he said. Gohar also said that PTI founder Imran was facing a multitude of cases, adding that the ex-premier’s lawyers should be allowed to meet him. He said that a PTI delegation had held a meeting with National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and highlighted the fact that meetings with Imran were not being allowed. Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. However, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar had said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with Imran. Meanwhile, in his maiden speech as the National Assembly opposition leader on Monday, Achakzai had extended an olive branch to the government and offered “unconditional support” to empower Parliament. PTI rejects NA’s passage of bill seeking to amend Elections Act Separately, the PTI rejected the passage of the Elections (Amendment) Bill 2026 by the National Assembly, terming it a “direct assault” on the fundamental principles of the right to information, transparency, and accountability. “This bill grants parliamentarians the ability to hide details of their assets from the public under the vague and undefined guise of ‘security concerns,’ which essentially provides a legal shield for the current ruling class,” the party said in a statement. “Such laws do not strengthen democracy; instead, they weaken it and severely undermine the public’s trust in the government,” it said. The PTI alleged that parties which claimed to champion democracy, transparency, and parliamentary values were now legislating to “conceal the ill-gotten wealth” they had accumulated through “corrupt practices and misuse of power”. “The nation is well aware of the sources of their illicit wealth; it is the result of corruption, looting, and the abuse of authority,” it said. “The public is fully informed, and no law can hide the truth. This bill is an affront to the consciousness of the people. “These parties, who repeatedly preach about accountability, good governance, and democratic values, are practically erecting walls of immunity and protection for themselves,” it stated. The PTI contended that such laws proved that some political parties represented not the public but their own personal and class interests, and the dual standard was hollowing out Pakistan’s democratic system from within. “If any member of parliament has genuine security concerns, the solution is not to hide assets, but for the government to ensure the protection of their life and property,” it said. “Keeping asset details hidden from the public opens the door to corruption and provides the political elite with unjust protection for their ill-gotten wealth,” it said. The PTI said that this bill contradicted the global principles of transparent governance and was a “conspiracy” to push Pakistan further into the quagmire of unchecked corruption. “In line with the vision of PTI’s leader Imran Khan, the party has always been a strong advocate for transparency. Therefore, this controversial amendment must be immediately revoked,” it said. “The nation has the right to be informed about the sources of its representatives’ wealth. Transparency is not a privilege but the foundation of democracy,” it added.",

Gohar also said that PTI founder Imran was facing a multitude of cases, adding that the ex-premier’s lawyers should be allowed to meet him. He said that a PTI delegation had held a meeting with National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and highlighted the fact that meetings with Imran were not being allowed. Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. However, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar had said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with Imran. Meanwhile, in his maiden speech as the National Assembly opposition leader on Monday, Achakzai had extended an olive branch to the government and offered “unconditional support” to empower Parliament. PTI rejects NA’s passage of bill seeking to amend Elections Act Separately, the PTI rejected the passage of the Elections (Amendment) Bill 2026 by the National Assembly, terming it a “direct assault” on the fundamental principles of the right to information, transparency, and accountability. “This bill grants parliamentarians the ability to hide details of their assets from the public under the vague and undefined guise of ‘security concerns,’ which essentially provides a legal shield for the current ruling class,” the party said in a statement. “Such laws do not strengthen democracy; instead, they weaken it and severely undermine the public’s trust in the government,” it said. The PTI alleged that parties which claimed to champion democracy, transparency, and parliamentary values were now legislating to “conceal the ill-gotten wealth” they had accumulated through “corrupt practices and misuse of power”. “The nation is well aware of the sources of their illicit wealth; it is the result of corruption, looting, and the abuse of authority,” it said. “The public is fully informed, and no law can hide the truth. This bill is an affront to the consciousness of the people. “These parties, who repeatedly preach about accountability, good governance, and democratic values, are practically erecting walls of immunity and protection for themselves,” it stated. The PTI contended that such laws proved that some political parties represented not the public but their own personal and class interests, and the dual standard was hollowing out Pakistan’s democratic system from within. “If any member of parliament has genuine security concerns, the solution is not to hide assets, but for the government to ensure the protection of their life and property,” it said. “Keeping asset details hidden from the public opens the door to corruption and provides the political elite with unjust protection for their ill-gotten wealth,” it said. The PTI said that this bill contradicted the global principles of transparent governance and was a “conspiracy” to push Pakistan further into the quagmire of unchecked corruption. “In line with the vision of PTI’s leader Imran Khan, the party has always been a strong advocate for transparency. Therefore, this controversial amendment must be immediately revoked,” it said. “The nation has the right to be informed about the sources of its representatives’ wealth. Transparency is not a privilege but the foundation of democracy,” it added.",

      "title_orig": "IHC grants pre-arrest bail to Imaan, Hadi in case dating back to July",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday granted activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha pre-arrest bail in a case pertaining to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) that dates back to July 2025 and resurfaced a day earlier. The two had filed pre-arrest bail applications in the case. However, their bail pleas could not be taken up on an urgent basis on Tuesday while the couple struggled to avoid arrest. The couple took refuge in the IHCBA president’s office, where they spent the whole night, while a large number of police officials remained outside the premises. During the hearing on Wednesday, Justice Muhammad Azam Khan of the IHC took up the pre-arrest application and approved Mazari and Chattha’s bail against surety bonds of Rs10,000 each. Advocate Kamran Murtaza appeared on behalf of the petitioners, and a large number of lawyers and officials from the IHCBA were present in the courtroom in solidarity with the applicants. Addressing the court, Murtaza said that this was the first time in the country’s judicial history that a woman had to spend the night on court premises, adding that he personally felt responsible for what happened. “If there had been an old case, they would have arrested her first,” he said, adding that the petitioners had been appearing in various cases since July. “You are the custodian of the high court. You must ensure that no one is taken away from here,” the defence counsel pleaded with the judge. “We are not enemies of the country. As much as you have the right, I also have the right to be in this building,” advocate Murtaza said. He requested that the court grant protective bail and sought directions that no arrest should be made in any other case unless it has been formally placed on record. In response to his request, Justice Khan observed, “I am passing orders only to the extent of the FIR that is before me.” Subsequently, Justice Khan granted protective bail to Mazari and Chattha and restrained police from arresting them in the case. Social media posts case July’s first information report (FIR) surfaced a day after the IHC granted Mazari and Chattha one-day protective bail in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts. The two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. It has been registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA). The case is being heard by a trial court in Islamabad, which had issued arrest warrants for the two last week. Subsequently, Mazari and Chattha approached the IHC , challenging the trial court’s January 15 arrest orders. Yesterday, the IHC declared the trial court’s order against them null and void and directed that they be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. The IHC categorically clarified that Mazari and Chattha should not be arrested in the case. But, it also stated that if they failed to appear before the trial court, the protection granted under the order would stand automatically terminated. The trial court was further directed that in case of their non-appearance, proceedings may continue in accordance with the law. An Islamabad district and sessions court resumed hearing in the case today, in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. At the hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka expressed displeasure over the continued absence of the accused from the hearings and warned that their right to cross-examination would be terminated if the process was not completed within the court-mandated time. When the proceedings commenced, an assistant counsel representing Mazari and Chattah informed Judge Majoka that the IHC was simultaneously hearing their bail pleas and that they would appear before the trial court after proceedings at the high court. Upon receiving this information, the court adjourned the hearing until 1:30pm. When the hearing resumed, the court directed the prosecution to read out the IHC’s order. Judge Majoka observed that the IHC’s order had been received at 3:28pm on January 20 while the prosecution argued that the high court had upheld the trial court’s order to the extent of the cancellation of Mazari and Chattha’s bail and the issuance of arrest warrants for the accused. The judge observed that the case’s trial had to be completed within four days, in line with the IHC’s directives. Subsequently, the hearing was again adjourned until 2:30pm. However, Mazari and Chattha were still not present when the proceedings resumed, which prompted stern remarks from Judge Majoka. “Despite being granted two-day protective bail, the suspects failed to attend the proceedings, which appears to be a deliberate act intended to delay the trial,” he said. Judge Majoka noted that the high court had directed the trial court to complete the cross-examination within four days, and that the order was received on January 20. Accordingly, the accused had been directed to complete the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses by 3:30pm on January 24, the judge observed, issuing the directives that the accused must complete the cross-examination by the court-mandated time. He warned that no further time would be granted “if the court’s time is wasted”. “If the cross-examination is not completed by 3:30 pm on January 24, the right to cross-examine will stand terminated,” the court stated and adjourned the hearing till Thursday (tomorrow). ‘Legal harassment’ The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), meanwhile, expressed serious concern over what it called the “continued harassment” of Mazari and Chattha. In a statement posted on X, the HRCP noted that the two “now face yet another allegedly fabricated first information report that was filed immediately after the Islamabad High Court reinstated their bail in a previous case on charges under the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016” — a reference to the July 2025 case. “While they have been granted protective bail in this case as well, such a pattern of serial litigation appears designed to punish and intimidate individuals through legal harassment rather than to uphold due process. “We call on the authorities to immediately halt the misuse of the Peca laws, respect the orders of the superior judiciary and ensure that all citizens’ fundamental rights to liberty, fair trial and freedom of expression are fully protected,” the statement said.",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday granted activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha pre-arrest bail in a case pertaining to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) that dates back to July 2025 and resurfaced a day earlier. The two had filed pre-arrest bail applications in the case. However, their bail pleas could not be taken up on an urgent basis on Tuesday while the couple struggled to avoid arrest. The couple took refuge in the IHCBA president’s office, where they spent the whole night, while a large number of police officials remained outside the premises. During the hearing on Wednesday, Justice Muhammad Azam Khan of the IHC took up the pre-arrest application and approved Mazari and Chattha’s bail against surety bonds of Rs10,000 each. Advocate Kamran Murtaza appeared on behalf of the petitioners, and a large number of lawyers and officials from the IHCBA were present in the courtroom in solidarity with the applicants. Addressing the court, Murtaza said that this was the first time in the country’s judicial history that a woman had to spend the night on court premises, adding that he personally felt responsible for what happened. “If there had been an old case, they would have arrested her first,” he said, adding that the petitioners had been appearing in various cases since July. “You are the custodian of the high court. You must ensure that no one is taken away from here,” the defence counsel pleaded with the judge. “We are not enemies of the country. As much as you have the right, I also have the right to be in this building,” advocate Murtaza said. He requested that the court grant protective bail and sought directions that no arrest should be made in any other case unless it has been formally placed on record. In response to his request, Justice Khan observed, “I am passing orders only to the extent of the FIR that is before me.” Subsequently, Justice Khan granted protective bail to Mazari and Chattha and restrained police from arresting them in the case. Social media posts case July’s first information report (FIR) surfaced a day after the IHC granted Mazari and Chattha one-day protective bail in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts. The two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. It has been registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA). The case is being heard by a trial court in Islamabad, which had issued arrest warrants for the two last week. Subsequently, Mazari and Chattha approached the IHC , challenging the trial court’s January 15 arrest orders. Yesterday, the IHC declared the trial court’s order against them null and void and directed that they be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. The IHC categorically clarified that Mazari and Chattha should not be arrested in the case. But, it also stated that if they failed to appear before the trial court, the protection granted under the order would stand automatically terminated. The trial court was further directed that in case of their non-appearance, proceedings may continue in accordance with the law. An Islamabad district and sessions court resumed hearing in the case today, in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. At the hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka expressed displeasure over the continued absence of the accused from the hearings and warned that their right to cross-examination would be terminated if the process was not completed within the court-mandated time. When the proceedings commenced, an assistant counsel representing Mazari and Chattah informed Judge Majoka that the IHC was simultaneously hearing their bail pleas and that they would appear before the trial court after proceedings at the high court. Upon receiving this information, the court adjourned the hearing until 1:30pm. When the hearing resumed, the court directed the prosecution to read out the IHC’s order. Judge Majoka observed that the IHC’s order had been received at 3:28pm on January 20 while the prosecution argued that the high court had upheld the trial court’s order to the extent of the cancellation of Mazari and Chattha’s bail and the issuance of arrest warrants for the accused. The judge observed that the case’s trial had to be completed within four days, in line with the IHC’s directives. Subsequently, the hearing was again adjourned until 2:30pm. However, Mazari and Chattha were still not present when the proceedings resumed, which prompted stern remarks from Judge Majoka. “Despite being granted two-day protective bail, the suspects failed to attend the proceedings, which appears to be a deliberate act intended to delay the trial,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "The world’s biggest nuclear power plant was restarted on Wednesday for the first time since the 2011 Fukushima disaster , its Japanese operator said, despite persistent safety concerns among residents. The plant was “started at 19:02”, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) spokesman Tatsuya Matoba told AFP of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Niigata prefecture. The regional governor approved the resumption last month, although public opinion remains sharply divided. On Tuesday, a few dozen protesters — mostly elderly — braved freezing temperatures to demonstrate in the snow near the plant’s entrance, whose buildings line the Sea of Japan coast. “It’s Tokyo’s electricity that is produced in Kashiwazaki, so why should the people here be put at risk? That makes no sense,” Yumiko Abe, a 73-year-old resident, told AFP . Around 60 per cent of residents oppose the restart, while 37pc support it, according to a survey conducted in September. TEPCO said on Wednesday it would “proceed with careful verification of each plant facility’s integrity” and address any issues appropriately and transparently. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted. The facility was taken offline when Japan pulled the plug on nuclear power after a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown in 2011. However, resource-poor Japan now wants to revive atomic energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has voiced support for the energy source. Fourteen reactors, mostly in western and southern Japan, have resumed operation since the post-Fukushima shutdown under strict safety rules, with 13 running as of mid January. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first TEPCO-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates the stricken Fukushima Daiichi plant, now being decommissioned. Nearly 15 years after the disaster, “the situation is still not under control in Fukushima, and TEPCO wants to revive a plant? For me, that’s absolutely unacceptable”, said Keisuke Abe, an 81-year-old demonstrator. ‘Anxious and fearful’ The vast Kashiwazaki-Kariwa complex has been fitted with a 15-metre-high tsunami wall, elevated emergency power systems and other safety upgrades. However, residents raised concerns about the risk of a serious accident, citing frequent cover-up scandals, minor accidents and evacuation plans they say are inadequate. “I think it’s impossible to evacuate in an emergency,” Chie Takakuwa, a 79-year-old resident of Kariwa, told AFP . On January 8, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to TEPCO and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority. The petition said the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong quake in 2007. “We can’t remove the fear of being hit by another unforeseen earthquake,” it said. “Making many people anxious and fearful so as to send electricity to Tokyo … is intolerable.” Before the 2011 disaster — which killed around 18,000 people — nuclear power generated about a third of Japan’s electricity. String of scandals Japan’s nuclear industry has also faced a string of scandals and incidents in recent weeks, including data falsification by Chubu Electric Power to underestimate seismic risks. At Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, TEPCO said on Saturday that an alarm system failed during a test. “Safety is an ongoing process, which means operators involved in nuclear power must never be arrogant or overconfident,” TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa said in an interview with the Asahi daily newspaper. Japan is the world’s fifth-largest single-country emitter of carbon dioxide after China, the United States, India and Russia, and is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels. Nearly 70pc of its electricity in 2023 came from coal, gas and oil — a share Tokyo wants to slash to 30-40pc over the next 15 years as it expands renewable energy and nuclear power. Under a plan approved by the government in February, nuclear power will account for around a fifth of Japan’s energy supply by 2040 — up from around 8.5pc in the fiscal year 2023-24. Meanwhile, Japan still faces the daunting task of decommissioning the Fukushima plant, a project expected to take decades.",
