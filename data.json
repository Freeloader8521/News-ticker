Kim made the remarks during a live-streamed town hall meeting last week on a proposed administrative merger between Gwangju and South Jeolla Province, saying the idea was to help rural bachelors marry and stem population decline in the region. He used a Korean word that refers to young or unmarried women. His words quickly drew criticism. Last week, the Embassy of Vietnam in Korea sent protest letters to South Jeolla Province and Jindo County. “The remarks have already caused outrage and offense within the Vietnamese community in Korea and continue to generate controversy and concern,” the statement said, urging authorities to take the matter seriously, apologize and make amends for the phrase “importing Vietnamese women.” The statement also said that the Vietnamese community in Korea — particularly th",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A judicial magistrate on Monday declared two PTI leaders — former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur and ex-National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub — absconders in two case pertaining to the party’s 2022 ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi March ’. The march is one of several protests that the party has carried out following the ouster of PTI founder Imran Khan as the prime minister through a no-confidence vote in 2022. Judicial Magistrate Mubashir Hassan Chishti heard the two cases related to the protest, registered at Islamabad’s Bara Kahu police station, declaring Ayub and Gandapur absconders and issuing their perpetual arrest warrants over their persistent absence from hearings. Judge Chishti observed that the two had failed to appear before the court despite the issuance of summons multiple times. They also did not furnished any plausible justification for their absence, the judge noted. They were summoned several times, but they continued to evade the proceedings, the judge remarked. Making these observations, he declared both PTI leaders absconders and directed the issuance of permanent arrest warrants for them so that they are presented before the court. Over Gandapur and Ayub’s persistent absence from the proceedings, the court had formalised their status as proclaimed offenders at a previous hearing. Meanwhile, the court had acquitted several others accused in the case, including PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Zartaj Gul, in the two cases on the basis of insufficient evidence to establish their involvement in the allegations levelled by the police. According to the prosecution, the two cases were registered in connection with alleged violations of law and order during the ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi March ’, with police claiming that the accused had incited people to commit unlawful activities and obstructed officials from performing their duties. The defence, however, had consistently maintained that the cases were politically motivated.",

Since the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out on Oct 7, 2023, Pakistan has sent numerous aid items intended for the Gaza Strip, which was besieged at least until a ceasefire was secured in October 2025. According to NDMA, the consignment comprised 100 tonnes of tents and was sent with the support of Alkhidmat Foundation. This was the 28th relief consignment sent by Pakistan, bringing the total volume of humanitarian assistance sent to 2,727 tonnes. The relief goods were dispatched through a special flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore to Egypt’s El Arish International Airport “for onward delivery to Gaza”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. Punjab housing minister Bilal Yasin was a special guest at the dispatch, which was attended by officials of the NDMA and the foreign ministry, NDMA stated. Pakistan had first sent aid , including medicines and tents, for the people of Gaza on Oct 19, 2023 — days after the Israeli bombardment began. The activists who were behind the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which was intercepted at sea by Israel in September 2025, said last week they will try again this year. The organisers said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt, carrying up to 1,000 medics. Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents. On Sept 27, 2025, Israeli drones hit the GSF — a collection of boats carrying humanitarian aid with rights activists, doctors, parliamentarians, journalists and others — as they entered the final stretch of their journey to Gaza. The aid boats were carrying delegations from over 40 countries, including Pakistan , which aimed to distribute vital humanitarian aid such as baby formula, food, water and medicine to the malnourished, forcibly displaced and injured civilians suffering from almost two years of genocide , as classified by the United Nations. Israel’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced most of its population and left much of the strip in ruins. Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.",

      "summary_orig": "• PM aide’s contention that ‘innocents may get caught up’ in the wake of action following terror attacks prompts heckling, walkout • Dr Malik, Akhtar Mengal stress need for political, not military-based solutions LAHORE: At a charged discussion about the situation in Balochistan, PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah ignited controversy when he implied that innocent civilians were bound to get caught up in the fallout of attacks such as the ones witnessed across the province on Jan 31. The PM’s aide was speaking during a session, titled ‘Is There a Political Will to Solve the Crisis in Balochistan’, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The minister was part of a distinguished panel, which also incl­uded BNP-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, and was moderated by Mujahid Barelvi. PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The controversy reared its head when Mr Sanaullah was responding to points raised by the other speaker regarding the treatment meted out to the people from Balochistan. Referring to demands such as the abolition of checkpoints from across the province, he said that this could not happen unless terrorism and violence were rooted out. “If incidents like Jan 31 happen, then security forces will take act­ion, and there is a possibility that some of the people taken into custody could be innocent,” he said. This prompted a reaction from the audience, and some — like rights activist Sheema Kermani — got up from her seat and began to heckle the minister. He responded by chiding the hecklers, saying that their refusal to listen to him had ‘exposed them’. Ms Kermani then walked out of the venue, with many people following suit. Speaking to Dawn outside the hall, she said: “Asma Jahangir must be turning in her grave”. “Asma’s name is a symbol for people’s rights, for resistance, defiance and justice. If in this conference, you give a platform to such people who justify state violence, then we will not sit and hear it… If [Asma] had been here, she herself would have walked out and wouldn’t have let such persons speak.” ‘Political people’ Earlier, in his remarks, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch termed insurgency and enforced disappearances as the two major issues facing the province, which did not seem to have a solution. “Whenever I go to my area, four or five people come [up to me] daily, complaining about a missing person.” The state and political leadership should find a solution to these issues, he demanded. “If you deal with Balochistan as a security issue, then conditions would get worse by the day. If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested. “For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted. He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’. Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances. He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award. ‘Military solution to a political issue’ At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions. Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan. However, he regretted that this and subsequent pacts were not implemented. He also referred to past periods of conflict, including operations under different governments, the killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti and the issue of enforced disappearances, which he said had deeply affected many families, including his own. He also criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined, while expressing concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties. He also referred to jailed human rights lawyers and activists, Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying that they had been jailed for 17 years over a mere tweet, while those who had harmed the country and looted had not spent a single day behind bars, or were accorded A or B class prison facilities. Sanaullah’s response Responding to these grievances, Mr Sanaullah said nothing could be done about the past, as it could not be changed. “Right now Balochistan had two crises, one is being represented by Akhtar Mengal and Dr Malik, and the other side being Bashir Zaib and his accomplices,” he said, referring to one of the leaders of the banned BLA. “In my view, both these crises have different solutions and different demands. We are making a mistake by taking them as one.” He also maintained that enforced disappearances and violence in Balochistan started simultaneously, calling it a ‘chicken and egg story’, adding that they would also end together, just as they had started.

      "summary_orig": "Injury-hit Australia limp into the T20 World Cup without leading fast bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, but Nathan Ellis says the team’s depleted attack can still carry the nation to glory. Cummins pulled out with a back injury and Hazlewood lost a race to be fit after sustaining Achilles and hamstring injuries . With Mitchell Starc having quit the format, Australia will be without all three of their top quicks for the first World Cup in over a decade. Ellis, the default leader of a pace attack featuring Xavier Bartlett and Ben Dwarshuis, said the new trio would be able to cover for the loss of their more experienced teammates. “We’ve had 18-24 months of cricket together where the big three haven’t been playing and have had big workloads in the test arena,” he told reporters on Monday. “I actually think we work together really, really well. “We’ve all got different skill-sets and can gel together on the night in different phases of the game. “A squad without ‘Hoff’ (Hazlewood) and Cummo (Cummins) is a strong squad obviously, but without them I feel like we’re just as well placed to go deep.” Ellis will go into Australia’s opener against Ireland in Colombo on Wednesday without any recent match practice, having suffered a hamstring strain bowling for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League. In his absence, Australia were whitewashed 3-0 in a warm-up series against Pakistan. Ellis has been used more as a specialist death bowler than a powerplay enforcer, but conceded his role might need to change in the absence of Hazlewood. “Obviously, you have to take each game, conditions as they come. But losing one of the better white ball bowlers in the world in Hoff, things are always going to have to change,” he said. “My role will try to be adaptable as much as I can.”",

      "title_orig": "Hong Kong sentences pro-democracy mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in jail",
      "summary_orig": "A Hong Kong court sentenced pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison on Monday for national security crimes, a punishment rights groups condemned as “effectively a death sentence” and a symbol of the city’s shrivelling press freedoms. The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper was found guilty in December on two counts of foreign collusion under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing, as well as one count of seditious publication. His sentence is by far the harshest handed out under the national security law, surpassing the previous record of 10 years given to legal scholar Benny Tai in 2024. A summary document from the judges said they had settled on 20 years’ imprisonment “after considering the serious and grave criminal conduct of Lai”. Two of those years will overlap with Lai’s existing prison term, meaning that he will serve an additional 18 years, the judges wrote. Lai, who has been behind bars since 2020, sat impassively in the dock as his sentence was read out, an AFP journalist in the court saw. As he was led away, he waved solemnly to people in the public gallery, including his wife Teresa, former Hong Kong bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen, and former Apple Daily reporters. His defence lawyer Robert Pang, declined to comment on whether Lai would lodge an appeal, which can be done in the next 28 days. Asked if the sentence was in line with expectations, Pang told AFP : “In these times I don’t know what to expect.” Teresa Lai was grim-faced during the hearing and made no comment as she left the court, but the family condemned the sentence in a statement. “Sentencing my father to this draconian prison sentence is devastating for our family and life-threatening for my father,” Lai’s son Sebastien said. His daughter Claire called it “a heartbreakingly cruel sentence” given his declining health in prison, and if carried out, “he will die a martyr behind bars”. ‘Effectively a death sentence’ Rights groups also said Lai’s punishment amounted to a grave injustice. “The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence. A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. Amnesty International called the case “another grim milestone in Hong Kong’s transformation from a city governed by the rule of law to one ruled by fear”. Jodie Ginsberg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said “today’s egregious decision is the final nail in the coffin for freedom of the press in Hong Kong”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously said he had raised the issue of Lai, a British citizen, during his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing last month, while US President Donald Trump has also called for his release. Beijing has dismissed critics as smearing Hong Kong’s judicial system, while Hong Kong authorities say Lai’s case “has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press”. Staunch supporters Dozens of former Apple Daily employees and others braved the cold to queue overnight outside the West Kowloon court for a spot in court, while journalists gathered outside the building’s entrance. The mood was tense as police deployed dozens of officers, an armoured car and a bomb disposal van to the area. “I think this is equivalent to sentencing Lai to life imprisonment,” Lam Ying-kit, a former history teacher in his 50s, told AFP . Lai’s supporters, children, lawyers and rights groups have all raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison. Lai was kept in solitary confinement at his own request to avoid harassment, according to prosecutors, while authorities maintain he receives “adequate” care. Long a thorn in Beijing’s side, Lai was prosecuted under the national security law imposed by China on Hong Kong in 2020, following huge pro-democracy protests in the finance hub. Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 following police raids. Eight other defendants, including six Apple Daily executives, are due to be sentenced alongside Lai on Monday, all of whom pleaded guilty. As of the start of the month, Hong Kong had arrested a total of 386 people for various national security crimes, with 176 of them being convicted.",

      "title_orig": "New Zealand’s Christchurch mosque killer appeals conviction",
      "summary_orig": "A white supremacist who shot and killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in 2019 launched an appeal Monday seeking to overturn his conviction. Brenton Tarrant, an Australian former gym instructor, admitted carrying out New Zealand’s deadliest modern-day mass shooting before being sentenced to life in jail in August 2020. Now, the convicted killer argues that his “torturous and inhumane” detention conditions during his trial made him incapable of making rational decisions when he pleaded guilty, according to a court synopsis of the case. Tarrant is being held in a specialist unit for prisoners of extreme risk at Auckland Prison, seldom interacting with inmates or other people. “I did not have the mind frame or mental health required to be making informed decisions at that time,” Tarrant told the court, according to the New Zealand Herald. Tarrant said his state of mind was such that he had considered trying to implicate President Donald Trump in the crime. Life without parole “What I said at the time is ‘perhaps I could go out and say there was a second shooter on the roof, perhaps I could say it was Donald J Trump’,” he said, according to national broadcaster RNZ. If the Court of Appeal in Wellington upholds Tarrant’s conviction, it would hold a separate hearing later in the year to consider an appeal against his sentence. His penalty of life imprisonment without parole was the stiffest in New Zealand history. Armed with an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons, Tarrant attacked worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019. He published an online manifesto before the attacks and then livestreamed the killings for 17 minutes.

      "summary_en": "A white supremacist who shot and killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in 2019 launched an appeal Monday seeking to overturn his conviction. Brenton Tarrant, an Australian former gym instructor, admitted carrying out New Zealand’s deadliest modern-day mass shooting before being sentenced to life in jail in August 2020. Now, the convicted killer argues that his “torturous and inhumane” detention conditions during his trial made him incapable of making rational decisions when he pleaded guilty, according to a court synopsis of the case. Tarrant is being held in a specialist unit for prisoners of extreme risk at Auckland Prison, seldom interacting with inmates or other people. “I did not have the mind frame or mental health required to be making informed decisions at that time,” Tarrant told the court, according to the New Zealand Herald. Tarrant said his state of mind was such that he had considered trying to implicate President Donald Trump in the crime. Life without parole “What I said at the time is ‘perhaps I could go out and say there was a second shooter on the roof, perhaps I could say it was Donald J Trump’,” he said, according to national broadcaster RNZ. If the Court of Appeal in Wellington upholds Tarrant’s conviction, it would hold a separate hearing later in the year to consider an appeal against his sentence. His penalty of life imprisonment without parole was the stiffest in New Zealand history. Armed with an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons, Tarrant attacked worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019. He published an online manifesto before the attacks and then livestreamed the killings for 17 minutes. His victims were all Muslim and included children, women and the elderly. ‘Not prepared’ There are heavy restrictions on who can be in court during Monday’s appeal hearing, with only counsel, media and court officials allowed.

      "summary_orig": "• Opposition claims Modi surrendered to Trump over Epstein files • Growers fears the disastrous impact of the agreement; nationwide protests set for Feb 12 NEW DELHI: Indian farmers on Monday slammed a new US trade deal as “a surrender to multinational agricultural giants”, calling for the commerce minister’s resignation as Congress accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of capitulating to US President Donald Trump over the “Epstein files ” release. Congress leaders claimed an Indian minister, a businessman and individuals close to the prime minister were mentioned in the files, along with Modi. According to a report in The Hindu , the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) demanded Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s immediate resignation as soon as he explained the details of the bilateral pact. Leaders of the union representing apple and cotton growers said any relaxation on the import of cotton would be disastrous for the economies of Jammu and Kashmir, Him­­­­achal Pradesh, Mah­ar­ashtra and Gujarat. Talking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday, SKM leaders called the framework for the interim agreement on bilateral trade a “total surrender” to America’s agriculture sector. They cited the inclusion of dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits in the joint statement. The leaders warned that the animal feed market would be completely monopolised by US companies. SKM leaders urged farmers across the country to join protest demonstrations on Feb 12 and to support a general strike of workers as a “befitting reply to the anti-people Modi government”. The leaders said Goyal’s claim that the agriculture and dairy sectors were excluded from the agreement was incorrect. “Dairy products are part of the FTAs signed with the UK, New Zealand and European Union and the fresh revelations have undoubtedly proved the Commerce Minister is consciously propagating falsehood and betraying the farmers and the entire people,” the SKM statement said. “SKM considers the role of Commerce Minister as a traitor and demands his immediate resignation.” The organisation demanded that Prime Minister Modi desist from signing the India-US Free Trade Agreement or face “massive pan-India united mass struggles”. Farmers’ leaders highlighted tariff disparities, noting that US tariffs on Indian goods rose from zero in 2023-24 to 18pc, while Indian tariff rates on US agriculture products dropped from between 30pc and 150pc to zero. They said this would make Indian agriculture hang by the noose of US MNCs. The SKM also questioned Goyal’s position that the animal husbandry sector had requested imported feed. The group said poultry groups were the ones demanding feed based on maize and soybean to reduce minimum support prices for domestic crops. “We have heard that the animal feed in US may contain non-vegetarian items too. Why does the government want our cows to eat non-vegetarian food?” asked Rakesh Tikait, a prominent SKM leader. The statement also targeted the ruling party’s ideological parent organisation. “The RSS had been claiming no import of milk of animals fed with meat. That was a non-tariff barrier,” the statement said. “Now, the RSS has been made to eat its own claim by ‘Master’ Donald Trump and they have cowed down completely.” M.Y. Tarigami, leader of the Apple Farmers Federation of India and a Jammu and Kashmir lawmaker, said the trade deal would devastate regional economies. “We have been facing problems in apple cultivation due to lack of marketing facilities and climatic challenges,” Tarigami said. “Farmers in both the states are already in distress. This announcement will be a huge setback for apple and tree nut growers.” “In a state like Jammu and Kashmir, where there are no other economic avenues such as industry, the only source of income was cultivation of apples and dry fruits,” Tarigami added. “The Union government does not care about farmers here and is working for their masters in the United States.” Protesting against the government’s lack of transparency regarding the deal, the Congress party on Friday displayed a poster reading “Trap Deal” at the main entrance of the Parliament complex. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that President Trump pressured Modi into signing the deal because of the Epstein files. “The truth is that over the past few days, Narendra Modi has been troubled because matters related to him have come up in the Epstein files. After that, Narendra Modi surrendered before Trump and struck a trade deal,” Kharge said. “He sacrificed the country’s farmers. Modi is making our people poor and making America’s farmers rich.” Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to boycott the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15. The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion. After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that. Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told Dawn that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan. They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.” The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source. They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.” The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.” Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings. Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport. Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said. The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter. Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting. Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials. The high-level visits come a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced. The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland. Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the ICC rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka. After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo. In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”. It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of. “The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated. A government source told Dawn at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh. “The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added. Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue. It was reported earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses. Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown . Pakistan, who edged out the Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate. Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.",

We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition… You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration, when integration becomes the source of your subordination.” — Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada, at Davos 2026 “After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it, but we gave it back. But how ungrateful are they now? And then after the war, which we won, we won it big — without us, right now, you’d all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps.” — Donald Trump, US President, at Davos 2026 “If anyone thinks that the European Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US, keep on dreaming. You can’t. We can’t.” — Mark Rutte, Secretary-General Nato, speaking at EU Parliament Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney went to the World Economic Forum at Davos and told the world that his country — by extrapolation, all US allies — had lived a “pleasant fiction” that is now over. That fiction was grounded in the assumption that the United States would continue to lead a global order and that such order would perpetually guarantee stability, provide limitless liquidity, and manage all systemic risks. Under this global order, American hegemony would continue to “provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes.”  This does not obtain anymore. For decades, America’s Western allies lived comfortably with a system in which the US was the \n  accepted hegemon and which benefitted them as its satraps. That system is now unravelling \n  because of the brazenness and boorishness of US President Donald Trump and because the \n  allies are now being treated like others were always treated in the Global South. For the first time, Canada and Europe are being forced to confront the fact that power creates its own dynamics… This is where the irony lies. For Carney, as also other US allies, US hegemony worked and made them prosper as long as its application of force targeted states and societies in what we loosely describe as the Global South: Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, to name just the most obvious regions. These are also the regions where a number of states or leaders within those states decided to remove the signboard, to not live the lie that Canada was so content to live with until recently and acquiesced in. Those leaders were picked off — the list is long from Mohamed Mosaddegh to Patrice Lumumba to Ngo Din Diem to Salvador Allende to hundreds of failed attempts on Fidel Castro — those states suffered and most, like Iran, continue to suffer. The system’s power did not come from its truth, but from Canada’s willingness, as also of other US allies, to perform as if it were true. Now, “its fragility comes from the same source”, as identified by Carney. I argue that the challenge faced by the US allies is not that the United States has suddenly become more of a hegemon. The entire post-WWII system was grounded in unequal power distribution and accepted hegemony of the US by its allies. The fiction Carney spoke about was (and remains) an elaborate mise en scène, put together not just by the US but also its allies. In fact, as we shall discuss later, the centrality of a dominant power is the core tenet of an integrated alliance system that must also have a unifying perception of threat and shared values. Carney’s assertion that “when we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness”, and his invocation of Thucydides’ Melian Dialogue are, therefore, about the direction of the exercise of US hegemony, not hegemony itself. What is true, however, is the fact and Carney’s realisation of it, that a hegemon’s intent can change. That is what has happened. To that end, I propose to briefly look at how the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) came about and what exactly is the Greenland issue about. Finally, I argue that, while this moment may not be a Wagnerian frenzy, it could lead to that in the years to come, quite possibly unravelling Europe, which is not a single, seamless entity but a conglomeration of multiple states and ethnolinguistic groupings. EUROPE, AMERICA AND NATO: FROM RELUCTANCE TO PRIMACY What follows is based on a number of works, including those by US international affairs academic Lawrence Kaplan, Canadian diplomat Escott Reid and US historian Melvyn Leffler and several declassified documents from the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) volumes. Today, Nato is taken for granted. But the idea and its actualisation did not evolve as a premeditated American design. It emerged from European insecurity, economic and military, and involved a drawn-out and complex diplomatic process. The US was still grappling with its new global role and was reluctant to get involved in Europe’s affairs again. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and National Policy Volume II 1947-1949 by military historian Kenneth Condit makes clear that post-war demobilisation had left the US military (all branches) starved of manpower and materiel. A good example of such pressures was the crisis in Greece (Civil War 1946-49) and the decision by Britain to withdraw its troops from there in 1947. The US wanted the British to keep the troops in Greece, even as the JCS’s own study had concluded that “the United States was not capable of deploying sufficient armed forces to Greece to defeat a combined attack by Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria. Any US force sent should therefore be small. It should be solely for the purposes of stiffening morale of the Greeks and of contributing to stability in areas where it was stationed.” The details are too many and complicated. The essential point, however, is that the period from December 1947 to March 1948 marked the critical point where the idea of a transatlantic military pact moved from a British proposal to an accepted, if still vague, American objective. On December 17, 1947, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin made a case to the US Secretary of State George Marshall for a “Western Union.” Bevin’s concept, which he described as a “spiritual federation of the West”, encompassed Western European nations, the British dominions and, crucially, the United States. This entity would be “an understanding backed by power, money and resolute action”, with its essential task being to create a “feeling of security” and the confidence that “further communist inroads [into Eastern Europe] would be stopped.” The US presence in the Union would provide Europe the confidence to resist the Soviet political threat. While agreeing with the general idea and its importance, Marshall struck a cautious tone. He believed the union should be purely European, with the US providing only material assistance. He refused to approve any specific course of action or make public promises. This was in line with the Truman administration’s reluctance to undertake formal military commitments despite the March 1947 Truman Doctrine, which pledged American political, military and economic aid to democratic nations under threat from authoritarian (specifically communist) forces. Protesters take part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark on January 17, 2026: Greenlanders have already rebuffed Trump’s desire to take control of the island | Reuters Bevin elaborated his proposal in a formal paper in January 1948. He argued for a union, formal or informal, that included Scandinavia, the Low Countries, France, Italy, Greece, Portugal and, eventually, Spain and Germany. As a first step, he proposed expanding the 1947 Dunkirk Treaty — a bilateral Anglo-French pact solely against future German aggression — into a treaty with the Benelux countries. This “solid core” could then expand into the full Western Union. Bevin’s proposals at this stage were far ahead of American thinking. Marshall or his aides had not seriously considered a military alliance with the Europeans, despite the emerging Soviet threat. The British initiative did spark a debate within the US State Department. Two distinct camps emerged. One comprised the sceptics, led by Marshall, Under Secretary Robert Lovett and George Kennan, head of the Policy Planning Staff and the writer of the famous ‘Long Telegram’ and the ‘X Article’, which analysed Soviet ideology and advocated containment. Kennan welcomed the idea of a European union under Franco-British leadership, believing it could restore the balance of power. However, he opposed direct US military commitment, arguing that a military pact should flow from political and economic union, not precede it. He also warned that using the anti-German Dunkirk Treaty as a model was “a poor way” to prepare for Germany’s eventual inclusion. Like Marshall, Kennan insisted the initiative and hard work must come from Europe itself. When that happened, the US could then offer support. The other camp had advocates of an Atlantic pact, primarily John D. Hickerson, director of the Office of European Affairs, and his deputy Theodore Achilles. Hickerson agreed the Dunkirk model was flawed but argued that a European union backed only by US aid would be insufficient. He believed only a direct American moral commitment — a promise to fight if necessary — could generate the “confidence and energy” needed to restore a stable, solvent Europe. He proposed modelling a new pact on the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (the Rio Treaty), which would be linked to the UN Charter. This “Atlantic security system” would explicitly include the US and Canada alongside the Western European states. Initially, the sceptics held sway. On January 20, 1948, Marshall informed the British ambassador that the US welcomed Bevin’s initiative and would assist it “to the fullest” but would not be a part of it. This marginalised Hickerson and Achilles. Marshall’s position was rooted in several powerful strands of opposition within the US government, the Congress and the military. From a strategic perspective, Kennan et al viewed the Soviet threat in early 1948 as primarily politico-economic, not military. The preferred instrument to counter the Soviets was the European Recovery Program (ERP, or Marshall Plan). They feared that a sudden push for a military alliance could jeopardise Congressional approval of this vital economic aid package. They were also hedging politically and anticipated resistance from three quarters: traditional isolationists who opposed entangling alliances because they drained US resources; internationalists who saw such a pact as undermining the United Nations; and the military establishment, which did not have the capacity for unsustainable commitments and wanted to withdraw troops from an indefensible Western Europe. Secretary of Defence James Forrestal warned of the danger of letting military commitments outpace capabilities. Faced with American reluctance, Bevin and French foreign minister Georges Bidault decided Europe must take the first step, hoping to ‘lure’ the US in later. On March 17, 1948, Britain, France and the Benelux countries signed the Brussels Treaty, establishing the Western Union. This coincided with a shift in American opinion, catalysed by an escalation of Cold War tensions in February and March 1948. The Soviet-backed communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February, combined with Soviet pressure on Finland and Norway and intensified communist agitation in Italy and France, ignited a palpable ‘war-scare’ in Washington. This climate of crisis helped remove key barriers to American action. While US leaders still did not believe that war was imminent, they now concluded that economic aid alone was insufficient to provide the psychological stability needed for recovery. Only a US security guarantee could create the necessary confidence to resist Soviet political subversion. On March 11, Bevin formally invited the US to discuss a North Atlantic treaty. The following day, Marshall agreed to proceed with joint talks on an “Atlantic security system.” In a speech to Congress on March 17, the very day the Brussels Treaty was signed, President Truman endorsed the pact and pledged that the US would “extend to the free nations the support that the situation requires.” By late March 1948, the fundamental US position on a transatlantic security pact had reversed. The objective was now to design a form of military commitment to Europe. The consensus purpose was not to prepare for a likely Soviet invasion, but to “strengthen the determination of the free nations to resist… Soviet-directed world Communism” and “increase their confidence.” The commitment would serve as a psychological and political stabiliser to ensure the success of the Marshall Plan. The remaining debates were to be worked out in the subsequent Pentagon Talks. The path to Nato had opened up, forged by European fear, British diplomacy, and an American realisation that economic power required a security complement to be effective in the upcoming Cold War. But there was something else too. If this were to work, the alliance needed a dominant state. That state was to be the US. The path was also cleared from reluctance to configuring Nato with the US at the apex. Despite belonging to different theoretical schools, John Mearsheimer, John Ikenberry and Melvyn Leffler converge on this point: US hegemony in Nato was not an accidental outcome but a logical result of the alliance’s foundational conditions and strategic purpose. Once committed, the US used its unmatched power to shape Nato’s institutions in ways that locked in its leadership, ensuring the alliance would remain an extension of American grand strategy, while providing Europe with indispensable security. This ‘bargain’ — European subordination to and participation in the American-led financial and security architecture for American protection — was the stable, if unequal, core of the transatlantic relationship for decades. The post-Cold War evolution — with Nato expanding eastward under continued US impetus, and recent developments about Nato’s future and the US role — further demonstrate the nature and extent of this configured hegemony. This structural imperative (predominance of US power — economic, industrial, human resource, military, technological) was wedded to Nato’s strategic logic and influenced Nato’s institutional design both politically and operationally. The Europeans, since the end of the Cold War — the so-called peace dividend — have become niche auxiliaries. Budgets were slashed, conscription abolished, personnel reduced. It has been the same story regarding capabilities and inventories. This is precisely what Trump began talking about in his first term. While the Russo-Ukraine War and slacking US commitment to Europe have forced a rethink, it will take at least a decade-and-half’s sustained effort for Europe to develop the strategic capabilities for which they entirely rely on the US. This is the reason Mark Rutte bluntly told the EU parliamentarians that Europe can’t defend itself without the US. We shall return to this issue of US hegemony but let’s first get to Greenland. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivering his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 20, 2026: for Carney, as also other US allies, US hegemony worked and made them prosper as long as its application of force targeted states and societies in the Global South | AFP GREENLAND, JUST TRUMP’S OBSESSION? Short answer, no. Let’s go for the longish answer. The US has a history with Greenland. In recent years, melting Arctic glaciers and warming waters, as also Russia and China’s interest in the Arctic waterways, have revived the conversation among US policymakers. But it’s also the geography. As Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told the BBC, “If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland. That’s why the Pituffik [pronounced bee-doo-feek] Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.” When Nazi forces occupied Denmark during World War II, the US invaded Greenland and established military and listening posts on the island. The Danish Ambassador to the US during World War II was Henrik Kauffmann, a pivotal figure who, after Germany occupied Denmark in 1940, acted independently as the representative of “Free Denmark” and signed crucial defence agreements for Greenland with the US. On April 9, 1941, he signed an agreement with the US allowing American military bases in Greenland, a critical move to prevent German seizure of the island. After the war, the US expanded the Pittufik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base. A 1951 defence agreement with Denmark also granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases. But before the 1951 agreement, in 1946, the US expressed the desire to purchase Greenland from Denmark for a sum of $100 million in gold bars. US officials at the time described the interest in Greenland as a “military necessity”, precisely the language used by Trump when he suddenly mentioned Greenland. The 1946 offer remained classified until documents were declassified in 1991. But it wasn’t the first time the US had shown interest in Greenland, though. US Secretary of State William Seward raised the idea of annexing it along with Iceland in 1867. Seward had earlier purchased Alaska from Russia in March of the same year. Trump himself talked about buying Greenland in 2019. A Wall Street Journal report at the time revealed the plan. All these offers have been rebuffed by Denmark. In January this year, Trump stated that “the fact that they [Danes] had a boat land there 500 years ago [sic] doesn’t mean that they own the land.” So what’s the legal status of Greenland? The 1933 Eastern Greenland Case before the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) centred on a sovereignty dispute between Denmark and Norway. In 1931, Norway occupied and claimed a portion of Eastern Greenland, arguing it was terra nullius [unowned land] outside Danish control. Denmark countered that its sovereignty historically extended over all of Greenland, supported by continuous and peaceful displays of authority, such as a trade monopoly and granting of concessions. A key diplomatic point was the 1919 Ihlen Declaration, where Norway’s foreign minister had informally assured Denmark that Norway would not challenge Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The PCIJ ruled 12-2 in favour of Denmark by arguing that Denmark had demonstrated sufficient intention and exercise of sovereignty to claim title over all of Greenland. The Court also held that Norway was bound by the Ihlen Declaration and thus obligated not to contest Danish sovereignty or occupy any part of Greenland. The case remains a significant precedent in international law, particularly regarding territorial acquisition, the binding nature of unilateral declarations by state officials, and the requirements for effective occupation even in sparsely populated areas (contrast this with Occupied Palestine). That said, the ruling was a product of a colonial era. Today, the right to self-determination of Indigenous peoples, such as the Inuit of Greenland, would be a central consideration, fundamentally altering the legal context for such disputes. In essence, this means, legally speaking, that any decision about Greenland must come from the Greenlanders and no one else. They have already rebuffed Trump’s desire to take control of the island. But the issue for our purpose is different. Just to recap, my argument is that US hegemony was built into the post-WWII alliance system. So what was the fiction? THE PREDICTABLE FICTION US allies, including Canada, were perfectly fine with the yarn woven by a benign hegemon. As Carney himself noted, it was a predictable system, despite being fictitious. But no one cared because it allowed Canada and Europe to play along, act bigger than they were and are, get prosperous and be protected. For the US too, it was a win-win. Nato is a force multiplier for the US military power and it also provides legitimacy to American power projection. As noted above, the Europeans bring niche capabilities and diplomatic support. Freedom from bearing the full cost of defence, they could focus on economic growth and industrialisation and punched above their weight because of the US backing. In that, they were and are also willing partners in bullying states the US wants to sanction and beat up. Like the child in Ursula Le Guin’s story, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, the town’s (read US allies’) happiness requires the child’s misery. In the real world, that child can be found in many parts of the world: occupied Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Venezuela… the list is long. To be precise, Carney et al don’t want to walk away from Omelas. They aren’t particularly concerned about the misery of the child in the basement of a building. Or to use Carney’s invocation of Vaclav Havel’s green grocer, they don’t want to remove the sign. In the Q&A at Davos after his speech, Carney was far more circumspect, especially when asked about Greenland and Nato. Their concern is how ‘Daddy’ is behaving, mocking them for what the allies really are: subordinates — children who hold cushy jobs in the global US enterprise but must behave if they are to retain their houses and cars and yachts and place on the board. Those, like Iran, who never signed up to the signboard, belong to a different story — the real, sordid one, not the pleasant fiction. None of the US allies is prepared to speak the truth on Iran — at least not for some time to come. But something else has also happened. And that has the allies running helter-skelter. In this fiction there was (and is) one big reality: US preponderance. What if the sudden malignancy of hegemony becomes a practice? While the fiction lasted, no one thought about it. The fact that allies were satraps was only occasionally put on overt display: Suez (Britain/France); Nixon Shock (devastating currency reserves of allies, especially Japan); Kissinger’s 1973 exhortation to allies that they subordinate their regional interests to US global leadership; 1973 oil shock; extraterritorial bullying through the Helms-Burton Act 1996; Old Europe/New Europe statements during the illegal invasion of Iraq. With Trump, it’s more brazen and boorish. If the US is the dominant power and if allies expect it to protect them, why can’t it make some demands? Oh, there’s a bit of a problem. It’s called a rules-based order. Really, thinks Trump. Didn’t I just abduct a head of state? What are these Europeans talking about. They were fine with it. Wait, the rules-based part of the fiction had some reality within the camp. You didn’t pee inside the tent. Now the camp is being treated the same way as others. That sucks. Even if Trump were to be an aberration 2.0, the historical rule has been established. Power creates its own dynamics. That’s the rupture Carney has pointed to. The question is, can Canada, in collaboration with Europe, develop an alternative power pole? Contiguity works against Canada; distance works against Europe. Trump is not the only thing happening to Europe. There are other strands and pressures within Europe that will likely determine Europe’s future and whether and for how long one could use a collective noun for Europe. In October 2022, during the inauguration of the European Diplomatic Academy in Bruges, Josep Borrell, EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy stated: “Europe is a garden. Most of the rest of the world is a jungle and the jungle could invade the garden.” It’s kind of ironic! The serpent is already in the garden and going by the Book of Genesis, he is an irrevocable part of the story of Man. The writer is a journalist interested in security and foreign policies.

The consensus purpose was not to prepare for a likely Soviet invasion, but to “strengthen the determination of the free nations to resist… Soviet-directed world Communism” and “increase their confidence.” The commitment would serve as a psychological and political stabiliser to ensure the success of the Marshall Plan. The remaining debates were to be worked out in the subsequent Pentagon Talks. The path to Nato had opened up, forged by European fear, British diplomacy, and an American realisation that economic power required a security complement to be effective in the upcoming Cold War. But there was something else too. If this were to work, the alliance needed a dominant state. That state was to be the US. The path was also cleared from reluctance to configuring Nato with the US at the apex. Despite belonging to different theoretical schools, John Mearsheimer, John Ikenberry and Melvyn Leffler converge on this point: US hegemony in Nato was not an accidental outcome but a logical result of the alliance’s foundational conditions and strategic purpose. Once committed, the US used its unmatched power to shape Nato’s institutions in ways that locked in its leadership, ensuring the alliance would remain an extension of American grand strategy, while providing Europe with indispensable security. This ‘bargain’ — European subordination to and participation in the American-led financial and security architecture for American protection — was the stable, if unequal, core of the transatlantic relationship for decades. The post-Cold War evolution — with Nato expanding eastward under continued US impetus, and recent developments about Nato’s future and the US role — further demonstrate the nature and extent of this configured hegemony. This structural imperative (predominance of US power — economic, industrial, human resource, military, technological) was wedded to Nato’s strategic logic and influenced Nato’s institutional design both politically and operationally. The Europeans, since the end of the Cold War — the so-called peace dividend — have become niche auxiliaries. Budgets were slashed, conscription abolished, personnel reduced. It has been the same story regarding capabilities and inventories. This is precisely what Trump began talking about in his first term. While the Russo-Ukraine War and slacking US commitment to Europe have forced a rethink, it will take at least a decade-and-half’s sustained effort for Europe to develop the strategic capabilities for which they entirely rely on the US. This is the reason Mark Rutte bluntly told the EU parliamentarians that Europe can’t defend itself without the US. We shall return to this issue of US hegemony but let’s first get to Greenland. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivering his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 20, 2026: for Carney, as also other US allies, US hegemony worked and made them prosper as long as its application of force targeted states and societies in the Global South | AFP GREENLAND, JUST TRUMP’S OBSESSION? Short answer, no. Let’s go for the longish answer. The US has a history with Greenland. In recent years, melting Arctic glaciers and warming waters, as also Russia and China’s interest in the Arctic waterways, have revived the conversation among US policymakers. But it’s also the geography. As Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told the BBC, “If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland. That’s why the Pituffik [pronounced bee-doo-feek] Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.” When Nazi forces occupied Denmark during World War II, the US invaded Greenland and established military and listening posts on the island. The Danish Ambassador to the US during World War II was Henrik Kauffmann, a pivotal figure who, after Germany occupied Denmark in 1940, acted independently as the representative of “Free Denmark” and signed crucial defence agreements for Greenland with the US. On April 9, 1941, he signed an agreement with the US allowing American military bases in Greenland, a critical move to prevent German seizure of the island. After the war, the US expanded the Pittufik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base. A 1951 defence agreement with Denmark also granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases. But before the 1951 agreement, in 1946, the US expressed the desire to purchase Greenland from Denmark for a sum of $100 million in gold bars. US officials at the time described the interest in Greenland as a “military necessity”, precisely the language used by Trump when he suddenly mentioned Greenland. The 1946 offer remained classified until documents were declassified in 1991. But it wasn’t the first time the US had shown interest in Greenland, though. US Secretary of State William Seward raised the idea of annexing it along with Iceland in 1867. Seward had earlier purchased Alaska from Russia in March of the same year. Trump himself talked about buying Greenland in 2019. A Wall Street Journal report at the time revealed the plan. All these offers have been rebuffed by Denmark. In January this year, Trump stated that “the fact that they [Danes] had a boat land there 500 years ago [sic] doesn’t mean that they own the land.” So what’s the legal status of Greenland? The 1933 Eastern Greenland Case before the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) centred on a sovereignty dispute between Denmark and Norway. In 1931, Norway occupied and claimed a portion of Eastern Greenland, arguing it was terra nullius [unowned land] outside Danish control. Denmark countered that its sovereignty historically extended over all of Greenland, supported by continuous and peaceful displays of authority, such as a trade monopoly and granting of concessions. A key diplomatic point was the 1919 Ihlen Declaration, where Norway’s foreign minister had informally assured Denmark that Norway would not challenge Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The PCIJ ruled 12-2 in favour of Denmark by arguing that Denmark had demonstrated sufficient intention and exercise of sovereignty to claim title over all of Greenland. The Court also held that Norway was bound by the Ihlen Declaration and thus obligated not to contest Danish sovereignty or occupy any part of Greenland. The case remains a significant precedent in international law, particularly regarding territorial acquisition, the binding nature of unilateral declarations by state officials, and the requirements for effective occupation even in sparsely populated areas (contrast this with Occupied Palestine). That said, the ruling was a product of a colonial era. Today, the right to self-determination of Indigenous peoples, such as the Inuit of Greenland, would be a central consideration, fundamentally altering the legal context for such disputes. In essence, this means, legally speaking, that any decision about Greenland must come from the Greenlanders and no one else. They have already rebuffed Trump’s desire to take control of the island. But the issue for our purpose is different. Just to recap, my argument is that US hegemony was built into the post-WWII alliance system. So what was the fiction? THE PREDICTABLE FICTION US allies, including Canada, were perfectly fine with the yarn woven by a benign hegemon. As Carney himself noted, it was a predictable system, despite being fictitious. But no one cared because it allowed Canada and Europe to play along, act bigger than they were and are, get prosperous and be protected. For the US too, it was a win-win. Nato is a force multiplier for the US military power and it also provides legitimacy to American power projection. As noted above, the Europeans bring niche capabilities and diplomatic support. Freedom from bearing the full cost of defence, they could focus on economic growth and industrialisation and punched above their weight because of the US backing. In that, they were and are also willing partners in bullying states the US wants to sanction and beat up. Like the child in Ursula Le Guin’s story, The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, the town’s (read US allies’) happiness requires the child’s misery. In the real world, that child can be found in many parts of the world: occupied Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Iraq, Iran, Venezuela… the list is long. To be precise, Carney et al don’t want to walk away from Omelas. They aren’t particularly concerned about the misery of the child in the basement of a building. Or to use Carney’s invocation of Vaclav Havel’s green grocer, they don’t want to remove the sign. In the Q&A at Davos after his speech, Carney was far more circumspect, especially when asked about Greenland and Nato. Their concern is how ‘Daddy’ is behaving, mocking them for what the allies really are: subordinates — children who hold cushy jobs in the global US enterprise but must behave if they are to retain their houses and cars and yachts and place on the board. Those, like Iran, who never signed up to the signboard, belong to a different story — the real, sordid one, not the pleasant fiction. None of the US allies is prepared to speak the truth on Iran — at least not for some time to come. But something else has also happened. And that has the allies running helter-skelter. In this fiction there was (and is) one big reality: US preponderance. What if the sudden malignancy of hegemony becomes a practice? While the fiction lasted, no one thought about it. The fact that allies were satraps was only occasionally put on overt display: Suez (Britain/France); Nixon Shock (devastating currency reserves of allies, especially Japan); Kissinger’s 1973 exhortation to allies that they subordinate their regional interests to US global leadership; 1973 oil shock; extraterritorial bullying through the Helms-Burton Act 1996; Old Europe/New Europe statements during the illegal invasion of Iraq. With Trump, it’s more brazen and boorish. If the US is the dominant power and if allies expect it to protect them, why can’t it make some demands? Oh, there’s a bit of a problem. It’s called a rules-based order. Really, thinks Trump. Didn’t I just abduct a head of state? What are these Europeans talking about. They were fine with it. Wait, the rules-based part of the fiction had some reality within the camp. You didn’t pee inside the tent. Now the camp is being treated the same way as others. That sucks. Even if Trump were to be an aberration 2.0, the historical rule has been established. Power creates its own dynamics. That’s the rupture Carney has pointed to. The question is, can Canada, in collaboration with Europe, develop an alternative power pole? Contiguity works against Canada; distance works against Europe. Trump is not the only thing happening to Europe. There are other strands and pressures within Europe that will likely determine Europe’s future and whether and for how long one could use a collective noun for Europe. In October 2022, during the inauguration of the European Diplomatic Academy in Bruges, Josep Borrell, EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy stated: “Europe is a garden. Most of the rest of the world is a jungle and the jungle could invade the garden.” It’s kind of ironic! The serpent is already in the garden and going by the Book of Genesis, he is an irrevocable part of the story of Man. The writer is a journalist interested in security and foreign policies.

      "title": "THE RUPTURE IN THE WESTERN WORLD ORDER",
      "summary": "“This bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition… You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration, when integration becomes the source of your subordination.” — Mark Carney, Prime Minister of Canada, at Davos 2026 “After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it, but we gave it back. But how ungrateful are they now? And then after the war, which we won, we won it big — without us, right now, you’d all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps.” — Donald Trump, US President, at Davos 2026 “If anyone thinks that the European Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US, keep on dreaming. You can’t. We can’t.” — Mark Rutte, Secretary-General Nato, speaking at EU Parliament Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney went to the World Economic Forum at Davos and told the world that his country — by extrapolation, all US allies — had lived a “pleasant fiction” that is now over. That fiction was grounded in the assumption that the United States would continue to lead a global order and that such order would perpetually guarantee stability, provide limitless liquidity, and manage all systemic risks. Under this global order, American hegemony would continue to “provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes.”  This does not obtain anymore. For decades, America’s Western allies lived comfortably with a system in which the US was the \n  accepted hegemon and which benefitted them as its satraps. That system is now unravelling \n  because of the brazenness and boorishness of US President Donald Trump and because the \n  allies are now being treated like others were always treated in the Global South. For the first time, Canada and Europe are being forced to confront the fact that power creates its own dynamics… This is where the irony lies. For Carney, as also other US allies, US hegemony worked and made them prosper as long as its application of force targeted states and societies in what we loosely describe as the Global South: Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, to name just the most obvious regions. These are also the regions where a number of states or leaders within those states decided to remove the signboard, to not live the lie that Canada was so content to live with until recently and acquiesced in. Those leaders were picked off — the list is long from Mohamed Mosaddegh to Patrice Lumumba to Ngo Din Diem to Salvador Allende to hundreds of failed attempts on Fidel Castro — those states suffered and most, like Iran, continue to suffer. The system’s power did not come from its truth, but from Canada’s willingness, as also of other US allies, to perform as if it were true. Now, “its fragility comes from the same source”, as identified by Carney. I argue that the challenge faced by the US allies is not that the United States has suddenly become more of a hegemon. The entire post-WWII system was grounded in unequal power distribution and accepted hegemony of the US by its allies. The fiction Carney spoke about was (and remains) an elaborate mise en scène, put together not just by the US but also its allies. In fact, as we shall discuss later, the centrality of a dominant power is the core tenet of an integrated alliance system that must also have a unifying perception of threat and shared values. Carney’s assertion that “when we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness”, and his invocation of Thucydides’ Melian Dialogue are, therefore, about the direction of the exercise of US hegemony, not hegemony itself. What is true, however, is the fact and Carney’s realisation of it, that a hegemon’s intent can change. That is what has happened. To that end, I propose to briefly look at how the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) came about and what exactly is the Greenland issue about. Finally, I argue that, while this moment may not be a Wagnerian frenzy, it could lead to that in the years to come, quite possibly unravelling Europe, which is not a single, seamless entity but a conglomeration of multiple states and ethnolinguistic groupings. EUROPE, AMERICA AND NATO: FROM RELUCTANCE TO PRIMACY What follows is based on a number of works, including those by US international affairs academic Lawrence Kaplan, Canadian diplomat Escott Reid and US historian Melvyn Leffler and several declassified documents from the Foreign Relations of the United States (FRUS) volumes. Today, Nato is taken for granted. But the idea and its actualisation did not evolve as a premeditated American design. It emerged from European insecurity, economic and military, and involved a drawn-out and complex diplomatic process. The US was still grappling with its new global role and was reluctant to get involved in Europe’s affairs again. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and National Policy Volume II 1947-1949 by military historian Kenneth Condit makes clear that post-war demobilisation had left the US military (all branches) starved of manpower and materiel. A good example of such pressures was the crisis in Greece (Civil War 1946-49) and the decision by Britain to withdraw its troops from there in 1947. The US wanted the British to keep the troops in Greece, even as the JCS’s own study had concluded that “the United States was not capable of deploying sufficient armed forces to Greece to defeat a combined attack by Yugoslavia, Albania and Bulgaria. Any US force sent should therefore be small. It should be solely for the purposes of stiffening morale of the Greeks and of contributing to stability in areas where it was stationed.” The details are too many and complicated. The essential point, however, is that the period from December 1947 to March 1948 marked the critical point where the idea of a transatlantic military pact moved from a British proposal to an accepted, if still vague, American objective. On December 17, 1947, British foreign secretary Ernest Bevin made a case to the US Secretary of State George Marshall for a “Western Union.” Bevin’s concept, which he described as a “spiritual federation of the West”, encompassed Western European nations, the British dominions and, crucially, the United States. This entity would be “an understanding backed by power, money and resolute action”, with its essential task being to create a “feeling of security” and the confidence that “further communist inroads [into Eastern Europe] would be stopped.” The US presence in the Union would provide Europe the confidence to resist the Soviet political threat. While agreeing with the general idea and its importance, Marshall struck a cautious tone. He believed the union should be purely European, with the US providing only material assistance. He refused to approve any specific course of action or make public promises. This was in line with the Truman administration’s reluctance to undertake formal military commitments despite the March 1947 Truman Doctrine, which pledged American political, military and economic aid to democratic nations under threat from authoritarian (specifically communist) forces. Protesters take part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark on January 17, 2026: Greenlanders have already rebuffed Trump’s desire to take control of the island | Reuters Bevin elaborated his proposal in a formal paper in January 1948. He argued for a union, formal or informal, that included Scandinavia, the Low Countries, France, Italy, Greece, Portugal and, eventually, Spain and Germany. As a first step, he proposed expanding the 1947 Dunkirk Treaty — a bilateral Anglo-French pact solely against future German aggression — into a treaty with the Benelux countries. This “solid core” could then expand into the full Western Union. Bevin’s proposals at this stage were far ahead of American thinking. Marshall or his aides had not seriously considered a military alliance with the Europeans, despite the emerging Soviet threat. The British initiative did spark a debate within the US State Department. Two distinct camps emerged. One comprised the sceptics, led by Marshall, Under Secretary Robert Lovett and George Kennan, head of the Policy Planning Staff and the writer of the famous ‘Long Telegram’ and the ‘X Article’, which analysed Soviet ideology and advocated containment. Kennan welcomed the idea of a European union under Franco-British leadership, believing it could restore the balance of power. However, he opposed direct US military commitment, arguing that a military pact should flow from political and economic union, not precede it. He also warned that using the anti-German Dunkirk Treaty as a model was “a poor way” to prepare for Germany’s eventual inclusion. Like Marshall, Kennan insisted the initiative and hard work must come from Europe itself. When that happened, the US could then offer support. The other camp had advocates of an Atlantic pact, primarily John D. Hickerson, director of the Office of European Affairs, and his deputy Theodore Achilles. Hickerson agreed the Dunkirk model was flawed but argued that a European union backed only by US aid would be insufficient. He believed only a direct American moral commitment — a promise to fight if necessary — could generate the “confidence and energy” needed to restore a stable, solvent Europe. He proposed modelling a new pact on the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (the Rio Treaty), which would be linked to the UN Charter. This “Atlantic security system” would explicitly include the US and Canada alongside the Western European states. Initially, the sceptics held sway. On January 20, 1948, Marshall informed the British ambassador that the US welcomed Bevin’s initiative and would assist it “to the fullest” but would not be a part of it. This marginalised Hickerson and Achilles. Marshall’s position was rooted in several powerful strands of opposition within the US government, the Congress and the military. From a strategic perspective, Kennan et al viewed the Soviet threat in early 1948 as primarily politico-economic, not military. The preferred instrument to counter the Soviets was the European Recovery Program (ERP, or Marshall Plan). They feared that a sudden push for a military alliance could jeopardise Congressional approval of this vital economic aid package. They were also hedging politically and anticipated resistance from three quarters: traditional isolationists who opposed entangling alliances because they drained US resources; internationalists who saw such a pact as undermining the United Nations; and the military establishment, which did not have the capacity for unsustainable commitments and wanted to withdraw troops from an indefensible Western Europe. Secretary of Defence James Forrestal warned of the danger of letting military commitments outpace capabilities. Faced with American reluctance, Bevin and French foreign minister Georges Bidault decided Europe must take the first step, hoping to ‘lure’ the US in later. On March 17, 1948, Britain, France and the Benelux countries signed the Brussels Treaty, establishing the Western Union. This coincided with a shift in American opinion, catalysed by an escalation of Cold War tensions in February and March 1948. The Soviet-backed communist coup in Czechoslovakia in February, combined with Soviet pressure on Finland and Norway and intensified communist agitation in Italy and France, ignited a palpable ‘war-scare’ in Washington. This climate of crisis helped remove key barriers to American action. While US leaders still did not believe that war was imminent, they now concluded that economic aid alone was insufficient to provide the psychological stability needed for recovery. Only a US security guarantee could create the necessary confidence to resist Soviet political subversion. On March 11, Bevin formally invited the US to discuss a North Atlantic treaty. The following day, Marshall agreed to proceed with joint talks on an “Atlantic security system.” In a speech to Congress on March 17, the very day the Brussels Treaty was signed, President Truman endorsed the pact and pledged that the US would “extend to the free nations the support that the situation requires.” By late March 1948, the fundamental US position on a transatlantic security pact had reversed.
