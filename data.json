      "summary_orig": "South Africa sailed their way to an easy victory over Pakistan after chasing down a target of 256 to win by eight wickets in the first one-day international (ODI) of their series in Lahore on Tuesday, in the lead-up to the Women’s World Cup. The World Cup , to be hosted later this month under a hybrid model across India and Sri Lanka, will see all of Pakistan’s fixtures staged in Colombo, with political tensions ruling out travel between the two neighbours. Earlier in the day, veteran batter Sidra Amin smashed a century as The Women in Green set the Proteas a target of 256 to win in the first ODI of the three-match series. South Africa’s reply was led by batters Tazmin Brits and Marizanne Kapp after Sadia Iqbal struck early for the Green Shirts. They remained unbeaten on 101 and 121 respectively as the Proteas chased down a decent total with 10 balls to spare. Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana had won the toss and elected to bat first at the Gaddafi Stadium. Sidra was ably supported by Muneeba Ali as the duo put Pakistan in a strong position to win the first encounter of the three-match series. Opening batter Muneeba and Sidra anchored the innings with a commanding 147-run stand. It was Pakistan’s highest second-wicket partnership and third-highest for any wicket in women’s ODIs. The duo brought up the team’s 100 in the 21st over and continued to build momentum, taking the total to 150 by the 31st over. Muneeba, having reached her 5th half-century, was eventually dismissed for a well-crafted 76 off 94 balls, laced with 11 fours. Aliya Riaz then joined Sidra at the crease and the pair added a valuable 68 runs off the next 71 deliveries. Aliya contributed a brisk 33 off 34 balls, striking five boundaries, before falling in the 43rd over. Sidra brought up her 5th ODI century with a delicate dab down to long-on. She remained unbeaten on a superb 121, featuring 12 fours, as Pakistan posted 255-4 at the end of their 50 overs For the Proteas, Ayabonga Khaka returned figures of 9-0-36-2 while Tumi Sekhukhune picked up one wicket for 37 runs in eight overs. Pakistan had opened their immediate run-in with a three-match ODI series against South Africa in Lahore, following the conclusion of a training camp at the National Cricket Academy and the Gaddafi Stadium. On Monday, speaking at the pre-match press conference in Lahore, Fatima had said: “The specific aim is to prepare for the World Cup and execute our plans in this series.” “A series like this is very beneficial for the team ahead of the World Cup. It gives the players a good opportunity to put into practice all the preparation they have done in recent times,“ she was quoted as having said by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). She added that it is widely known that Pakistan rely on their bowling attack, so this time the Green Team’s focus will be on getting more support from the batting unit as well. “We worked a lot on batting during the camp,” the Pakistani skipper said. The ODIs will be staged at the Gaddafi Stadium on September 16, 19 and 22, with the first ball of all matches to be bowled at 3:30pm, according to the PCB. Pakistan’s 15-member squad is captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt leads the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches. The squad features one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August. The series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka. In head-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on September 14, 2023.",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan warns of ‘dangerous escalation’ as UNHRC urges accountability for Israel’s Qatar attack",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan warned of “dangerous escalation” as the United Nations and a long line of countries on Tuesday denounced Israel’s attack on Qatar last week, demanding “accountability”. Israel’s strikes on the Qatari capital on September 9 targeted Hamas leaders gathered to discuss a new US ceasefire proposal for Gaza. Five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer were killed. That strike “was a shocking breach of international law”, UN rights chief Volker Turk said during an urgent debate at the UN Human Rights Council about the strike. Denouncing the attack as “an assault on regional peace and stability”, he urged “accountability for unlawful killings”. His words were echoed by Qatar and dozens of country representatives who took the floor during the three-hour debate. Qatari International Cooperation Minister Maryam bint Ali bin Nasser Al-Misnad slammed Israel’s “treacherous attack” and demanded that the international community “take practical steps to hold the aggressors accountable and prevent their impunity”. “This attack was not an isolated incident, but rather was part of a broader campaign aimed at distorting Qatar’s role and obstructing its diplomatic efforts,” she said. Pakistan’s ambassador Bilal Ahmad warned that “this unjustifiable and unprovoked attack constitutes a dangerous escalation”. The council had announced on Monday that it would convene the 10th urgent debate since its creation in 2006, following two official requests from members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Pakistan was among those that led the call for the urgent debate. ‘Shameful’ Neither Israel nor its main ally, the United States, which both disengaged from the council earlier this year, was present for the urgent debate. But Israel’s ambassador in Geneva, Daniel Meron, lambasted the meeting from the sidelines. “This marks yet another shameful chapter in the Human Rights Council’s ongoing abuse,” he told journalists. He accused the council of “serving as a platform for anti-Israel propaganda, while ignoring the brutal realities on the ground and the atrocities committed by Hamas”. There was little support for Israel’s position during the debate. European Union ambassador Deike Potzel stressed the bloc’s “principled stance against terrorism in all its forms”, while underlining its “support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar” and calling “on Israel to respect international law”. “We urge all parties to refrain from any actions that jeopardise mediation channels and regional stability,” she said. China’s ambassador Chen Xu said his country “firmly rejects and categorically condemns” the September 9 attack, which he charged was “a deliberate attempt to derail the negotiation process”. Some of the harshest criticism came from South Africa, which has brought a case against Israel before the International Court of Justice, accusing it of committing genocide in Gaza. The attack “strikes against the very heart of mediation processes”, ambassador Mxolisi Nkosi told the council, adding that it “demonstrates that Israel does not want to end its genocidal war against the Palestinian people”. “It is time for the international community to demonstrate through practical countermeasures that Israel does not enjoy some form of special immunity from accountability.“",

      "title_orig": "The words of the Chief Justice",
      "summary_orig": "In 1817, Chief Justice John Marshall, one of America’s founding fathers, delivered what is often called the shortest judgment in judicial history: “The United States never pays costs.” This was the entirety of a unanimous majority decision in the Supreme Court case of United States v. Barker . Six words settled a complex question of law that had gone unanswered for twenty years, and solidified jurisprudence on sovereign immunity with clarity and precision. Exactly 208 years later, the unthinkable happened. In a judgment authored by Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) ruled on the case of a journalist restricted from leaving the country with the following: “Office objection is sustained”. Move over Justice Marshall, that looks like four words and a newly broken world record to me. Pakistan: 1, USA: 0. A stunning upset like this must be exactly the kind of judicial achievement the framers of the 26th Amendment dreamed of. So where are the balloons, the mass media coverage, the celebrations on the streets? Why is it only this writer who’s publicly noticed an achievement so grand? Well, it might have something to do with the difference between these two judgments. Brevity is the soul of wit, and that Shakespearean adage applies to both. But while the former sought to push the limits of how much you could accomplish with how few words, the latter took a different approach, by not seeking to accomplish anything at all. When courts shield power, not people For context, the journalist, Asad Ali Toor, had approached the court after he was stopped at an airport and prevented from leaving the country to attend a training program.  He had been placed on the “Provisional National Identification List”, which exists under a 2018 standing order for the purposes of preventing fugitives of ‘heinous crimes’, like rape, murder, or terrorism, from fleeing abroad. The only ‘heinous’ crime Toor has ever been accused of is irritating some very powerful people. Regardless, his name was on the list; he was not told this fact until he was packed up and ready to board his flight, and someone in a very high office likely took great pleasure in the deliberate act of causing him pain. Courts exist for the precise purpose of shielding regular citizens from thuggery like this. What happened to Toor was illegal in at least a dozen different ways: he was not even accused of anything that merited inclusion in the PNIL; no reasoning or show-cause notice was given; the Courts have consistently held that one must be informed when placed on such a list; an accused must be given the right to appeal; the Constitution guarantees freedom of movement; and the list goes on and on. Toor has a history of being targeted and punished for his journalism (even the people who sold him his parrots were not spared ), and this cannot be ignored when judging his present mistreatment. For a case like this to land before a judge is a ripe and easy opportunity to affirm that justice is not dead in this country — that some loose cog in our very large government machinery cannot arbitrarily decide that it does not like you, and therefore you must deal with a certain amount of misery as a prerequisite to your existence here. Confronted with a situation so transparently unjust, a judge has the chance to deliver a comprehensive verdict that strengthens individual liberties and at least attempts to ensure that no citizen of this country ever goes through such an indignity again. Justice Babar Sattar of this same court did just that in his excellent judgment on illegal phone tapping. If the chief justice so desired, he could have affirmed and strengthened the constitutional right to free movement in a way that made Pakistan a better place, with a stronger rule of law, for all of us. Instead, we got the world’s shortest judgment. Toor had been told by the registrar’s office that, before he comes to court, he must first go to the government department that is visibly intent on making his life miserable. The office objection was sustained. The training program went on without him. Now, it could happen to you, too. Whether you love him or hate him, agree with his opinions or not, or even know who he is, Toor has unravelled the extent of all our freedoms, and their lack thereof. For now, they’re worth a grand total of four words. Later, though, we got more words from the chief justice. Misogyny, misconduct and the language of the law In another case about the freedom to leave the country, he castigated Imaan Mazari, the same lawyer who represented Toor, for critiquing his work. In open court, the chief justice reportedly threatened contempt proceedings, said “shut your mouth”, and then turned to another lawyer, who happened to be Mazari’s husband, to say “control her, one day if I catch her…”. There was no question that these remarks were sexist, threatening, and unacceptable. An apology was due. Instead, the following day, according to journalists in the courtroom, the chief justice stated: “Imaan Mazari is like my daughter. Yesterday, as a chief justice and as an elder, I was explaining things to her. My remarks were taken out of context”. Specifically, he denied having said he was going to “catch her” and stated (in contradiction of multiple journalists’ reports) that he had, in fact, only asked her husband to catch her (as if that was any better). There’s an old saying that goes, ‘when you’re in a hole, stop digging’. But the Chief Justice still wasn’t done. “If I initiate contempt proceedings, the girl’s career will be ruined. I explained to her like my children, but she wasn’t understanding”. A shockingly inappropriate word was used to refer to a professional and accomplished lawyer — “ bachi ”. In doubling down on a worldview that sees women as lesser beings, devoid of agency and subject to the restraint, control, and unsolicited advice of the men around them, the chief justice revealed much. But he was clear during his castigation that one should critique the decisions, and not the person, so that is all I’ll do. The IHC chief justice’s decision to belittle a female advocate for daring to stand up to him has sparked criticism across the board. His decision to present a non-apology and further condescension disguised as benevolence only worsened his position. And his decision to still not provide an unconditional apology to all the women who appear in his court, despite multiple condemnations from bar associations and women’s groups, takes this matter to unacceptable levels of misconduct. Apparently, there is a history to this behaviour. In an interview with Matiullah Jan, Mazari’s husband reported that Justice Dogar had been protested by the bar in Multan and ultimately transferred for referring to a lawyer as ‘ulloo ka patha’ in court. The Supreme Judicial Council is the sole body empowered to hold judges accountable for actions like this. At the very least, it should convene to take notice and release the minutes of the meeting to the public to let the country know that the entirety of its justice system does not condone misogyny. How one clause changed it all It cannot be ignored that everything you have read about here is a direct result of the 26th Amendment . That is what allowed this chief justice to be transferred from number 15 in seniority at the Lahore High Court (LHC) to number one in Islamabad, leapfrogging over some of our country’s most brilliant jurists. No reasoning was ever given to the public as to why Justice Dogar was deemed a better fit than those he superseded for the top job at the court of this nation’s capital. Five sitting judges went on the record to argue (very convincingly) that this transfer was illegal and amounted to nothing more than an attack on the independence of the judiciary; going so far as to file a petition against the transfer appointments in the Supreme Court (SC). This challenge was heard by the constitutional bench, itself a creation of the 26th Amendment, and went exactly how you would expect it to. With every passing day, the mess that this amendment created gets layers added to it, and the prospect of any meaningful pushback feels less and less likely. Robust challenges to its legality remain completely ignored by the SC. And almost a year into its enactment, while its impacts are immense and impossible to quantify, the result here is simple; the same IHC that once represented the very best of our judiciary — pushing back against power, delivering intelligent and progressive judgments, and standing up for the vulnerable — has been reduced to castigating activists and broadcasting misogyny. This country deserves better. And if justice is to be seen to be done, we can’t have Justices seeing half the population as lesser than the other.",

      "summary_en": "In 1817, Chief Justice John Marshall, one of America’s founding fathers, delivered what is often called the shortest judgment in judicial history: “The United States never pays costs.” This was the entirety of a unanimous majority decision in the Supreme Court case of United States v. Barker . Six words settled a complex question of law that had gone unanswered for twenty years, and solidified jurisprudence on sovereign immunity with clarity and precision. Exactly 208 years later, the unthinkable happened. In a judgment authored by Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) ruled on the case of a journalist restricted from leaving the country with the following: “Office objection is sustained”. Move over Justice Marshall, that looks like four words and a newly broken world record to me. Pakistan: 1, USA: 0.

Well, it might have something to do with the difference between these two judgments. Brevity is the soul of wit, and that Shakespearean adage applies to both.

      "summary_orig": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) has dismissed the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) complaint seeking the removal of match referee Andy Pycroft from the ongoing Asia Cup over a dispute during the recent Pakistan-India match , Indian media outlets claimed on Tuesday. The PCB had yesterday lodged a complaint with the ICC against Pycroft over his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket“, with the board claiming that the referee had asked the Pakistan and India captains “not to shake hands at the time of the toss” for Sunday’s match. “Late last night, ICC had sent a reply to PCB stating that Pycroft won’t be removed and their plea has been rejected,” an unnamed ICC source told the Press Trust of India . However, Cricbuzz reported , “When contacted, the PCB has denied receiving any communication from the ICC.” The PCB has yet to issue an official statement on the development. The Times of India ( TOI ) reported it was “actually the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) officials on the ground who informed Pycroft about the no-handshake policy at the toss”. It is unclear if any such official policy had been set for the match. Another TOI report quoted an unnamed PCB source as saying, “It is very unlikely that the PCB will pull out from the Asia Cup.” At the centre of the complaint is the Indian team’s refusal to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts at the toss and the match’s end, as is customary. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi yesterday claimed , without naming, that Pycroft had violated the “ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket”. According to an earlier press release by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Pycroft is scheduled to be the match referee for the Pakistan-UAE match tomorrow. ‘Politicised’ victory The Asia Cup match between India and Pakistan took place on Sunday in Dubai, where spinners led by Kuldeep Yadav helped the Men in Blue beat the Green Shirts by seven wickets as the neighbours met on the cricket pitch for the first time since their military conflict in May. After hitting the winning shot, skipper Suryakumar Yadav and his teammates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts. The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government” and the team wanted to give the Green Shirts a “proper reply”. Suryakumar also seemingly “politicised” the victory by bringing up the April terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam — over which Delhi and Islamabad fought the four-day conflict in May — at his post-match presentation and said the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country. He also dedicated the win to the Indian armed forces, with Pakistani cricketers and various analysts criticising his comments. In response, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony and coach Mike Hesson termed the Indian team’s conduct “ disappointing ”.",

      "title_orig": "We have ‘effective’ armed forces: Dar on Pakistan’s possible position if united body is formed against Israel in ME",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has “very large” and “effective” armed forces that have proven their capabilities in conventional warfare, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said during an interview to Al Jazeera when asked about the possible position Islamabad would take in case a united body in the Middle East was formed to stop Israeli aggression. The interview, recorded ahead of an Arab-Islamic summit on Israel’s recent strikes in Qatar and published late on Monday night, saw Dar in conversation with Al Jazeera ’s Osama Bin Javed. who asked the foreign minister if the formation of a united body in the Middle East, away from the United Nations structure, to intervene in Gaza was an option on the table. To that, Dar began his response by mentioning that “vis a vis UN Security Council, a mechanism could be chalked out”. “For example, they have [imposed] very serious sanctions on countries that don’t listen to them. And that is a very severe economic dent or pain they can cause to any country.” He then went on to say that there had been talk along the lines of “some sort of combined security force” during recent interactions among Arab nations and the Arab League. Dar added, “Why not? What’s wrong with that? They should [have a combined force]. And according to their own capacity, own strength, they should create some mechanism. Not for aggression purpose [ sic ], but for peaceful purpose[s], for stopping the aggressor, for stopping the occupier, for stopping someone who just doesn’t listen.” Where would a “nuclear-powered Pakistan” stand with that, asked Javed. “Nuclear-powered Pakistan, obviously, as a member of the ummah, would discharge its duty,” replied Dar. Javed then asked him to further elaborate in his answer. In his response, Dar clarified that Pakistan saw nuclear weapons only for deterrence and didn’t intend to use them. “We have no intention of using it; it is only a deterrence.” He continued: “But Pakistan has a very large, known, very effective army, very effective air force, very effective navy … We have proved that we can beat [our opponent] even conventionally, if challenged.” The interviewer then brought up a recent debate at the UN Security Council where Israel had invoked a 2011 attack within Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden in a bid to justify its attacks in Gaza. “So if now Pakistan comes under attack, from a country like the United States, for instance, would Pakistan act differently [than it did in 2011]?” he asked. “We would not allow the breach of our territorial integrity, no matter by whom, be it the smallest or the largest country. We would respond. But I don’t see any reason why the US or any other country would do it. India did it. You saw what happened to them,” replied Dar. Javed then pointed to the lack of action by the US in stopping Israel from attacking Qatar and asked Dar whether Pakistan still saw America as a “trustworthy” security partner. In his response, Dar highlighted the “positive” role the US had played in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following a recent escalation between the two countries in May. Earlier in the interview, recent strikes by Israel in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders in Doha also came up. Sharing his views on the subject, Dar said Israel’s reasons to attack a sovereign country were “totally baseless”. He pointed out that Qatar was mediating talks, along with the US and Egypt, for peace in Gaza when that attack happened, terming Israel’s actions “rogue”. Dar highlighted that Israel had attacked multiple countries in the Middle East and said that international laws, international humanitarian rules and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and UN Security Council resolutions seemed to have “no effect on one country, which is repeatedly doing what it feels like”. “That means [the] multilateral system needs very serious reforms right now … This is the need of the hour. I think the UN Security Council, as well as the UN system itself needs very serious reforms. “The UN Security Council is meant to maintain peace in the world. And if its resolutions are just put in the bin, as it is happening since so many years — [by] Israel in Gaza and Palestine and by India in Kashmir — what do we expect from the multilateral system?” Asked whether all Muslim countries in the world were carrying equal weight and “doing the jobs they should be doing”, Dar said Pakistan believed that no matter how big or small a state was, their “dignity and respect should be equal”. In this connection, he also gave the example of India, mentioning that “some country had claimed to have hegemony, to be the net security provider, to be the captain of the entire region”. But “you saw what happened between May 7 and 10. It’s all settled. The hegemony is buried,” he added, referring to a four-day armed escalation between India and Pakistan. Dar further said that military action by Pakistan at the time was in self-defence. Answering a follow-up question, he said he believed with regard to Gaza, diplomacy and dialogue were the best options. “It takes time, but you can reach a solution when you sit at the table. But if you are not willing to sit [at] the table, if you are not sincere and have negative and evil designs of expansionism […] then you will never be sincere about the dialogue. So, sincerity in dialogue is also required.” To a question about whether Israel could attack Pakistan next after Qatar, Dar reminded that India had tried that and Israel “gave it full support according to our information” and the “world saw that the claim is exposed”. “We are ready. Again, I repeat, we want peace. The nuclear-armed state does not want any destabilisation in the region because that will have consequences beyond [the region],” he added, stressing the need for collective efforts for reforms in UN Security Council resolutions. Saying that Israel and India were the only countries that did not abide by UN Security Council resolutions, he emphasised evolving a mechanism in the council for taking practical measures to “control the situation” if its resolutions were not acted upon and implemented. “And that might require physical actions, physical interventions.”",

Javed then pointed to the lack of action by the US in stopping Israel from attacking Qatar and asked Dar whether Pakistan still saw America as a “trustworthy” security partner. In his response, Dar highlighted the “positive” role the US had played in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following a recent escalation between the two countries in May. Earlier in the interview, recent strikes by Israel in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders in Doha also came up. Sharing his views on the subject, Dar said Israel’s reasons to attack a sovereign country were “totally baseless”. He pointed out that Qatar was mediating talks, along with the US and Egypt, for peace in Gaza when that attack happened, terming Israel’s actions “rogue”. Dar highlighted that Israel had attacked multiple countries in the Middle East and said that international laws, international humanitarian rules and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and UN Security Council resolutions seemed to have “no effect on one country, which is repeatedly doing what it feels like”. “That means [the] multilateral system needs very serious reforms right now … This is the need of the hour. I think the UN Security Council, as well as the UN system itself needs very serious reforms. “The UN Security Council is meant to maintain peace in the world. And if its resolutions are just put in the bin, as it is happening since so many years — [by] Israel in Gaza and Palestine and by India in Kashmir — what do we expect from the multilateral system?” Asked whether all Muslim countries in the world were carrying equal weight and “doing the jobs they should be doing”, Dar said Pakistan believed that no matter how big or small a state was, their “dignity and respect should be equal”. In this connection, he also gave the example of India, mentioning that “some country had claimed to have hegemony, to be the net security provider, to be the captain of the entire region”. But “you saw what happened between May 7 and 10. It’s all settled. The hegemony is buried,” he added, referring to a four-day armed escalation between India and Pakistan. Dar further said that military action by Pakistan at the time was in self-defence. Answering a follow-up question, he said he believed with regard to Gaza, diplomacy and dialogue were the best options. “It takes time, but you can reach a solution when you sit at the table. But if you are not willing to sit [at] the table, if you are not sincere and have negative and evil designs of expansionism […] then you will never be sincere about the dialogue. So, sincerity in dialogue is also required.” To a question about whether Israel could attack Pakistan next after Qatar, Dar reminded that India had tried that and Israel “gave it full support according to our information” and the “world saw that the claim is exposed”. “We are ready. Again, I repeat, we want peace. The nuclear-armed state does not want any destabilisation in the region because that will have consequences beyond [the region],” he added, stressing the need for collective efforts for reforms in UN Security Council resolutions. Saying that Israel and India were the only countries that did not abide by UN Security Council resolutions, he emphasised evolving a mechanism in the council for taking practical measures to “control the situation” if its resolutions were not acted upon and implemented. “And that might require physical actions, physical interventions.”",

      "title_orig": "Suspected gunman Robinson wrote note threatening Kirk, tied to scene by DNA, FBI director says",
      "summary_orig": "The suspect accused of assassinating right-wing activist Charlie Kirk in Utah wrote a text message before the shooting that he planned to kill Kirk, FBI Director Kash Patel said on Monday. In an appearance on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” Patel said investigators believe Tyler Robinson also wrote a physical note saying he had the “opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk” and would do so. The note was destroyed, Patel said, but investigators have collected forensic evidence that it had existed and confirmed its contents through interviews. Patel did not say who had received the text message or whether anyone had seen the written note before the attack. Investigators have not publicly identified a motive. Law enforcement authorities have said they believe Robinson acted alone when he shot Kirk, but are investigating whether anyone else had a role in plotting the killing. Separately, the Washington Post reported on Monday that Robinson had sent a message via the online platform Discord to friends, apparently confessing to the crime on Thursday night, shortly before he was arrested. “It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,” read a message from the account belonging to Robinson, the newspaper reported, citing two people familiar with the chat as well as screenshots it had obtained. Kirk, an influential ally of US President Donald Trump who co-founded the leading conservative student group Turning Point USA, was killed by a single rifle shot last Wednesday during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem, about 40 miles south (65 km) of Salt Lake City. Court hearing by video Robinson, 22, is expected to be formally charged on Tuesday, around the same time that he makes an initial court appearance by video from his jail cell. Patel told Fox News that DNA matching the suspect’s was found on a towel that was wrapped around the rifle believed to be the murder weapon and on a screwdriver found on the rooftop that served as the shooter’s sniper perch. Robinson has not cooperated with authorities, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said on Sunday, but investigators have been interviewing his friends and family in an effort to determine the motive for the shooting. The killing has shaken a country already gripped by a spike in political violence, fueled by deepening polarisation between the right and the left.\nBoth sides have universally condemned Kirk’s slaying as an indefensible act of political violence, though partisan differences have emerged over the framing of that message. Some Republicans, including Trump, have blamed liberal groups for Kirk’s murder despite a lack of evidence, while Democrats have noted that left-wing figures have also been the targets of political violence in recent years.\nThe left and right also disagree over Kirk’s legacy and how he should be remembered. Legacy divided Kirk’s supporters cast him as an influential and charismatic figure who galvanised support for Trump among younger voters in 2024, and the Republican president has honoured Kirk by ordering flags flown at half-staff on public buildings. Civil rights advocates and liberals have criticised Kirk as a divisive figure who embraced Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of a stolen election in 2020 and has marginalised Blacks, women, the LGBT community, Muslims and immigrants with derogatory rhetoric. In an appearance on Kirk’s eponymous podcast on Monday, Vice President JD Vance said the “incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism” had helped lead to Kirk’s killing. While Robinson was raised in a Mormon household by religious parents in a deeply conservative region of the state, “his ideology was very different than his family,” Cox said on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program, without going into specifics. State records show Robinson had registered to vote without choosing a party affiliation and did not vote in the 2024 presidential election. But a relative told police that Robinson had grown more political and had expressed dislike for Kirk in a recent conversation. House Speaker Mike Johnson and three other top members of the House Republican leadership held a brief vigil on Monday for Kirk, attended by dozens of lawmakers, friends and supporters in Statuary Hall of the US Capitol. Back in Utah, at the scene of Kirk’s assassination, scores of mourners have flocked to makeshift memorials in recent days to leave flowers and handwritten notes, and to inscribe messages in chalk on campus sidewalks, many of them Bible verses. Dally Bronson, 22, a sheriff’s dispatcher from neighbouring Wasatch County who was on duty at the time Kirk was shot, said that as a devout Christian, she felt torn about what justice should look like. Describing herself as an admirer of Kirk, Bronson said she had been praying for both him and his accused killer. “By all accounts (Robinson) was a good kid until recently, when something went terribly wrong,” she said, speaking through tears. Kirk’s “killing isn’t about one political side or the other - it’s about good and evil. The shooter encountered a darkness online; he went into some black hole on the internet, and it’s something people our age fall into.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Apart from the affluent sheikhs of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, who lavished Pakistan’s dignitaries — including visiting bureaucrats — with expensive gifts, mainly wristwatches, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif received a traditional golden dagger during the first six months of 2025. The Toshakhana record, made public by the cabinet division for the period between January and June 2025, lists high-value items such as watches, luxury vehicles, carpets, handicrafts, and traditional artefacts presented to top state functionaries, including the president, prime minister, ministers, and senior officials during foreign visits and local engagements. The data, comprising 137 entries, records gifts received from heads of state, royal families, diplomats, and business delegations. However, the value of these gifts is still being assessed by the cabinet division. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received a total of 61 gifts, mostly decorative and traditional items. These included several high-end wristwatches. Notably, on the first day of 2025, he was presented with two luxury wristwatches — an IWC Schaffhausen and a Panerai, both with warranty cards — by Sheikh Abdul Hadi Mana Al-Hajri of Qatar. Record shows PM received 61 out of total 137 gifts presented to state officials The Shah of the State of Selangor, Malaysia, gifted PM Shehbaz a ‘Golden Kris’ — a traditional Malaysian dagger. Additionally, the president of Turkiye presented him with an electric car. During his visit to Azerbaijan, the prime minister received a handmade silk carpet and other items. The President of Tajikistan gifted him a box containing a golden teacup with a spoon. While in Saudi Arabia , PM Shehbaz received a model of Mimbar-e-Rasool from Prince Mansour Bin Muhammad Bin Saad bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, and a wooden box containing two documents — the Charter of Makkah in English and Arabic — from Dr Mohammad Abdulkareem Al-Issa, Secretary General of the Muslim World League. From Iran , the PM was presented with a wall hanging and a shield by the Chief of General Staff. Other gifts included handmade carpets, onyx decorations, paintings, tea sets, books, and shields. Interestingly, while the Saudi hosts did not overwhelm the prime minister with lavish gifts, several Pakistani officials visiting the Kingdom — led by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — received high-end wristwatches. On Jan 28, Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia gifted six Rolex watches, five Tudor watches, three Black Armin watches, and nine Frank Rosha watches to Pakistani officials, primarily government officers. The record shows that President Asif Ali Zardari received 11 gifts, including a ladies’ suit and a bedsheet from the High Commissioner of Bangladesh. The most valuable among his gifts was an electric vehicle from the president of Turkiye. He also received a carpet from the Iranian foreign minister, as well as vases, candle stands, shields, a coffee set, and onyx items. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received several Afghan carpets and traditional bowls, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was presented with prayer mats and Turkish handicrafts. Other ministers, advisers, and security officials were gifted watches, rugs, wall hangings, and porcelain items. Published in Dawn, September 16th, 2025",
