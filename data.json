      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Afghanistan have often engaged in minor border skirmishes, particularly since the withdrawal of US forces and the Taliban’s takeover in 2021. However, tensions have recently escalated to an unprecedented level, with clashes over the past few days prompting intervention from mediators. The latest flare-up coincided with a historic visit by Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India, raising alarm in Islamabad after he referred to Kashmir as part of India and said terrorism was Pakistan’s “internal problem” that the country should solve itself. Escalation The recent clashes began late on Saturday night, when 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed at the border following an attack from the Afghan side at around 9pm, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The ISPR said skirmishes between the two sides began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintained that Kabul must “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. By midnight, both sides were targeting each other, as Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and artillery pounded Afghanistan’s posts, targeting hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika. Pakistan warns of ‘unwavering, befitting response’ On Sunday, the Foreign Office (FO) warned that further acts of aggression from Afghanistan would receive an “unwavering and befitting response”. It expressed concern about the “unwarranted aggression by the Afghan Taliban, Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan ”, which it said would destabilise neighbourly relations between the two nations. The same day, Afghan Taliban Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had said that Pakistani strikes on Kabul “will have consequences” and that the country had “weapons to respond”. ‘Stalemate’ situation Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday described the situation as a “stalemate”, noting that there were “no ties, direct or indirect” between Islamabad and Kabul in the fallout of the unprovoked attack. “You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’ while reporting a lull in attacks. He also stressed that Pakistan had the “right to react” to being attacked, and warned that the fighting could resume again at any time. Attacks resume As Asif predicted, the exchange of blows resumed again last night between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to state media reports. State-run PTV , citing security sources, described the attack from the Afghan side as unprovoked once again, adding that the Pakistani army “responded with full force and intensity”. Today, the ISPR said that security forces repulsed another attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban. It said that the Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said. It added that as Pakistani troops repelled the attack, 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban were killed and several others were injured. Calls for restraint China, which shares a border with the two countries, sought to play a mediating role in calming the hostilities. Beijing’s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had asked the two countries to protect their nationals and investments in the region, according to AFP . United States President Donald Trump, while on his way to Israel to oversee the exchange of hostages between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas, also expressed an interest in resolving the conflict, saying, “I’m good at making peace.” Additionally, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, offered yesterday to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan in an effort to ease the tensions, citing his past experience with peacemaking between the two sides. As the only Pakistani political leader who has met the Taliban supreme leader, Shaikh Hibatullah, the chief said, “I have been in contact with the Afghan leadership, and they want to resolve the issues through understanding.” He added that both sides should refrain from blaming each other for the hostilities. Previous improvement in ties Islamabad and Kabul had witnessed an improvement in bilateral ties this year, after steps such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee and upgrading diplomatic ranks. However, Pakistan has long been pressing the Taliban rulers to take action against the TTP and other Pakistani militant groups in view of the increase in attacks across Pakistan. Last week, during the Moscow Format Consultations held in the Russian capital, Pakistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan, Mohammad Sadiq, sought] 15 regional countries’ cooperation to “effectively counter terrorism and dismantle all terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil”. The Taliban government insists it does not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against Pakistan. Muttaqi’s trip to India The meeting in Moscow was also attended by Muttaqi, who, the next day, left for New Delhi for the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since they came to power. Although New Delhi does not formally recognise the Taliban government, it has taken steps to thaw relations. While in India, Muttaqi issued controversial remarks on terrorism in Pakistan with reference to Pahalgam, the site of a deadly attack in India-occupied Kashmir in which 26 tourists were killed. India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the attack, while Islamabad denied the allegations. The incident led to a four-day military escalation between Pakistan and India before being halted with US intervention. Muttaqi’s statement referred to Pahalgam as a part of India, drawing severe backlash from Pakistan’s FO. In a response to the India-Afghanistan joint statement, the FO expressed “strong reservations” on the remarks and described the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India to be “in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions” and “highly insensitive”.

According to the families and their legal representatives, two of the three domestic and international law firms representing the families have recently filed complaints with the Superior Court of King County in Seattle, Washington. The remaining law firm is reportedly preparing to file an additional complaint. The families claim that multiple failures in critical landing equipment occurred as the Jeju Air 7C2216 aircraft approached the runway, arguing that Boeing bears responsibility for defects that led to the fatal accident on Dec. 29 at Muan International Airport that claimed the lives of 179 passengers and crew members.",

      "summary_orig": "Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir called on President Asif Ali Zardari at the Presidency on Wednesday, where both discussed internal and external security threats. The meeting comes in the wake of escalating border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with security forces repelling an attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border this morning and killing 15 to 20 fighters, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. Today’s clash, the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, follows the incident in Kurram on Tuesday night and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations. According to a statement from the President’s Secretariat, Field Marshal Munir briefed the president on Pakistan’s overall internal and external security landscape. “He (army chief) also apprised the president of the recent security situation arising from the aggressive and provocative actions of the Afghan Taliban regime, as well as the measured and befitting response by the Armed Forces of Pakistan,” the statement read. It added that the president reaffirmed that Pakistan will defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs and expressed full confidence in the “strength, valour, capacity, and preparedness of Pakistan’s Armed Forces”. President Zardari “lauded their (armed forces) vigilance and professionalism in defending the nation’s frontiers and in swiftly repelling cross-border attacks along the Afghan border”, the statement concluded. According to the ISPR, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 injured in the weekend skirmishes which began with the Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border. The military’s media affairs wing also said that credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment showed that “more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher”. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “ retaliatory ” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. The weekend clash took place against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists. Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces repulsed an attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border on Wednesday, killing around 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. According to a statement by the ISPR, Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said. It added that as Pakistani troops repelled the attack, 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban were killed and several others were injured. “The situation is still developing. There are reports of further buildup at staging points of Fitna-al-Khwarij and [the] Afghan Taliban,” the statement said. Fitna-al-Khwarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The ISPR said that the attack from the Afghan side was “unfortunately […] orchestrated through divided villages in the area, with no regard for [the] civil population”. “The Afghan Taliban also destroyed the Pak-Afghan Friendship Gate on their side, which clearly displays the mindset with regard to mutual trade and easement rights of the divided tribes,” it added. The statement by the military’s media affairs wing underlined that the incident in Balochistan was an isolated event. “On [the] night of October 14/15, Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khwarij tried to attack Pakistani border posts in Kurram Sector in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “These attacks were effectively repulsed , causing heavy losses to Afghan posts. Eight posts, including six tanks, were destroyed in the effective yet proportionate response of Pakistani troops. Twenty-five to thirty Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khwarij fighters were suspected to have been killed,” the ISPR said. The ISPR further stated, “The insinuations that the attack was initiated by Pakistan are outrageous and blatant lies, just like the claims of capturing Pakistani posts or equipment. The propaganda of [the] Taliban regime can be debunked with basic fact checks.” The statement also reaffirmed that the “armed forces stand resolute and fully prepared to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. All acts of aggression against Pakistan will be responded to with full force”. Before the ISPR’s statement today, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid also posted on social media platform X about the incident at the border in Balochistan. He alleged that Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. Mujahid claimed that more than 12 civilians were killed and over 100 were injured in the attacks carried out by Pakistani forces with the use of “light and heavy weapons”. The Afghan government spokesperson also claimed heavy losses on the Pakistan side, including the capture of posts and weapons, as well as fatalities. President, PM laud security forces Following the incident in Balochistan, a statement on the PPP’s X account said President Asif Ali Zardari had “strongly condemned” the cross-border attacks from Afghanistan. “Attacks from Afghanistan are a blatant violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty,” the statement quoted him as saying, adding that he also paid tribute to the armed forces for their “courage and professional expertise”. The president said the Afghan Taliban government was continuously “violating” the 2020 Doha agreement — a deal signed between the US and Afghan Taliban that included guarantees from the Taliban that it would prevent militant groups from using Afghan soil to threaten the security of the US and its allies. President Zardari accused the Afghan Taliban of “providing safe havens to Taliban terrorists”, who he said were a threat to other countries in the region. The president said such measures were destabilising the entire region, including Pakistan. “The Afghan government is deviating from its promise to establish a broad-based representative government,” he further stated. On the incidents along the border in Kurram and Balochistan, he said the Pakistan Army had “effectively repelled the attacks” in those areas. He called on the Afghan authorities not to let their soil be used for terrorism and anti-Pakistan activities. “Such attacks harm the peace and friendly relations in the region,” the president said, adding that Pakistan wanted peaceful ties based on cooperation with all its neighbours. “Any aggression against Pakistan will be met with a strong and unequivocal response,” he asserted. A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) today said premier Shehbaz Sharif had expressed concern over “incitement” by the Afghan Taliban, Fitna-al-Khwarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan (the term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan) at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. He also paid tribute to the security forces for repelling the attack by the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram sector, the statement said. It further quoted the PM as observing that the Pakistan Army had given a “strong” response to the Afghan Taliban’s “unprovoked aggression”. “National integrity will be defended at all costs. The use of Afghan soil for incidents of terrorism in Pakistan is condemnable,” he added. Tense ties Today’s border clash in Balochistan is the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following the incident in Kurram last night and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.

On Monday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’ that there were “no ties” between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he had said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”. The minister had also said that hostilities between the two sides could resume “at any time”. Additional reporting by Irfan Sadozai",

      "title_orig": "After May conflict, India trying to mould history by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts: ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "The military on Wednesday said that India was attempting to “mould history to its liking by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts” in the aftermath of the May conflict between the two countries. The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . After New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later raising the tally to seven . After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire . Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after its three air bases were targeted. However, Indian political and military leadership have continued to make aggressive statements , repeating terrorism allegations that Pakistan has repeatedly refuted . Yesterday, Indian Army’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai claimed that the Indian Navy was fully prepared during ‘Operation Sindoor’, the term New Delhi used for its May 7 strikes on Pakistan. He further said that any further hostilities by Pakistan could have been “catastrophic for it”, Times of India reported. Lt Gen Ghai claimed that more than 100 Pakistani soldiers were killed during the May conflict along the Line of Control, according to The Hindu . The Indian officer also reiterated India’s claim of inflicting major damage on Pakistani airbases and destroying its air assets on the ground, the report said. Without taking any names, a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said: “The contradictions in the Indian Army presser are so evident that they should not be dignified with a response. Evidently, the Indian leadership is attempting to mould history to its liking by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts. “It appears that [the] Indian army and the political leadership have not been able to reconcile with the idea that they have been decisively beaten in Marka-i-Haq, and that their falsehoods have been fully exposed,” it added. The military’s media affairs wing noted with grave concern that five months after the May conflict, “in the run-up to elections in Bihar and West Bengal , Indian military leadership has started parroting the same delusional, fabricated and provocative propaganda that they regurgitate before every state election in India”. “It is saddening to see the military leadership of a nuclear-armed country issuing irresponsible statements under immense political pressure. The lies being fed to the Indian public and international audience have turned the Indian military machine into a laughing stock,” the statement said. The ISPR cautioned that “any professional soldier would know that unnecessary chest thumping and unwarranted statements might initiate a cycle of jingoism and lead to serious consequences for peace and stability in South Asia”. It asserted that the world now recognised India as the “true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, bent upon adventurism and hegemonism to the detriment of its people and its neighbours”. The ISPR stressed that the “Indian armed forces and its political masters must realise that Pakistan’s people and its armed forces are fully capable and committed to defend every inch of our territory with full resolve”. “Every act of aggression will be dealt with a swift, resolute and intense response that will be remembered by posterity,” it said. Last week, the military’s top brass had warned India that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.",

      "summary_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan said on Tuesday that his party had been given a mandate by the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would not act against their interests. Imran’s remarks come after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Friday vowed the country would not ‘mortgage’ the security of its people with any country. He said “appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators was not and never would be a policy”, while addressing KP’s security situation in Peshawar. Responding to Imran’s call — from jail — for talks with the Afghan Taliban to end bloodshed , the DG ISPR said the state and forces would not be swayed by political distortions. He added that no single person — “most responsible for bringing terrorism back to KP” — could dictate national security. He also cited “governance gaps” in the province’s infrastructure and counter-terror funding. In a post on Imran’s official X account last night — which he does not operate himself — the PTI founder congratulated KP MPAs on the transition in governance after Sohail Afridi’s election as the new chief minister. “The way members of the KP Assembly voted for my nominated chief minister, without any ifs or buts, is commendable,” he said. He also paid tribute to outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who resigned “not once but thrice” without any hesitation. He also gave a special message to the new KP chief minister, calling him his “opening batsman” and telling him to play as such. “The PTI is the largest political party in Pakistan. Branding people associated with the party as traitors just because they do not agree with a certain policy is an extremely dangerous act,” Imran said, calling for an end to the practice of labelling people as “anti-state”. “As a politician, it is my right to criticise any policy that is against the interest of the people, the country’s integrity and democracy. I have and will continue to oppose every policy against national interests,” the ex-premier said. “The PTI has been given a mandate by the people of KP and we are answerable to them, not the DG ISPR. Therefore, we will never go against the interests of the people of Pakistan and the province,” he added. Imran asserted that he did not have an enmity with the army, saying: “The army is mine, the country is mine and its people are also mine.” He went on to say that several members of his family were part of the armed forces, adding that he felt sorrow when soldiers were martyred while fighting against terrorism. “But unrest still persists and our people are killed on both sides,” he said. “History has proven that military operations alone are not the solution for terrorism. Our principled position is that military operations in KP are unacceptable because innocent people are martyred in the name of ‘collateral damage’ and are displaced from their areas,” Imran said. “For decades, military operations are being conducted but this scourge still remains. Every year, precious blood is being spilt; sometimes army and police personnel are martyred, other times innocent civilians lose their lives in terrorist incidents,” he added. “I have always said that in order to completely eradicate terrorism, an effective, comprehensive strategy based on political insight is needed instead of decisions taken behind closed doors,” he said. The PTI founder further said that any policy made without the input and consultation of political representatives and the KP government was unacceptable. Imran asserted that all relevant stakeholders should be taken on board when formulating a policy against terrorism, be it local tribes in the province, the KP government, the federal government or the Afghan government. “The issue of terrorism cannot be solved without dialogue with the Afghan government,” he said. The PTI founder then directed the new KP government to talk to relevant stakeholders and formulate an effective and comprehensive strategy against terrorism to ensure long-term peace in the province. Imran’s statement comes after Afghan Taliban forces launched an unprovoked attack on posts situated on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. The ISPR said 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. Fighting flared up again last night between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in KP’s Kurram district, state media reported.",

      "summary": "PTI founder Imran Khan said on Tuesday that his party had been given a mandate by the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would not act against their interests. Imran’s remarks come after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Friday vowed the country would not ‘mortgage’ the security of its people with any country. He said “appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators was not and never would be a policy”, while addressing KP’s security situation in Peshawar. Responding to Imran’s call — from jail — for talks with the Afghan Taliban to end bloodshed , the DG ISPR said the state and forces would not be swayed by political distortions. He added that no single person — “most responsible for bringing terrorism back to KP” — could dictate national security. He also cited “governance gaps” in the province’s infrastructure and counter-terror funding. In a post on Imran’s official X account last night — which he does not operate himself — the PTI founder congratulated KP MPAs on the transition in governance after Sohail Afridi’s election as the new chief minister. “The way members of the KP Assembly voted for my nominated chief minister, without any ifs or buts, is commendable,” he said. He also paid tribute to outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who resigned “not once but thrice” without any hesitation. He also gave a special message to the new KP chief minister, calling him his “opening batsman” and telling him to play as such. “The PTI is the largest political party in Pakistan. Branding people associated with the party as traitors just because they do not agree with a certain policy is an extremely dangerous act,” Imran said, calling for an end to the practice of labelling people as “anti-state”. “As a politician, it is my right to criticise any policy that is against the interest of the people, the country’s integrity and democracy. I have and will continue to oppose every policy against national interests,” the ex-premier said. “The PTI has been given a mandate by the people of KP and we are answerable to them, not the DG ISPR. Therefore, we will never go against the interests of the people of Pakistan and the province,” he added. Imran asserted that he did not have an enmity with the army, saying: “The army is mine, the country is mine and its people are also mine.” He went on to say that several members of his family were part of the armed forces, adding that he felt sorrow when soldiers were martyred while fighting against terrorism. “But unrest still persists and our people are killed on both sides,” he said. “History has proven that military operations alone are not the solution for terrorism. Our principled position is that military operations in KP are unacceptable because innocent people are martyred in the name of ‘collateral damage’ and are displaced from their areas,” Imran said. “For decades, military operations are being conducted but this scourge still remains. Every year, precious blood is being spilt; sometimes army and police personnel are martyred, other times innocent civilians lose their lives in terrorist incidents,” he added. “I have always said that in order to completely eradicate terrorism, an effective, comprehensive strategy based on political insight is needed instead of decisions taken behind closed doors,” he said. The PTI founder further said that any policy made without the input and consultation of political representatives and the KP government was unacceptable. Imran asserted that all relevant stakeholders should be taken on board when formulating a policy against terrorism, be it local tribes in the province, the KP government, the federal government or the Afghan government. “The issue of terrorism cannot be solved without dialogue with the Afghan government,” he said. The PTI founder then directed the new KP government to talk to relevant stakeholders and formulate an effective and comprehensive strategy against terrorism to ensure long-term peace in the province. Imran’s statement comes after Afghan Taliban forces launched an unprovoked attack on posts situated on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. The ISPR said 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.

Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand resumed the hearing at Adiala jail, where Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi and defence counsel Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry were present. Special Prosecutor Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Naqvi and Barrister Umair Majeed completed the prosecution’s final arguments following the recording of statements by the PTI founder and his wife under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The court adjourned the proceedings till Wednesday (today), when lead counsel Barrister Salman Safdar is expected to conclude the defence’s arguments. The prosecution may then seek brief time for a rebuttal, after which the court could either reserve or announce its verdict. Earlier, the prosecution had closed its evidence after presenting 20 witnesses, including the PTI founder’s former military secretary, whose testimony was described as “damaging”. The court later summoned Mr Khan and his wife to record their statements before the conclusion of proceedings. The case concerns the alleged unlawful retention of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set — comprising a necklace, earrings, bracelets and rings — reportedly gifted by the Saudi royal family. The couple allegedly acquired the set at a nominal price, causing a loss to the national exchequer. According to the prosecution, the jewellery set, valued at around Rs80 million, was retained after paying only Rs2.9m. The former military secretary testified that Mr Khan had instructed him not to deposit the set in Toshakhana, in violation of official rules. During his statement under Section 342, Mr Khan had denied all allegations, terming the case “fabricated, malicious, and politically engineered” to disqualify him from politics. He said the case was politically motivated and violated due process. Mr Khan argued that he did not qualify as a “public servant” under the Pakistan Penal Code and maintained that even as prime minister, he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he claimed was presented to his wife. He said the jewellery set was lawfully retained under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 after proper valuation and payment. Rejecting allegations of undervaluation, he said neither he nor his wife had influenced any official appraiser and described prosecution witnesses — including former comptroller Syed Inamullah Shah and appraiser Sohaib Abbasi — as “unreliable and politically compromised”. Mr Khan also challenged the jurisdiction of both NAB and the FIA, asserting that the investigation was “extra-legal” and that the FIA had acted merely as a conduit for NAB. He questioned the admissibility of evidence obtained from abroad, including from Bulgari Italy. In her separate statement, Bushra Bibi also pleaded not guilty, denying charges of illegal retention and undervaluation of the same jewellery set. She said the gift was declared, assessed, and retained according to Toshakhana rules. She too challenged the jurisdiction of NAB and FIA and termed the proceedings “political victimisation”. Arrest warrant Meanwhile, the Special Anti-Terrorism Court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in the Nov 26 protest case registered at the Sadiqabad police station. The court noted that Ms Khanum had failed to appear twice and directed the Sadiqabad police to arrest and produce her before the court by Wednesday. The court rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that Ms Khanum was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the protest.

      "summary_orig": "• Huge cache of foreign currency, around 2kg gold recovered from Rizvi’s home • FIA says outfit’s financiers will be placed on stop list • Punjab police register over 20 FIRs against TLP leadership, say Rizvi escaped during crackdown • Mufti Muneeb, HRCP call for probe into ‘excessive force’ against protesters LAHORE: The authorities have launched a money-laundering investigation against Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan chief Saad Rizvi after “huge sums” of foreign currency were allegedly recovered from his residence in Lahore during a raid by the law enforcement agencies. The Punjab police said the raid was conducted by the provincial police, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), adding that all items, including the gold ornaments, were confiscated. The raid at the residence of the TLP chief came after the crackdown on the outfit’s march on Sunday night. Police said Mr Rizvi had escaped during the crackdown in Muridke. A senior police official said the law enforcers were shocked to find such a large amount of foreign currency, gold, and silver at the residence, as the TLP chief did not run any business before the formation of the radical outfit. In light of these findings, the authorities expanded the scope of their investigation to acquire details of bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, his son, and other family members to assess the total movable and immovable assets he had obtained under the TLP banner. The total currency allegedly recovered from the residence amounted to Rs110 million, including 50,000 Indian rupees. In a separate statement, the FIA said it has initiated legal and financial actions against a religious group involved in anti-state protests and violent activities, adding that the accounts and assets of several important officials and workers of the religious group were being examined based on evidence. According to the statement, “The FIA has frozen several bank accounts that were allegedly being used to fund violent protests.” Similarly, key individuals involved in fundin­g the TLP were being placed on the stop list. TLP headquarters ‘no-go’ area According to a police official, who shared initial findings with Dawn , the TLP purcha­sed dozens of properties in the vicinity of its headquarters — the hub of its activities — on Multan Road, making it a ‘no-go area’ for the LEAs and the general public. He said that the TLP chief had created a team of his loyal extremists and accommodated them by purchasing various houses at throwaway prices. “Several streets connected to the TLP’s main office have become a hub of the organisation’s trusted workers/supporters,” he said, adding that a separate team of the TLP was provided an office equipped with the latest gadgets to run and handle social and regular media campaigns. He said a dedicated team of highly trained activists was made available by the TLP to respond quickly to police operations. The Punjab police officially shared the detailed inventory of recovered valuables from the TLP chief’s residence. They included 1.92kg of gold, 898g of silver, 69 branded wristwatches, 28 gold bangles weighing 445g, 12 bracelets (490g), 24 necklaces, chains, and lockets, and 46 gold rings (355g). Similarly, the raiding team also recovered one silver crown and 32 silver rings from the house. 22 FIRs against TLP On the other hand, the Punjab police lodged at least 22 FIRs against TLP chief Saad Rizvi and his violent supporters across the province on various serious offences. In the primary FIR, Muridke police booked over 300 suspects on serious charges, ranging from terrorism to murder. Besides Mr Rizvi, his brother Anas Rizvi and many central leaders were also booked for inciting hate and instigating workers to raise anti-state slogans. The FIR said Ins­p­e­ctor Shahzad Nawaaz was allegedly kidna­p­ped and thrashed by a TLP mob, leaving him injured. It also accused Saad Rizvi of shooting the inspector in his abdomen, leaving him critically injured. The police officer later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital. It said that the TLP mob attacked the policemen with clubs, iron rods and sharp-edged weapons containing nails and injured several, adding that the TLP supporters were armed with lethal weapons and they opened indiscriminate fire at policemen, injuring many of them. As per the reports, the Pakpattan, Sahiwal, and Chichawatni police lodged three cases against Mr Rizvi, his supporters and workers under the anti-terrorism law and other offences. Another FIR alleged that Mr Rizvi’s speech, broadcast live via social media from Burawla Chowk, incited his followers to block roads, shut down markets, block traffic, and disrupt public order. Separately, the Gujrat police also booked at least 120 TLP activists on terrorism char­ges. The FIR was lodged with the Reh­m­ania police on the report of SI Aftab Rasool. Calls for probe Meanwhile, renowned cleric Mufti Mun­eebur Rehman urged the formation of a judicial commission, led by a serving superior judge, to investigate the crackdown on the TLP to disperse the protesters. “There is a growing demand that a judge of the high court or the SC should lead a thorough and independent investigation into this heart-wrenching and brutal incident. The aim is to identify those responsible and to recommend appropriate punishments based on the findings,” he said while reading out a joint declaration issued at the conference of clerics in Karachi. He also urged the Punjab government and administrations across the province to hand over the bodies of the deceased TLP workers to their families and to cease raids on the homes of its activists. Mufti Muneeb also urged the TLP leaders to reconsider their strategy and refrain from resorting to violence, instead focusing on securing their rightful place through the democratic parliamentary system. The Human Rights Comm­ission of Pakistan said the it was deeply concerned by the events that had unfolded since Oct 8, culminating in violent cla­shes between security forces and the TLP, causing multiple deaths and casualties among protesters and policemen. “We are equally concerned by the lack of transparency and credible, independent infor­mation surrounding the operation, providing which was the government’s responsibility. While state authorities have neglected to address the TLP’s consistent role in promoting hate speech and inciting mob viole­nce against individuals and groups, particularly religious minorities, this does not justify the alleged use of excessive force,” it said. Both the Constitution as well as international law mandate that security forces, even when dispersing violent assemblies, use the minimum necessary force, it said.
