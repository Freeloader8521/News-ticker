      "summary_orig": "An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday resumed hearing a set of pleas challenging the 26th Amendment and mull on the petitioners’ request to form a full court. The Amendment was passed by the parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment. Former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Abid Shahid Zuberi is set to continue his arguments on the case today. During recent hearings, judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners. So far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA)’s counsel Munir A. Malik and petitioner Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed have presented their arguments. Hamid sought the formation of a 16-member bench as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024. Malik contended that the CB had the power to issue a judicial order for the formation of a “full court”. On Saturday, a convention jointly hosted by the LHCBA and the Lahore Bar Association resolved to continue its struggle against the 26th constitutional Amendment, declaring that the legal fraternity would not accept any judicial verdict that undermines the judiciary’s independence. The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the legality of the 26th Amendment. The case was initially taken up in January , and after the CB’s approval of petitioners’ request for it, the proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8. The hearing At the outset of the hearing, Justice Mandokhail questioned whether it was the right of any party to request a bench of its choice, to which Zuberi replied, “I do not think that any party has the right to select a bench of their choice. But here the case is that we are requesting a full court on some constitutional legal issues.” The ex-SCBA president added that he had “always insisted that there should be a full bench”. Justice Mandokhail then asked why Zuberi wanted a full court, to which the latter said he would cite past judgements by the judges on the bench that rule for the formation of a full court. Upon the judge asking how many judges were appointed in the apex court currently and what a full court would look like, Zuberi said there were a total of 24 judges. “I am not declaring any judge wrong. All judges are honourable.” Justice Ayesha then enquired of the petitioner what his request was, to which Zuberi said that judges who were present before the 26th Amendment should hear the case. LHCBA’s counsel Hamid and BHCBA’s lawyer Malik had also sought the same. Responding to a question by Justice Mandokhail on the reasoning behind his request, Zuberi argued that the 26th Amendment, under which the CB was formed, “itself had been challenged”. Justice Mandokhail then wondered whether the CJP, who was elevated to his role after the passage of the contested amendment, would be part of the bench or not, at which Zuberi said that the chief justice himself should decide that. Justice Mandokhail noted: “The chief justice was appointed under the 26th Amendment. If the constitutional amendment had not been present, then Yahya Afridi would not have become the chief justice, as the timing was specified. “May Allah grant long life to the chief justice, the senior puisne judge (Justice Mansoor Ali Shah) was set to become the chief justice but he could not.” The 26th Amendment had discarded the seniority principle for the CJP’s appointment and set the selection criteria for the role from the top 3 senior SC judges. The petitions The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: The Balochistan High Court has ruled that prisoners convicted under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997 are not legally entitled to any form of general or special remission or pardon. The court declared that Section 21-F of the ATA explicitly excludes terrorists from eligibility for clemency or sentence reduction, leaving no room for interpretation or relaxation. A two-member bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail and Justice Najamuddin Mengal announced the verdict while hearing several constitutional petitions filed in 2023 and 2024, dismissing all of them collectively. According to the judgement, the petitioners had argued that they were entitled to the president’s pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution and to general or special remission under the Pakistan Prison Rules, 1978. However, the court held that the insertion of Section 21-F in 2001 was specifically intended to permanently exclude terrorism convicts from the scope of pardons. The bench noted that the amendment was a deliberate legislative act aimed at protecting public safety amid rising incidents of terrorism. The court emphasised that the Anti-Terrorism Act is a special law that takes precedence over general laws, including the Prisons Act of 1894. It further rejected the argument that denying remission to terrorism convicts violates Article 25 (Equality Before Law) of the Constitution, stating that terrorism convicts constitute a distinct legal class, and such classification is reasonable and constitutionally valid. Citing precedents from the Supreme Court cases of Sherwani, Government of Balochistan vs. Azizullah, and Dr Mubashir Hassan vs. Federation of Pakistan, the bench affirmed that reasonable classification is permissible under the Constitution. The court directed the Home Depar­t­ment, Inspector General of Prisons, and relevant superintendents to immediately revoke all illegal remissions granted contrary to the law and recalculate the sentences of affected inmates. It also instructed that future pardons or remissions must strictly comply with legal provisions, warning that officers violating the law would face disciplinary action.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Monday appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan after border skirmishes between the two countries over the weekend, saying he was “good at making peace”. Intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. The US president, since returning to the White House for his second term in January, had repeatedly insisted in the run up to the Nobel peace prize that he deserved the award for his role in resolving eight conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated. The US president touched on the border hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan while speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel. Tel Aviv and Hamas are set to carry out a hostage-prisoner exchange as part of the first phase of the Gaza peace plan proposed by Trump. During the interaction with the media, a reporter stated that the US president was receiving credit from Democrats and Republicans for securing the peace deal in Gaza. “Where do you think it fits into your legacy?” the reporter asked. “This will be my eighth war that I’ve solved. And I hear now there’s a war going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan. I said, ‘I’ll have to wait till I get back’. I am doing another one’. Because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace and it is an honour to do it. I save millions of lives,” he said. Commenting on the Nobel peace prize being awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, he said: “In all fairness to the Nobel committee, it was for 2024 … But there are those that say you could make an exception cause a lot of things happened during 2025 that are done and completed and great. “But I did this not for Nobel, I did this for saving lives,” he said. “Think about India-Pakistan. Think about some of the wars that were going on for years. We had one going for 31 [years], one going for 32 [years] and one going for 37 years. And I got every one of those done, for the most part, within a day. It’s pretty good,” he said. He went on to say that he had settled “a few of the wars just based on tariffs”. “With India and Pakistan, I said if you guys want to fight a war and you have nuclear weapons, I’m going to put big tariffs on you both; like a 100 per cent, a 150pc and 200pc … I had that thing settled in 24 hours. If I didn’t have tariffs you could have never settled that war,” he said. Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the May conflict between India and Pakistan. The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Additional input from AFP and Reuters",

      "summary_orig": "A DEMOCRACY activist wins the Nobel Peace Prize and the president of one of the world’s most powerful democracies begrudges her the honour. The best author would struggle to coin such a neat ending for the story of the demise of democracy. The prize, after all, implies how exceptional the fight for democratic norms has become in this century. Such a bleak reading of María Corina Machado’s victory may seem counter-intuitive given the flurry in recent months of protest activity around the world. According to the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s Global Protest Tracker, there have been more than 142 significant anti-government protests over the past 12 months affecting over 68 countries. Analysis by Allianz shows that 18 per cent of these have lasted more than three months. Peaceful protests have long been considered synonymous with healthy democracy. Research published by Harvard’s Erica Chenoweth in 2019 showed that non-violent protests are twice as likely to succeed in achieving their aims as armed conflict, and that protest movements that reached the ‘tipping point’ of engaging 3.5pc of the population always succeeded. Against this backdrop, the proliferation of protests should give us solace that civil society is alive and well, and that the routine exercise of the democratic right to peaceful protest indicates that the political system is in less jeopardy than signalled. In recent weeks alone, protests have erupted in Nepal , Madagascar, the US, UK, Italy, Israel, and, closer to home, AJK — as well as Punjab thanks to the TLP. Going by protest volume alone, one could conclude that Machado’s prize is an affirmation of good practice, rather than a callout for exceptional resilience. But as Pakistanis, we know better. Many protests in our country are feats of democratic participation, organised with integrity and courage — often against all odds — to demand justice, accountability or inclusion (consider women’s and Baloch rights marches). Sadly, some protests are part of a cynical political ploy, engineered by the powers that be and staged by proxies. They may be unleashed for various reasons: to put pressure on different institutions within our hybrid power structure; to establish the national narrative on sensitive issues; or to offer a release valve for strong emotions when realpolitik requires the state to make strategic decisions that counter public sentiment. In other words, protests are often a ploy to consolidate authoritarian control. What can be done to save protests? This knowledge nuances perceptions of the protest activity in other countries, and highlights how protests are interlinked with authoritarian tendencies as much as they are with democratic freedoms. Two trends are evident. Firstly, protests seem to erupt as a last resort, the fallback option when authoritarian approaches are so entrenched that all other political or legislative means to achieving just ends seem ineffective.

      "summary_orig": "A WAR of words broke out last week between India and Pakistan triggered by New Delhi’s belligerent statements. Threats and bellicose statements by Indian officials have continued sporadically after the four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May. But the spate of recent utterances by India’s political and military leaders struck a more ominous note and has made the already fraught environment more tense. Last week, three provocative statements from Indian officials raised the temperature between the two countries. The most egregious remarks were by the Indian army chief Upendra Dwived­i, who said Pakistan will face erasure from the world map if it doesn’t stop cross-border terrorism. He warned that India won’t show the “restraint” it did during ‘ Operation Sindoor ’. He also said India “can cross any border whenever necessary”. He asked his troops to stay in readiness as an “opportunity may come soon”. Subsequently, India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh accused Pakistan of expanding its military infrastructure in the Sir Creek sector, saying if Pakistan dared to act here “the reply will be so strong that it will change both history and geography”. Sir Creek is a 96 kilometre-long tidal estuary in the Rann of Kutch, disputed by the two neighbours. It has been the subject of inconclusive negotiations over the maritime boundary, the last such talks taking place in 2012. On Oct 5, India’s air force chief Amar Preet Singh came up with the canard that India had shot down nine to 10 Pakistani fighter jets in the May clash, including two F-16s. He reiterated the threat that the Indian air force had “the capability to strike deep inside any of the [terrorist] hideouts [in Pakistan] with absolutely accurate targeting” and could do that anytime. Pakistan pulled no punches in its reaction to these statements. A statement issued after a meeting of the top military brass, presided over by army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, vowed to give a “swift retributory response” to any “new normal” that the Indian leadership might be conjuring up. Earlier, the military’s media affairs office slammed the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic” statements from the highest echelons of the Indian security establishment and cast them as a “renewed attempt at fabricating a pretext for aggression”. The Inter-Services Public Relations statement warned any future conflict could lead to “ cataclysmic devastatio n” as Pakistan would respond without any restraint. Taking aim at the Indian army chief’s threat, it said those talking about “erasure” should know “the erasure would be mutual”. Recent Indian statements may just be empty threats but Pakistan cannot lower its guard. The questions raised by the latest round of Indian threats and escalatory rhetoric are what is driving them at this point and how seriously should they be taken. One explanation of the aggressive narrative is that it is aimed at the domestic audience, especially the ruling party’s Hindu base. Whipping up anti-Pakistan sentiment is a time-old tactic used by the BJP for electoral gain. With crucial state elections in Bihar drawing close and due early next year in West Bengal, the Narendra Modi government, under fire from the opposition for its conduct in the May conflict, is seeking to shore up its shaky position. This may be one aim, but not the only one. The Indian establishment is still smarting from Pakistan gaining the decisive upper hand in the May conflict as epitomised by the shooting down of several Indian aircraft. Thus such rhetoric might be a way to obfuscate that outcome. But it seems more than that. The reputational damage India suffered both at home and internationally has driven the motivation to avenge that loss of face. From this perspective and because Indian leaders keep hinting at another ‘round’ with Pakistan, some form of Indian incursion or aggressive action cannot be ruled out, especially as Indian leaders insist the rules of engagement and battle lines have irreversibly changed. Pakistani officials do not underestimate this possibility but believe the Indians may be deterred from embarking on another adventure by calculations such as Pakistan’s warnings of an even more muscular counter-response and changed regional and global dynamics. To be sure the international environment is far from being permissive for any Indian military action against Pakistan. Islamabad’s strengthened ties with the US, India’s strained relations with Washington, China’s unflinching diplomatic and military support for Pakistan and the P akistan-Saudi strategic mutual defence pact have reshaped the geostrategic landscape to New Delhi’s detriment. If India received virtually no international support for its military strikes on Pakistan in May, it can hardly count on it in a significantly transformed environment. But a counter-argument is that India may want to test the limits of the possible in a global environment where the use of force — hard power — has become the ‘new normal’ and thus more ‘acceptable’ than ever before. Pakistan in any case cannot afford to leave anything to chance or lower its guard. There should be no distraction from focusing on the eastern border by any military commitments it may be considering in the Middle East under President Trump’s Gaza ‘peace plan’. The country’s own security should take precedence over deploying military assets elsewhere, which in any case exposes Pakistan to other risks. Beyond official Indian statements, it is instructive to read comments in the Indian media by foreign policy experts and former diplomats as they reveal deep concerns and worry about India’s international isolation and loss of diplomatic initiative to Pakistan. An analysis by India Today saw Pakistan “redrawing its strategic playbook”, forging new alliances and carrying out a recalibration that underscored a shifting regional order. This had important implications for India and would test its resolve. Others fret over ‘Trump’s tilt to Pakistan’, with some construing this as a pressure tactic against India. Troubled by the loss of ally Bangladesh, some analysts have warned of an “alignment of adversarial powers around India”. The opposition Congress party has repeatedly said India is diplomatically isolated, decried the government for fraught Indo-US relations and for the loss of global influence. Domestic pressure on the Indian government could compel it to act recklessly. But conversely, the uncertain outcome of military action against Pakistan could urge caution. In any event Pakistan must stay on high alert and be ready for all eventualities. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN. Published in Dawn, October 13th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "TENSIONS that had been brewing for some time between Pakistan and Afghanistan exploded into open conflict when the Afghan Taliban regime launched attacks against this country late on Saturday, and Pakistan responded by repulsing the aggression. The number of attacks carried out by TTP terrorists inside Pakistan had been growing in frequency and lethality, with a high number of security men martyred over the last few weeks. On Thursday, there had been reports of attacks inside Afghanistan, including the apparent targeting of the TTP chief in Kabul. The Afghan regime issued a vague statement about the attack, making no mention of casualties, while Pakistan neither confirmed nor denied the operation, with both civil and military officials only saying Afghanistan needed to stop harbouring TTP terrorists. It is in the backdrop of these events that the Kabul regime launched attacks against Pakistan. The military says that 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” had been killed, while 23 troops had been martyred. The hostilities have ceased for the time being. As per the Afghan Taliban foreign minister, the Kabul regime paused the fighting after “our friends, Qatar and Saudi Arabia” expressed the need to de-escalate. Iran, which shares a border with both states, also offered its good offices to the “two neighbouring and Muslim countries” to bring down tensions. Pakistan, after showing it is capable of defending itself and repelling aggression, should prevent the matter from spiralling further. Though there have been low-level skirmishes in the past, this is the biggest flare-up in recent years. Pakistan must also be wary of the fact that India and the Afghan Taliban — once sworn enemies — have suddenly experienced a warming of ties, with the Afghan foreign minister receiving a cordial reception in New Delhi recently. Therefore, it would not be in this country’s interest to let ties with Kabul — however fraught — deteriorate further. At the heart of the matter is Pakistan’s legitimate grievance that Afghanistan hosts bloodthirsty terrorists inimical to this country. In fact, it is accepted by the international community that Kabul provides safe haven to not only the TTP, but other terrorist groups as well, such as Al Qaeda, ETIM, etc. If these groups keep launching attacks inside this country, Pakistan must react. But while kinetic cross-border action has to be taken when faced with foreign aggression, this is not a long-term solution, as it risks sparking a full-fledged war with the Kabul regime. Pakistan has shown that it can very much defend itself on the battlefield. Now the focus must shift to addressing the issue of terrorism through diplomacy. This can be done by working with Muslim states that have helped de-escalate matters, as well as engaging regional allies such as China, which have influence with Kabul.

In fact, it is accepted by the international community that Kabul provides safe haven to not only the TTP, but other terrorist groups as well, such as Al Qaeda, ETIM, etc. If these groups keep launching attacks inside this country, Pakistan must react. But while kinetic cross-border action has to be taken when faced with foreign aggression, this is not a long-term solution, as it risks sparking a full-fledged war with the Kabul regime. Pakistan has shown that it can very much defend itself on the battlefield. Now the focus must shift to addressing the issue of terrorism through diplomacy. This can be done by working with Muslim states that have helped de-escalate matters, as well as engaging regional allies such as China, which have influence with Kabul.

      "summary": "TENSIONS that had been brewing for some time between Pakistan and Afghanistan exploded into open conflict when the Afghan Taliban regime launched attacks against this country late on Saturday, and Pakistan responded by repulsing the aggression. The number of attacks carried out by TTP terrorists inside Pakistan had been growing in frequency and lethality, with a high number of security men martyred over the last few weeks. On Thursday, there had been reports of attacks inside Afghanistan, including the apparent targeting of the TTP chief in Kabul. The Afghan regime issued a vague statement about the attack, making no mention of casualties, while Pakistan neither confirmed nor denied the operation, with both civil and military officials only saying Afghanistan needed to stop harbouring TTP terrorists. It is in the backdrop of these events that the Kabul regime launched attacks against Pakistan. The military says that 200 “Taliban and affiliated terrorists” had been killed, while 23 troops had been martyred. The hostilities have ceased for the time being. As per the Afghan Taliban foreign minister, the Kabul regime paused the fighting after “our friends, Qatar and Saudi Arabia” expressed the need to de-escalate. Iran, which shares a border with both states, also offered its good offices to the “two neighbouring and Muslim countries” to bring down tensions. Pakistan, after showing it is capable of defending itself and repelling aggression, should prevent the matter from spiralling further. Though there have been low-level skirmishes in the past, this is the biggest flare-up in recent years. Pakistan must also be wary of the fact that India and the Afghan Taliban — once sworn enemies — have suddenly experienced a warming of ties, with the Afghan foreign minister receiving a cordial reception in New Delhi recently. Therefore, it would not be in this country’s interest to let ties with Kabul — however fraught — deteriorate further. At the heart of the matter is Pakistan’s legitimate grievance that Afghanistan hosts bloodthirsty terrorists inimical to this country. In fact, it is accepted by the international community that Kabul provides safe haven to not only the TTP, but other terrorist groups as well, such as Al Qaeda, ETIM, etc. If these groups keep launching attacks inside this country, Pakistan must react. But while kinetic cross-border action has to be taken when faced with foreign aggression, this is not a long-term solution, as it risks sparking a full-fledged war with the Kabul regime.

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday warned that any further acts of aggression from Afghanistan would be met with an “unwavering and befitting response”. This statement comes in the wake of intense border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. After the incident, an FO statement said: “Pakistan greatly values dialogue and diplomacy and a mutually beneficial relationship with Afghanistan. “At the same time, the Government of Pakistan continues to closely monitor the situation and would take all possible measures to safeguard its territory and the lives of its people. Any further provocations would be met with an unwavering and befitting response.” The FO expressed concern about the “unwarranted aggression by the Afghan Taliban, Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan ”, which it said would destabilise neighbourly relations between the two nations. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. Referring to Saturday night’s border clashes, the FO said: “Pakistan, exercising its right of self-defence, not only effectively repulsed the assaults all along the border, but also inflicted heavy losses on Taliban forces and affiliated kharjis , in terms of men, material and infrastructure.” It added that the said infrastructure was used to “plan and facilitate” acts of terror. The FO also strongly rejected “assertions and insinuations” by Acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to divert attention from the presence of terrorists in Afghanistan. Muttaqi is currently on a visit to India, where he said in recent a speech that there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan and Pakistan’s problems needed to be resolved internally. “By making these baseless assertions, the Taliban regime cannot absolve itself of its responsibilities towards regional peace and stability,” the FO statement said. “[The] continued presence of terrorist elements on Afghan soil and the freedom of activities enjoyed by them in Afghanistan are well documented in UN Monitoring Team reports.” Noting that the fight against terrorism was a “common cause”, the FO urged Kabul to honour its commitment of barring the use of its territory for terrorism against other countries and to play its role in achieving peace and stability in the region, rather than shifting the blame. “Pakistan has repeatedly shared its concerns related to the presence of Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan operating from the Afghan soil,” the FO stated. “Pakistan expects concrete and verifiable actions against these terrorist elements by the Taliban regime.” “Pakistan is desirous of a peaceful, stable, friendly, inclusive, regionally connected, and prosperous Afghanistan. Pakistan expects the Taliban regime to act responsibly, honour its commitments, and play a constructive role in achieving the shared objective of rooting out terrorism from its soil,” the statement concluded. Afghan refugees The FO also noted Pakistan’s hosting of four million Afghan refugees as a gesture of “good neighbourliness, Islamic brotherhood and humanity” and added that it would “take all actions to regulate the presence of Afghan nationals on its territory, in accordance with international norms and laws”. Earlier, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reacted to the border clashes, saying that “Afghan refugees living in our country for 50 years would now have to return to their homeland”. The Pak-Afghan border should be like other borders around the world, which no one should be able to cross at their will, he added.",

      "summary_orig": "FOR almost seven hours, Pakistan pounded targets inside Afghanistan along the entire stretch of the border, from Arandu in Chitral to Angoor Adda in South Waziristan. The fighting ensued after the Afghan Taliban, around 9pm, targeted the Pakistani position along the Gavi border belt in Kurram. The apparent provocation for this cross-border aggression was a drone strike by Pakistan on a militant hideout in which 27 terrorists were killed inside the Pakistani territory. What began in the north soon expanded to the rest of the border, as Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts from Kunar, Nangarhar, and Nuristan provinces. Tirah Valley also came under attack after mortar shells fired by the Afghan Taliban landed in a village, leaving a civilian dead and a child injured. Before midnight, both sides had entered fierce clashes and Pakistani forces had begun to conduct decisive artillery and air force strikes to take out the hostile positions along the border, forcing the Taliban fighters to retreat. Besides heavy artillery, PAF jets pounded multiple Afghan posts and militant positions, said sources who closely monitored the hours-long overnight battle. How it all started from a drone strike on a hideout of terrorists According to sources, air raids by Pakistan targeted hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika. The jets with their precision strikes destroyed the 2nd Kandak headquarters and strongholds of Aziz, Rawat, and Naka among others. “By midnight, 11 Afghan posts were neutralised and 27 hostile targets were destroyed, with heavy explosions heard deep inside the Afghan territory,” they said. As PAF jets thundered in the Afghan airspace taking out the Taliban border posts and terrorist positions, the Taliban forces reached out to Pakistan for a ceasefire — a request turned down by Pakistan and military operations continued late into the early hours of Sunday. From 2am to 4am, the artillery with the PAF continued to pound Afghan positions, reportedly destroying the enemy sites at Barbcha, Ali Dost, Malgai Koh, Turkmanzai Top, and Kharachar Fort. This onslaught forced the Afghan forces to withdraw from several forward posts after they suffered major losses. Attacks along border In Lower Dir, Pakistani security forces gave a strong response to the Afghan forces at the Shahi Binshahi Border, repulsing attacks and forcing the Taliban forces to retreat. In Lower South Waziristan, several villages along the border came under Afghan fire — a move that prompted retaliation by the forces, which inflicted significant human and material losses on the Afghan side. Sources added that during the retaliatory operation, one Afghan post was captured, and the Pakistani flag was subsequently hoisted at the captured position. Amid these clashes, there were multiple infiltration attempts soon after midnight when the Taliban tried to infiltrate from Sra Kwand in Angoor Adda area of South Waziristan, said sources. This was, however, foiled. After hours of bombing and gunfire, the situation returned to normalcy around 4am. “The situation remains tense but under control on Pakistan’s side as PAF jets and artillery units remain on high alert as cross-border fire reportedly subsided after 04:00 hours, but heightened vigilance continued along the western frontier,” sources said. As Pakistan and Afghanistan traded fire, the authorities immediately closed the Angoor Adda border, resulting in a complete suspension of bilateral trade activities. The sudden closure left dozens of trucks stranded on both sides of the border. It may be mentioned here that Angoor Adda border had reopened only ten days ago after a closure of two years. In Khyber, the Torkhum border crossing was also closed. However, the situation at this crossing remained peaceful. Residents at the Bacha Maina residential compound told Dawn that some of the families moved to Landi Kotal after the border security forces ordered the closure of the border at midnight. In North Waziristan, the Ghulam Khan border was closed following an exchange of fire between Pakistani and Afghan forces in different areas along the border. In Kurram, an emergency was declared in all hospitals and the Kharlachi border crossing with Afghanistan was closed. Tribal fighters in the district reportedly moved to assist security forces on the frontline amid continuous artillery duels near Kharlachi and Manujaba Forts.

      "summary_orig": "Twenty-three Pakistani troops have been martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Sunday. The statement comes after overnight skirmishes between the two sides, which began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. Key developments ISPR says 23 security personnel have been martyred and 29 injured More than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, says military’s media wing 21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps were rendered inoperative, according to ISPR PM Shehbaz vows ‘every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response’ Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran call for restraint after clashes broke out last night “During overnight skirmishes, 23 brave sons of Pakistan embraced shahadat (martyrdom) while defending the territorial integrity of our beloved country against this outrageous action, while 29 soldiers [were] injured. “According to credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment, more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher,” the ISPR statement said. Afghanistan claims it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. In response to Islamabad’s repeated calls to bar terrorists from using its territory for cross-border attacks, Afghanistan denies the allegation of allowing terrorist outfits to use it soil. But, the ISPR statement today said Afghanistan’s “cowardly action” of the overnight attack, which included fire and a few physical raids, was aimed at destabilising the border areas to “facilitate terrorism, furthering the nefarious designs of the terrorists”. According to a late-night report by state-run Radio Pakistan , which cited security sources, “Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations”, Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Bahram Chah in Balochistan along the Pak-Afghan border. “Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces and affiliated khwarij ,” the ISPR said. “Precision fires and strikes, as well as physical raids, were directed against Taliban camps and posts, terrorist training facilities and support networks operating from [the] Afghan territory, including elements linked to Fitna-al-Khawarij , Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh. “All possible measures were taken to avoid collateral damage and to protect civilian lives.” The ISPR said that as a result of the unrelenting operations, multiple Taliban locations were destroyed along the border. Providing further details, it said 21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps, used to plan and facilitate attacks against Pakistan, were rendered inoperative. “The infra-structural damages to Taliban posts, camps, headquarters and support networks of terrorists are extensive, all along the border and range from tactical to operational depth.”. The ISPR further said: “The armed forces of Pakistan remain ever ready to protect the territorial integrity, life and property of the people of Pakistan. Our resolve to defend Pakistan’s territorial integrity and to defeat those who threaten our security is unwavering.” It underlined that while the people of Pakistan preferred constructive diplomacy and dialogue over violence and belligerence, “we will not tolerate the treacherous use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan”. “We have noted with concern that this serious provocation has occurred during the visit of the [Afghan] Taliban foreign minister to India, the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the region. “In the interest of regional peace and security, we call upon the Taliban government to take immediate and verifiable actions to neutralise the terrorist groups, inter alia, Fitna-al-Khawarij , Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh operating from their territory.” Otherwise, it asserted, Pakistan will continue to exercise its right to defend its people by persistently neutralising terror targets. It said that the Taliban government should “shun any ill-begotten notions and prioritise well-being, peace, prosperity and development of the Afghan people over irresponsible sabre-rattling”. The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Last night’s episode vindicates Pakistan’s long-standing position that the Taliban government is actively facilitating the terrorists. “If the Taliban government continues to sponsor terrorist outfits, in cohorts with India, for the shortsighted objective of destabilising the region, the people and the state of Pakistan will not rest until the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.” Afghan posts targeted by army Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported details of the Afghan posts targeted by the Pakistan Army. The sources said the army had launched “successful strikes at Durrani Camp, Manojba Camp Battalion Headquarters and Manojba Camp-2, Ghaznali Headquarters in Noshki Sector and neutralised them completely”. “Dozens of Taliban soldiers and Khwarij positioned in the camps and headquarters have been reportedly killed,” the report added. Security sources said that the army had also devastated the Afghan Taliban’s “most important Asmatullah Karar Camp” at Spin Boldak . They noted that the camp was the Taliban’s “one of the biggest” from where terrorist activities against Pakistan were carried out. Afghan Taliban and Khawarij hiding in the camp reportedly suffered “heavy losses”. Meanwhile, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan shared footage of a “second engagement and destruction” of the Asmatullah Karar camp at Spin Boldak. The second Battalion Headquarters of the Afghan Taliban in the Brabcha area, from “where Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists were launched into Pakistan”, was also targeted, as per the sources. In a series of posts on X, PTV News said Afghanistan’s Barikot base camp, Manojba Camp-3 , Karzai post, and Shapola Khula Taliban post were also destroyed. According to Radio Pakistan , security forces also occupied an “important” Afghan post in the Zhob sector and hoisted the Pakistani flag. “Humvee-armoured personnel carrier of the Afghan Taliban deployed at the post was destroyed as well in the attack,” the report said. Targeting an Afghan Tank position at the mountain peaks opposite Kurram, the forces eliminated “several tanks of the Afghan Taliban”, the state media reported, citing security sources. In an earlier Radio Pakistan report, security sources said Afghanistan’s Jandusar Post, Turkmenzai camp and Kharchar Fort had also been “completely destroyed”. On the other hand, Pakistan’s posts also came under attack in the Baramcha area of Chagai district, which borders Afghanistan’s Helmand province. “Afghan forces opened indiscriminate fire at Pakistani border posts with heavy weapons late on Saturday night,” a senior official said. Security sources stated that Afghan forces also tried to infiltrate into Pishin and Zhob districts. However, the attempts were defeated by Pakistani forces in the area. Afghan govt urges Pakistan to ‘desist from using force’ Following the border fighting, Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid urged Pakistan to “desist from using force as such actions will have negative consequences”. Addressing a press conference in Kabul, Mujahid alleged that “certain elements within the Pakistani security establishment want to destabilise Afghanistan”. He further warned that Kabul “possessed weapons to respond”, adding that the Afghanistan Islamic Emirate had made “efforts to resolve issues with Pakistan”. Earlier, the Afghan military said in a statement that “in retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces”, Taliban border forces in the east are “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas”. Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand — all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan — had confirmed the clashes. The Afghan Ministry of Defence also confirmed earlier that Afghan forces had launched “retaliatory operations against Pakistani security forces” tonight. “The operations ended at midnight. If the opposing side violates Afghanistan’s territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly,” said the statement. Kabul said on Sunday that it had halted attacks at the request of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Reuters reported. Separately, it was reported that the Torkham border crossing had been closed for all kinds of traffic after the overnight firing exchanges at various locations, according to locals on the Pakistani side. Afghan official Qureshi Badloon also confirmed the closure to Dawn.com from Nangarhar. Separately, Reuters , citing local officials, reported that two main border crossings with Afghanistan, at Torkham and Chaman, and at least three minor crossings, at Kharlachi, Angoor Adda and Ghulam Khan, were closed on Sunday. ‘No compromise on Pakistan’s sovereignty’ Earlier in the day, as reports with details of the skirmishes continued to emerge, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted there would be “no compromise” on Pakistan’s sovereignty. President Zardari, in a statement, noted that there were United Nations reports that “proved” terrorist attacks were carried out from the Afghan soil. However, he also stressed that bilateral respect and joint counter-terrorism efforts were the key to long-term regional peace. Asserting that no compromise will be made on Pakistan’s sovereignty, President Zardari said the country remained “firmly committed to safeguarding its national interests, regional sovereignty and security”. He noted that attacks launched “from the territory of the Interim Afghan government by India-backed Khawarij terrorists are a well-documented reality confirmed in successive United Nations Security Council (UNSC) monitoring reports”. The president pointed out that Pakistan had repeatedly “ made it clear that its civilians and security personnel are being targeted through the nexus of the Indian sponsored Khawarij and other terror groups”. President Zardari urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete and verifiable action” against anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from the Afghan soil, the statement added. He termed the menace of terrorism “sponsored by India” as the “greatest threat to regional peace and stability”. “Terrorism is a shared challenge and its burden cannot be placed on any single country,” the president was quoted as saying. In his statement, President Zardari termed it unfortunate that the current Afghan interim administration had “turned away from the just struggle of the oppressed people” of India-occupied Kashmir , “thereby doing injustice to both history and the Muslim ummah”. He reaffirmed that Pakistan will “never accept any disputed or misleading position on Jammu and Kashmir” and reiterated that India’s “unlawful claims over the territory” are contrary to international law and UNSC resolutions. The president highlighted Pakistan’s hosting of millions of Afghan refugees for over decades, saying it “demonstrated Islamic fraternity and exemplary neighbourliness”. However, he added that the “dignified repatriation of Afghan citizens” was in the interest of both countries and essential for sustainable peace. “President Zardari reaffirmed that Pakistan will continue to support the educational and humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, but no compromise will ever be made on Pakistan’s national sovereignty,” the statement said. The president emphasised that Pakistan had extended “every possible facilitation to Afghanistan in trade, economic connectivity, and people-to-people exchanges”. Mutual cooperation and economic partnership are the foundation for lasting peace and regional prosperity, he noted. President Zardari underscored that Pakistan desires a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan. He said brotherly relations must be based on mutual respect, security cooperation and a shared commitment to regional peace. He expressed hope that the interim Afghan government will prevent its soil from being used by “Khawarij and India-backed terrorist elements against Pakistan”, stressing that only joint and practical measures can guarantee enduring peace in the region. PM Shehbaz, too, strongly condemned the “provocation by Afghanistan in Pakistan’s border areas”. “There will be no compromise on Pakistan’s defence, and every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response,“ he asserted. “We are proud of the professional excellence of our armed forces,” the premier said, hailing the army’s “strong and effective response to Afghanistan’s aggression”. “The Pakistan Army not only gave a powerful response to Afghan aggression under the bold leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat,” the prime minister said. “Our defence is in strong hands, and we know well how to defend every inch of our motherland,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the army has always given a “crushing response to every form of external aggression”. The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had “repeatedly provided Afghanistan with information regarding terrorist elements such as Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan , who are using Afghan soil to launch attacks against Pakistan”. “Terrorist organisations are being supported by certain elements within Afghanistan,” he stated, expressing hope that the Afghan interim government will ensure its territory is not used by terrorist elements against Pakistan. In one of the first official statements by Pakistan, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi lauded the security forces for their “prompt” response. “Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,” Naqvi said on X. “Pakistan’s forces are alert and Afghanistan is being answered with stones for bricks. The people of Pakistan stand with the brave armed forces like a lead wall. Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India.” Expressing his “deep concern” over the attack from the Afghan side, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said “unprovoked firing and raids along Pak-Afghan border by the Taliban government is a serious provocation”. “Pakistan’s befitting response and strikes are against Taliban infrastructure and to neutralise Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil,” he asserted in a post on X. “Our defensive response is not targeted towards peace-loving Afghan civilian population. Unlike Taliban forces, we are exercising extreme caution in our defensive responses to avoid loss of civilian lives,” Dar added. He expressed Pakistan’s expectation from the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures against terrorist elements and their perpetrators that wish to derail Pak-Afghan relations”. “Pakistan will take all possible measures to defend its own territory, sovereignty and its people,” the deputy premier pledged. Former foreign minister and PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also called upon Afghan authorities to “act with restraint and responsibility in the interest of regional peace”. “Unprovoked aggression by Afghan forces along our border poses a serious threat to regional peace and stability, while undermining collective efforts toward shared prosperity,” he said in a statement. Bilawal said Pakistan’s armed forces had responded with resolve, restraint, and professionalism, reflecting Pakistan’s enduring commitment to peace and stability while safeguarding every inch of national territory and protecting civilian lives. He further urged the Taliban authorities in Kabul to take concrete and verifiable action against terrorist outfits operating from Afghan soil, warning that such groups threaten not only Pakistan but also the security and future of the entire region. “Pakistan desires a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan. We urge the Taliban leadership to engage in practical, result-oriented dialogue and cooperation to secure enduring peace and stability in our shared neighborhood,” he said. Bilawal expressed hope that the interim Afghan government would ensure that Afghan soil was not used against Pakistan and that both countries would work together in the spirit of mutual respect to promote peace, stability, and prosperity across the region and beyond. Calls for restraint After the border clashes were reported, multiple countries urged Pakistan and Afghanistan to exercise restraint. Saudi Arabia, with which Pakistan recently signed a mutual defence deal , expressed concern at the skirmishes. “The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region. “The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples.” Iranian top diplomat Abbas Araghchi called on Afghanistan and Pakistan “to exercise restraint” amid ongoing clashes. “Our position is that both sides must exercise restraint,” Araghchi said during a live interview with state television, adding that “stability” between the countries “contributes to regional stability”. Qatar’s foreign ministry urged both sides to prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint, and to work towards containing differences in a manner that helps to reduce tension and avoid escalation, in order to achieve regional security and stability. The foreign ministry reiterated Qatar’s support for all regional and international efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security, and affirmed its commitment to ensuring security and prosperity for the people of the two countries. Events preceding the border clashes The border clashes come against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. An instance of Pakistan asserting its position was when Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly,\n“Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out.” While Kabul maintains that it does not provide safe havens to terrorists, Afghan officials blamed Pakistan on Friday of bombing a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line and also violating the territory of capital Kabul. This was after an explosion was reported in Afghanistan on Thursday. The Foreign Office in Islamabad avoided directly acknowledging the incident in Kabul during a weekly briefing on Friday, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the ISPR director general also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out any strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who was on a visit to India when the border clashes began, had condemned Thursday’s incident and Pakistan’s alleged role in it during a press conference in New Delhi. It was India’s — with which Pakistan’s ties have historically been tense — first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. On Friday, New Delhi also announced that it would be reopening its embassy in Kabul after four years. These developments followed a four-day military escalation between Pakistan and India in May — one of the deadliest in recent years — which led to a new low in relations between the two countries.

      "summary_en": "Twenty-three Pakistani troops have been martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Sunday. The statement comes after overnight skirmishes between the two sides, which began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. Key developments ISPR says 23 security personnel have been martyred and 29 injured More than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, says military’s media wing 21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps were rendered inoperative, according to ISPR PM Shehbaz vows ‘every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response’ Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran call for restraint after clashes broke out last night “During overnight skirmishes, 23 brave sons of Pakistan embraced shahadat (martyrdom) while defending the territorial integrity of our beloved country against this outrageous action, while 29 soldiers [were] injured. “According to credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment, more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher,” the ISPR statement said. Afghanistan claims it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. In response to Islamabad’s repeated calls to bar terrorists from using its territory for cross-border attacks, Afghanistan denies the allegation of allowing terrorist outfits to use it soil. But, the ISPR statement today said Afghanistan’s “cowardly action” of the overnight attack, which included fire and a few physical raids, was aimed at destabilising the border areas to “facilitate terrorism, furthering the nefarious designs of the terrorists”. According to a late-night report by state-run Radio Pakistan , which cited security sources, “Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations”, Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Bahram Chah in Balochistan along the Pak-Afghan border. “Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces and affiliated khwarij ,” the ISPR said. “Precision fires and strikes, as well as physical raids, were directed against Taliban camps and posts, terrorist training facilities and support networks operating from [the] Afghan territory, including elements linked to Fitna-al-Khawarij , Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh. “All possible measures were taken to avoid collateral damage and to protect civilian lives.” The ISPR said that as a result of the unrelenting operations, multiple Taliban locations were destroyed along the border.

These developments followed a four-day military escalation between Pakistan and India in May — one of the deadliest in recent years — which led to a new low in relations between the two countries.

      "title": "23 troops martyred, 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed in border skirmishes with Afghanistan: ISPR",
      "summary": "Twenty-three Pakistani troops have been martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Sunday. The statement comes after overnight skirmishes between the two sides, which began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. Key developments ISPR says 23 security personnel have been martyred and 29 injured More than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, says military’s media wing 21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps were rendered inoperative, according to ISPR PM Shehbaz vows ‘every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response’ Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran call for restraint after clashes broke out last night “During overnight skirmishes, 23 brave sons of Pakistan embraced shahadat (martyrdom) while defending the territorial integrity of our beloved country against this outrageous action, while 29 soldiers [were] injured. “According to credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment, more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher,” the ISPR statement said. Afghanistan claims it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. In response to Islamabad’s repeated calls to bar terrorists from using its territory for cross-border attacks, Afghanistan denies the allegation of allowing terrorist outfits to use it soil. But, the ISPR statement today said Afghanistan’s “cowardly action” of the overnight attack, which included fire and a few physical raids, was aimed at destabilising the border areas to “facilitate terrorism, furthering the nefarious designs of the terrorists”. According to a late-night report by state-run Radio Pakistan , which cited security sources, “Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations”, Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Bahram Chah in Balochistan along the Pak-Afghan border. “Exercising the right of self-defence, the alert armed forces of Pakistan repelled the assault decisively all along the border and inflicted heavy casualties on Taliban forces and affiliated khwarij ,” the ISPR said. “Precision fires and strikes, as well as physical raids, were directed against Taliban camps and posts, terrorist training facilities and support networks operating from [the] Afghan territory, including elements linked to Fitna-al-Khawarij , Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh. “All possible measures were taken to avoid collateral damage and to protect civilian lives.” The ISPR said that as a result of the unrelenting operations, multiple Taliban locations were destroyed along the border. Providing further details, it said 21 hostile positions on the Afghan side of the border were also briefly physically captured and multiple terrorist training camps, used to plan and facilitate attacks against Pakistan, were rendered inoperative. “The infra-structural damages to Taliban posts, camps, headquarters and support networks of terrorists are extensive, all along the border and range from tactical to operational depth.”. The ISPR further said: “The armed forces of Pakistan remain ever ready to protect the territorial integrity, life and property of the people of Pakistan. Our resolve to defend Pakistan’s territorial integrity and to defeat those who threaten our security is unwavering.” It underlined that while the people of Pakistan preferred constructive diplomacy and dialogue over violence and belligerence, “we will not tolerate the treacherous use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan”. “We have noted with concern that this serious provocation has occurred during the visit of the [Afghan] Taliban foreign minister to India, the biggest sponsor of terrorism in the region. “In the interest of regional peace and security, we call upon the Taliban government to take immediate and verifiable actions to neutralise the terrorist groups, inter alia, Fitna-al-Khawarij , Fitna-al-Hindustan and ISKP/ Daesh operating from their territory.” Otherwise, it asserted, Pakistan will continue to exercise its right to defend its people by persistently neutralising terror targets. It said that the Taliban government should “shun any ill-begotten notions and prioritise well-being, peace, prosperity and development of the Afghan people over irresponsible sabre-rattling”. The ISPR concluded its statement, saying: “Last night’s episode vindicates Pakistan’s long-standing position that the Taliban government is actively facilitating the terrorists. “If the Taliban government continues to sponsor terrorist outfits, in cohorts with India, for the shortsighted objective of destabilising the region, the people and the state of Pakistan will not rest until the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is completely eliminated.” Afghan posts targeted by army Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported details of the Afghan posts targeted by the Pakistan Army. The sources said the army had launched “successful strikes at Durrani Camp, Manojba Camp Battalion Headquarters and Manojba Camp-2, Ghaznali Headquarters in Noshki Sector and neutralised them completely”. “Dozens of Taliban soldiers and Khwarij positioned in the camps and headquarters have been reportedly killed,” the report added. Security sources said that the army had also devastated the Afghan Taliban’s “most important Asmatullah Karar Camp” at Spin Boldak . They noted that the camp was the Taliban’s “one of the biggest” from where terrorist activities against Pakistan were carried out. Afghan Taliban and Khawarij hiding in the camp reportedly suffered “heavy losses”. Meanwhile, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan shared footage of a “second engagement and destruction” of the Asmatullah Karar camp at Spin Boldak. The second Battalion Headquarters of the Afghan Taliban in the Brabcha area, from “where Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists were launched into Pakistan”, was also targeted, as per the sources. In a series of posts on X, PTV News said Afghanistan’s Barikot base camp, Manojba Camp-3 , Karzai post, and Shapola Khula Taliban post were also destroyed. According to Radio Pakistan , security forces also occupied an “important” Afghan post in the Zhob sector and hoisted the Pakistani flag. “Humvee-armoured personnel carrier of the Afghan Taliban deployed at the post was destroyed as well in the attack,” the report said. Targeting an Afghan Tank position at the mountain peaks opposite Kurram, the forces eliminated “several tanks of the Afghan Taliban”, the state media reported, citing security sources. In an earlier Radio Pakistan report, security sources said Afghanistan’s Jandusar Post, Turkmenzai camp and Kharchar Fort had also been “completely destroyed”. On the other hand, Pakistan’s posts also came under attack in the Baramcha area of Chagai district, which borders Afghanistan’s Helmand province. “Afghan forces opened indiscriminate fire at Pakistani border posts with heavy weapons late on Saturday night,” a senior official said. Security sources stated that Afghan forces also tried to infiltrate into Pishin and Zhob districts. However, the attempts were defeated by Pakistani forces in the area. Afghan govt urges Pakistan to ‘desist from using force’ Following the border fighting, Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid urged Pakistan to “desist from using force as such actions will have negative consequences”. Addressing a press conference in Kabul, Mujahid alleged that “certain elements within the Pakistani security establishment want to destabilise Afghanistan”. He further warned that Kabul “possessed weapons to respond”, adding that the Afghanistan Islamic Emirate had made “efforts to resolve issues with Pakistan”. Earlier, the Afghan military said in a statement that “in retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces”, Taliban border forces in the east are “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas”. Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand — all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan — had confirmed the clashes. The Afghan Ministry of Defence also confirmed earlier that Afghan forces had launched “retaliatory operations against Pakistani security forces” tonight. “The operations ended at midnight. If the opposing side violates Afghanistan’s territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly,” said the statement. Kabul said on Sunday that it had halted attacks at the request of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Reuters reported. Separately, it was reported that the Torkham border crossing had been closed for all kinds of traffic after the overnight firing exchanges at various locations, according to locals on the Pakistani side. Afghan official Qureshi Badloon also confirmed the closure to Dawn.com from Nangarhar. Separately, Reuters , citing local officials, reported that two main border crossings with Afghanistan, at Torkham and Chaman, and at least three minor crossings, at Kharlachi, Angoor Adda and Ghulam Khan, were closed on Sunday. ‘No compromise on Pakistan’s sovereignty’ Earlier in the day, as reports with details of the skirmishes continued to emerge, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asserted there would be “no compromise” on Pakistan’s sovereignty. President Zardari, in a statement, noted that there were United Nations reports that “proved” terrorist attacks were carried out from the Afghan soil. However, he also stressed that bilateral respect and joint counter-terrorism efforts were the key to long-term regional peace. Asserting that no compromise will be made on Pakistan’s sovereignty, President Zardari said the country remained “firmly committed to safeguarding its national interests, regional sovereignty and security”. He noted that attacks launched “from the territory of the Interim Afghan government by India-backed Khawarij terrorists are a well-documented reality confirmed in successive United Nations Security Council (UNSC) monitoring reports”. The president pointed out that Pakistan had repeatedly “ made it clear that its civilians and security personnel are being targeted through the nexus of the Indian sponsored Khawarij and other terror groups”. President Zardari urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete and verifiable action” against anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from the Afghan soil, the statement added. He termed the menace of terrorism “sponsored by India” as the “greatest threat to regional peace and stability”. “Terrorism is a shared challenge and its burden cannot be placed on any single country,” the president was quoted as saying. In his statement, President Zardari termed it unfortunate that the current Afghan interim administration had “turned away from the just struggle of the oppressed people” of India-occupied Kashmir , “thereby doing injustice to both history and the Muslim ummah”. He reaffirmed that Pakistan will “never accept any disputed or misleading position on Jammu and Kashmir” and reiterated that India’s “unlawful claims over the territory” are contrary to international law and UNSC resolutions. The president highlighted Pakistan’s hosting of millions of Afghan refugees for over decades, saying it “demonstrated Islamic fraternity and exemplary neighbourliness”. However, he added that the “dignified repatriation of Afghan citizens” was in the interest of both countries and essential for sustainable peace. “President Zardari reaffirmed that Pakistan will continue to support the educational and humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, but no compromise will ever be made on Pakistan’s national sovereignty,” the statement said. The president emphasised that Pakistan had extended “every possible facilitation to Afghanistan in trade, economic connectivity, and people-to-people exchanges”. Mutual cooperation and economic partnership are the foundation for lasting peace and regional prosperity, he noted. President Zardari underscored that Pakistan desires a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan. He said brotherly relations must be based on mutual respect, security cooperation and a shared commitment to regional peace. He expressed hope that the interim Afghan government will prevent its soil from being used by “Khawarij and India-backed terrorist elements against Pakistan”, stressing that only joint and practical measures can guarantee enduring peace in the region. PM Shehbaz, too, strongly condemned the “provocation by Afghanistan in Pakistan’s border areas”. “There will be no compromise on Pakistan’s defence, and every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response,“ he asserted. “We are proud of the professional excellence of our armed forces,” the premier said, hailing the army’s “strong and effective response to Afghanistan’s aggression”. “The Pakistan Army not only gave a powerful response to Afghan aggression under the bold leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat,” the prime minister said. “Our defence is in strong hands, and we know well how to defend every inch of our motherland,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the army has always given a “crushing response to every form of external aggression”. The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had “repeatedly provided Afghanistan with information regarding terrorist elements such as Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan , who are using Afghan soil to launch attacks against Pakistan”. “Terrorist organisations are being supported by certain elements within Afghanistan,” he stated, expressing hope that the Afghan interim government will ensure its territory is not used by terrorist elements against Pakistan. In one of the first official statements by Pakistan, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi lauded the security forces for their “prompt” response. “Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,” Naqvi said on X. “Pakistan’s forces are alert and Afghanistan is being answered with stones for bricks. The people of Pakistan stand with the brave armed forces like a lead wall. Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India.” Expressing his “deep concern” over the attack from the Afghan side, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said “unprovoked firing and raids along Pak-Afghan border by the Taliban government is a serious provocation”. “Pakistan’s befitting response and strikes are against Taliban infrastructure and to neutralise Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil,” he asserted in a post on X. “Our defensive response is not targeted towards peace-loving Afghan civilian population. Unlike Taliban forces, we are exercising extreme caution in our defensive responses to avoid loss of civilian lives,” Dar added. He expressed Pakistan’s expectation from the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures against terrorist elements and their perpetrators that wish to derail Pak-Afghan relations”. “Pakistan will take all possible measures to defend its own territory, sovereignty and its people,” the deputy premier pledged. Former foreign minister and PPP chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also called upon Afghan authorities to “act with restraint and responsibility in the interest of regional peace”. “Unprovoked aggression by Afghan forces along our border poses a serious threat to regional peace and stability, while undermining collective efforts toward shared prosperity,” he said in a statement. Bilawal said Pakistan’s armed forces had responded with resolve, restraint, and professionalism, reflecting Pakistan’s enduring commitment to peace and stability while safeguarding every inch of national territory and protecting civilian lives. He further urged the Taliban authorities in Kabul to take concrete and verifiable action against terrorist outfits operating from Afghan soil, warning that such groups threaten not only Pakistan but also the security and future of the entire region. “Pakistan desires a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan. We urge the Taliban leadership to engage in practical, result-oriented dialogue and cooperation to secure enduring peace and stability in our shared neighborhood,” he said. Bilawal expressed hope that the interim Afghan government would ensure that Afghan soil was not used against Pakistan and that both countries would work together in the spirit of mutual respect to promote peace, stability, and prosperity across the region and beyond. Calls for restraint After the border clashes were reported, multiple countries urged Pakistan and Afghanistan to exercise restraint. Saudi Arabia, with which Pakistan recently signed a mutual defence deal , expressed concern at the skirmishes. “The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region. “The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples.” Iranian top diplomat Abbas Araghchi called on Afghanistan and Pakistan “to exercise restraint” amid ongoing clashes. “Our position is that both sides must exercise restraint,” Araghchi said during a live interview with state television, adding that “stability” between the countries “contributes to regional stability”. Qatar’s foreign ministry urged both sides to prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint, and to work towards containing differences in a manner that helps to reduce tension and avoid escalation, in order to achieve regional security and stability. The foreign ministry reiterated Qatar’s support for all regional and international efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security, and affirmed its commitment to ensuring security and prosperity for the people of the two countries. Events preceding the border clashes The border clashes come against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. An instance of Pakistan asserting its position was when Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly,\n“Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out.” While Kabul maintains that it does not provide safe havens to terrorists, Afghan officials blamed Pakistan on Friday of bombing a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line and also violating the territory of capital Kabul. This was after an explosion was reported in Afghanistan on Thursday. The Foreign Office in Islamabad avoided directly acknowledging the incident in Kabul during a weekly briefing on Friday, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the ISPR director general also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out any strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who was on a visit to India when the border clashes began, had condemned Thursday’s incident and Pakistan’s alleged role in it during a press conference in New Delhi. It was India’s — with which Pakistan’s ties have historically been tense — first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. On Friday, New Delhi also announced that it would be reopening its embassy in Kabul after four years. These developments followed a four-day military escalation between Pakistan and India in May — one of the deadliest in recent years — which led to a new low in relations between the two countries.

      "summary_orig": "The latest hearing of cases against Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other group leaders was held in Quetta District Jail instead of an anti-terrorism court (ATC), it emerged on Sunday, with the advocacy group terming the development a “disturbing display of institutionalised repression”. The BYC, a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018, posted in a statement on X that the judicial remand of the detained BYC leaders was further extended for ten days. Mahrang and other BYC leaders, including Sibghatullah Baloch, Beebow Baloch, Beebarg Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, were arrested under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO) in March and have remained in custody since then, being remanded multiple times. Israr Baloch, the counsel for Mahrang, confirmed Saturday’s developments to Dawn.com . The case was heard by Judge Muhammad Ali Mobin of ATC-1, he said. “Instead of presenting the BYC leaders in ATC-1, the BYC legal team was summoned to District Jail Quetta, where the cases were heard,” Israr said. “During the hearing, the prosecutor could not submit the challan, due to which the charges could not be framed against the detained BYC leader and nor could a formal trial be initiated,” he added. The hearing was adjourned until October 18 and Judge Mobin ordered the prosecution to submit a challan by then, he said. Earlier, the BYC said in its X post that the shift to “jail hearings marks a grave and deliberate attempt to suppress transparency, exclude public scrutiny, and further institutionalise the criminalisation of peaceful political dissent in Balochistan. “By moving the proceedings behind prison walls, the state effectively bars families, journalists, and neutral observers from witnessing the process which is a direct violation of Pakistan’s own constitution and international standards on fair trial and due process.” BYC leaders’ arrest Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. She was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April. After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days. Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.",

The case was heard by Judge Muhammad Ali Mobin of ATC-1, he said. “Instead of presenting the BYC leaders in ATC-1, the BYC legal team was summoned to District Jail Quetta, where the cases were heard,” Israr said. “During the hearing, the prosecutor could not submit the challan, due to which the charges could not be framed against the detained BYC leader and nor could a formal trial be initiated,” he added. The hearing was adjourned until October 18 and Judge Mobin ordered the prosecution to submit a challan by then, he said. Earlier, the BYC said in its X post that the shift to “jail hearings marks a grave and deliberate attempt to suppress transparency, exclude public scrutiny, and further institutionalise the criminalisation of peaceful political dissent in Balochistan. “By moving the proceedings behind prison walls, the state effectively bars families, journalists, and neutral observers from witnessing the process which is a direct violation of Pakistan’s own constitution and international standards on fair trial and due process.” BYC leaders’ arrest Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. She was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order — for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April. After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days. Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.",

The M1 motorway connects Peshawar to Islamabad, while the M2 motorway connects Lahore to Islamabad and the M3 motorway links Lahore to Abdul Hakeem in Khanewal district, where it joins the M4 leading to Faisalabad and Multan. A day ago, the main TLP procession reached Muridke after breaking through police security, hours after violent clashes in Lahore left over four dozen police personnel injured. The marchers then staged a sit-in at Muridke, blocked by trenches dug along the GT Road. In an update on Sunday evening, motorway police issued an alert stating that the Sialkot Motorway was now open, but that the roads going from Chowk Yateem to Scheme Morr and Babu Sabu remained closed. Earlier, authorities reopened the M1, M2 and M3 motorways for traffic on Sunday. “Citizens can travel on the Swat Expressway, Hazara Motorway and Hakla DI Khan Motorway,” the police said in a traffic alert. “Containers have been removed from all internal and external routes.” The motorway police concluded the alert by stating that information can be received from their 130 helpline and official social media accounts. Roads that have been reopened today include parts of Margalla Road, Jinnah Avenue and Seventh Avenue, as well as Korang Road to Bani Gala; Jinnah Road to Park Road; Garden Avenue to Tulip Banquet Hall; Chand Tara Flyover to Club Road (Murree Road); Fazal-i-Haq Road, Nazimuddin Road, Embassy Road; Ninth Avenue from JUP to Shaheen Chowk via internal access from Margalla Road, and others. TLP spokesperson Usman Naushahi told Dawn.com that protesters remained in Muridke and Sadhoke, saying, “We have not gone further yet.” While internet service is slow in the area, mobile data services are working, according to citizens. Meanwhile, the federal government moved over 1,200 paramilitary personnel to Punjab to intercept protesters , who have been marching on the capital from Lahore via GT Road. Yesterday, police said a gathering of 300 people, carrying TLP flags, posters, and banners, reached the crossing from Dhoke Abbasi and surrounding areas. The rally chanted anti-government slogans and delivered speeches, provoking people to join the TLP protest. The protesters also blocked the GT Road and refused to clear it when asked by the police. In response, the police used force, arresting 90 protesters and seizing sound systems, while others escaped. Last night, the police also decided to lift some blockades from a few roads.",

      "summary_orig": "Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Sunday urged the PTI and other political parties to unite in backing the “charter for a stable Pakistan” , saying the initiative had become more crucial than ever following last night’s border escalation with Afghanistan. According to a statement from the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), overnight skirmishes between Kabul and Islamabad erupted on the night of Oct 11-12, after “Afghan Taliban and India-backed militants launched an unprovoked attack along the Pak-Afghan border”. Pakistan said its forces responded decisively, killing over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, while 23 Pakistani soldiers were martyred. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Afghanistan to rein in the Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for militants linked to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — saying the group operates from Afghan soil. Kabul, however, has denied any involvement. Speaking during a media briefing in Faisalabad today, Sanaullah said that given the current circumstances, when the country’s stability was more important than anything else, all political parties needed to adopt a unified stance. “At this moment, I say to the PTI leadership: you may continue to criticise us and chant slogans against the government by all means, but you must stand with Pakistan, with its armed forces, and with its martyrs,” he said. “If you stand with Pakistan and the armed forces, a way forward will open for you.” PTI has opposed renewed military operations, arguing they have repeatedly failed to curb terrorism and only displaced civilians, fuelling resentment in affected areas. The party insists militancy should be tackled through dialogue and governance reforms rather than force, warning that fresh offensives without a political strategy could further destabilise Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. A day earlier, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had assailed the PTI-led KP government for “facilitating terrorists, sowing division, and undermining national security.” Sanaullah said at this crucial hour, political leadership should fulfil its responsibility, and invited other parties to join the ‘charter for a stable Pakistan’, or ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’, as well, a concept introduced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to lay the basis for the greater national interest. “I call upon all political parties, political leaders and all parliamentarians — whether members of the provincial assemblies, members of the National Assembly or the Senate. “I invite and appeal to them to accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s request that he made on Independence Day that we should back the charter.” He said national consolidation had become more important than ever before due to the circumstances. “Come and unite on the ‘charter for stable Pakistan’, and discuss the proposals that the prime minister has put forward,” he stressed. Talking about the escalation with Afghan Taliban forces, he said: “Today, we have dealt a blow to a disgraced and hidden enemy. We have given the enemy, one that was apparently attacking us from the shadows, a crushing answer.” He said that because of the Field Marshal Asim Munir’s courageous policy and the bravery of the armed forces, “the whole nation witnessed this honourable moment which they had not seen in some 78 years.” ‘TLP should call off protest’ Meanwhile, Sanaullah also urged Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to call off its protest in the wider interest of the country. Last week, the party began a march towards Islamabad from Lahore to express ‘solidarity with Palestinians.’ Protesters broke through security and engaged in violent clashes, leaving over four dozen police personnel injured.\nThe marchers have since camped at Muridke, with their way forward blocked by trenches dug along the GT Road. “You should postpone this protest, bring it to an end,“ Sanaullah said. “The Gaza march, in fact, is at a time when the issue has, to a considerable extent, indeed to a very large extent, been resolved through diplomatic efforts, and that one-sided slaughter that was taking place there is about to end.” He said that the march should have been an expression of solidarity with the present government of Pakistan and, in particular, with Field Marshal Munir and PM Shehbaz. “[You should express solidarity with] the courage with which Pakistan presented its position at the UN and condemned the atrocities being committed against the Palestinian people,” he said. “Even Europe couldn’t persuade the US, but it is Pakistan’s leadership that called on the US to perform its role and to end this one-sided killing.” He said that since the protest had turned violent, it was time to call it off. “A situation has emerged where all senior religious leaders, especially Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the JUI-F, have shown concern,” he said. “You may not listen to us [the government], but your respected leader [Khadim Hussain Rizvi] always stood with the country; therefore, you should call this off.”",
