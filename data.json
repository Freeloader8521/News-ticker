      "summary_orig": "The search for two missing workers entered its fifth day Monday after a boiler tower collapsed at a thermal power plant in the southeastern city of Ulsan. A total of seven workers were initially trapped at the plant of the Ulsan branch of Korea East-West Power, a state-run utility company, on Thursday. Three bodies have been recovered, while four people are still trapped, including two who are presumed dead. Firefighting authorities said drones were sent inside the debris overnight to aid in the search but failed to locate the missing. Search personnel have withdrawn from the site temporarily as work began the previous day to prepare for the demolition of two other boiler towers flanking the one that collapsed. Once the two towers are demolished, sometime early this week, officials plan to use heavy equipment to lift the debris from the collapse, speeding up the search for the missing. The collapsed tower was 60 meters tall and in the process of being demolished after 40 years of use ending in 2021.",

      "summary_orig": "As the government made moves toward the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment , former judges and top lawyers on Monday urged Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi to summon a full court meeting to discuss the proposed legislation. The request came in a letter, dated November 9 and a copy of which is available with Dawn , that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi. It was also signed and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers. The letter said that the missive was being written “not in normal times but in times that presented the greatest threat to the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its establishment in 1956”. It termed the 27th Amendment Act as the “biggest and the most radical restructuring of the Federal Appellate Court structure since the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935”. “We say this without any fear of contradiction that no civilian or military government in Pakistan’s history has even tried, let alone succeeded, in relegating the Supreme Court of Pakistan as a subordinate court and permanently denude it of its constitutional jurisdiction, as is being done through the proposed Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025,” the lawyers and judges said in the letter. “If your Lordship is in agreement with us that this proposed amendment act is the biggest and most radical restructuring of the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its inception, then we would most respectfully request, and fully expect your Lordship, to call a full court meeting to discuss this proposed Amendment Act and to give an appropriate response to the federal government in the form of inputs and suggestions regarding this proposed amendment act,” they added. “We would respectfully not like to explain to your Lordship that the Supreme Court has every right and power to give its input to the federal government on any proposed amendment act,” the legal experts said, adding that the legislation proposes “radical restructuring” of SC’s basic essence, structure and its constitutional obligation to administer justice for all. The letter reiterated the call for an immediate full court meeting, noting that the Amendment was expected to be passed by November 11 (today) “or any day thereafter”. The lawyers and judges went on to add that in case this request was declined on the “pretext of neutrality or noninterference with legislation (which we consider to be reasons without any substance), then we would at\nleast expect you to accept and admit in a written response to us that you are now reconciled to be the last chief justice of Pakistan and now reconciled to accept the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan as the highest court in Pakistan”. “At least by this admission by you, we would no longer have any kind of expectation from your Lordship to be a defender of the Supreme Court,” they said. The letter requested that, as this was a matter of “utmost public importance”, a copy of the missive be released to the media. Besides Siddiqui and retired judges Alam and Akhtar, the letter was also endorsed by former attorney generals for Pakistan (AGP) Muneer A. Malik, Anwar Mansoor Khan; ex-presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Abid Shahid Zuberi, Ali Ahmad Kurd, Muhammad Akram Sheikh and Kanrani B. Amanullah; and SC advocates Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, Salahuddin Ahmed and Shabnam Nawaz Awan. Zuberi , Sheikh and Salahuddin are among the petitioners who have challenged the 26th Amendment, which had also faced great opposition from the legal fraternity at the time of its passage in October 2024. Kurd and other lawyers had vowed to launch a protest movement to reject that Amendment and “restore the judiciary’s independence”. Malik and Hosain had last month presented their arguments in the 26th Amendment case as counsels for the Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA) and veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak , respectively. Proposed judicial restructuring Shortly after its approval by the federal cabinet, the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate on Saturday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes. The Senate has convened for the third consecutive day today and is likely to greenlight the legislation, after which it will land in the National Assembly. Among the various changes proposed in the Amendment, many pertain to the judiciary, with the most notable being the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). The FCC will deal with constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the Supreme Court itself, which has led to many experts believing that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the SC as the country’s highest judicial forum. View this post on Instagram At the heart of the amendment is the creation of a new apex court, the FCC, building upon the constitutional benches formed under the 26th Amendment, which remains challenged before the SC. Even before the 27th Amendment gets the parliament’s nod, the government has already begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the FCC. Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the SC’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC. The names of Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Mus­arrat Hilali, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi from SC, along with SHC’s Justice K.K. Agha and Balochistan High Court’s Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, are also being discussed for inclusion in the FCC’s initial composition. Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require an Act of Parliament. Inserted into the Constitution as Chapter 1A, the FCC would have its own chief justice — serving a fixed three-year term — and judges, who may be appointed from the SC, senior high court judges with at least seven years of experience, or very senior advocates with over two decades in practice. FCC judges would retire at the age of 68. The retirement age for SC judges currently is 65 as per Article 179 of the Constitution. The amendment further stipulates that the president may transfer a high court judge from one high court to another on the recommendation of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP). A judge of a high court who does not accept a transfer under this Article shall be deemed to have retired from his office. The FCC would assume some of the SC’s most significant powers. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil and criminal appeals only, while FCC decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself. The FCC would also hold exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between the Federation and provinces, or among provinces, and could, on its own motion, take up any case involving a “substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution“. Moreover, the FCC would take over the SC’s authority on cases concerning the enforcement of fundamental rights, appeals from high courts on constitutional matters, writ petitions under Article 199 (except family and rent cases), and even the president’s power to seek advisory opinions from the apex court.",

Besides Siddiqui and retired judges Alam and Akhtar, the letter was also endorsed by former attorney generals for Pakistan (AGP) Muneer A. Malik, Anwar Mansoor Khan; ex-presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Abid Shahid Zuberi, Ali Ahmad Kurd, Muhammad Akram Sheikh and Kanrani B. Amanullah; and SC advocates Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, Salahuddin Ahmed and Shabnam Nawaz Awan. Zuberi , Sheikh and Salahuddin are among the petitioners who have challenged the 26th Amendment, which had also faced great opposition from the legal fraternity at the time of its passage in October 2024. Kurd and other lawyers had vowed to launch a protest movement to reject that Amendment and “restore the judiciary’s independence”. Malik and Hosain had last month presented their arguments in the 26th Amendment case as counsels for the Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA) and veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak , respectively. Proposed judicial restructuring Shortly after its approval by the federal cabinet, the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate on Saturday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes. The Senate has convened for the third consecutive day today and is likely to greenlight the legislation, after which it will land in the National Assembly. Among the various changes proposed in the Amendment, many pertain to the judiciary, with the most notable being the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). The FCC will deal with constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the Supreme Court itself, which has led to many experts believing that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the SC as the country’s highest judicial forum. View this post on Instagram At the heart of the amendment is the creation of a new apex court, the FCC, building upon the constitutional benches formed under the 26th Amendment, which remains challenged before the SC. Even before the 27th Amendment gets the parliament’s nod, the government has already begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the FCC. Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the SC’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC. The names of Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Mus­arrat Hilali, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi from SC, along with SHC’s Justice K.K. Agha and Balochistan High Court’s Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, are also being discussed for inclusion in the FCC’s initial composition. Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require an Act of Parliament. Inserted into the Constitution as Chapter 1A, the FCC would have its own chief justice — serving a fixed three-year term — and judges, who may be appointed from the SC, senior high court judges with at least seven years of experience, or very senior advocates with over two decades in practice. FCC judges would retire at the age of 68. The retirement age for SC judges currently is 65 as per Article 179 of the Constitution. The amendment further stipulates that the president may transfer a high court judge from one high court to another on the recommendation of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP). A judge of a high court who does not accept a transfer under this Article shall be deemed to have retired from his office. The FCC would assume some of the SC’s most significant powers. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil and criminal appeals only, while FCC decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself. The FCC would also hold exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between the Federation and provinces, or among provinces, and could, on its own motion, take up any case involving a “substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution“. Moreover, the FCC would take over the SC’s authority on cases concerning the enforcement of fundamental rights, appeals from high courts on constitutional matters, writ petitions under Article 199 (except family and rent cases), and even the president’s power to seek advisory opinions from the apex court.",
      "title": "‘Radical restructuring’: Retired judges, top lawyers urge CJP to summon full court meeting on 27th Amendment",
      "summary": "As the government made moves toward the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment , former judges and top lawyers on Monday urged Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi to summon a full court meeting to discuss the proposed legislation. The request came in a letter, dated November 9 and a copy of which is available with Dawn , that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi. It was also signed and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers. The letter said that the missive was being written “not in normal times but in times that presented the greatest threat to the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its establishment in 1956”. It termed the 27th Amendment Act as the “biggest and the most radical restructuring of the Federal Appellate Court structure since the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935”. “We say this without any fear of contradiction that no civilian or military government in Pakistan’s history has even tried, let alone succeeded, in relegating the Supreme Court of Pakistan as a subordinate court and permanently denude it of its constitutional jurisdiction, as is being done through the proposed Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025,” the lawyers and judges said in the letter. “If your Lordship is in agreement with us that this proposed amendment act is the biggest and most radical restructuring of the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its inception, then we would most respectfully request, and fully expect your Lordship, to call a full court meeting to discuss this proposed Amendment Act and to give an appropriate response to the federal government in the form of inputs and suggestions regarding this proposed amendment act,” they added. “We would respectfully not like to explain to your Lordship that the Supreme Court has every right and power to give its input to the federal government on any proposed amendment act,” the legal experts said, adding that the legislation proposes “radical restructuring” of SC’s basic essence, structure and its constitutional obligation to administer justice for all. The letter reiterated the call for an immediate full court meeting, noting that the Amendment was expected to be passed by November 11 (today) “or any day thereafter”. The lawyers and judges went on to add that in case this request was declined on the “pretext of neutrality or noninterference with legislation (which we consider to be reasons without any substance), then we would at\nleast expect you to accept and admit in a written response to us that you are now reconciled to be the last chief justice of Pakistan and now reconciled to accept the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan as the highest court in Pakistan”. “At least by this admission by you, we would no longer have any kind of expectation from your Lordship to be a defender of the Supreme Court,” they said. The letter requested that, as this was a matter of “utmost public importance”, a copy of the missive be released to the media.

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s ousted premier, Sheikh Hasina’s written interviews flaunt an utter lack of contrition. There is not a hint of remorse, not a sliver of guilt. The interviews published by Indian outlets last week — The Hindustan Times , New Indian Express and The Hindu — or the ones by Reuters , AFP and the UK’s Independent (published on October 29) show that former prime minister, in exile in India since August 5, 2024, remains thoroughly unencumbered by even a touch of introspection or self-doubt. Going a step further, The Week , also based in India, published a column by Hasina where she deplores the ineptitude of the very institutions her regime had meticulously destroyed. She flails against the interim government for not having the people’s mandate, which she had manufactured to stay in power for years through rigged elections. She berates the BNP for trying to manipulate the caretaker government system, which her regime had abolished. Her deluded sense of being wronged pervades the entire article. The closest Hasina comes to acknowledging some error of her administration in the article is one that she had already mentioned in her written interviews. She writes, “I mourn the life of every Bangladeshi that has been needlessly lost since the protests in the summer of 2024. While the vast majority of law-enforcement officers acted within their guidelines, mistakes were very clearly made in the way some members of the security forces responded to the rapid upsurge of violence.” Hasina goes on to write that it was a very fluid and “febrile situation”, and clearly there were “breakdowns of discipline within the chain of command”. She then states, “However, the Awami League categorically rejects the allegations that we were directly responsible for, or commanded the use of, lethal force against our own citizens. To characterise what happened as a plot by a democratically elected government to commit violence against its own people is entirely wrong. Indeed, I personally took steps to ensure that no firearms were used.” Throughout all her interviews Hasina maintains that the evidence against her, audio clips of phone calls, were either doctored or taken out of context. She also rejects the UN human rights office estimate that 1,400 people were killed during the July uprising as “inflated”. She told in her interview with The Hindustan Times rejecting her role in the crackdown , “But to suggest that I was directing minute-by-minute tactical responses from the prime minister’s office is to fundamentally misunderstand how security forces work. I repeat, at no point did I authorise security forces to fire on crowds.” The Daily Star ’s own investigation found Hasina to have personally authorised the use of lethal weapons. This newspaper had reported on a phone recording from July 18, 2024 where Hasina tells her nephew, former Dhaka South Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, “I have given instructions, now I have given direct instructions; now they will use lethal weapons. Wherever they find them [protesters], they will shoot directly.” The 78-year-old former leader took the opportunity to express her gratitude to India for offering refuge. “I am deeply grateful to the Indian people for providing me with a safe haven,” she said. “The connections between our two countries are broad and deep. We pride ourselves on being India’s reliable partner.” While her interviews with the international agencies and the UK newspaper appeared to be somewhat balanced, the ones carried by the Indian outlets are far more incendiary. Sheikh Hasina’s lack of self-reproach aside, the latest round of interviews shirks from providing any context that explain Hasina’s hasty departure. There is little that sheds light on the weeks of untold violence preceding her flight. There is hardly any mention of Hasina’s 17 years of misrule when Bangladesh descended into an autocracy. Her interviews and the writeup attempts to portray the Yunus-led government as a usurper without any acknowledgement of how the Awami League regime had fuelled discontent among the protesters as well as the general populace. The underlying message has been the next election will not be inclusive without the Awami League, whose activities are currently banned, taking part. The publication of these interviews and column could not have happened without the knowledge or consent of Hasina’s host country. Together with the former premier’s write-up, this move can only be seen as an attempt to somehow influence the ensuing election. Hasina is still seen as the one responsible for hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries during the July uprising alone. She would do well to remember that such interviews will not even begin to restore Awami League’s image. Her hosts would do well to remember that under the current circumstances they should refrain from activities that will further their distance from the people of Bangladesh.

      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN’S slide into authoritarianism has been unmistakable over the past three years or more. Now a fresh move will reinforce the trend of democratic regression. The 27th constitutional amendment tabled in parliament will alter the country’s judicial structure with significant implications for governance and democracy. Last year, when parliament adopted the 26th Constitutional Amendment , it was done in the darkness of night, without providing the final text to lawmakers before being tabled. The entire legislative process lacked transparency and was over in hours in parliament. Official coercion to secure the required two-thirds vote robbed the process of legitimacy. But the controversial amendment passed, making the judiciary subservient to the executive and undermining the rule of law. Consequently, the government won every case concerning constitutional interpretations. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment seems to follow a similar path. It was kept under wraps until PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari disclosed the government had sought his party’s support and revealed the amendment’s key elements. This set off a public furore with constitutional lawyers calling this ‘state capture of the judiciary’, opposition leaders dubbing it as a ‘power grab’ directed by the establishment and others deeming it as a ‘threat to democracy’ and ‘assault on the notion of separating justice from politics’. As presented in the Senate, the 27th Amendment consists of the following core elements. Establishment of a federal constitutional court, transfer of high court judges between courts and changes to Article 243 which concerns the control and command of the armed forces. The 27th constitutional amendment is part of the broader trend towards democratic backsliding. Establishment of a federal constitutional court was also attempted by the government in the 26th Amendment. But due to fierce opposition, constitutional benches were instead set up in the Supreme Court and high courts. That too was criticised because the composition of benches, influenced by the executive, empowered the government to choose which judges could hear constitutional cases of concern. It all but took away that jurisdiction from regular benches. Objections to a constitutional court rest on solid ground. Packed with judges chosen by the government it will set up a parallel executive-compliant court. This will denude the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction in constitutional cases and those relating to fundamental rights. Meanwhile, the proposal to transfer high court judges between courts, without their consent, will mean the executive will be able to sideline ‘independent judges’ through its influence on the judicial commission, empowered to do this. Originally the proposed amendment also included rollback of constitutional safeguards for provincial shares in state revenues determined by the National Finance Commission Award, which guarantees they are not reduced. While the fiscal logic for this was understandable as the federal government is left with limited resources to meet its expenditure, the PPP opposed this as unacceptable erosion of the 18th Amendment. This was then dropped from the amendment but with ministers indicating it might be taken up later. Modification of Article 243 of the Constitution, which gives the government control and command of the armed forces, is predicated on the argument that defence needs have changed as a result of modern warfare while the post of field marshal necessitates constitutional recognition. The amendment bestows wider constitutionally sanctioned powers and privileges to the top military leadership. The office of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (headed at different times by the army, air force and naval officers who were supposed to do so by rotation) is to be abolished. Instead, the new post of Chief of Defence Forces will be created, to be held by the army chief. The Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force and Admiral of the Fleet are all given legal immunity akin to the president’s and can only be removed by impeachment. They will remain in uniform and retain the rank for life with the same privileges and immunity. The effect of all this is to further shift the power balance to the military from the civilian system. Seen in the context of democratic erosion in recent years, the 27th amendment delivers another blow to democracy by further emasculating an independent judiciary. There have been a series of democratic reversals under the hybrid government-plus arrangement. Every indicator of democracy has shown regression. Parliament has been reduced to a rubber-stamp, freedom of assembly restricted, opposition suppressed, media controlled, independence of the judiciary compromised and the civil-military balance ske­wed to the latter’s advantage by a ruling coalition happy to act as a subservient junior ‘partner’. It can be argued that democratic backsliding is nothing new and similar to what happened in the past. Previous periods of civilian rule also saw governments take repressive measures — crackdowns on opposition, jailing of opposition leaders on trumped-up charges, marginalisation of parliament, muzzling the media and undermining judicial independence. While the present situation has echoes of the past, the nature and extent of democratic erosion makes it different. Previous civilian governments would persecute political opponents and take other autocratic measures including eroding judicial independence and controlling the media, but they would do so mostly on their own without the establishment’s direct involvement. That changed after 2018 and more so after 2022. The establishment became directly involved in efforts to ‘control’ the opposition, courts, media and digital space. This expanded its sphere of political interventions in an unprecedented way. Perhaps what ‘necessitated’ this was that the government installed after the 2024 election had little political weight as it rested on a dubious mandate. So, it needed to be shored up. Past periods of civilian democracy did not see continuous bans on political protests and public assembly as happens now. Moreover, targeting of political opponents is now accompanied by efforts at broader repression. Raids on opposition leaders’ homes and incommunicado detention of party activists are part of the present government’s inventory of repressive actions. Because there is more to control, the government has gone much further than its civilian predecessors in micromanaging the electronic media and imposing curbs on digital space. Against this backdrop the 27th constitutional amendment is part of a broader pattern of Pakistan’s slide to an undemocratic system. But as the country’s history shows, aggrandisement of power and manipulation of law neither makes a government secure nor guarantees its future. It only exposes its lack of self-confidence and absence of faith in democracy. i Published in Dawn, November 10th, 2025",

The main reason for this is the Taliban’s obduracy, and lack of intention in stopping terrorist groups such as the TTP from staging cross-border attacks. The third round of talks in Istanbul wrapped up without any forward movement on Friday, with the extension of the ceasefire agreed to in Doha after hostilities last month as the only saving grace. Pakistan, indicating its seriousness, sent high-powered negotiators, including the ISI chief. But the Taliban’s refusal to budge from their stance, as in previous rounds of dialogue, resulted in no progress. As the defence minister put it, the talks are currently in an “indefinite phase”, though there are chances that further parleys are possible. The Taliban have described Pakistan’s demands as “unrealistic”. But there is nothing undoable about preventing militant groups active on Afghan soil from attacking Pakistan. The Kabul regime has vacillated between denying that any terrorist groups are active in Afghanistan, and saying that internal security is Pakistan’s own problem. While internal security is indeed Pakistan’s responsibility, Kabul has a duty to stop armed actors from crossing the border and carrying out acts of terrorism in this country. Complicating matters further is the fact that Kabul is unwilling to give written guarantees that it will prevent attacks. This recurring cycle of negotiations, followed by a breakdown in talks and the threat of renewed hostility, must end; a permanent solution needs to be found soon. Few in the international community will believe the Taliban when they claim that no TTP fighters, or militants belonging to other groups, are active on Afghan soil. Evidence proving the presence of such groups in Afghanistan is significant. The Taliban’s ideological affinity with the TTP is also no secret. If the Afghan Taliban seek international recognition, they must realise that this will elude them unless they muzzle their militant comrades, and stop them from attacking sovereign states. The international community should ignore the threat of Afghanistan-based militants at its own peril. Today, these elements are attacking Pakistan; tomorrow, they may expand their reach to other states. Therefore, if the Taliban are not willing to accept Pakistan’s legitimate demands, Islamabad should work with regional allies to ensure that the Kabul regime incurs costs for hosting terrorist groups. This can include limiting diplomatic engagement and trade ties. Pakistan must also be wary of Indian moves to indulge the Taliban.

      "summary_orig": "The visa applications of foreigners seeking residence in the US face the possibility of rejection if the applicants have certain medical conditions, including diabetes or obesity, according to US-based news outlet KFF Health News . The publication reported this on Thursday, citing a new directive from the Trump administration. According to the outlet, this new directive was outlined in a cable issued by the US State Department to embassy and consular officials. It “directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the US for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits”, KFF reported. “The guidance says that such people could become a ‘public charge’ — a potential drain on US resources — because of their health issues or age,” the report said. “You must consider an applicant’s health,” the cable read, according to KFF . It added: “Certain medical conditions — including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions — can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care.” According to KFF , the cable also encouraged visa officers to consider conditions like obesity — which it noted could cause asthma, sleep apnea and high blood pressure —  while assessing whether an immigrant could become a public charge and should therefore be denied entry into the US. “All of these can require expensive, long-term care,” the cable read, additionally directing visa officers to determine if applicants had the means to pay for medical treatment without financial assistance from the US government. KFF reported that the instruction also directed visa officers to consider the health of the applicant’s family members, including children or older parents. Tommy Pigott, the US State Department’s principal deputy spokesperson, also said in a statement: “It’s no secret the Trump administration is putting the interests of the American people first. This includes enforcing policies that ensure our immigration system is not a burden on the American taxpayer.” Separately, the official told reporters that the decision to issue a visa had always been at the discretion of an officer. Officers are not being instructed to reject an applicant because they have a certain medical condition, but to consider the “overall impact” if someone would be unlikely to be able to pay for their own medical care, they clarified. “It’s addressed on an individual, case-by-case basis,” the official added.",

In a statement, a PIA spokesperson also disputed claims about aircraft safety put forward by the Society of Aircraft Eng­ineers of Pakistan (SAEP), which had maintained that its personnel could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “The body responsible for air safety in Pakistan is the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), which regulates all airlines, including PIA, under the strictest international stan­dards and procedures. All matters concerning the use and replacement of parts, the fitness of aircraft for flight, and the routes, sche­dules, or changes thereto are under the direct purview of the PCAA and are executed only after seeking their approvals,” the spokesperson said. Referring to images of damage to an aircraft win­dscreen that circulated on the media, the spokesperson said that the use of steel tape for curing (drying) sealant after winds­creen repair was a routine matter. But, he maintained, an impression was wrongly created that “flights were being operated with a windscreen held together by tape”. The spokesperson also claimed that the PIA management had not taken administrative or retaliatory action against any engineer, adding that the dismissal of the body’s “self-styled” president and general secretary was the result of administrative proceedings ongoing for the past four months. However, the dismissal letter issued to both men last week stated they had been issued notices for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Calling the proposed 27th Constitutional Amen­dment a “9/11 on Pakistan”, Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai announced a nationwide protest, arguing the measure would “shatter the foundation of the country”. Mr Achakzai said the peaceful protest would be held under the slogan of a Habib Jalib ghazal: “Aise Dastoor Ko, Subh-i-BeNoor Ko, Me Nahi Manta, Mai Nahi Janta”. Speaking at a news conference at the National Press Club, he anno­unced two additional slogans: “death for dictatorship and democracy live long” and “free the prisoners”. Mr Achakzai described himself as a “true patriotic” who has taken the oath to protect the country five times, noting that the current National Ass­embly speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, administered two of those oaths. Opposition alliance announces nationwide protests; plans to observe ‘Black Day’ He recalled an exchange from 1993 with then-speaker Gohar Ayub Khan. “I spoke to the speaker that he has taken an oath of protecting the Constitution from hundreds of people, but how will we protect the constitution,” Mr Achakzai said. “I suggested taking another oath from us that if any general violated the constitution, we will be on the roads. How­ever, my suggestion was not considered.” Mr Achakzai drew a parallel with Afghanistan, noting the shared language and blood. “We can only forgive them if there will be constitution and democracy in Pakistan,” he said. He criticised the country’s economic state, stating that 45 percent of people live below the poverty line while some seek lifetime impunity from the law. “Then who will be investigated, a drug addict who steals money for the drugs or food?” he asked, claiming that those who commit minor crimes will be punished while those who “loot the country will have impunity”. Mr Achakzai argued that the country cannot be protected by empowering a single individual but by stren­gthening its constitution and people. “We appeal to all sections of society that it is an attack on the foundation of the country, so all should rise and resist against the conspiracy to smash the Parliament,” he said. “We all should get united and make a system to protect the country before it gets too late, here people are being killed, and they are being pushed to take the weapons in their hands.” Another TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, said the 27th Amendment was designed to protect the interests of certain individuals and was disconnected from the issues facing the public. A draft of the TTAP’s plans detailed a National Conference to be held this week to strategise against the amendment. The day after the amendment is passed will be observed as a “Black Day,” with lawyers and citizens encouraged to wear black arm strips. It claimed that the 1973 constitution was no more representative of the masses and was being used to protect the power in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Larkana. The movement will also involve publishing articles in national and international newspapers and establishing committees to meet with stakeholders, including bar councils and retired Supreme Court judges.

      "title_orig": "Afghan Taliban used talks to prolong temporary ceasefire, not take action against terrorism: FO",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday stated that the Afghan Taliban only participated in talks with Pakistan this past week to prolong a temporary ceasefire between the two nations and did not take any action against terrorist elements operating from their soil. Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban followed weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month. On Friday, the talks broke down , with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying that the negotiations “entered an indefinite phase”, but a temporary ceasefire between Kabul and Islamabad still stands. In a lengthy statement published today, the FO said: “Anyone following the talks held under the mediation of brotherly countries of Turkiye and Qatar, could easily discern that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/ Fitna-al-Khawarij ) and BLA/FaH (Balochistan Liberation Army/ Fitna-al-Hindustan ) elements present on Afghan soil.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “Instead of finding solutions to address Pakistan’s core concern, [the] Afghan regime used the opportunity to malign Pakistan through hypothetical accusations and jingoistic rhetoric,” the statement added. “It prolonged discussions and engaged in futile arguments to stonewall the efforts at reaching any concrete understanding.” The statement added that at the same time, the Afghan Taliban regime tried to paint the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue. “In the aftermath of Pakistan’s ‘Operation Zarb-i-Azb’ in 2015, terrorists belonging to the so-called TTP/FaK fled to Afghanistan,” the statement read. “They abetted [the] Afghan Taliban in their fight against the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) and [the] Afghan Government of the time. These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by [the] Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to Afghan Taliban.” Despite the breakdown of the negotiations, the statement emphasised that Pakistan has never turned down dialogue with “any government in Kabul”, but affirmed that it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group. The FO noted that since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021, terrorist attacks in Pakistan surged, with the attacks “emanating from Afghan soil”. It added that despite the attacks, Islamabad maintained restraint and took no retaliatory action. “Pakistan’s expectation was that with [the] passage of time, [the] Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the TTP/FaK elements present on Afghan soil,” the statement read, adding that Pakistan tried to foster positive ties through providing humanitarian assistance and encouraging trade. “However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan in terms of trade, humanitarian assistance, educational and medical visas facilitation and efforts at international forums to encourage the international community to engage with [the] Taliban regime in the interest of regional peace and stability, and for the socio-economic development of Afghanistan and its people, the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction.” The statement reiterated Pakistan’s demand that the Afghan Taliban hand over these terrorists to Islamabad’s custody, adding that Kabul repeatedly refused to do so, citing a lack of control. “More than being a matter of capability, it has become a matter of intent of [the] Taliban regime. Empty hopes and hollow promises rendered by Taliban regime so far have already outlived their efficacy,” the FO stated. “[The] Taliban regime is also trying to portray the TTP/FaK and BLA/FaH elements as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee issue, but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees.” The statement added: “Instead of acting upon the core expectation from Pakistan … not to allow Afghan territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions.” The FO said Kabul has tried to “confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues” and keeps trying to “develop a narrative which absolves [the] Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards international community and its own people.” The statement affirmed that Pakistan’s response to attacks launched from Afghanistan’s territory would leave “no stone unturned” to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens, adding that anyone supporting or abetting terrorists is “not considered a friend” of Islamabad’s. Narratives and propaganda The statement added that the Afghan Taliban try to spread narratives about disagreements within Islamabad over Afghan policy. “Irrespective of this misleading propaganda, there is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that the ordinary people of Pakistan are the biggest victims of the terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan and their abettors,” the FO clarified, maintaining that Pakistan’s armed forces are fully capable of safeguarding the population against any acts of aggression. Moreover, the FO noted in its statement an attempt by elements in the Afghan Taliban to “instigate Pashtoon (Pakhtun) nationalism” in Pakistan. “It is a historical fact that Pashtoons in Pakistan are a vibrant part of the society and the state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of polity and bureaucracy,” the statement read. “More … Pashtoons live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan … therefore, instead of instigating pashtoonism in Pakistan, it would be wise for [the] Taliban regime to look into its own credentials of inclusivity of all segments of its population in its governance structures.” ‘Strong lobby’ The FO added that there are people within the Afghan Taliban who do not want war with Pakistan, but noted the presence of a “strong lobby, with monetary support from foreign actors that has been tasked to stoke tensions”. “In search for legitimacy and to unite their fractious government, certain elements in [the] Taliban regime, anti-Pakistan terrorist elements and their abettors have found raising the bogey of Pakistan quite useful,” the statement read. “These elements have engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan. By doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had within Pakistan.” Border clashes and talks The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held several rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement was not achieved. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks began on Friday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire. Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing. However, the talks failed as negotiators could not bridge deep differences between the two sides. “Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’. The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.”",

      "summary_en": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday stated that the Afghan Taliban only participated in talks with Pakistan this past week to prolong a temporary ceasefire between the two nations and did not take any action against terrorist elements operating from their soil. Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban followed weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month. On Friday, the talks broke down , with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying that the negotiations “entered an indefinite phase”, but a temporary ceasefire between Kabul and Islamabad still stands. In a lengthy statement published today, the FO said: “Anyone following the talks held under the mediation of brotherly countries of Turkiye and Qatar, could easily discern that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/ Fitna-al-Khawarij ) and BLA/FaH (Balochistan Liberation Army/ Fitna-al-Hindustan ) elements present on Afghan soil.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “Instead of finding solutions to address Pakistan’s core concern, [the] Afghan regime used the opportunity to malign Pakistan through hypothetical accusations and jingoistic rhetoric,” the statement added. “It prolonged discussions and engaged in futile arguments to stonewall the efforts at reaching any concrete understanding.” The statement added that at the same time, the Afghan Taliban regime tried to paint the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue. “In the aftermath of Pakistan’s ‘Operation Zarb-i-Azb’ in 2015, terrorists belonging to the so-called TTP/FaK fled to Afghanistan,” the statement read. “They abetted [the] Afghan Taliban in their fight against the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) and [the] Afghan Government of the time. These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by [the] Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to Afghan Taliban.” Despite the breakdown of the negotiations, the statement emphasised that Pakistan has never turned down dialogue with “any government in Kabul”, but affirmed that it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group. The FO noted that since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021, terrorist attacks in Pakistan surged, with the attacks “emanating from Afghan soil”. It added that despite the attacks, Islamabad maintained restraint and took no retaliatory action. “Pakistan’s expectation was that with [the] passage of time, [the] Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the TTP/FaK elements present on Afghan soil,” the statement read, adding that Pakistan tried to foster positive ties through providing humanitarian assistance and encouraging trade. “However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan in terms of trade, humanitarian assistance, educational and medical visas facilitation and efforts at international forums to encourage the international community to engage with [the] Taliban regime in the interest of regional peace and stability, and for the socio-economic development of Afghanistan and its people, the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction.” The statement reiterated Pakistan’s demand that the Afghan Taliban hand over these terrorists to Islamabad’s custody, adding that Kabul repeatedly refused to do so, citing a lack of control. “More than being a matter of capability, it has become a matter of intent of [the] Taliban regime. Empty hopes and hollow promises rendered by Taliban regime so far have already outlived their efficacy,” the FO stated. “[The] Taliban regime is also trying to portray the TTP/FaK and BLA/FaH elements as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee issue, but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees.” The statement added: “Instead of acting upon the core expectation from Pakistan … not to allow Afghan territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions.” The FO said Kabul has tried to “confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues” and keeps trying to “develop a narrative which absolves [the] Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards international community and its own people.” The statement affirmed that Pakistan’s response to attacks launched from Afghanistan’s territory would leave “no stone unturned” to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens, adding that anyone supporting or abetting terrorists is “not considered a friend” of Islamabad’s. Narratives and propaganda The statement added that the Afghan Taliban try to spread narratives about disagreements within Islamabad over Afghan policy. “Irrespective of this misleading propaganda, there is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that the ordinary people of Pakistan are the biggest victims of the terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan and their abettors,” the FO clarified, maintaining that Pakistan’s armed forces are fully capable of safeguarding the population against any acts of aggression. Moreover, the FO noted in its statement an attempt by elements in the Afghan Taliban to “instigate Pashtoon (Pakhtun) nationalism” in Pakistan. “It is a historical fact that Pashtoons in Pakistan are a vibrant part of the society and the state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of polity and bureaucracy,” the statement read. “More … Pashtoons live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan … therefore, instead of instigating pashtoonism in Pakistan, it would be wise for [the] Taliban regime to look into its own credentials of inclusivity of all segments of its population in its governance structures.” ‘Strong lobby’ The FO added that there are people within the Afghan Taliban who do not want war with Pakistan, but noted the presence of a “strong lobby, with monetary support from foreign actors that has been tasked to stoke tensions”. “In search for legitimacy and to unite their fractious government, certain elements in [the] Taliban regime, anti-Pakistan terrorist elements and their abettors have found raising the bogey of Pakistan quite useful,” the statement read. “These elements have engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan. By doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had within Pakistan.” Border clashes and talks The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held several rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement was not achieved. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks began on Friday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire. Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing. However, the talks failed as negotiators could not bridge deep differences between the two sides. “Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’.
