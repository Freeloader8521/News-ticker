In a release posted Wednesday, the USFK said it \"proudly welcomes home\" soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery Regiment, following their deployment to the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility in March. \"Around 500 personnel and artillery units at the battalion level returned on Oct. 30,\" a USFK official said. At a press conference in August, USFK Commander Gen. Xavier Brunson indicated that the Patriot batteries, which had been relocated to the Middle East for strategic flexibility, would return to South Korea for the latest equipment upgrades. The Patriot missile system is designed to intercept incoming ballistic missiles at low to mid-range altitudes and serves as part of South Korea's layered missile defense network, along with the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, to counter North Korean threats.",

      "summary_orig": "Continuing to comment on the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year, US President Donald Trump has stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down. “In eight months I ended eight wars, including Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda … Pakistan and India,” he said during a speech at the American Business Forum in Miami late on Wednesday. “I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them. And then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper — I won’t mention the newspaper because it’s usually fake news — but I heard they are going to war. Eight planes, seven planes were shot down — an eighth was really badly wounded [sic]. But eight planes were shot down essentially,” he said. He reiterated his previous claims that he threatened not to make trade deals unless the two countries agreed to peace. “I’m not trading with you; we are not making any deals with you if you are at war with each other,” he said. “A day later, I get a call, ‘We made peace’. They stopped. I said, ‘Thank you, let’s trade’. Isn’t that great? Tariffs did that. Without tariffs that would have never happened.” The US president has previously stated on several occasions stated that five to seven planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September. Just last month, he had said that seven “brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down” during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India. India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks. The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.",

      "summary_orig": "• Afridi warns proposed 27th Amendment will undermine provincial autonomy; vows to take all steps to resist legislation • Says any cut in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 9.4pc share in NFC award unacceptable ISLAMABAD: The PTI parliamentary party on Wednesday unanimously passed a resolution calling for the arrangement of a meeting between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, after the chief minister was reportedly denied access on four occasions despite directions issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The resolution, which was later submitted to the National Assembly Secretariat, claimed that Mr Khan is the head of Pakistan’s largest political party and that it is the constitutional and democratic right of the KP chief minister to meet him in Adiala jail. Members of the parliamentary party deman­ded that the IHC’s orders be implemented, terming the continued denial a violation of democratic norms and parliamentary mandate. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was present during the meeting. Speaking to media persons, Mr Afridi warned that the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment would amount to an attack on provincial autonomy. He said that the KP government would take all possible steps to resist what he described as an attempt to roll back powers guaranteed to provinces under the Constitution. He stated that the proposed amendment was “nothing but an encroachment on provincial rights” and that it would not be tolerated at any cost. He added that PTI considered itself the guardian of the Constitution and would continue to protect it. KP CM to visit jail again today Responding to questions about his repeated attempts to meet the PTI founder in jail, Mr Afridi expressed disappointment that the IHC’s facilitation orders had not been implemented and said his democratic right had been violated. He announced that he would visit Adiala jail on Thursday (today), noting that meetings with Mr Khan were officially allowed on Tuesdays and Thursdays. About the NFC Award, Mr Afridi said that KP’s share of 19.4 per cent must not be reduced. He argued that KP had rendered the greatest sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, with many of its residents martyred, and that decreasing the province’s financial share would amount to ignoring those sacrifices. Post on Imran’s X account Meanwhile, a post issued from Imran Khan’s account on the social media platform X, reportedly based on comments shared by his sister, claimed that the rule of law no longer prevailed in the country. It remains unclear who currently operates Mr Khan’s account; however, he has never publicly disassociated himself from posts made in his name. The post described the current leadership as presiding over a period of “oppression” and alleged that incidents such as those of May 9, 2023, and the recent events in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Muridke represented abuses of state authority. In a message directed at supporters, the PTI founder stated that a nation which embraces the principle of “freedom or death” cannot be stopped from attaining true independence. He said that legal counsel Salman Akram Raja would transmit all party-related instructions and ensure their implementation. PTI to oppose 27th Amendment Separately, PTI Central Infor­mation Secre­tary Sheikh Waqas Akram reaffirmed that the party would go to any extent to block the proposed 27th Constitution Amendment. He alleged that a non-representative government was pushing the amendment to weaken provincial autonomy, politicise state institutions, curtail media freedom, restrict judicial independence, and concentrate power. He said the PTI would not allow the government to undo provincial rights, undermine parliamentary authority, or compromise on judicial oversight, stating that such measures would be unacceptable.

      "summary_orig": "• Airline says it will take legal action against protesting employees, claims partial restoration of flights • SAEP maintains it is not on strike, can’t issue clearance certificates at passengers’ expense RAWALPINDI: The PIA on Wednesday managed to “partially restore its flight operations” amid a protest by aircraft engineers under the umbrella of the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP). The tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP has been going on for three days over the safety of aircraft, causing delays in the departure of domestic and international flights at multiple major airports. On Wednesday, the PIA cancelled six flights to adjust the schedule of already delayed flights. On Monday night, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, and hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia. The PIA claimed that the engineers were on “strike” while the SAEP said that they were on duty but not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks. Against this backdrop, the PIA management called the SAEP president and general secretary for an inquiry on Tuesday, but they didn’t even show up on Wednesday. A PIA spokesman confirmed that the two office-bearers were summoned by the PIA management for the final hearing as an investigation against them had been underway. The PIA will initiate legal action against them in line with the law, he explained. He said that PIA flight operations had been partially restored through alternative means, hoping that the situation would become normal very soon. SAEP Secretary General Awais Jadoon said that they are on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances,” he explained. He said that the engineers were not on strike, adding that they could not make compromises on the safety of travellers, as they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying. When asked about their meeting with the PIA management, he explained that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them.

      "summary_orig": "• Khawaja Asif expects ‘clarity on consensus’ within two to three days • Justifies changes to Article 243 as defence needs ‘have changed’ • Latest tweaks not meant to roll back 18th Amendment, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tells NA ISLAMABAD: Clarity on a consensus over the proposed 27th Constit­utional Amendment is expected within two to three days, after which the legislation is likely to be tabled in parliament next week, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday. Separately, the National Assembly was also assu­red that the 18th Amen­dment would not be rolled back through the new legislation. Speaking to Geo News , Mr Asif said consultations were underway on amendments to the law governing the armed forces as the government considers constitutional changes. He stressed that discussions on amending Article 243 were ongoing because “defence requirements have changed”. Article 243 of the Constitution provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces” and that “the supreme command of the armed forces shall vest in the president”. Earlier, speaking to the media outside parliament, Mr Asif said he could not share details about reservations or discussions concerning the 27th Amendment. He added that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had every right to express his views and that the government was enga­ging other parties in the same spirit to seek input. ‘Guesswork’ Meanwhile, responding to points raised by opposition members in the Nati­onal Assembly, Minis­ter for Parliamentary Aff­a­irs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry urg­ed an end to “negative and false propaganda” and den­­­­o­unced attempts to ma­ke the 27th Amen­dm­ent controversial ba­sed on “ass­­u­­mptions and gues­s­work” as an official draft has yet to see the light of day. He said there was no plan to take control of provincial educational institutions or boards. “We are just talking about a uniform syllabus,” he said. The minister said no step would be taken that weakened the federation, the provinces or their relationship. “The purpose is to improve governance, bolster defence and stre­ngthen ties between the federation and the provinces,” he remarked. He added that allies and all stakeholders wou­ld be taken on board and that matters relating to the NFC would be decided through consultation. Regretting that the 26th Amendment , passed last year, had also been portrayed as an attack on judicial independence, he said a separate constitutional court, as proposed in the 27th Amendment, would help reduce case backlogs. He noted that establishing such a court had been agr­e­ed upon in the Charter of Democracy , signed by the PML-N and the PPP in 2006. He stressed that constitutional amendments req­u­ire a two-thirds majority, not consensus, and said the spirit of the Consti­tution would be upheld. Call for consensus Earlier, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said constitutional amendments should be passed with consensus, as happened in the neighbouring country in the past. He argued that the 27th Amendment would run counter to the spirit of the Constitution and warned the government against dividing the nation. “It will further jeopardise the independence of the judiciary,” he said. Barrister Gohar said the government was putting the federation at risk by pushing the amendment, adding that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces. “These subjects were devolved to the provinces with the passage of the 18th Amendment,” he noted. He also questioned why a draft of the 27th Amendment had been leaked. He said the opposition had proposed Mahmood Khan Achakzai as leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, submitting his name to the speaker’s office with signatures of 72 MNAs. “As per rules, the speaker should name the opposition leader; otherwise, I shall request Mr Achakzai to occupy the seat himself,” he said. He also recalled the Supreme Court’s 2022 judgement directing the federal government to legislate within 45 days to provide civilians convicted by military courts the right to appeal in the civilian judiciary, and called for its implementation. In his speech, Malik Aamir Dogar demanded that the chair immediately name Mr Achakzai as leader of the opposition under the rules. Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa, who was chairing the proceedings, suggested the opposition visit the speaker’s office to discuss the issue, as a case in this regard was in court. Journalists’ walkout Also on Wednesday, reporters covering the proceedings of the National Assembly also staged a walkout from the Press Gallery before start of Question Hour, to protest recent sacking of employees from a number of TV channels and curbs on media freedom. Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah sent Information Minister Attaullah Tarar to negotiate with the protesting journalists. Speaking on the occasion, Parliamentary Reporters Association (PRA) MB Soomro expressed his serious concerns over the recent sackings of a number of media workers from TV channels and various media organisations. He also in a forceful manner drew the attention of the minister towards the suspension of the government advertisements to Daily Dawn. Later, speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, the minister expressed concern over the dismissal of journalists by several media organisations without prior notice or valid justification. He said the issue would be raised during a meeting with media owners scheduled for next week. “We have ensured that timely payments are made to media houses, and we expect that these financial benefits will also reach working journalists and media staff,” he said. Mr Tarar said a delegation of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) had met him to present a charter of demands. These demands will be discussed with media owners, including the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and All Pakistan Newspaper Society (APNS), in the upcoming meeting to find a lasting solution, he added.

The minister said no step would be taken that weakened the federation, the provinces or their relationship. “The purpose is to improve governance, bolster defence and stre­ngthen ties between the federation and the provinces,” he remarked. He added that allies and all stakeholders wou­ld be taken on board and that matters relating to the NFC would be decided through consultation. Regretting that the 26th Amendment , passed last year, had also been portrayed as an attack on judicial independence, he said a separate constitutional court, as proposed in the 27th Amendment, would help reduce case backlogs. He noted that establishing such a court had been agr­e­ed upon in the Charter of Democracy , signed by the PML-N and the PPP in 2006. He stressed that constitutional amendments req­u­ire a two-thirds majority, not consensus, and said the spirit of the Consti­tution would be upheld. Call for consensus Earlier, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said constitutional amendments should be passed with consensus, as happened in the neighbouring country in the past. He argued that the 27th Amendment would run counter to the spirit of the Constitution and warned the government against dividing the nation. “It will further jeopardise the independence of the judiciary,” he said. Barrister Gohar said the government was putting the federation at risk by pushing the amendment, adding that it would be inappropriate to claw back population and education from the provinces. “These subjects were devolved to the provinces with the passage of the 18th Amendment,” he noted. He also questioned why a draft of the 27th Amendment had been leaked. He said the opposition had proposed Mahmood Khan Achakzai as leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, submitting his name to the speaker’s office with signatures of 72 MNAs. “As per rules, the speaker should name the opposition leader; otherwise, I shall request Mr Achakzai to occupy the seat himself,” he said. He also recalled the Supreme Court’s 2022 judgement directing the federal government to legislate within 45 days to provide civilians convicted by military courts the right to appeal in the civilian judiciary, and called for its implementation. In his speech, Malik Aamir Dogar demanded that the chair immediately name Mr Achakzai as leader of the opposition under the rules. Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa, who was chairing the proceedings, suggested the opposition visit the speaker’s office to discuss the issue, as a case in this regard was in court. Journalists’ walkout Also on Wednesday, reporters covering the proceedings of the National Assembly also staged a walkout from the Press Gallery before start of Question Hour, to protest recent sacking of employees from a number of TV channels and curbs on media freedom. Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah sent Information Minister Attaullah Tarar to negotiate with the protesting journalists. Speaking on the occasion, Parliamentary Reporters Association (PRA) MB Soomro expressed his serious concerns over the recent sackings of a number of media workers from TV channels and various media organisations. He also in a forceful manner drew the attention of the minister towards the suspension of the government advertisements to Daily Dawn. Later, speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, the minister expressed concern over the dismissal of journalists by several media organisations without prior notice or valid justification. He said the issue would be raised during a meeting with media owners scheduled for next week. “We have ensured that timely payments are made to media houses, and we expect that these financial benefits will also reach working journalists and media staff,” he said. Mr Tarar said a delegation of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) had met him to present a charter of demands. These demands will be discussed with media owners, including the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) and All Pakistan Newspaper Society (APNS), in the upcoming meeting to find a lasting solution, he added.

      "summary_orig": "PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday termed the proposed 27th amendment an “attack on the House” and said that he and his party would continue to raise their voices against it. According to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, proposals for this new amendment include setting up constitutional courts , restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces. Addressing the National Assembly today, the PTI chairman spoke about the proposed amendment, remarking that when the 26th Amendment was being passed, the PTI “made great efforts” with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. “Maybe this time we won’t need to visit his (Fazl) home, or sit with you in committee,” Gohar said, directly addressing the deputy speaker, who was chairing today’s session. “We will raise our voice against it as it is an attack on the House.” Gohar added: “Whenever there is a constitutional amendment anywhere in the world, it happens with a consensus and amends things according to the country’s needs.” The PTI chairman said the 27th Amendment is “against the spirit of this House and the Constitution”, asserting that the country cannot have further division and urging that no amendments be presented that put more pressure on the courts. “Amending the Constitution is this House’s right, and in this House, it is the right of those exact people who have the people’s mandate,” Gohar said. “Our democracy is very fragile; the people have no faith in the courts.” He told the deputy speaker that when the 18th Amendment was passed in 2010, it was “passed with consensus and unity with the people”. “The world acknowledged and celebrated it,” Gohar said. “However, when you presented the 26th Amendment, you brought 56 amendments, which were reduced to 25, then 18. We strongly opposed four of those amendments, including the constitutional bench, the tenure of judges and the preservation of the Election Commission. “This is a time when the nation is very divided; tensions are high, terrorism is on the rise, the deficit is rising and people cannot bear further problems. Please, be concerned about Pakistan’s security.” 27th amendment not meant to rollback 18th amendment: Tariq Fazal Chaudhry Responding to some points raised by opposition members, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry called for bringing “negative and false propaganda” to a halt. He assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th amendment. He denounced the attempts to make the 27th amendment controversial even before the official draft saw the light of day on the basis of assumptions and guesswork. He said there was no plan to take over the control of educational institutions and education boards in the provinces. “We are just talking about a uniform syllabus,” he remarked. Chaudhry said no step that weakened the federation, provinces and the relationship between them would be taken. “The purpose is to improve governance and bolster defence and strengthen the relationship between the federation and the provinces,” he remarked. He said allies and all stakeholders would be taken on board and matters regarding the National Finance Commission award would also be decided through consultation. He regretted that the 26th Amendment had also been dubbed as an attack on the independence of the judiciary. He noted that a separate constitutional court would help reduce the backlog. The minister pointed out that the establishment of the constitutional court had been agreed upon in the Charter of Democracy signed between the PML-N and PPP in 2006. He said amendments to the Constitution required a two-thirds majority and not consensus. He said the spirit of the Constitution would be followed. About the demand for the KP chief minister’s meeting with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, he said there was a procedure under the jail manual. He said Imran’s family members and counsels kept meeting him. PTI submits resolution in NA A resolution was submitted by PTI members in the National Assembly to arrange a meeting between KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Imran Khan, with PTI members signing the resolution. “This House affirms that consultation between elected representatives and their political leadership is a cornerstone of parliamentary democracy,” stated the resolution. Recognising that lmran remains the head of the largest political party in the KP Assembly, the resolution said that the CM, as the constitutional head of the provincial government, “must be able to consult his leader on matters of governance and public mandate”. “This House considers the denial of such access a violation of democratic\nnorms and an affront to the constitutional spirit that upholds dialogue and accountability,” it said. Through the resolution, the PTI members urged both the federal and the Punjab governments to implement the orders of the Islamabad High Court pertaining to the CM’s meeting with Imran in letter and spirit. “This House further declares that such a meeting shall constitute an official\nand legitimate consultation between the Chief Executive of the Province and the Leader of the largest parliamentary party, consistent with the principles of representative democracy and federal comity,” the resolution stated. Last Thursday, CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the fourth time since assuming office. Afridi has termed consultation with Imran as crucial in order to announce his new provincial cabinet after he was elected as the chief minister in October.",

      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani in Doha on Wednesday and offered to expand bilateral cooperation in the areas of defence and defence production between Pakistan and Qatar, a statement issued by the Presidency said. According to the statement, the Qatari emir “responded positively” to the offer and said he would instruct the relevant authorities to initiate discussions with Pakistan in this regard immediately. The bilateral meeting was held on sidelines of the  Second World Summit for Social Development, which is being held in Qatari capital Doha from November 4 to 6. President Zardari is representing Pakistan at the moot. The Presidency’s statement said that the Qatari leader also “expressed satisfaction at the recent Pakistan-Saudi Arabia defence agreement”. “It was a welcome and timely step that should have happened earlier,” the statement quoted al-Thani as saying. He also noted Pakistan’s “unique position as a country maintaining strategic ties with China, the West and the Gulf states at the same time”. In September, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hinted that it was rooted in current world affairs and reflected the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June. On the matter of recent clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Qatari emir expressed “hope that Pakistan and Afghanistan would resolve their current issues and move beyond recent challenges”. Qatar is one of the two mediators in talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, which were held in Doha and Istanbul following border clashes between the two sides last month. Another round of talks between them is set to begin tomorrow (Nov 6) in the Turkish capital. According to the Presidency’s statement, al-Thani told Zardari that “Qatar is proud of Pakistan and its achievements, and deeply values the contribution of the Pakistani community to Qatar’s development”. He expressed the desire to see their number “increase significantly” in the coming years, the statement said. For his part, President Zardari conveyed “warm greetings and best wishes” from the government and people of Pakistan to the Qatari emir, expressing “deep admiration for Qatar’s remarkable progress and visionary leadership”. Moreover, the statement said that President Zardari also “proposed enhancing cooperation in agriculture and food security” during the meeting. He also welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two nations. He lauded Qatar’s growing global role as a “centre of dialogue and humanitarian diplomacy and paid tribute to its leadership in advocating a ceasefire and humanitarian relief for the people of Gaza”. Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the Gulf nation, he highlighted Islamabad’s “strong condemnation” of Israel’s aggression against Qatar and its continued diplomatic support for Qatar’s sovereignty at international forums. The president welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two countries under the Qatari emir’s leadership, the statement said. The president “also commended the contributions of the Qatar Fund for Development, the Education Above All Foundation, and other Qatari humanitarian initiatives, paying special tribute to  Sheikha Moza bint Nasser and Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad Al Thani for advancing education and cultural exchange,” the statement read. It added that President Zardari further appreciated Qatar’s role in hosting and facilitating the UN-led Doha Process meetings on Afghanistan, including the first and second rounds held in May 2023 and February 2024, which have supported international coordination on humanitarian, development and security issues. He invited the Qatari emir to Pakistan to further strengthen “partnership with Qatar for regional peace, progress, and shared prosperity”, the statement said, adding that the Qatari leader said he would visit Pakistan early next year. Both leaders also discussed ways to further strengthen cooperation in political, economic and cultural spheres, the statement said, adding that they “reaffirmed the historic and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar, rooted in faith, mutual trust and shared aspirations for peace, prosperity and the advancement of the Muslim Ummah”. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was also present during the meeting, the statement said. Meeting with Qatari defence minister The president later met Qatari Defence Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani and underscored the close and historic ties between their two countries, particularly in the field of defence and security cooperation. “He expressed satisfaction over the existing collaboration between the armed forces of the two countries in training, capacity building and defence production. “President Zardari emphasised the importance of expanding cooperation in joint exercises, defence technology and exchange of expertise, noting that such initiatives would further enhance regional peace and stability,” said a statement from the PPP. The Qatari defence minister commended the professionalism of the Pakistan Armed Forces and reaffirmed his country’s commitment to deepening defence relations with Pakistan. He reiterated Qatar’s interest in joint defence production and collaborative defence projects, expressing readiness to expand such initiatives in the future. He also assured Qatar’s support for facilitating peace and stability in the Afghan conflict. The president appreciated Qatar’s continued support and said that Pakistan remained committed to further strengthening its strategic partnership with Qatar in diverse fields, including defence and security. Meeting with Chinese vice president Earlier, the president also met Chinese Vice President Han Zheng in the Qatari capital who appreciated Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and stability, a separate statement issued by the Presidency said. According to the statement by the Presidency, during his meeting with the Chinese vice president, Zardari recalled his recent visit to China, saying that Pakistan and China were “iron brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners”. “He thanked China for its consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan through all challenges, reaffirming that friendship with China remains the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” the statement said. The president also commended “China’s continued partnership in the successful implementation of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has now entered its second phase of high-quality development,” it added. For his part, the statement said, Han Zheng  appreciated “Pakistan’s efforts in combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and stability” and reaffirmed the “enduring strength of the Pakistan-China friendship”. The vice president also conveyed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s warm greetings. He stressed that China would “continue to support Pakistan’s economic development under the second phase of CPEC, particularly in transport and infrastructure, information technology, agriculture, and vocational training”. According to the statement, the two leaders “reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership based on mutual trust, respect, and a shared vision for regional peace and prosperity”. “They also agreed to continue close cooperation on issues of mutual interest at regional and international fora,” the statement added. President Zardari was accompanied by MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Pakistan’s ambassador to Qatar during the meeting.",

      "summary": "President Asif Ali Zardari met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani in Doha on Wednesday and offered to expand bilateral cooperation in the areas of defence and defence production between Pakistan and Qatar, a statement issued by the Presidency said. According to the statement, the Qatari emir “responded positively” to the offer and said he would instruct the relevant authorities to initiate discussions with Pakistan in this regard immediately. The bilateral meeting was held on sidelines of the  Second World Summit for Social Development, which is being held in Qatari capital Doha from November 4 to 6. President Zardari is representing Pakistan at the moot. The Presidency’s statement said that the Qatari leader also “expressed satisfaction at the recent Pakistan-Saudi Arabia defence agreement”. “It was a welcome and timely step that should have happened earlier,” the statement quoted al-Thani as saying. He also noted Pakistan’s “unique position as a country maintaining strategic ties with China, the West and the Gulf states at the same time”. In September, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hinted that it was rooted in current world affairs and reflected the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June. On the matter of recent clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Qatari emir expressed “hope that Pakistan and Afghanistan would resolve their current issues and move beyond recent challenges”. Qatar is one of the two mediators in talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, which were held in Doha and Istanbul following border clashes between the two sides last month. Another round of talks between them is set to begin tomorrow (Nov 6) in the Turkish capital. According to the Presidency’s statement, al-Thani told Zardari that “Qatar is proud of Pakistan and its achievements, and deeply values the contribution of the Pakistani community to Qatar’s development”. He expressed the desire to see their number “increase significantly” in the coming years, the statement said. For his part, President Zardari conveyed “warm greetings and best wishes” from the government and people of Pakistan to the Qatari emir, expressing “deep admiration for Qatar’s remarkable progress and visionary leadership”. Moreover, the statement said that President Zardari also “proposed enhancing cooperation in agriculture and food security” during the meeting. He also welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two nations. He lauded Qatar’s growing global role as a “centre of dialogue and humanitarian diplomacy and paid tribute to its leadership in advocating a ceasefire and humanitarian relief for the people of Gaza”. Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with the Gulf nation, he highlighted Islamabad’s “strong condemnation” of Israel’s aggression against Qatar and its continued diplomatic support for Qatar’s sovereignty at international forums. The president welcomed enhanced Qatari investment in Pakistan and expressed confidence that bilateral collaboration would continue to grow between the two countries under the Qatari emir’s leadership, the statement said.

      "title_orig": "‘The name is Mamdani’: Democrat Zohran elected New York City’s first Muslim mayor",
      "summary_orig": "Zohran Mamdani , a 34-year-old Democratic socialist, won the New York City mayoral race on Tuesday, capping a meteoric rise from a little-known state lawmaker to one of the United State’s most visible Democratic figures. According to CBS , Mamdani received 1,035,645 votes (50.4 per cent) against 854,783 (41.6pc) for former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and 146,127 (7.1pc) for Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani will become the first Muslim mayor of the largest US city. He defeated Democratic former Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, who ran as an independent after losing the nomination to Mamdani in the primary election. The campaign served as an ideological and generational contest that could have national implications for the Democratic Party. Democrats won two key state governor races, sending an early warning signal to Republican President Donald Trump ahead of the 2026 midterms. The clean sweep among several ballots nationwide has boosted morale among Democrats bruised by Trump’s return to the White House and has set alarm bells ringing among Republican circles. Mamdani, the youngest to serve in more than a century, was born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin and has lived in the United States since he was seven, becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2018. The Democratic socialist’s victory came in the face of fierce attacks on his policies and his Muslim heritage from business elites, conservative media commentators and Trump himself, who had made an eleventh-hour intervention in the race, calling Mamdani a “Jew hater“. “Hope is alive,” Mamdani declared in his victory speech. “We won because New Yorkers allowed themselves to hope that the impossible could be made possible. We won because we insisted that no longer would politics be something that is done to us. Now, it is something we do,” he said. View this post on Instagram Mamdani said New York would no longer be a city where one can “traffic in Islamophobia and win an election”, adding that the city will be a light “in this moment of political darkness”. He pledged a city hall “that stands steadfast alongside Jewish New Yorkers and does not waver in the fight against the scourge of anti-Semitism, where the more than one million Muslims know that they belong”. He quoted Jawaharlal Nehru, saying, “A moment comes, but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.” View this post on Instagram The Democrat also gave a message to the US president, who is also a New Yorker, saying, “Donald Trump, since I know you are watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!” Mamdani said he would put an end to the “culture of corruption” that has allowed billionaires like Trump to “evade taxation and exploit tax breaks”. “We will stand alongside unions and expand labour protections because we know, just as Donald Trump does, that when working people have iron-clad rights, the bosses who seek to extort them become very small indeed,” he said. View this post on Instagram Promising to fight for all New Yorkers, Mamdani said his administration would represent “immigrants, members of the trans community, Black women fired by Trump from federal jobs, single mothers struggling with rising costs — anyone with their back against the wall”. He concluded his speech by thanking New Yorkers, saying, “This power is yours. This city belongs to you.” His emphatic speech concluded with Bollywood song ‘Dhoom Machale’ blaring over the speakers. View this post on Instagram Turnout was high in this year’s vote with 2.06 million ballots, or 98pc of votes cast, counted by 12:31am on Wednesday — more than the total number of voters in the 2021 race. “The next and last stop is City Hall,” Mamdani said in a video posted to X after his victory was declared. Congratulations for Mamdani Ex-president Bill Clinton congratulated Mamdani. “I’m wishing you success as you work to transform the passion of your campaign into building a better, fairer, more affordable New York,” he said. The former US First Lady and 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said that “more people voted in New York City’s election this year than they have in 50 years”. US Senator Bernie Sanders said Mamdani had “pulled off one of the great political upsets in modern American history”. “Yes. We CAN create a government that represents working people and not the 1pc,” he said. Former US president Barack Obama congratulated all the Democrat candidates who won on Tuesday, calling it a reminder that “when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win”. “We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter,” he said. In New York, one group exclaimed “Mamdaniiiiii“, substituting the 34-year-old’s name for the customary “cheese” as they posed for a photo at a Brooklyn bar watch party. Voters gathered there in cautious optimism, sporting Mamdani merch as they anxiously awaited the evening’s results, classic songs such as Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” and edgier tracks from Lou Reed blasting from the speakers. It was a “local victory” that offered a means of “resisting and pushing back” against the political establishment in Washington, 40-year-old Ben Parisi told AFP , adding that the night stood in stark contrast to Trump’s victory a year ago. “A lot of us worked hard in one way or another to make this happen,” Parisi said, “and here we are… we get to celebrate“. Ghazala Hashmi becomes first Muslim woman to win statewide office in US Meanwhile, Ghazala Hashmi defeated Republican writer and conservative talk show host John Reid in the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race on Tuesday, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States Hashmi maintained a steady lead over Reid throughout the campaign, though polling tightened in the final days before election day. She secured 747,773 votes (53.8 per cent) against 659,421 (46.4pc) for her Republican rival. Earlier in June, Hashmi narrowly clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and state Senator Aaron Rouse in a closely contested primary. A member of the party’s progressive wing, Hashmi enjoyed strong support from prominent figures such as Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, who backed her during the primary campaign. Born in Hyderabad, India, Hashmi moved to the United States in her youth and later earned a PhD in English from Emory University. She began her career in academia, teaching English for over two decades at community colleges in Virginia before entering politics. Her election to the state Senate in 2019 marked her as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Virginia legislature, a milestone she has now extended to statewide office. Democrats win Virginia, New Jersey governor races In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger easily won the election for governor, becoming the first woman elected to serve in that role, while Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States. And in New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race. Spanberger defeated Republican Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race, flipping control of the state and making her the first woman ever to serve as the state governor. A former congresswoman and CIA officer, Spanberger maintained a consistent lead over Earle-Sears through most of the campaign, buoyed by strong fundraising and strong support in the state’s suburban counties. Her victory gives Democrats a significant boost as they seek to regain political footing following their 2024 national election losses. Spanberger, 47, centred her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well as public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her loyalty to Trump. Earle-Sears, 61, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message. “We sent a message to the world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,” Spanberger said in her victory speech. “We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.” “You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,” she said. Separately, Democrat Sherrill won New Jersey’s election for governor. Sherrill, a US representative and former Navy pilot, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli and will succeed Democratic Governor Phil Murphy. It is the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms. Uphill battle The races offered the beleaguered Democratic Party a test of differing campaign playbooks a year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress will be at stake. Since Trump’s win last year, Democrats have found themselves locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find the best path out of the political wilderness. Reacting to Republican losses, Trump cited unspecified pollsters who attributed the loss to the ongoing government shutdown and Trump not leading the ballot. “‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Prominent business people, including Bill Ackman, had noisily attacked Mamdani and funnelled cash to his rivals, while conservative media, including The New York Post , published blanket negative coverage. Mamdani’s improbable rise highlights the Democratic Party’s debate over a centrist or a leftist future, with some leading national figures offering only tepid endorsements of Mamdani ahead of voting. Syracuse University political science professor Grant Reeher said ahead of the result that Mamdani would face an uphill battle. “Everybody’s got their knives out, and it’s a very difficult city to govern,” he told AFP .",

Former US president Barack Obama congratulated all the Democrat candidates who won on Tuesday, calling it a reminder that “when we come together around strong, forward-looking leaders who care about the issues that matter, we can win”. “We’ve still got plenty of work to do, but the future looks a little bit brighter,” he said. In New York, one group exclaimed “Mamdaniiiiii“, substituting the 34-year-old’s name for the customary “cheese” as they posed for a photo at a Brooklyn bar watch party. Voters gathered there in cautious optimism, sporting Mamdani merch as they anxiously awaited the evening’s results, classic songs such as Frank Sinatra’s “New York, New York” and edgier tracks from Lou Reed blasting from the speakers. It was a “local victory” that offered a means of “resisting and pushing back” against the political establishment in Washington, 40-year-old Ben Parisi told AFP , adding that the night stood in stark contrast to Trump’s victory a year ago. “A lot of us worked hard in one way or another to make this happen,” Parisi said, “and here we are… we get to celebrate“. Ghazala Hashmi becomes first Muslim woman to win statewide office in US Meanwhile, Ghazala Hashmi defeated Republican writer and conservative talk show host John Reid in the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race on Tuesday, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States Hashmi maintained a steady lead over Reid throughout the campaign, though polling tightened in the final days before election day. She secured 747,773 votes (53.8 per cent) against 659,421 (46.4pc) for her Republican rival. Earlier in June, Hashmi narrowly clinched the Democratic nomination, defeating former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and state Senator Aaron Rouse in a closely contested primary. A member of the party’s progressive wing, Hashmi enjoyed strong support from prominent figures such as Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, who backed her during the primary campaign. Born in Hyderabad, India, Hashmi moved to the United States in her youth and later earned a PhD in English from Emory University. She began her career in academia, teaching English for over two decades at community colleges in Virginia before entering politics. Her election to the state Senate in 2019 marked her as the first Muslim woman to serve in the Virginia legislature, a milestone she has now extended to statewide office. Democrats win Virginia, New Jersey governor races In Virginia, Democrat Abigail Spanberger easily won the election for governor, becoming the first woman elected to serve in that role, while Democrat Ghazala Hashmi won the Virginia lieutenant governor’s race, becoming the first South Asian to hold statewide office in the state and the first Muslim woman ever elected to a statewide post in the United States. And in New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race. Spanberger defeated Republican Earle-Sears in the Virginia governor’s race, flipping control of the state and making her the first woman ever to serve as the state governor. A former congresswoman and CIA officer, Spanberger maintained a consistent lead over Earle-Sears through most of the campaign, buoyed by strong fundraising and strong support in the state’s suburban counties. Her victory gives Democrats a significant boost as they seek to regain political footing following their 2024 national election losses. Spanberger, 47, centred her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well as public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her loyalty to Trump. Earle-Sears, 61, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message. “We sent a message to the world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship,” Spanberger said in her victory speech. “We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.” “You all chose leadership that will focus relentlessly on what matters most: lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian,” she said. Separately, Democrat Sherrill won New Jersey’s election for governor. Sherrill, a US representative and former Navy pilot, defeated Republican Jack Ciattarelli and will succeed Democratic Governor Phil Murphy. It is the first time since the 1960s that New Jersey voters have elected governors from the same party for three consecutive terms. Uphill battle The races offered the beleaguered Democratic Party a test of differing campaign playbooks a year ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when control of Congress will be at stake. Since Trump’s win last year, Democrats have found themselves locked out of power in Washington and struggling to find the best path out of the political wilderness. Reacting to Republican losses, Trump cited unspecified pollsters who attributed the loss to the ongoing government shutdown and Trump not leading the ballot. “‘TRUMP WASN’T ON THE BALLOT, AND SHUTDOWN, WERE THE TWO REASONS THAT REPUBLICANS LOST ELECTIONS TONIGHT,’ according to Pollsters,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Prominent business people, including Bill Ackman, had noisily attacked Mamdani and funnelled cash to his rivals, while conservative media, including The New York Post , published blanket negative coverage. Mamdani’s improbable rise highlights the Democratic Party’s debate over a centrist or a leftist future, with some leading national figures offering only tepid endorsements of Mamdani ahead of voting. Syracuse University political science professor Grant Reeher said ahead of the result that Mamdani would face an uphill battle. “Everybody’s got their knives out, and it’s a very difficult city to govern,” he told AFP .",
