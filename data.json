      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi reached Karachi on Friday, beginning his three-day visit to Sindh as part of mobilisation efforts for PTI’s street movement. Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani welcomed him at the airport. A video released from the minister’s office showed Ghani receiving Afridi and the two hugging at the airport. Ghani was also seen presenting Afridi a Sindhi cap and Ajrak. The party’s secretary general Salman Akram Raja has also reached Karachi. Videos shared by the PTI on X showed a large crowd gathered at the airport to welcome Afridi. Afridi boarded the flight for Karachi from the Islamabad airport, where he faced flight delays. KP Minister for Local Government Meena Khan Afridi, who is accompanying the chief minister, said in a post on X prior to their departure that their flight had been delayed. PTI alleges dismantling of tents Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had removed the tents put up outside the party‘s head office near the nursery area for the KP CM’s reception. He, however, clarified that the office had not been sealed by police. Previously, the PTI had alleged in a post on social media platform X that Sindh police had sealed the Insaf Secretariat in Karachi and dismantled a camp installed there for Afridi’s welcome. Bozdar said CM Afridi was expected to address party workers and leaders at the head office, where he would be taken from the airport. He also said he had spoken to police and Sindh government officials, who have assured that the tents would be returned. He added that the officials also assured that the party would be allowed to hold a gathering but was asked not to block roads. Dawn reached out to police for a comment but there was no response from their side. Afridi to hold gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday Before departing for Karachi, the KP chief minister said in a post on X that he was bringing party founder Imran Khan’s “message” to the province. “My visit is for three days and during this time we have planned various activities,” the chief minister said, urging people to support the street movement. KP CM announced that he would be holding a gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday at 4:30pm, calling on people to participate in the gathering. “We will hold the biggest gathering in Karachi’s history,” CM Afridi said. For its part, the authorities in Sindh initially said Afridi would not be allowed to hold a public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid but later, a provincial minister announced a change in the decision. A notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office initially cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold the gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid and asked the PTI to propose an alternative venue. However, later Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement issued by his office that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid. “We will fully welcome KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in the province,” he said, adding that the peaceful struggle of any political party, including the PTI, could not be stopped. But, he also warned that “difficulties could arise in the law is violated”. “There is no restriction on the rally. They have sought permission for holding rallies in South and Korangi districts. They have sought permission for a rally at Jinnah Ground and they are being given permission for that,” he said. “We are in talks with the PTI leadership and they can definitely be given permission for holding the rally in accordance with the law.” What‘s on CM’s agenda? The KP CM, during his three-day visit, will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister. On Monday, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, shared the CM Afridi’s schedule for the visit. He detailed that CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on January 9 and arrive in Karachi, where he will be received by party workers and supporters. A rally will then accompany him to Insaf House, followed by a series of meetings with party leaders and delegations. His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a meeting with the Press at the Karachi Press Club (KPC), and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir. He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice. The momentum will carry into Jan 10 as CM Afridi travels to Hyderabad. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah. The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the High Court Bar Association and Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad. The PTI Sindh chapter president had also said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on January 12, pending official confirmation. Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — undertaken for the same purpose — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.",

Afridi to hold gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday Before departing for Karachi, the KP chief minister said in a post on X that he was bringing party founder Imran Khan’s “message” to the province. “My visit is for three days and during this time we have planned various activities,” the chief minister said, urging people to support the street movement. KP CM announced that he would be holding a gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday at 4:30pm, calling on people to participate in the gathering. “We will hold the biggest gathering in Karachi’s history,” CM Afridi said. For its part, the authorities in Sindh initially said Afridi would not be allowed to hold a public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid but later, a provincial minister announced a change in the decision. A notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office initially cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold the gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid and asked the PTI to propose an alternative venue. However, later Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement issued by his office that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid. “We will fully welcome KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in the province,” he said, adding that the peaceful struggle of any political party, including the PTI, could not be stopped. But, he also warned that “difficulties could arise in the law is violated”. “There is no restriction on the rally. They have sought permission for holding rallies in South and Korangi districts. They have sought permission for a rally at Jinnah Ground and they are being given permission for that,” he said. “We are in talks with the PTI leadership and they can definitely be given permission for holding the rally in accordance with the law.” What‘s on CM’s agenda? The KP CM, during his three-day visit, will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister. On Monday, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, shared the CM Afridi’s schedule for the visit. He detailed that CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on January 9 and arrive in Karachi, where he will be received by party workers and supporters. A rally will then accompany him to Insaf House, followed by a series of meetings with party leaders and delegations. His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a meeting with the Press at the Karachi Press Club (KPC), and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir. He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice. The momentum will carry into Jan 10 as CM Afridi travels to Hyderabad. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah. The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the High Court Bar Association and Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad. The PTI Sindh chapter president had also said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on January 12, pending official confirmation. Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — undertaken for the same purpose — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.",

      "summary": "KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi reached Karachi on Friday, beginning his three-day visit to Sindh as part of mobilisation efforts for PTI’s street movement. Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani welcomed him at the airport. A video released from the minister’s office showed Ghani receiving Afridi and the two hugging at the airport. Ghani was also seen presenting Afridi a Sindhi cap and Ajrak. The party’s secretary general Salman Akram Raja has also reached Karachi. Videos shared by the PTI on X showed a large crowd gathered at the airport to welcome Afridi. Afridi boarded the flight for Karachi from the Islamabad airport, where he faced flight delays. KP Minister for Local Government Meena Khan Afridi, who is accompanying the chief minister, said in a post on X prior to their departure that their flight had been delayed. PTI alleges dismantling of tents Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had removed the tents put up outside the party‘s head office near the nursery area for the KP CM’s reception. He, however, clarified that the office had not been sealed by police. Previously, the PTI had alleged in a post on social media platform X that Sindh police had sealed the Insaf Secretariat in Karachi and dismantled a camp installed there for Afridi’s welcome. Bozdar said CM Afridi was expected to address party workers and leaders at the head office, where he would be taken from the airport. He also said he had spoken to police and Sindh government officials, who have assured that the tents would be returned. He added that the officials also assured that the party would be allowed to hold a gathering but was asked not to block roads.

The US president had stated earlier that the US was watching the situation in Iran “very closely”. “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump had said. Khamenei on Friday also accused protesters of acting on behalf of Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as “mercenaries for foreigners”. Khamenei said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians” and predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution. Iranians staged their biggest protests yet of an almost two-week movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, chanting slogans including “death to the dictator” and setting fire to official buildings, videos showed on Friday. Internet monitor Netblocks said authorities had imposed a total connectivity blackout late on Thursday and added early on Friday that the country has “now been offline for 12 hours … in an attempt to suppress sweeping protests”. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has reported at least 34 protesters and four security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest, which analysts say highlights deeper disillusionment with the status quo. Authorities have tried to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while responding to some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.",

      "summary": "Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Friday told US President Donald Trump to focus on the problems in his own country. The US president had stated earlier that the US was watching the situation in Iran “very closely”. “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump had said. Khamenei on Friday also accused protesters of acting on behalf of Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as “mercenaries for foreigners”. Khamenei said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians” and predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution. Iranians staged their biggest protests yet of an almost two-week movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, chanting slogans including “death to the dictator” and setting fire to official buildings, videos showed on Friday. Internet monitor Netblocks said authorities had imposed a total connectivity blackout late on Thursday and added early on Friday that the country has “now been offline for 12 hours … in an attempt to suppress sweeping protests”. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has reported at least 34 protesters and four security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest, which analysts say highlights deeper disillusionment with the status quo.

      "summary_orig": "PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar on Thursday said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. He made the remarks while speaking alongside a delegation of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in Lahore, which is on a three-day visit to the city as part of the opposition’s “ street movement ” to hold political and social gatherings. The alliance posted on X that TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas arrived on Friday at a gathering held at the residence of Advocate Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas, where a large number of journalists, political leaders and PTI workers were present. Speaking during the gathering, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar welcomed the TTAP delegation to Lahore. He urged the TTAP to use its platform to push for a meeting with Imran, who has not been allowed visitors in recent weeks. “No talks or dialogue can start until meetings are allowed with Imran,” he said. Zafar assured the TTAP of “full cooperation and support from [PTI’s] leaders and workers in Lahore”. He stressed that the top priority at the moment was the protection of Pakistan‘s sovereignty. In this regard, he said that Imran’s release was “the need of the time”. “The government cannot take any such step that will harm Pakistan‘s future or is against Pakistan’s sovereignty,” he said. Zafar expressed gratitude to the TTAP leadership for their visit, stating, “The difficulties you faced in reaching here, I would like to say that we face it every day here.“ On Thursday, Achakzai, who led the TTAP caravan from Islamabad to Lahore, had urged the nation and political parties to support its wheel-jam and shutter-down strike to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8 elections, saying the protest would also pave the way for talks with the government. The PTI had also accused the Punjab police of a crackdown on its supporters ahead of Achakzai’s visit, saying its workers were rounded up by the police in late-night raids while the caravan was also attacked by “masked individuals” on its way to the provincial capital. Speaking to reporters, Achakzai said a powerful protest would exert pressure on the government to hold talks with the opposition and release its leader, Imran.",

He made the remarks while speaking alongside a delegation of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in Lahore, which is on a three-day visit to the city as part of the opposition’s “ street movement ” to hold political and social gatherings. The alliance posted on X that TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas arrived on Friday at a gathering held at the residence of Advocate Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas, where a large number of journalists, political leaders and PTI workers were present.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Pakistan has called for the launch of a high-level economic dialogue with the United States at the earliest and urged a shift in bilateral engagement from geopolitics to geoeconomics during a series of meetings between the country’s envoy Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and senior members of Congress. Meeting House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US said 2026 should be treated as a “year of action” to translate shared intentions into concrete economic cooperation. “Our focus is shifting from geopolitics to geoeconomics,” he said, according to one of two handouts issued after the meeting, and stressed the need for institutionalised engagement in sectors such as energy, defence, minerals, information technology and artificial intelligence. Ambassador Sheikh said Pakistan’s low-cost, high-quality manufacturing base positioned it well to meet growing US market needs, highlighting surgical instruments, textiles and sports goods as areas with strong export potential. He said that “2026 should be the year of action for a long-term, sustainable partnership based on economic cooperation”, noting that footballs manufactured in Sialkot had been used in five consecutive Fifa World Cups. US State Secretary Marco Rubio has recently spoken positively about expanding ties with Pakistan, describing the relationship as one with significant untapped potential. “We see an opportunity to expand our strategic relationship with Pakistan,” Rubio said in October 2025, adding that Washington valued Islamabad’s long history of cooperation, particularly in counter-terrorism. At the same time, Rubio sought to reassure regional partners, saying that closer engagement with Pakistan does not come at the expense of US ties with India. “I don’t think anything we’re doing with Pakistan comes at the expense of our relationship or friendship with India, which is deep, historic, and important,” he had said, describing US policy as pragmatic and interest-based. US President Donald Trump, however, has also highlighted strains in Washington’s dealings with New Delhi. Speaking at a political gathering this week, Trump said : “I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Modi … he’s not that happy with me because they’re paying a lot of tariffs now,” referring to trade and energy-related differences between the two countries. Meanwhile, in his meeting with US lawmakers, Ambassador Sheikh also praised the US president’s political judgment and personal engagement in helping de-escalate tensions following the military escalation between Islamabad and New Delhi in May 2025. According to the handouts, the discussions in Washington also focused on regional security challenges, with the Pakistani ambassador warning that terrorism originating from Afghanistan continued to pose serious threats to Pakistan’s security as well as to regional and international peace. He told congressional leaders that terrorist incidents in Pakistan increased by 40 per cent in 2024 and by a further 25pc in 2025, attributing the rise to militant groups operating from Afghan soil. He expressed concern over the continued misuse of advanced weapons left behind during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Addressing South Asian tensions, Ambassador Sheikh referred to the events of May 2025 and said India’s “irresponsible and aggressive behaviour” had lowered the threshold of escalation in the region. He warned that confrontation between two nuclear-armed neighbours had moved beyond conventional conflict to include advanced technologies, describing the use of dual-capable weapons in a region of 1.7 billion people as deeply alarming. Ambassador Sheikh cautioned that decisions based on misperceptions or miscalculations could undermine regional peace and reiterated that the unresolved issue of Kashmir and the right of self-determination of its people remained central to lasting stability in South Asia. Both sides agreed on the need to institutionalise structured and regular dialogue on issues of mutual interest, including economic cooperation and security. Ambassador Sheikh also extended invitations to congressional leaders to visit Pakistan to strengthen parliamentary and people-to-people ties. About his meeting with Rogers, the envoy said on X that the two discussed the “ascendantly evolving Pak-US partnership”. “Focused on regional security challenges, the escalating and sponsored terrorism from Afghanistan, and the subsequently urgent need to address the leftover military equipment. Emphasised that a stable, standalone Pak-US relationship remained vital to regional as well as global peace, security and stability,” he said. About his meeting with Mast, the ambassador said he thanked him for his leadership and continued support during a year of positive trajectory in Pak-US relations. “Noted that 2026 must be a year of action — moving from good intent to concrete content based on structured and sustained engagement, geared to translating our ties into a long-term partnership on its own merits,” he said. “Also exchanged views on regional and global developments. Sought support for enhanced counterterror cooperation, and invited him to visit Pakistan,“ he said.",

      "summary_orig": "The visa sections of three Bangladesh missions in India have been closed temporarily on security grounds, Foreign Affairs Adviser Touhid Hossain said on Friday. “What I have done is that I have asked our three missions to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It’s a security issue,” he told reporters at the foreign ministry, responding to a question on whether Bangladesh missions in India had restricted tourist visas for Indians. He did not name the missions. However, diplomatic sources said the visa sections of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, the Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, and the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala have been closed. The visa sections at Bangladesh missions in Chennai and Mumbai, however, remain operational, sources said. Over the past few weeks, protests have taken place near Bangladesh missions in India. Following the ouster of the Awami League regime, the Indian High Commission restricted tourist visas to Bangladeshis, citing security concerns. Touhid was also asked about the dropping of Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman from the Indian Premier League amid anti-Bangladesh protests in India, and Bangladesh’s decision not to send the national cricket team to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup. The adviser said he fully supported Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul’s stance on not sending the team to India for safety reasons and demanding that Bangladesh’s matches be relocated to co-host Sri Lanka. “We will certainly play outside India,” Touhid said. He added that both players and supporters would have to travel to India and said the government must consider their security. Asked about the impact on bilateral relations, Touhid said such issues arise from time to time and each has some impact. He said Bangladesh would take decisions based on its national interest. “We have an interest in our players’ safety in not sending them to India. If we have interest in buying rice from India, we will buy it,” he added. This article was originally published on The Daily Star , an ANN partner of Dawn.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Thursday said that land strikes against drug cartels were on the way following maritime attacks in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, without providing further details. “We are going to start now hitting land with regard to the cartels. The cartels are running Mexico,” Trump told broadcaster Sean Hannity in an interview on Fox News that aired on Thursday night. Trump’s comments come after the brazen abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicholas Maduro last weekend, the culmination of months of mounting US military and economic pressure on the leftist leader. As part of that campaign, the United States has killed more than 100 people in strikes on alleged drug boats since September, and Trump has also said that the US forces conducted a land strike on a docking area for such vessels in Venezuela. But strikes on cartels in Mexico would mark a significant US military escalation. The left-wing interim government in Caracas has condemned US strikes on Venezuela as a threat to regional stability. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said Monday that the Americas “do not belong” to any power, after Trump invoked Washington’s “dominance” of the hemisphere after seizing Maduro. Trump said on Sunday he was pushing Sheinbaum to let him send US troops to tackle drug cartels in Mexico, an offer he said she had previously rebuffed.",

The instruction was rel­ayed by Hafiz Gul Baha­dur, who heads the so-cal­led Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan , in an audio message released to his cadres a few days ago, The Khorasan Diary reported. This also seems to fly in the face of Kabul’s stance that the terrorist threat plaguing Pakistan is “an internal problem”. The issue of Afghan soil and fighters being used to stage terrorist attacks in Pakistan has remained a critical bone of contention between Islamabad and Afghanistan, escalating into border skirmishes and leading to the eventual closure of the Pak-Afghan border in October last year. In recent months, Pakis­tan’s civilian and military leadership has maintained that the terrorism plaguing the country originated from Afghanistan. The instruction from Gul Bahadur comes in the backdrop of pressure from the Afghan Taliban on their Pakistani comrades — in the face of rising international pressure — and follows a decree by a council of religious scholars, pledging that Afghan soil would not be used against a foreign country. Issued in Kabul early last month, the decree followed a similar statement by the Afghan Taliban su­­preme leader Hibatul­lah Akhundzada, which had largely gone unheeded.

      "summary_orig": "• Saudi-backed coalition tracks Al Zubaidi’s escape by boat, then by plane • Presidential council ousts him; pursues high treason charges • Deep rifts emerge within Southern Transitional Council ADEN: The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen said on Thursday that southern separatist lea­der, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, has fled the country by boat, as government forces advanced on the port city of Aden. The coalition said in a statement that Zubaidi travelled from Yemen to Somaliland, where he boarded an aircraft to Mogadishu. The coalition stated the plane was later tracked to a military airport in Abu Dhabi. The Somali government announced it has launched an investigation to determine if its airports were used to transport a “political fugitive”, a reference to Zubaidi. The country’s Immigration and Citizenship Agency said that if this proved to be true, it would constitute a “serious violation” of national sovereignty. Zubaidi’s escape follows his failure to appear for crisis talks in Riyadh on Wednesday. His group, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), claimed he had been asked to go to Saudi Arabia under threat. In a statement, the Saudi-led coalition provided further details about the flight from Somaliland. It said the aircraft turned off its identification system over the Gulf of Oman before turning it back on 10 minutes before its arrival at Al Reef military airport in Abu Dhabi. The situation in Aden appeared stable on Thursday, with Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces patrolling the streets and no sign of STC forces, a witness told Reuters . Authorities have also imposed a nighttime curfew in the city. Aden served as the seat of Yemen’s internationally recognised government since Houthi forces seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, but leaders of the Saudi-backed government left Aden last month after the STC took control of the city. The Saudi-led coalition first intervened in Yemen in 2015 to support the government against the Houthis, an intervention that led to one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The STC was established in 2017 and later joined the government coalition. An STC delegation in Riyadh said it had held fruitful talks with the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, according to comments by Mohammed Al Ghaith, a senior official of the group. Meanwhile, Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council on Thursday ousted the separatist leader from its ranks and referred him for investigation on charges of high treason after he fled the country, according to Arab News . The council held an emergency meeting, revoking Zubaidi’s membership and dismissing two ministers, Transport Minister Abdul­salam Humaid and Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Waed Badhib, from their posts. The meeting also revealed a split within the STC, as one of its prominent members, Abdulrahman Al-Muharrami, attended the session that voted to oust Zubaidi. Al-Muharrami’s Giants Brigades forces have also been deployed to help prevent security breakdowns in Aden in coordination with the government, officials said. Published in Dawn, January 9th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The International Crisis Group (ICG) says Pakistan is the worst-affected country by the Tali­ban’s 2021 takeover of Afgha­nistan, noting that even though a ceasefire holds for now, Islamabad is likely to strike again if militant violence persists. The Brussels-based independent and non-profit think tank, founded by prominent statesmen, says in a new report that relations between the two countries have tanked , mainly because of the Afghan Taliban’s refusal to crack down on the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Since 2022, violence in Pakistan has spiralled. In 2025 alone, militants killed more than 600 Pakistani soldiers and police, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the two provinces bordering Afghanistan. Islamabad blames the banned TTP for these attacks, along with Baloch insurgent groups, which it believes with evidence, are backed by arch-rival India. Brussels-based think tank says Islamabad may strike Afghanistan again if militant attacks continue “UN monitors assert that the TTP enjoys Taliban support, but the Taliban publicly deny that Pakistani militants are even in Afghanistan and say Islamabad provoked what they paint as homegrown violence,” according to the report. On its western flank, after 11 Pakistani military personnel were martyred in a TTP attack on Oct 8, Islamabad conducted cross-border airstrikes, including its first-ever strike on Kabul, ostensibly targeting TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud. Afghanistan retaliated with attacks on Pakistani military installations. Continued fighting claimed military and civilian lives on both sides. The report cautions that Islamabad is likely to lash out again if it traces another strike back to Afghanistan. The Taliban regime is badly outgunned, but its retaliation could still be lethal. Kabul claims to have missiles that can reach Pakistani cities, the use of which would likely provoke an even stronger Pakistani response. South Asia In South Asia, however, Islamabad’s foreign relations are far more fraught. After short wars in 2025 with both Afghanistan and India , another major attack by militants could upend the precarious calm that prevails between Pakistan and its two neighbours. The report lists 10 conflicts to watch in 2026: Afghanistan-Pakistan, Myan­mar, Israel and the United States versus Iran, Israel-Palestine, Syria, Ukraine, Mali and Burkina Faso, Ethiopia-Eritrea, Sudan, and Venezuela. The report says the world was careening into a dangerous new era well before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Thus far, his second term has done less to slow things down than to put a foot on the gas. The year 2025 was a bloody one, and 2026 promises little better. ‘Trump effect’ Less predictable has been President Trump, whose first year back in the White House has turned world politics and international crisis management on their heads. Trump returned to power pledging to bring peace to a world ablaze. He has put himself centre stage in many wars and trouble spots. Trump has brought fresh attention to peacemaking after years in which diplomatic efforts to end conflicts had been flailing. But Trump has not calmed the global turmoil he decried on the campaign trail. In some cases, he has made it worse. His deals, often built on other countries’ diplomacy, have brought respite to some battlefields but delivered no lasting peace anywhere. Trump’s deal-making aims to bring US power to bear, whether in Gaza , by leveraging Israel’s dependency on Washington, or elsewhere, mostly by threatening tariffs or dangling business opportunities. Trump’s bargaining must be set against the dearth of peace deals that preceded his return to power as well as the lack of progress in places where he does not engage. European leaders, for example, focused on the existential peril they see on their doorstep, have less bandwidth for peacemaking elsewhere, the report says. Published in Dawn, January 9th, 2026",

I hope he doesn’t do that.” Trump made the comments in the context of an exchange about what lessons Xi might take away from Trump‘s audacious military operation in Venezuela and the abduction of the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro. The Republican president said he did not view the situations as analogous because Taiwan did not pose the same type of threat to China that he has said the government of Maduro posed to the United States. He also repeated his belief that Xi would not make a move against Taiwan during his presidency, which ends in 2029. “He may do it after we have a different president, but I don‘t think he’s going to do it with me as president,” Trump said. The Trump administration said in a strategy document last year that it aims to prevent conflict with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea by building up US and allies’ military power. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s claims. The Taiwan question is purely China‘s internal affair, and how to resolve it is a matter purely within China’s sovereign rights, said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington. The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is the island’s most important international backer and is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The issue has been an irritant in US-China relations for years. Trump has largely avoided directly saying how he would respond to a rise in tensions over the island.",

      "summary": "US President Donald Trump said “it’s up to” Chinese President Xi Jinping what China does on Taiwan, but that he would be “very unhappy” with a change in the status quo, according to an interview the New York Times published on Thursday. “He (Xi) considers it to be a part of China, and that‘s up to him what he’s going to be doing,” Trump told the newspaper on Wednesday. “But I‘ve expressed to him that I would be very unhappy if he did that, and I don’t think he‘ll do that. I hope he doesn’t do that.” Trump made the comments in the context of an exchange about what lessons Xi might take away from Trump‘s audacious military operation in Venezuela and the abduction of the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro. The Republican president said he did not view the situations as analogous because Taiwan did not pose the same type of threat to China that he has said the government of Maduro posed to the United States. He also repeated his belief that Xi would not make a move against Taiwan during his presidency, which ends in 2029. “He may do it after we have a different president, but I don‘t think he’s going to do it with me as president,” Trump said. The Trump administration said in a strategy document last year that it aims to prevent conflict with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea by building up US and allies’ military power. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s claims. The Taiwan question is purely China‘s internal affair, and how to resolve it is a matter purely within China’s sovereign rights, said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington. The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is the island’s most important international backer and is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. The issue has been an irritant in US-China relations for years. Trump has largely avoided directly saying how he would respond to a rise in tensions over the island.",

      "summary_orig": "A US immigration agent shot and wounded a man and a woman in Portland, Oregon, authorities said on Thursday, leading local officials to call for calm given public outrage over the ICE shooting death of a Minnesota woman a day earlier. “We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more,” Portland police chief Bob Day said in a statement. The Portland shooting unfolded on Thursday afternoon as US Border Patrol agents were conducting a targeted vehicle stop, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement. The statement said the driver, a suspected Venezuelan gang member, attempted to “weaponise” his vehicle and run over the agents. In response, DHS said, “an agent fired a defensive shot” and the driver and a passenger drove away. Reuters was unable to independently verify the circumstances of the incident. Portland police said that the shooting took place near a medical clinic in eastern Portland. Six minutes after arriving at the scene and determining federal agents were involved in the shooting, police were informed that two people with gunshot wounds — a man and a woman — were asking for help at a location about 3 km to the northeast of the medical clinic. Police said they applied tourniquets to the man and woman, who were taken to a hospital. Their condition was unknown. The shooting came just a day after a federal agent from US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a separate agency within the Department of Homeland Security, fatally shot a 37-year-old mother of three in her car in Minneapolis. That shooting has prompted two days of protests in Minneapolis. Officers from both ICE and Border Patrol have been deployed in cities across the United States as part of Republican President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. While the aggressive enforcement operations have been cheered by the president’s supporters, Democrats and civil rights activists have decried the posture as an unnecessary provocation. US officials contend criminal suspects and anti-Trump activists have increasingly used their cars as weapons, though video evidence has sometimes contradicted their claims. Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a statement his city was now grappling with violence at the hands of federal agents and that “we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts”. He called on ICE to halt all its operations in the city until an investigation can be completed. “Federal militarisation undermines effective, community-based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region,” Wilson said. “I will use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”",

      "summary_orig": "Fighting intensified on Thursday between Syrian government troops and Kurdish fighters in the northern city of Aleppo, with a fierce exchange of fire extending into the night and rescue workers scrambling to put out fires ignited by the shelling. Plumes of smoke rose above the city skyline at dusk and the boom of artillery could be heard across Aleppo as the Kurdish fighters tried to repel the troops’ advance and cling to neighbourhoods under their control. The fighting, which erupted on Tuesday, has driven more than 140,000 people from their homes and left at least seven civilians dead, according to Syrian authorities. The deadly stand-off between Damascus and Kurdish authorities, who have resisted integrating into the central government, is a major challenge for Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has pledged to unite the country after 14 years of civil war. Stalled talks on ceasefire Syria’s army gave a window on Thursday for residents to evacuate the neighbourhoods held by Kurdish forces in Aleppo before launching new strikes there. It released more than seven maps identifying areas it said would be targeted and announced a curfew in the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh from 1200 GMT. This picture taken on January 8, 2026 shows columns of smoke rising from Aleppo’s Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh neighborhoods amid intense clashes between government forces and the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) forces. —AFP The Kurdish forces, including the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Asayish, or internal security forces, said they had pushed back Syrian troops’ attacks. Syrian sources told Reuters the US was spearheading efforts to reach a ceasefire. SDF head Mazloum Abdi said the government forces’ strikes and deployment of tanks had undermined “the chances of reaching understandings, create conditions for dangerous demographic changes, and expose civilians trapped in the two neighbourhoods to the risk of massacres”. Two government officials told Reuters that negotiations were underway over the withdrawal of Kurdish forces from the city. The Asayish, in a written statement, denied that its forces had requested safe passage and called instead on the Damascus government to withdraw its forces. “The attacks carried out against civilians in Aleppo have unfortunately exacerbated concerns about the true intentions of the SDF and created a pessimistic picture regarding peace efforts,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told a joint press conference with his Omani counterpart on Thursday. “The SDF’s insistence on protecting what it has at all costs is the biggest obstacle to achieving peace and stability in Syria,” Fidan added. Turkey views the US-backed SDF, which controls swathes of northeastern Syria, as a terrorist organisation and has warned of military action if the group does not honour the integration agreement. Accusations of ethnic cleansing The Kurdistan Regional Government’s Prime Minister Masrour Barzani said he was deeply concerned by attacks on Kurdish neighbourhoods in Aleppo, warning that targeting civilians and attempts to alter the area’s demography amounted to what he described as ethnic cleansing. Barzani called on all sides to exercise restraint, protect civilians and pursue dialogue. Members of the Syrian army help a woman as she flees following renewed clashes between the Syrian army and the Syrian Democratic Forces, in Aleppo, Syria, January 8, 2026. —Reuters The SDF said Damascus’s evacuation warnings ahead of shelling could amount to forced displacement and war crimes under international humanitarian law. Kurdish-led authorities established a semi-autonomous administration in northeast Syria and parts of Aleppo during Syria’s 14-year war and have resisted fully integrating into the new government that took power after former President Bashar al-Assad was ousted in late 2024. Damascus reached a deal with the SDF last year that envisaged full integration by the end of 2025, but progress has been limited, with both sides accusing the other of stalling. The US has sought to mediate, holding meetings as recently as Sunday, though those talks ended without tangible results.",

      "summary_orig": "PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said on Thursday that negotiations with the federal government would not take place if party founder Imran Khan is not present. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, Raja said that the party’s stance on talks is very clear: “You cannot come into our house, attack us, loot us and then invite us for negotiations. “Give us an agenda, tell us what topics will be discussed,” he added. “We cannot negotiate in Imran Khan’s absence. You cannot expect to put him in a black hole while everyone else talks and the PM eats biscuits. It will not happen like that.” Raja continued, recounting that between December 2024 and January 2025, they wanted to meet Imran and have him present at the talks, but that was not authorised. He added that judicial probes into the riots on May 9, 2023, and the PTI’s Islamabad march on November 26, 2024, were also denied. “The plan seems to be an effort to bury the attack on voters on February 8, 2024, and move on from it,” the party official claimed, referring to the date of the last general elections, which the PTI has repeatedly claimed were rigged. When asked about whether talks would happen on January 12, as per Federal Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Raja replied that he was not aware of the date. In response to another question about differing party views on talks, Raja emphasised that Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Imran’s sister Aleema Khan were on the same page. “This past Tuesday, Achakzai sahib and Aleema were present outside Adiala jail. Together, they spoke with the press,” the secretary general replied. “They’re saying the same thing: talks will only happen when the powers that be realise that the Pakistani people are tired of them and the system. It’s a system where people are struggling to find livelihoods, health and education. We need to express our displeasure.” Raja further added that Achakzai had travelled from Islamabad to Lahore today for street mobilisation , but claimed that the TTAP chief was stopped several times along the route and several PTI workers had been arrested and “someone had died”. “How can talks happen in this environment, if you are not willing to give even a little bit of political space?” he asked. “You have denied two distinguished gentlemen passage from Islamabad to Lahore and have turned Lahore into a battleground. And you want us to sit and talk? “Negotiations do not happen in a graveyard or a jail, they require space.” On December 23, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. Since then, the PTI has said that it would not come to the table , citing instructions from Imran. However, the TTAP opposition alliance, of which the PTI is a part, has stated its openness to talks. Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said that “ confidence-building measures ” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation. “Two of them are my leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif. The third is President Asif Ali Zardari, the fourth is [incarcerated PTI leader] Imran Khan, and everyone knows who the fifth is,” Sanaullah said. In response to Sanaullah, PTI Chief Whip Malik Amir Dogar said the government should arrange a meeting between Achakzai, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and the incarcerated PTI founder. “Hopefully, a path will be made,” he added.",
