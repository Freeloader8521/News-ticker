      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The leadership of the PTI and the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Thursday unanimously announced that they would not compromise on the health of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, and urged the nation to join the nationwide shutter-down strike scheduled for February 8 (Sunday). The remarks were made during a meeting of the PTI’s joint parliamentary committee at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The meeting was attended by prominent political leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, and PTI stalwarts Asad Qaiser and Taimoor Saleem Jhagra, among others. The meeting was closed off to the media. Addressing the participants, Qaiser said that the meeting was called because of Imran’s health. He said that representatives of 40 million people were in attendance and unanimously announced that they would not compromise on the health of the PTI founder. “Don’t push us against the wall; otherwise, all options are open,” Qaiser said in a warning to the ‘powers that be’. Talking about the Feb 8 protest, he said, “Today, we pledge that we will make the protest successful.” He further said that the PTI would meet the Supreme Court chief justice at 10am on Friday and share the resolution passed by today’s meeting regarding Imran’s health. Reading out the declaration, Qaiser said that the meeting, chaired by Achakzai, expressed concerns over the PTI founder’s health and demanded that his visitation rights be restored. The meeting also expressed concern over the law and order situation in Balochistan, which witnessed a spate of attacks over the weekend, and showed solidarity with the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country. Additionally, the participants demanded that steps be taken to ensure the welfare of the people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah and to rehome those who had been displaced . They also elected to intensify the PTI’s ongoing street movement , so that the nationwide protest would be successful. The participants also condemned the arrest of party leaders and workers in Sindh and announced that rallies would be staged after Isha prayers on February 8. They also showed solidarity with the people of Indian-occupied Kashmir and emphasised their right to self-determination. They also denounced the revocation of Article 370-A by the Indian parliament in 2019, which stripped the region of its autonomy. However, the participants expressed their appreciation for the meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and KP CM Afridi, demanding that the province’s dues be cleared. Before attending the meeting, Raja said that all issues, including the upcoming protests, would be discussed during at the gathering. He further said that a statement by Achakzai and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas had been misunderstood, as they said that it would not be a one-day protest. “They meant that the struggle for democracy will carry on even after February 8,” he clarified. The development comes after the government last week admitted that Imran was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), days after reports regarding the treatment of the ex-premier emerged in mainstream media. Speaking to Geo News , Tarar said the former premier, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, was taken to Pims in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24. He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”. Subsequently, the Pims executive director, Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, said that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention. Achakzai on Tuesday wrote a letter to PM Shehbaz, seeking his “personal intervention” for the PTI founder’s medical examination by the jailed leader’s “trusted” doctors. Meanwhile, the PTI has called a massive nationwide shutter-down strike on February 8 against the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections.",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Train services were restored in Balochistan on Thursday, after five days of suspension, as the tense security situation eased following a series of counter-terrorism operations in response to a spate of attacks in the province. However, mobile data services remained suspended for the sixth day in Quetta and some other districts. “Train services within Balochistan and to other provinces have been,” Muhammad Kashif, spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, confirmed to Dawn . He particularly mentioned that the services of the Jaffar Express train on the Quetta-Peshawar route and the Karachi-bound Bolan Mail had been suspended since January 31. The railway official added that both had been restored now. He further said that operations of the Quetta-Chaman passenger train had also resumed, and it departed today at its scheduled time. On the other hand, mobile data services remained suspended in the provincial capital for the sixth consecutive day. The mobile internet was still inaccessible in Quetta, Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat told Dawn . However, it was expected to be restored till 12am, he said. Mobile data also reportedly remained suspended in the Nushki, Sibi and Mastung districts. The services have also been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns. Separately, Balochistan Special Assistant to the Balochistan CM on Politics Shahid Rind said during a press conference in Quetta that examinations for grades 8 and 9 in the provincial capital would be held as per the schedule, and the polio campaign would continue as planned except in Nushki. “National highways in the province have been cleared, except for an area of Noshki, which is disturbed,” Rind added. “The PDMA (Provincial Disaster Management Authority) is working on it, it will be cleared within the next 12 to 24 hours.” The spokesperson said that all roads were open, though the standard operating procedure barring night travel remained in place. “In Noshki, the road was damaged by bombs, so teams from CNW (Communication and Works Department) and the PDMA (Provincial Disaster Management Authority) are working on repairs,” Rind said, adding that the repair work should be completed within the next 12 to 24 hours. After several days of “mop-up” actions in some parts in the wake of January 31 attacks , the military announced earlier today that security forces successfully concluded “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 36 civilians, including women and children, and 22 security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel were martyred as a result of the operations. “[…] a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed. On January 31, police said suspected explosive materials were found on a railway track in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district. Railway tracks are a frequent target of terrorists, with the Jaffar Express coming under attack several times over the past year. On the night of January 26, a blast on the railway track linking Sindh to Balochistan derailed four bogies of the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express train coming from Peshawar and damaged the track. The Jaffar Express had also escaped attacks in Nasirabad in October and November last year. Similar attempts also occurred during the two months in Kachhi and Sindh’s Shikarpur district.",

However, mobile data services remained suspended for the sixth day in Quetta and some other districts. “Train services within Balochistan and to other provinces have been,” Muhammad Kashif, spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, confirmed to Dawn . He particularly mentioned that the services of the Jaffar Express train on the Quetta-Peshawar route and the Karachi-bound Bolan Mail had been suspended since January 31. The railway official added that both had been restored now. He further said that operations of the Quetta-Chaman passenger train had also resumed, and it departed today at its scheduled time. On the other hand, mobile data services remained suspended in the provincial capital for the sixth consecutive day. The mobile internet was still inaccessible in Quetta, Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat told Dawn . However, it was expected to be restored till 12am, he said. Mobile data also reportedly remained suspended in the Nushki, Sibi and Mastung districts. The services have also been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns. Separately, Balochistan Special Assistant to the Balochistan CM on Politics Shahid Rind said during a press conference in Quetta that examinations for grades 8 and 9 in the provincial capital would be held as per the schedule, and the polio campaign would continue as planned except in Nushki. “National highways in the province have been cleared, except for an area of Noshki, which is disturbed,” Rind added. “The PDMA (Provincial Disaster Management Authority) is working on it, it will be cleared within the next 12 to 24 hours.” The spokesperson said that all roads were open, though the standard operating procedure barring night travel remained in place. “In Noshki, the road was damaged by bombs, so teams from CNW (Communication and Works Department) and the PDMA (Provincial Disaster Management Authority) are working on repairs,” Rind said, adding that the repair work should be completed within the next 12 to 24 hours. After several days of “mop-up” actions in some parts in the wake of January 31 attacks , the military announced earlier today that security forces successfully concluded “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 36 civilians, including women and children, and 22 security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel were martyred as a result of the operations. “[…] a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed. On January 31, police said suspected explosive materials were found on a railway track in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district. Railway tracks are a frequent target of terrorists, with the Jaffar Express coming under attack several times over the past year. On the night of January 26, a blast on the railway track linking Sindh to Balochistan derailed four bogies of the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express train coming from Peshawar and damaged the track. The Jaffar Express had also escaped attacks in Nasirabad in October and November last year. Similar attempts also occurred during the two months in Kachhi and Sindh’s Shikarpur district.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have successfully concluded “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in the days-long clearance actions against “Indian-sponsored terrorist elements”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday. “Security forces have successfully concluded Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 in Balochistan under which a series of coordinated, swift, and intelligence-driven operations were conducted against Indian-sponsored terrorist elements seeking to disrupt peace and development by targeting innocent civilians, including women and children,” the ISPR said in a press release. The development comes as security forces responded to a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days . “As a result of these well-coordinated engagements and subsequent clearance operations, 216 terrorists have been sent to hell, significantly degrading the leadership, command-and-control structures and operational capabilities of terrorist networks,” the military’s media affairs wing said. “Through meticulous planning, actionable intelligence, and seamless joint execution, Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs), with support of intelligence agencies, under Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 responded with precision and resolve,” the statement read. “During these operations, 36 innocent civilians, including women and children, embraced martyrdom, while 22 brave security forces and law enforcement agencies’ personnel made the ultimate sacrifice in defence of Pakistan’s territorial integrity and the protection of its citizens,” the ISPR stated. “Their courage, professionalism, and unwavering commitment reflect the highest traditions of service. The nation honours their sacrifice and stands in solidarity with the families of all martyrs,” the military said. Detailing the forces’ timely actions, the ISPR recalled that on January 29, “operations were initiated in Panjgur and the outskirts of Harnai District after credible and verified intelligence confirmed the presence of terrorist elements posing an imminent threat to local public”. “During this phase, security forces undertook operations against identified terrorist hideouts, resulting in the elimination of 41 terrorists affiliated with Indian proxy networks,” it noted. “Subsequently, aggressive and steadfast responses by the brave security forces effectively thwarted the desperate attacks of Fitna-al-Hindustan to destabilise the peace of Balochistan. “Sequel to these, a broader series of intelligence-based operations were launched in multiple areas to dismantle terrorist sleeper cells through sustained combing and sanitisation operations,” the ISPR detailed. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR stated that a “substantial cache of foreign-origin weapons, ammunition, explosives and equipment has also been recovered during the process”. “Preliminary analysis indicates systematic external facilitation and logistical support to these extremist proxies,” it observed. The military reaffirmed that the armed forces remained steadfast in their “resolve to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations under the ambit” of the government’s National Action Plan (NAP). It asserted that “counter-terrorism operations will continue with full determination until the complete elimination of terrorist threats”. “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 stands as a testament to Pakistan’s and particularly Balochistan’s proud peoples’ unwavering commitment to always prefer peace over violence, unity over division and development over violence,” the ISPR said. Following the January 31 attacks at multiple locations across Balochistan, security forces and LEAs continued “mop-up” actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province on Tuesday. Mobile internet had remained suspended in parts of the province for the fifth consecutive day on Wednesday, with provincial authorities also halting train services. President, PM hail forces for ‘crippling’ terrorists President Asif Ali Zardari commended security forces and law enforcement agencies over the successful completion of the operation in Balochistan, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. According to the report, in a statement, the president noted that the timely action of the security forces thwarted the nefarious attempts of Fitna-al-Hindustan to disrupt peace in Balochistan. “Eradication of foreign-backed terrorism is our top priority,” the report quoted him as saying. “The president expressed satisfaction that intelligence-based coordinated operations crippled the leadership and capacity of the foreign-backed terrorist networks,” the report read. It further said that President Zardari paid tribute to the innocent civilians and security personnel who were martyred during the operation, and expressed condolences to their families. “The nation salutes the sacrifices of martyrs and stands united against terrorism,” he said. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the officers and security forces personnel, as well as the leadership of the armed forces, for the success of Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1, Radio Pakistan reported. In his statement, PM Shehbaz praised the professional capabilities of the security forces for “breaking the backbone of enemies for peace and development” in Balochistan during the operation. The prime minister emphasised that the nation could never forget the sacrifices of its martyrs, Radio Pakistan said. “He vowed that the cowardly and malicious attempts by the terrorists to sabotage the peace of Balochistan through targeting innocent civilians would always be crushed,” the report read. “The terrorists have proved that they are enemies of development in the province and its people by targeting innocent civilians,” it quoted the premier as saying. PM Shehbaz vowed that the war against the “scourge of terrorism will continue until it is completely eradicated from the country”. “The entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with the armed forces in their unwavering determination to defend the homeland,“ he affirmed. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti, in a post on X, stated that the operation was a “clear message to those committing acts of bloodshed in Balochistan”. He maintained that the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was “a fitna targeting innocent civilians and labourers”, stressing that the group was working “at the behest of India”. “Pakistan will not compromise on its unity, development, and the protection of its people,” Bugti said. The chief minister warned that any effort to destabilise the country will be met with “a decisive response”. “The nation stands united, and any hand raised against Pakistan will not only be dealt with law and full force but will be broken,” he vowed. ‘Search and combing operations ongoing in Quetta’ Later, Balochistan CM’s spokesperson Shahid Rind said that while most areas had been cleared, search and combing operations were still ongoing in Quetta. “The situation across the province is normal, including in Nushki and Quetta,” he told reporters at a press conference in Quetta. “At least 100 suspects have been arrested during the combing and search operations in Quetta. They are being investigated.” Rind added that during the operations, “illegal small arms, recoilless rifles, anti-aircraft guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers were found in some homes”. “The identification of terrorists killed in the operations is ongoing,” further stated. He recalled that Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti previously said that “families whose children [had links] with terrorist organisations were requested to inform security institutions, district administration and political people about those children,” Rind said.“If they do not inform [the authorities] … action can be taken against the families, and the law has the provision for it.” Responding to a question, he said the terrorists’ target was the red zone in Quetta. “Balochistan police personnel and Frontier Corps soldiers kept the terrorists on their target until they were forced to move their vehicles from the spot.” Rind added that one of the challenges faced during the operation was that the terrorists had blended themselves among the people. “So, there was risk of collateral damage,” he said, adding that a similar problem was faced in Noshki. “We had to prevent collateral damage.” Asked if the Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) was on the target in the red zone, Rind said that the apparent target was the red zone itself. He then answered a question about any existing threats, noting that amid the current situation, “multiple threats are generated” to which security forces respond. “There were some threats pertaining to these incidents in the past,” he added. “When the red zone was attacked, it was not as if high-ranking officials were at home; the CTD DIG was leading the situation and the IG (Inspector General of Police) was present there. “It means that there was a threat or alert, which was why high-ranking officials were present.” In response to a question about attacks on prisons, Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary on Interior Hamza Shafqaat stated that the Nushki jail superintendent was in stable condition and was receiving medical care. “Two prisons were attacked, and prisoners under trial and serious criminals are at large,” he said. “There is a hot pursuit [for them] and combing and sanitisation operations are ongoing. As soon as we get updates from Nushki and Mastung, we will share them with you within 24 hours.” Provincial Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar stated that when the attacks were reported, the health ministry promptly responded and announced an emergency. He also expressed gratitude to healthcare providers and medical staff who cared for the injured. “These incidents affect people’s mental health,” he said, adding that a project related to mental health was ongoing. “Work on that will continue. The health department and the people are mentally ready for these kinds of situations.” Rind added that those who attacked police stations had been identified. “Most of them appeared to be civilians, but action has been taken against them after their identification,” he said. In response to another question, he two female terrorists had been killed during the operations while three civilian women had lost their lives in the attacks in Gwadar.",

      "title_orig": "Kashmir Solidarity Day: Pakistani leadership reaffirms support for Kashmiris’ just struggle",
      "summary_orig": "The nation is observing Kashmir Solidarity Day today with a renewed pledge to support the just struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination. The day will feature rallies, demonstrations and seminars throughout the country. Human chains will also be formed at all entry points of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). One-minute silence was observed across the country at 10am to pay homage to the martyrs of the Kashmir freedom movement, state-run Radio Pakistan reported . In his message to mark the occasion, President Asif Ali Zardari reiterated Pakistan’s steadfast moral, diplomatic and political support for the Kashmiri people, reaffirming their “inalienable right to self-determination” as enshrined in the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). The president said the people of Pakistan across the globe stand united with their Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their just struggle. He recalled that the observance of Kashmir Solidarity Day was initiated 36 years ago by ex-premier Benazir Bhutto following the historic Kashmiri uprising of 1989, a movement that continues to this day. President Zardari urged the international community to press India to end human rights violations in held Kashmir. He said India had intensified efforts to entrench its control through “administrative and legislative measures, curbing media freedoms, incarcerating Kashmiri leadership and attempting to alter the demographic composition of the territory”. The president also highlighted what he described as grave human rights violations by Indian occupation forces, citing international reports that point to a rise in arbitrary detentions, collective punishment and punitive house demolitions. He added that the “suppression of digital freedoms, including the blocking of thousands of social media accounts, reflected attempts to conceal the realities on the ground”. In his message on the occasion, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for the dispute’s resolution in accordance with UNSC resolutions. He urged the international community to play an effective role in getting the Kashmiri people their “inalienable right through a free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations”. He also announced that the government has increased the monthly per capita subsistence allowance of Kashmiri refugees to Rs5,000. “The government of Pakistan is conducting a pilot project to construct 750 residential houses at a cost of Rs3 billion,” PM Shehbaz said. The premier said the AJK government has provided land for the construction of these houses, exclusively meant for Jammu Kashmir refugees settled in the territory. He said complete rehabilitation of the refugees of Jammu and Kashmir is a national duty, and Pakistan will stand with the Kashmiris until they achieve their right to self-determination. PM Shehbaz visits AJK PM Shehbaz was on a visit to Muzaffarabad to address the special session of the AJK Legislative Assembly, APP reported. Addressing the AJK Legislative Assembly, the premier said, “Today, we have gathered here to stand in solidarity with our brothers in [occupied] Kashmir on behalf of the Pakistani people and the Pakistani leadership. “Soon, the freedom and nation of our Kashmiri brothers and sisters […] Kashmir will become a part of Pakistan.” The prime minister paid tribute to leaders of the Kashmiri freedom movement, including Burhan Wani, Asia Andrabi, Yasin Malik and All-Parties Hurriyat Conference Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq . “History has shown that Kashmiris can sacrifice themselves or their children but will not compromise on their freedom,” PM Shehbaz noted. “Kashmiris show the world every day the mirror of reality. They announce every day that Kashmir has never been a part of India, it is not, and it will never be,” he further said. “The solution to the Jammu-Kashmir dispute is to honour the wishes of the people of Kashmir and the implementation of the UNSC’s resolutions,” the prime minister said. “India has no way other than this.” PM Shehbaz affirmed, “Pakistan will continue to speak in favour of Kashmir until the birthright of Kashmiris’ freedom is given to them.” Recalling the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025, he quipped, “Our brave armed forces, under the courageous leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, meted India such a defeat that even their generations would not be able to forget.” “Our victory during Marka-i-Haq was also a victory of the Kashmir cause and the sacrifices made by Kashmiris,” he said, pointing out that the Kashmir cause was diplomatically “reignited with full force” in the wake of the conflict. The prime minister then turned his attention towards the surge in terrorism in the country. “After suffering defeat in Marka-i-Haq, India is now intensifying terrorism through proxies,” PM Shehbaz said. He asserted that peace cannot be established in the region until India’s “aggressive, expansionist, dominating and nefarious schemes come to an end”. “The brave armed forces and security forces of Pakistan will do the same to the puppets involved in Indian terrorism that they did to Indian jets in Marka-i-Haq,” the premier quipped. However, he emphasised, “We want peace, but this peace can be established on the basis of equality and justice. No matter what front India opens or what language it uses, we will respond there in an unforgettable way.” The prime minister underscored Pakistan’s principled stance on the Palestine and Kashmir issues. PM Shehbaz said the Centre will continue to work with the AJK government to further develop education, infrastructure and health facilities in the territory. “Recently, I was informed that the people who migrated from occupied Kashmir in 1989 have a stipend of only Rs3,500 per month, and it was requested that it should be increased to Rs5,000. I did not agree with that and said that it should be increased to Rs6,000,” he said. Announcing the establishment of a Daanish school in Muzaffarabad, he said, “Rs9.4 billion have been allocated for water supply schemes and hydropower projects in Neelum, while Rs10bn have been allocated for the construction of Haryam Bridge.” He went on to detail that Rs1.40bn have been allocated for the University of Kotli and Rs1,46bn for a women’s university in Bagh. The premier also remembered AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry, who passed away recently, saying: “He committed his entire life to the freedom of Kashmir.” In his speech to the assembly, AJK PM Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore noted that both the political and military leadership of Pakistan were expressing solidarity with the people of occupied Kashmir. “Pakistani soldiers have never hesitated to make sacrifices for Kashmir,” he said. Rathore highlighted that the country’s political leadership has never differentiated on the issue of Kashmir. “On the one hand, there is India that has turned Kashmir into a jail, and then there is Pakistan, which is sensitive to even the smallest of our difficulties,” he said. On his arrival, PM Shehbaz was welcomed by his AJK counterpart and senior government officials. The prime minister is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, and Advisor to the PM on Inter-Provincial Coordination Rana Sanaullah. Concrete action needed to alleviate Kashmiris’ suffering: armed forces On behalf of the armed forces, Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, and Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu reaffirmed their unwavering support for the “resilient people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) in their epic struggle for self-determination”. In their message , issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the services chiefs strongly condemned “grave violations of human rights in IIOJK, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and attempts to alter the demographic and political landscape of the region, with blatant disregard for international law”. They reiterated that a “just and peaceful resolution” of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, “remains essential for lasting peace and stability in South Asia”. “The international community must take concrete and meaningful action to alleviate the suffering of the Kashmiri people,” the services chiefs added. They reaffirmed that the armed forces remain “steadfast in their duty to safeguard Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and unwavering in their solidarity with their Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their rightful quest for freedom and dignity”. “Long live Pakistan! Long live Kashmir!” A separate statement later issued by the ISPR said CDF Munir visited Muzaffarabad today where he paid homage to the martyrs of the freedom struggle and laid the wreath at the Jammu and Kashmir Martyrs Monument. He “offered rich tributes to the Shuhada of Kashmir movement, acknowledging their enduring legacy of valour and selfless sacrifice,” the statement said. It added that while interacting with the notables and veterans, the CDF reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering political, moral, and diplomatic support for the people India-occupied Kashmir. “He noted that Indian atrocities, unabated violations of human rights, and Hindutva-driven excesses have failed to suppress the legitimate struggle and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people,” the statement said. Reaffirming Pakistan’s steadfast support for the Kashmiri cause, CDF Munir stated that Kashmir would soon “witness the dawn of freedom, in accordance with the will and destiny of the people of Kashmir”, the statement added. According to the statement, he emphasised that Pakistan would continue to highlight the Kashmir issue at all relevant international forums, in “complete solidarity with our Kashmiri brothers and sisters, until a just resolution of the dispute is achieved according to the United Nations Security Council resolutions”. He commended the unwavering dedication, high morale, professional excellence, and combat readiness of the officers and soldiers deployed in Azad Kashmir despite challenging operational conditions. The CDF emphasised the imperative of maintaining peak operational preparedness, vigilance, and seamless synergy across all domains to effectively deter and decisively respond to any hostile provocation. He also visited a forward post, where he interacted with troops deployed on the frontlines, the ISPR statement said, adding that during the visit, the CDF reiterated that any act of aggression would be instantaneously met with a swift and befitting response. “He underscored that the armed forces remain fully prepared to counter both conventional and hybrid threats in an evolving security environment,” the statement said. India’s ‘persistent defiance’ undermines UN Charter, UNSC resolutions: Dar FM Dar, in a statement , highlighted that the Kashmiri people “remain deprived of their fundamental rights”. “Yet, their resilience testifies the legitimacy of their just cause.” “At the heart of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute lies India’s failure to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions guaranteeing the Kashmiri people a free and impartial plebiscite,” the foreign minister noted. He pointed out that India’s “persistent defiance” undermines the UN Charter, the relevant UNSC resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention. The situation on the ground in occupied Kashmir has “moved beyond episodic violations to a sustained system of repression”, Dar remarked. He accused India of taking actions after Aug 5, 2019 for “artificially altering the demographic composition to change Muslim majority into majority into minority”. “Under the Hindutva-driven framework, people in IIOJK face constant discrimination. The recent profiling of mosques in IIOJK, where religious functionaries are forced to provide their personal details, photographs, and sectarian affiliations, shows the extent of institutionalised Islamophobia,” the statement read. FM Dar took note of “grave human rights violations, including fake encounters, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and restrictions on fundamental freedoms”. He urged the international community to take “decisive action to address the worsening human rights situation in IIOJK, ensure accountability for India’s illegal and unilateral actions, persuade India to implement the [UNSC] resolutions and allow the Kashmiri people their promised right to self-determination”. In his message, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq noted that the Kashmir issue remained one of the fundamental disputes stemming from the incomplete promises of the partition of the subcontinent. He stressed that sustainable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without granting the Kashmiri people their internationally recognised right to self-determination. Rallies held Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam led a rally from China Chowk to D-Chowk in Islamabad to mark the day, APP reported. A ceremony marking Kashmir Solidarity Day was also held at Kohala Bridge, where participants formed a human chain and reaffirmed support for the people of Kashmir. The event included flag hoisting and the playing of the national anthem, with officials, community representatives and citizens in attendance. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah led a Kashmir Solidarity Day rally in Karachi, marching from People’s Chowrangi to Mazar-i-Quaid. Members of the provincial cabinet, the Sindh chief secretary and police chief, and other government officials participated in the rally. Addressing an event, CM Murad recalled that in 1973, “when Kashmiris decided to join Pakistan, India illegally deployed troops” there. “Ever since, Kashmiris’ right to self-determination has been suppressed by India,” he added. “It is clear that this is not a decision between two countries, but India must be held accountable and the world must fulfil its promise to Kashmiris,” the chief minister said. “In the Kashmir issue, everyone is united; there’s no political difference, no ethnicity. Everyone speaks as one on Kashmir,” he highlighted. ‘Kashmir fundamental pillar of Pakistan’s identity’ Separately, at a ceremony held at Pakistan’s embassy in Kabul, Pakistan’s envoy to Afghanistan Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani also reaffirmed the country’s “commitment to the struggle of the Kashmiri people”. According to a press statement issued by the embassy, Ambassador Nizamani “framed the Kashmir cause as a fundamental pillar of Pakistan’s own spiritual and national identity”. Addressing the event, the envoy also “emphasised that the stability, security, and very ideological foundation of Pakistan are inextricably linked to the freedom of Kashmiri brethren from Indian occupation”.",

He urged the international community to play an effective role in getting the Kashmiri people their “inalienable right through a free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations”. He also announced that the government has increased the monthly per capita subsistence allowance of Kashmiri refugees to Rs5,000. “The government of Pakistan is conducting a pilot project to construct 750 residential houses at a cost of Rs3 billion,” PM Shehbaz said. The premier said the AJK government has provided land for the construction of these houses, exclusively meant for Jammu Kashmir refugees settled in the territory. He said complete rehabilitation of the refugees of Jammu and Kashmir is a national duty, and Pakistan will stand with the Kashmiris until they achieve their right to self-determination. PM Shehbaz visits AJK PM Shehbaz was on a visit to Muzaffarabad to address the special session of the AJK Legislative Assembly, APP reported. Addressing the AJK Legislative Assembly, the premier said, “Today, we have gathered here to stand in solidarity with our brothers in [occupied] Kashmir on behalf of the Pakistani people and the Pakistani leadership. “Soon, the freedom and nation of our Kashmiri brothers and sisters […] Kashmir will become a part of Pakistan.” The prime minister paid tribute to leaders of the Kashmiri freedom movement, including Burhan Wani, Asia Andrabi, Yasin Malik and All-Parties Hurriyat Conference Chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq . “History has shown that Kashmiris can sacrifice themselves or their children but will not compromise on their freedom,” PM Shehbaz noted. “Kashmiris show the world every day the mirror of reality. They announce every day that Kashmir has never been a part of India, it is not, and it will never be,” he further said. “The solution to the Jammu-Kashmir dispute is to honour the wishes of the people of Kashmir and the implementation of the UNSC’s resolutions,” the prime minister said. “India has no way other than this.” PM Shehbaz affirmed, “Pakistan will continue to speak in favour of Kashmir until the birthright of Kashmiris’ freedom is given to them.” Recalling the four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025, he quipped, “Our brave armed forces, under the courageous leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, meted India such a defeat that even their generations would not be able to forget.” “Our victory during Marka-i-Haq was also a victory of the Kashmir cause and the sacrifices made by Kashmiris,” he said, pointing out that the Kashmir cause was diplomatically “reignited with full force” in the wake of the conflict. The prime minister then turned his attention towards the surge in terrorism in the country. “After suffering defeat in Marka-i-Haq, India is now intensifying terrorism through proxies,” PM Shehbaz said. He asserted that peace cannot be established in the region until India’s “aggressive, expansionist, dominating and nefarious schemes come to an end”. “The brave armed forces and security forces of Pakistan will do the same to the puppets involved in Indian terrorism that they did to Indian jets in Marka-i-Haq,” the premier quipped. However, he emphasised, “We want peace, but this peace can be established on the basis of equality and justice. No matter what front India opens or what language it uses, we will respond there in an unforgettable way.” The prime minister underscored Pakistan’s principled stance on the Palestine and Kashmir issues. PM Shehbaz said the Centre will continue to work with the AJK government to further develop education, infrastructure and health facilities in the territory. “Recently, I was informed that the people who migrated from occupied Kashmir in 1989 have a stipend of only Rs3,500 per month, and it was requested that it should be increased to Rs5,000. I did not agree with that and said that it should be increased to Rs6,000,” he said. Announcing the establishment of a Daanish school in Muzaffarabad, he said, “Rs9.4 billion have been allocated for water supply schemes and hydropower projects in Neelum, while Rs10bn have been allocated for the construction of Haryam Bridge.” He went on to detail that Rs1.40bn have been allocated for the University of Kotli and Rs1,46bn for a women’s university in Bagh. The premier also remembered AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood Chaudhry, who passed away recently, saying: “He committed his entire life to the freedom of Kashmir.” In his speech to the assembly, AJK PM Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore noted that both the political and military leadership of Pakistan were expressing solidarity with the people of occupied Kashmir. “Pakistani soldiers have never hesitated to make sacrifices for Kashmir,” he said. Rathore highlighted that the country’s political leadership has never differentiated on the issue of Kashmir. “On the one hand, there is India that has turned Kashmir into a jail, and then there is Pakistan, which is sensitive to even the smallest of our difficulties,” he said. On his arrival, PM Shehbaz was welcomed by his AJK counterpart and senior government officials. The prime minister is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, and Advisor to the PM on Inter-Provincial Coordination Rana Sanaullah. Concrete action needed to alleviate Kashmiris’ suffering: armed forces On behalf of the armed forces, Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, and Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu reaffirmed their unwavering support for the “resilient people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) in their epic struggle for self-determination”. In their message , issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the services chiefs strongly condemned “grave violations of human rights in IIOJK, including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and attempts to alter the demographic and political landscape of the region, with blatant disregard for international law”. They reiterated that a “just and peaceful resolution” of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, “remains essential for lasting peace and stability in South Asia”. “The international community must take concrete and meaningful action to alleviate the suffering of the Kashmiri people,” the services chiefs added. They reaffirmed that the armed forces remain “steadfast in their duty to safeguard Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and unwavering in their solidarity with their Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their rightful quest for freedom and dignity”. “Long live Pakistan! Long live Kashmir!” A separate statement later issued by the ISPR said CDF Munir visited Muzaffarabad today where he paid homage to the martyrs of the freedom struggle and laid the wreath at the Jammu and Kashmir Martyrs Monument. He “offered rich tributes to the Shuhada of Kashmir movement, acknowledging their enduring legacy of valour and selfless sacrifice,” the statement said. It added that while interacting with the notables and veterans, the CDF reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering political, moral, and diplomatic support for the people India-occupied Kashmir. “He noted that Indian atrocities, unabated violations of human rights, and Hindutva-driven excesses have failed to suppress the legitimate struggle and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people,” the statement said. Reaffirming Pakistan’s steadfast support for the Kashmiri cause, CDF Munir stated that Kashmir would soon “witness the dawn of freedom, in accordance with the will and destiny of the people of Kashmir”, the statement added. According to the statement, he emphasised that Pakistan would continue to highlight the Kashmir issue at all relevant international forums, in “complete solidarity with our Kashmiri brothers and sisters, until a just resolution of the dispute is achieved according to the United Nations Security Council resolutions”. He commended the unwavering dedication, high morale, professional excellence, and combat readiness of the officers and soldiers deployed in Azad Kashmir despite challenging operational conditions. The CDF emphasised the imperative of maintaining peak operational preparedness, vigilance, and seamless synergy across all domains to effectively deter and decisively respond to any hostile provocation. He also visited a forward post, where he interacted with troops deployed on the frontlines, the ISPR statement said, adding that during the visit, the CDF reiterated that any act of aggression would be instantaneously met with a swift and befitting response. “He underscored that the armed forces remain fully prepared to counter both conventional and hybrid threats in an evolving security environment,” the statement said. India’s ‘persistent defiance’ undermines UN Charter, UNSC resolutions: Dar FM Dar, in a statement , highlighted that the Kashmiri people “remain deprived of their fundamental rights”. “Yet, their resilience testifies the legitimacy of their just cause.” “At the heart of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute lies India’s failure to implement the United Nations Security Council resolutions guaranteeing the Kashmiri people a free and impartial plebiscite,” the foreign minister noted. He pointed out that India’s “persistent defiance” undermines the UN Charter, the relevant UNSC resolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention. The situation on the ground in occupied Kashmir has “moved beyond episodic violations to a sustained system of repression”, Dar remarked. He accused India of taking actions after Aug 5, 2019 for “artificially altering the demographic composition to change Muslim majority into majority into minority”. “Under the Hindutva-driven framework, people in IIOJK face constant discrimination. The recent profiling of mosques in IIOJK, where religious functionaries are forced to provide their personal details, photographs, and sectarian affiliations, shows the extent of institutionalised Islamophobia,” the statement read. FM Dar took note of “grave human rights violations, including fake encounters, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and restrictions on fundamental freedoms”. He urged the international community to take “decisive action to address the worsening human rights situation in IIOJK, ensure accountability for India’s illegal and unilateral actions, persuade India to implement the [UNSC] resolutions and allow the Kashmiri people their promised right to self-determination”. In his message, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq noted that the Kashmir issue remained one of the fundamental disputes stemming from the incomplete promises of the partition of the subcontinent. He stressed that sustainable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without granting the Kashmiri people their internationally recognised right to self-determination. Rallies held Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam led a rally from China Chowk to D-Chowk in Islamabad to mark the day, APP reported. A ceremony marking Kashmir Solidarity Day was also held at Kohala Bridge, where participants formed a human chain and reaffirmed support for the people of Kashmir. The event included flag hoisting and the playing of the national anthem, with officials, community representatives and citizens in attendance. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah led a Kashmir Solidarity Day rally in Karachi, marching from People’s Chowrangi to Mazar-i-Quaid. Members of the provincial cabinet, the Sindh chief secretary and police chief, and other government officials participated in the rally. Addressing an event, CM Murad recalled that in 1973, “when Kashmiris decided to join Pakistan, India illegally deployed troops” there. “Ever since, Kashmiris’ right to self-determination has been suppressed by India,” he added. “It is clear that this is not a decision between two countries, but India must be held accountable and the world must fulfil its promise to Kashmiris,” the chief minister said. “In the Kashmir issue, everyone is united; there’s no political difference, no ethnicity. Everyone speaks as one on Kashmir,” he highlighted. ‘Kashmir fundamental pillar of Pakistan’s identity’ Separately, at a ceremony held at Pakistan’s embassy in Kabul, Pakistan’s envoy to Afghanistan Ubaidur Rehman Nizamani also reaffirmed the country’s “commitment to the struggle of the Kashmiri people”. According to a press statement issued by the embassy, Ambassador Nizamani “framed the Kashmir cause as a fundamental pillar of Pakistan’s own spiritual and national identity”. Addressing the event, the envoy also “emphasised that the stability, security, and very ideological foundation of Pakistan are inextricably linked to the freedom of Kashmiri brethren from Indian occupation”.",

The very survival of the process is notable, even though expectations of a breakthrough remain low. The road to these talks has been uneven; plans were repeatedly disrupted by military incidents, disputes on the venue and disagreements over the scope of engagement. At one point, Washington was said to have walked away altogether. Each time, the process was revived . Not because of confidence, but because the alternatives appeared to be far riskier. From what we know so far, Washington’s attempts to expand the agenda was one of the straws that nearly broke the camel’s back, so to speak. While Iran had agreed to discuss its nuclear programme – given its stance that it isn’t interested in nuclear weapons – the US instead insisted on putting ballistic missiles, regional proxies and internal governance on the table. For Tehran, this confirmed long-held suspicions that diplomacy was being used to extract concessions, rather than resolve a specific dispute – in this case, nuclear weapons. It responded by hardening its position. Talks, Iran said, could only be indirect. They could only be held in Oman and not in Turkiye, as the Americans wanted. And they could only focus on the nuclear issue. Anything beyond that was declared ‘a red line’. Washington initially resisted, only relenting after sustained intervention by regional actors, particularly from the Gulf region. Their interest was not ideological, but purely pragmatic – any conflict between Iran and US would be fought in their neighbourhood, and they would have to absorb much of the fallout. On the face of it, President Donald Trump’s team appears to have listened to the regional stakeholders. US Vice President JD Vance has, meanwhile, expressed frustration over Washington’s inability to directly talk with Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, calling Iran “a very weird country to conduct diplomacy with”. Washington’s calculations It was Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s recent public remarks, where he insisted that any engagement would need to address Iran’s ballistic missiles, its regional posture and its domestic governance, alongside nuclear issues, that seemingly triggered the disagreement. American officials had assumed Iran would bend under pressure. The assessment in Washington was that Tehran had been weakened by war, domestic unrest and economic strain. More importantly, perhaps, Hezbollah’s loss of strength and the fall of Syria’s Assad regime were seen as a weakening of Iran’s influence in the region. Rubio’s comments , some believe, also pointed to divisions within the US administration itself. While President Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been tasked with exploring a diplomatic opening, Rubio articulated a far more expansive and hawkish agenda. Shashank Joshi, defence editor at The Economist , argues that Iran’s leverage had narrowed sharply. He notes that Tehran long relied on two main instruments: its missile programme and its network of regional allies, from Hamas to Hezbollah. With those groups weakened, the fall of the Assad regime in Syria and the degradation of its missile capabilities, he says Iran’s position had eroded further. “More recently, Iran’s economic crisis and its response to protests have left it extremely weak and vulnerable … All in all, I think this gives Iran very few options,” he says. But a diplomatic onlooker based in Islamabad disagrees, saying that Washington’s assumptions had proven to be misplaced. The Israel factor Since Oct 7, 2023 , regional anxieties have deepened because of Israeli military actions in the region. There is a growing view in the Gulf that an emboldened Tel Aviv would be antithetical to regional stability. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has also repeatedly warned that a regional conflict would spare no one. That assessment is quietly shared across several Gulf capitals, and in the broader region. Trita Parsi, executive vice president at the Quincy Institute, notes that while the US may not formally pursue regime change in Iran, Israeli pressure has kept Tehran at the centre of Washington’s security thinking. The memory of the 12-day war of June 2025 also shaped American calculations. That conflict demonstrated the limits of military action. Iran took damage, but it was not neutralised and retained the capacity to respond and to impose costs. While the conflict had ended in a stalemate, it reinforced the risks of escalation. Nevertheless, Israel remains the main proponent of confrontation. It continues to press the US to entangle itself in a military conflict with Iran. Its influence is evident in the steady expansion of American demands. What began as a nuclear concern has gradually widened to missiles and regional proxies. In Parsi’s assessment, the US will have to make a choice, whether it wants to “pursue Israeli interest or American interest”. Tehran’s scepticism Privately, Iranian officials insist that the difficulty does not lie in the choice of venue, but in what they describe as a “pattern of shifting US positions”. In effect, Iran has refused to engage on the agenda proposed by the US. It has agreed to talk about nuclear issues while rejecting discussion on missiles and regional alliances. These, it said, were integral to national deterrence. The view in Tehran is that any concession would invite further pressure. Trita Parsi agrees with Iran’s reading, saying: “If the nuclear programme is eliminated, [pressure] will shift to missiles. If the missiles are dealt with, there will be a new excuse”. In a media interview, Iranian academic Foad Izadi claims that the US was asking Iran to join the Missile Technology Control Regime, which would restrict the ranges of Iranian missiles to 300kms, and to provide detailed data about the nuclear sites that it hit during the 12-day war. The resistance from Tehran has not only surprised US officials, but it also narrowed Washington’s choices. Escalation remained an option, but an expensive one as a war with Iran would risk regional instability, energy disruption and political costs at home. American journalist and author Max Blumenthal notes that “Trump was pushed to deploy a naval Armada to the Persian Gulf, which he has done and now he risks humiliation if he stands down without an attack.” It was either that, or “attack and risk a total regional war with Iran, activating all of its assets which it had not done [even] during the 12-day war”, Blumenthal says. The alternative was to step back and accept talks on Iranian terms. For now, the US has chosen the latter. Oman was accepted as the venue and the agenda appears limited to nuclear issues. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi’s public statements suggest no expansion. That may keep the process alive, but it does not resolve the deeper mistrust. Reasonable expectations For Iran, the issue is ideological as much as it is political. The current regime itself emerged from the Islamic Revolution, which was a rejection of American dominance. Retreat on that front would hollow out the system’s legitimacy, not an option for Tehran. Therefore, for Washington, Iran remains a challenge to American influence and to a regional order anchored in US alliances, particularly with Israel. These positions leave little space for reconciliation. This is why expectations for Muscat remain modest with both sides taking the talks as a tool to manage pressure, but not a path to resolution. Iran’s approach to the talks is cautious. Officials describe negotiations as a tactical move in a long rivalry and not an endpoint. Expectations are being kept deliberately low. Talks may stall or collapse and Iranian officials, in their private conversations, say they are prepared for all outcomes. But still, it has taken limited confidence-building measures. Military exercises in the Persian Gulf were postponed, the handling of detainees was eased, and rhetoric on missiles was softened. These steps were calibrated and were intended to reduce tension without signalling vulnerability. The Americans are also keeping their fingers crossed. Secretary Rubio said, “We’re going to try to find out” if Iranians are ready for a peaceful settlement of the dispute. Both sides are nevertheless sending negotiators with authority. On the Iranian side, Abbas Araghchi and Ali Larijani enjoy institutional backing. This gives them room to explore limited compromises. On the American side, Steve Witkoff is again leading, this time accompanied by Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner. His presence suggests direct access to President Trump. This line-up may help avoid procedural delays, but it will not bridge the deeper divide. The conflict between Iran and the United States is rooted in ideology and geopolitics. It has endured for more than four decades. Diplomacy may slow escalation and possibly reduce chances of miscalculation, but will definitely not end the rivalry.",

      "summary_orig": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa apex committee has termed “consultation, cooperation and coordination” with the federal government and all political parties “essential” for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy, it emerged on Thursday. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi chaired his first meeting of the provincial apex committee since assuming office on Wednesday. The panel discussed the “general rise in terrorism incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and an action plan to eradicate the menace of Fitna-al-Khawarij and establish complete peace and stability”, as per a press release issued by the KP CM’s office today. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). During the meeting, the press release said, the committee agreed that “joint consultation, mutual cooperation, and practical coordination between all political parties, public representatives, and the federal government is essential for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy”. The meeting was attended by provincial ministers, the Peshawar corps commander, the chief secretary and the KP inspector general. Senior civil, military and law enforcement officials were also present. The apex committee “firmly resolved that the KP government will utilise all its resources, including the armed forces, police, CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department) and other institutions, to combat terrorism and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices”. The committee hoped that the “long-term strategy would identify all the causes of terrorism and eliminate them, and as a result, ensure the restoration of public confidence so that the government and the public” can work together for the country’s progress. “The KP government’s agenda is that only good governance and public interest can unite the nation against terrorism,” read the meeting’s press release. Under this agenda, it was decided that in the “first phase, areas affected by terrorism will be converted into model good governance districts”. It further said “all government resources will be utilised to compensate for the lack in the provision of development, social services and economic growth” in terrorism-afflicted areas. The committee also announced a “special package to provide security, communication, health, education, employment, basic amenities and other services in these areas under an organised programme”. “The forum decided that the government will ensure complete care, rehabilitation, and the provision of basic needs for the welfare of the people affected in the areas where temporary relocation took place for sustainable stability, so that this temporary difficulty can form the base for peace, development and prosperity in the future,” the statement read. “Their dignified return is a top priority for the [KP] government,” it stressed. The federal and KP governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists. Speaking during the meeting, CM Afridi stressed that the provincial government “will not make any compromise on peace” in the province. He asserted that the “civil government, authorities, armed forces, and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are on the same page for law and order and will continue their joint efforts”. He reiterated that the fight against terrorism was a “collective one and can only be won through joint efforts”. The statement comes days after CM Afridi met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, where the two discussed issues related to KP’s finances and counterterrorism. On counter-terrorism, PM Shehbaz had termed the KP government’s cooperation in establishing peace in the province as “unavoidable”. “There is a need to improve the provincial government’s efforts to establish law and order,” he said, urging the KP government to strengthen provincial departments to combat terrorism. Affirming that both the Centre and the provincial government would continue their efforts to combat militancy, the premier said the KP administration should fulfil its constitutional duties to ensure peace and public welfare. The PTI-led KP government and the Centre have mostly been at odds over counter-terrorism policies in the province, particularly military operations, with the former objecting to “decisions taken behind closed doors”. CM Afridi has repeatedly called for a “ policy shift ” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terrorism policy-making. The debate on the right approach to establish law and order comes on the heels of heightened militancy. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.",

On counter-terrorism, PM Shehbaz had termed the KP government’s cooperation in establishing peace in the province as “unavoidable”. “There is a need to improve the provincial government’s efforts to establish law and order,” he said, urging the KP government to strengthen provincial departments to combat terrorism. Affirming that both the Centre and the provincial government would continue their efforts to combat militancy, the premier said the KP administration should fulfil its constitutional duties to ensure peace and public welfare. The PTI-led KP government and the Centre have mostly been at odds over counter-terrorism policies in the province, particularly military operations, with the former objecting to “decisions taken behind closed doors”. CM Afridi has repeatedly called for a “ policy shift ” and urged the inclusion of the provincial government in counter-terrorism policy-making. The debate on the right approach to establish law and order comes on the heels of heightened militancy. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.",

      "summary": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa apex committee has termed “consultation, cooperation and coordination” with the federal government and all political parties “essential” for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy, it emerged on Thursday. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi chaired his first meeting of the provincial apex committee since assuming office on Wednesday. The panel discussed the “general rise in terrorism incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and an action plan to eradicate the menace of Fitna-al-Khawarij and establish complete peace and stability”, as per a press release issued by the KP CM’s office today. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). During the meeting, the press release said, the committee agreed that “joint consultation, mutual cooperation, and practical coordination between all political parties, public representatives, and the federal government is essential for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy”. The meeting was attended by provincial ministers, the Peshawar corps commander, the chief secretary and the KP inspector general. Senior civil, military and law enforcement officials were also present. The apex committee “firmly resolved that the KP government will utilise all its resources, including the armed forces, police, CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department) and other institutions, to combat terrorism and will not hesitate to make any sacrifices”. The committee hoped that the “long-term strategy would identify all the causes of terrorism and eliminate them, and as a result, ensure the restoration of public confidence so that the government and the public” can work together for the country’s progress. “The KP government’s agenda is that only good governance and public interest can unite the nation against terrorism,” read the meeting’s press release. Under this agenda, it was decided that in the “first phase, areas affected by terrorism will be converted into model good governance districts”. It further said “all government resources will be utilised to compensate for the lack in the provision of development, social services and economic growth” in terrorism-afflicted areas. The committee also announced a “special package to provide security, communication, health, education, employment, basic amenities and other services in these areas under an organised programme”. “The forum decided that the government will ensure complete care, rehabilitation, and the provision of basic needs for the welfare of the people affected in the areas where temporary relocation took place for sustainable stability, so that this temporary difficulty can form the base for peace, development and prosperity in the future,” the statement read. “Their dignified return is a top priority for the [KP] government,” it stressed. The federal and KP governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists. Speaking during the meeting, CM Afridi stressed that the provincial government “will not make any compromise on peace” in the province. He asserted that the “civil government, authorities, armed forces, and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) are on the same page for law and order and will continue their joint efforts”. He reiterated that the fight against terrorism was a “collective one and can only be won through joint efforts”. The statement comes days after CM Afridi met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, where the two discussed issues related to KP’s finances and counterterrorism.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Lahore Qalandars announced on Thursday that it had directly signed Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman for PSL’s 11th edition, spending over Rs60 million. “Our Bangladeshi brother, Mustafizur, picked in 2016 and 2018, is now our direct signing and finally back with the family. Once a Qalandar, always a Qalandar. “Amount spent on DS: PKR6.44 crore,” the announcement on Lahore Qalandar’s X account said. Mustafizur had registered for the PSL in early January, following his release from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL). The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by KKR for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December. He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season. KKR announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The decision came amid strained relations between India and Bangla­desh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh. In response, Bangladesh banned IPL broadcasts in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board requested the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka. ICC, however, rejected the request, replacing Bangladesh with Scotland in the 20-team tournament. Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously also featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars. Mustafizur’s direct signing has been made possible after the PCB announced sweeping changes to the player acquisition mechanism for PSL 11 last month, replacing the long-running draft with a full-fledged auction and raising the player purse to $1.6m per franchise. Under the new framework, each franchise is allowed one direct signing of a foreign player who did not feature in the previous season, giving teams an additional avenue to bolster their squads with new international talent. PSL 11 will begin on March 26, and will also mark the return of Faisalabad as a host city, expanding the league’s footprint beyond the existing venues of Karachi, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi.",

He made the remarks during a visit to Quetta, according to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), where he received a “comprehensive operational briefing on the prevailing security environment and internal security operations”. “The briefing covered recent terrorist attacks orchestrated by Indian-backed internationally-designated terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan and the prompt aggressive response of security forces, which failed their ulterior motive of compromising peace, stability, and development in Balochistan,” ISPR said. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The handout said measures being undertaken to further strengthen the writ of the state and ensure protection of the populace and critical infrastructure were also discussed. During his visit, CDF Munir remarked that “no terrorist and their facilitator will be spared and all will be dealt strictly as per law and that no one can rationalise violence and terrorism on any pretext”. “He appreciated the professionalism, valour, and sacrifices of officers and troops of all law enforcement agencies in thwarting nefarious anti-Pakistan designs and maintaining law and order.” The statement said that CDF Munir, along with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, visited the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Quetta, where he met injured personnel belonging to the army, Balochistan Frontier Corps and police. The statement said CDF Munir “lauded their high morale and commended their bravery and steadfastness in protecting the motherland from foreign-sponsored terrorists”.",

During his visit, CDF Munir remarked that “no terrorist and their facilitator will be spared and all will be dealt strictly as per law and that no one can rationalise violence and terrorism on any pretext”. “He appreciated the professionalism, valour, and sacrifices of officers and troops of all law enforcement agencies in thwarting nefarious anti-Pakistan designs and maintaining law and order.” The statement said that CDF Munir, along with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, visited the Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Quetta, where he met injured personnel belonging to the army, Balochistan Frontier Corps and police. The statement said CDF Munir “lauded their high morale and commended their bravery and steadfastness in protecting the motherland from foreign-sponsored terrorists”.",

      "summary": "Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday said that no terrorist or their facilitator would be spared, adding that “no one can rationalise violence and terrorism on any pretext”. He made the remarks during a visit to Quetta, according to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), where he received a “comprehensive operational briefing on the prevailing security environment and internal security operations”. “The briefing covered recent terrorist attacks orchestrated by Indian-backed internationally-designated terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan and the prompt aggressive response of security forces, which failed their ulterior motive of compromising peace, stability, and development in Balochistan,” ISPR said.

      "summary_orig": "• Araghchi says talks with US ‘scheduled’ for Friday in Oman • Regional leaders urge United States to proceed with dialogue following reports of breakdown • Uncertainty triggered after Rubio said talks should include missile programme; Iran wanted issue kept ‘off the table’ • Trump says Iran supreme leader ‘should be very worried’ • Regional players like Pakistan, S. Arabia, Turkiye, Egypt ‘unlikely’ to take part at this stage ISLAMABAD / WASHINGTON: The prospects for talks between Iran and the United States seemed fraught with uncertainty on Wednesday, even after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi publicly announced the date and timing of the proposed negotiations. “Nuclear talks with the United States are scheduled to be held in Muscat on about 10 am Friday. I’m grateful to our Omani brothers for making all necessary arrangements,” he posted on X late on Wednesday night. A US official also confirmed that the neg­o­tiations are on track, Reuters reported. The statement came amid swirling speculation that the talks had already been called off. Indications of trouble first surfaced after American news website Axios reported that the talks were falling apart, as the US had told Iran that it would not agree to Tehran’s demands to change the location and format of talks. US officials considered the request to change the venue but then decided to reject it, Axios said. “We told them it is this or nothing, and they said, ‘Ok, then nothing,’” a senior US official was quoted as saying. The news outlet later reported, citing two US officials, that plans for US-Iran nuclear talks are back on after several Middle Eastern leaders “urgently lobbied the Trump administration on Wednesday afternoon not to follow through on threats to walk away. “At least nine countries from the region reached out to the White House at the highest levels strongly urging the US not to cancel the meeting,” it added. Insider accounts suggested the talks were salvaged after persistent requests from regional actors, which had originally been slated to participate in the discussions planned for Turkiye, but were later excluded from the round shifted to Oman. These countries — including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye — maintain dir­ect stakes, as they would face significant consequences in the event of a conflict, and thus have sustained their strong interest in the dialogue. Their advocacy seems to have helped preserve at least some channel for de-escalation and prevented the breakdown of diplomacy. Talking to Dawn from Tehran, Iranian officials had suggested that regional players like were unlikely to take part at this stage. Qatar’s prime minister, however, is more likely to be involved alongside Omani interlocutors. Troubled talks Reports about the cancellation of talks started making rounds after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in public remarks, insisted that any engagement would need to address Iran’s ballistic missiles, its regional posture and its domestic governance, alongside nuclear issues. Rubio’s comments, many believed, pointed to divisions within the US administration itself. While President Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been tasked with exploring a diplomatic opening, Rubio articulated a far more expansive and hawkish agenda. For Tehran, this seemed to confirm long-held suspicions that Washington was abandoning the idea of a limited confidence-building process. Iranian officials, therefore, saw the expanded agenda not as a starting point for negotiation, but as an attempt to front-load concessions. A senior Iranian official, however, said the talks would only be about Iran’s nuclear programme, and that its missile programme was “off the table”. The diplomatic efforts come after Trump’s threats of military action against Iran during its crackdown on protesters last month and the deployment of more naval power to the Gulf. After Israel and the United States bombed Iran last summer, renewed friction has kindled fears among regional states of a major conflagration that could rebound on them or cause long-term chaos in Iran. Trump has continued to weigh the option of strikes on Iran, sources say. Oil prices have risen due to the tension. Khamenei ‘should be very worried’ Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be “very worried”, as Washington builds up its military forces in the region. “I would say he should be very worried, yeah, he should be,” Trump said in an interview with US broadcaster NBC News . “As you know, they are negotiating with us.” Trump also said that Iran had eyed a new nuclear site after US strikes. “They were thinking about starting a new site in a different part of the country,” Trump told NBC . “We found out about it, I said, you do that, we’re going to do very bad things to you.” Published in Dawn, February 5th, 2026",

In response to the announcement, the Balochistan government agreed to release all government employees recently arrested by police while attempting to enter the “Red Zone”. The decision was reached during a meeting between an authorised government committee and an All Parties delegation representing a broad spectrum of political leadership, including the Awami National Party (ANP), National Party, Pakhtunkhwa National Awami Party (PkNAP), and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). During the session, the political coalition formally ended its protest movement, citing the prevailing circumstances in Balochistan. In turn, the government confirmed it would move forward with the release of detained employees to de-escalate tensions. The two sides scheduled a follow-up meeting for Feb 12. During that session, senior political leaders and the government committee are expected to formulate a comprehensive strategy to resolve all remaining pending issues. The government delegation included Mir Shoaib Nosherwani, provincial minister for finance and minerals; Raheela Hameed Durrani, provincial education minister; and Provincial Minister Ali Madad Jattak. Other government representatives included Pakistan Peoples Party leader Syed Iqbal Shah, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister Imran Zarkoon, and Special Secretary Finance Arif Khan Achakzai. The All Parties delegation featured prominent leaders, including ANP Prov­incial President Asghar Khan Achakzai, National Party Central Vice President Dr. Ishaq Baloch, PkNAP Provincial President Nasrullah Khan Zerey, and PTI’s Salam Agha.

      "summary_orig": "Commenting on the decision to boycott the match against India in the T20 World Cup, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that there “should be no politics in sports”. He made the remarks while addressing the federal cabinet in Islamabad. The remarks were televised. “We have taken a clear stand regarding the T20 World Cup that we will not play the match against India,” he said. “There should be no politics in sports,” he said. “We have taken this stand after deliberating on it carefully,” he said, calling it an “appropriate decision”. It should be noted that the government on Sunday gave the cricket team the nod to participate in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held on Feb 15 in Colombo. The development came after Bangladesh’s withdrawal from the tournament amid tensions with India, which is one of the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup. At the start of his address, PM Shehbaz began by talking about the attacks in Balochistan. “Within three to four days, 180 terrorists were sent to hell,” he said. “As a result, 17 personnel embraced martyrdom. Similarly, 31 civilians were martyred.” He added that a “heartbreaking incident” took place in Gwadar, where five women and children were martyred. “These people (terrorists) are not human,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said that the nation would never forget the sacrifice of security forces and that since Marka-i-Haq — the name for Pakistan’s brief military conflict against India last year — Pakistan’s “hostile eastern neighbour” and other khawarij were conspiring against the country’s progress and prosperity. Khawarij is a term used by the state to designate members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. “God willing, this will not happen. We will completely eradicate terrorism and Pakistan will find success on the path of progress,” PM Shehbaz vowed. He added that the nation should remember how terrorists killed women, children and people who were trying to work. “It is a terrible incident and the whole nation is mourning, but it is standing with its law enforcement agencies and the Pakistan armed forces,” the premier added. “The day will come when these sacrifices will be worthwhile and the scourge of terrorism will be erased from this country.” Switching gears and discussing the tensions in Iran, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan has played a “brotherly role”. “Myself, the deputy prime minister and the field marshal met the Iranian leadership on multiple occasions and we had telephone conversations,” he outlined. “We had several discussions and played our brotherly role as best we could.” The premier expressed the hope that through dialogue, a peaceful path would emerge leading to regional peace. Speaking about Kashmir Day on February 5 (tomorrow), PM Shehbaz said that the nation, from Peshawar to Karachi, would express solidarity with freedom movements within the Indian-occupied territory. “The people will express their passionate devotion to Kashmir in different cities,” the premier said. “I personally will be heading to Azad Kashmir tomorrow and we will convey a message of solidarity on behalf of the whole nation.” PM Shehbaz then spoke about his meeting with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. “I called him the day he was elected and assured him that he would have the full support of the Centre, regardless of whatever party he belongs to,” the premier recounted. “I told him that Pakistan comes before the party and that he is the chief minister of an important, beautiful province where the people are proud Pakistanis and brave. They have also sacrificed much.” The premier noted that during the 2010 National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Rs800 billion was allocated to KP for counter-terrorism, security and policing. “I told him that we gave this money under the NFC, but we have yet to see the results,” he said. “I said that the Safe City project remains incomplete, but he assured me that he intends to complete it. “I spoke to him again , and he mentioned that some payments have been delayed,” the premier added. “I immediately tasked [Planning Minister] Ahsan Iqbal, the finance minister and the finance secretary to meet him (KP CM) and, wherever there are delays in payments, to resolve them,” he said.",
