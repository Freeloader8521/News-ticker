      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, who arrived in Lahore earlier today with PTI leaders and workers, led a rally at Liberty Chowk in the provincial capital. Afridi arrived in Lahore to spearhead PTI‘s plans to launch a street movement and to meet the party’s local leadership. As of 11:43pm, PTI workers and supporters were participating in the rally, with the KP CM joining them in sloganeering. The PTI posted a video showing CM Afridi amid a crowd of supporters raising his fist and chanting slogans. At 10:18pm, the PTI’s Lahore chapter posted a video on X showing CM Afridi leaning out of a car and sloganeering, while supporters showered his vehicle with flowers. KP Minister for Higher Education and Local Government Meena Khan Afridi could also be seen chanting slogans. Another video posted at 10:37 showed the KP CM mingling with crowds of supporters chanting slogans. PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters, Aleema Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi are also present at Liberty Chowk. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja wrote in an earlier post on X at 9:32pm that he and CM Afridi were at Liberty Chowk, but the Punjab Police were “blocking their path”. Earlier, visiting PTI members, including Meena Khan, were involved in a fracas with guards at the Punjab Assembly. A video of the scuffle was shared by the PTI at 8:42 PM, showing pushing and shoving within a crowd that included Meena Khan, KP CM’s aide Shafiullah Jan, and guards, along with people shouting. CM Afridi addresses PTI lawmakers in Punjab Assembly The KP CM addressed PTI lawmakers during his visit to the Punjab Assembly, expressing gratitude to the people of Punjab for their hospitality, but highlighting his treatment by the police during the group’s journey to Lahore. “Today, the Punjab Police were rude to our workers at Chakri Interchange, Bhera, Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin,” he said. “Our workers, our parliamentarians, our leaders — they were harassed and arrested. This cannot be condemned enough.” CM Afridi assailed the federal government for failure to handle the economy, brain drain and declining industrial growth. “Farmers are being driven to suicide. And what are their priorities? Making sure the PTI cannot hold rallies, stopping Imran Khan from meeting his sisters and arresting our workers,” he stated. Earlier this evening, a video shared by the PTI on X showed the CM‘s vehicle showered with flowers by party workers and supporters as he arrived at PTI leader Latif Khosa’s residence. CM Afridi, flanked by Khosa, then addressed reporters at the latter’s residence, acknowledging party supporters who came out in support of the PTI. “They say that Punjab‘s people do not come out. But they did because on February 8, you only had 17 seats,” he said. “Punjab’s people came out because Imran Khan had 180 seats. “The people of Punjab and Pakistan stand with only one leader: he is sitting in Adiala jail right now and his name is Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi.” Traders shut markets in Gulberg Traders in Gulberg market closed down their shops, offices and business premises on Friday evening following the announcement of a PTI rally, led by KP CM Afridi at Liberty roundabout. “On the appeal of Gulberg Traders Board—a body of 18 major markets, the shopkeepers closed down their businesses at 7pm,” the board’s chairman Sohail Sarfraz Munj said while talking to Dawn. “No, we have closed down the shops voluntarily, keeping in view the law and order situation that may deteriorate due to the PTI rally . We took the decision after the police informed us about a possible security threat,“ said the senior trader when asked if the police had asked them to shut down. Faisal, a property dealer at Liberty Roundabout, also confirmed the development, adding that the traders had shut their shops after receiving a message from the traders’ board president. “All shops have been closed in view of the law and order situation,” he said. Azma Bukhari welcomes KP CM, warns against property damage Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari welcomed CM Afridi to Lahore, saying he is free to see the lights, eat local food and enjoy the city, but warned him that the use of abusive language or property damage will not be tolerated. Talking to the media, she remarked that during his visit, former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur was shown “the lights of Lahore” and now CM Afridi should also witness Punjab and Lahore’s beauty and progress and replicate in KP whatever positives he observes in Punjab. Bukhari called Lahore “the Europe of Pakistan,” adding that if conditions in Peshawar are poor, visiting Lahore for learning and recreation is welcome. She stressed that the KP CM has full permission for tourism, political or informative, but he will not be allowed to use abusive language, create unrest, or spread chaos. She further warned that bringing weapons or drugs to Lahore would not be allowed. Referring to past protests, she said CM Afridi is “not a bigger leader than ‘Fitna Khan’ (Imran Khan)” and that the public response to protest calls during Afridi’s Lahore visit would be worse than what the PTI founder received. Highlighting the festive atmosphere due to Christmas, Bukhari added that Liberty Market is beautifully decorated with lights and a tree, but emphasised any attempt to damage public property would not be tolerated. Bukhari also regretted that the Lahore police contacted the KP CM’s staff today without receiving any response. “We will extend warm hospitality to guests,” Azma Bukhari concluded. “But guests must behave like guests.” Afridi reaches Lahore An earlier video shared by the party at 4:33pm showed Afridi’s vehicle entering Lahore through a toll plaza, while vehicles belonging to workers and supporters were halted and the toll plaza was subsequently closed. Speaking to reporters after crossing Ravi Toll Plaza, the CM noted that while he had been granted entry, at least seven accompanying vehicles had been stopped. “Workers from Mandi Bahauddin were stopped from travelling to Lahore through Bhera,” he said, claiming that roads were blocked and party workers had been arrested. A reporter informed him that media vehicles had also been denied entry. “Democratic governments do not do things like this,” he added. When asked if he wanted to convey a message to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz Sharif, he said, “The CM does not understand that by taking these actions, she is worsening tensions between two provinces.” When asked about his response to claims that PTI founder Imran Khan is a “security threat”, CM Afridi replied, “My message is this: Imran Khan is a symbol of national unity and guarantees political and economic stability.” CM Afridi is also expected to visit the Punjab Assembly during his time in the provincial capital. To that end, the Opposition Leader in the Punjab Assembly Moeen Riaz Qureshi wrote a letter to the speaker — a copy of which is available with Dawn — to prepare for the CM’s visit. Meanwhile, the PTI posted a video on X of opposition lawmakers gathering at the Punjab Assembly to greet the KP chief minister. “During the visit, he (CM Afridi) will hold a meeting with the opposition members and will also interact with representatives of the media. The [honourable] chief minister will remain in the Assembly until 8pm,” the letter read. “In view of the above, you are kindly requested to make the necessary administrative and security arrangements for the said visit, including seating, protocol and media coordination, to ensure that the program is conducted smoothly.” Earlier today, KP Minister Meena Khan said CM Maryam should be “ashamed for trampling on Punjab’s traditions” by blocking roads and closing down restaurants. “I want to tell her that she cannot stop us from moving on our path or thwart our mission,” he said in a video posted by the party on X. “This is only practice, but the full match is coming.” Moreover, the CM’s aide on information and public relations Shafiullah Jan said that the “tsunami” would reach Lahore, despite “hurdles” he claimed were placed to stop the PTI march. “We are crossing these hurdles and moving forward. The convoy is moving. When we reach Lahore, God willing, Section 804 will be in place,“ he said, referring to Imran’s prisoner number. According to an update posted on PTI’’s official X account at 2:24pm, the KP CM had reached Bhera by then in Punjab. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had earlier said that CM Afridi, his cabinet members and members of the provincial assembly would make their first stop in Punjab at Bhera during their journey to Lahore. She had asked ticket-holders and party office-bearers from the Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin divisions to welcome Afridi at that location. An update shared by PTI‘s Central Punjab account at 1pm said that CM Afridi’s convoy had reached Chakri at the time after making its way through “blockades by police ”. Another post on the account said policemen in large numbers had been deployed at the site. Sharing a video, where PTI supporters were seen engaging with police, the party alleged that law enforcers had tried to block the CM’s convoy from moving forward at Chakri Interchange. PTI MPAs from Punjab have gathered at the provincial assembly to welcome and meet the KP CM. The PTI has also alleged that police arrested scores of party leaders and workers late on Thursday night. “The Punjab government is scared to the extent that police began carrying out raids on Thursday night and picked hundreds of party workers,” stated PTI MPA Farrukh Javed Moon in a video message. Instead, he said, the Punjab government should act democratically and welcome the KP CM. Sohail Afridi on Thursday had said that the PTI would launch a street movement in line with the directives of its founder, Imran Khan, with “ full force ”. Meanwhile, Malik had said that the PTI would follow party founder Imran Khan’s directives to launch a “mass protest movement” in Pakistan’s largest province by population. She said it would be a “historic moment” to convert Lahore’s main boulevard into a march for the release of Khan. The chief organiser instructed all ticket-holders, office-bearers, workers, and lawyers in the Lahore division to ensure their presence at Liberty Roundabout to welcome CM Afridi. More to follow",

Talking to the media, she remarked that during his visit, former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur was shown “the lights of Lahore” and now CM Afridi should also witness Punjab and Lahore’s beauty and progress and replicate in KP whatever positives he observes in Punjab. Bukhari called Lahore “the Europe of Pakistan,” adding that if conditions in Peshawar are poor, visiting Lahore for learning and recreation is welcome. She stressed that the KP CM has full permission for tourism, political or informative, but he will not be allowed to use abusive language, create unrest, or spread chaos. She further warned that bringing weapons or drugs to Lahore would not be allowed. Referring to past protests, she said CM Afridi is “not a bigger leader than ‘Fitna Khan’ (Imran Khan)” and that the public response to protest calls during Afridi’s Lahore visit would be worse than what the PTI founder received. Highlighting the festive atmosphere due to Christmas, Bukhari added that Liberty Market is beautifully decorated with lights and a tree, but emphasised any attempt to damage public property would not be tolerated. Bukhari also regretted that the Lahore police contacted the KP CM’s staff today without receiving any response. “We will extend warm hospitality to guests,” Azma Bukhari concluded. “But guests must behave like guests.” Afridi reaches Lahore An earlier video shared by the party at 4:33pm showed Afridi’s vehicle entering Lahore through a toll plaza, while vehicles belonging to workers and supporters were halted and the toll plaza was subsequently closed. Speaking to reporters after crossing Ravi Toll Plaza, the CM noted that while he had been granted entry, at least seven accompanying vehicles had been stopped. “Workers from Mandi Bahauddin were stopped from travelling to Lahore through Bhera,” he said, claiming that roads were blocked and party workers had been arrested. A reporter informed him that media vehicles had also been denied entry. “Democratic governments do not do things like this,” he added. When asked if he wanted to convey a message to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz Sharif, he said, “The CM does not understand that by taking these actions, she is worsening tensions between two provinces.” When asked about his response to claims that PTI founder Imran Khan is a “security threat”, CM Afridi replied, “My message is this: Imran Khan is a symbol of national unity and guarantees political and economic stability.” CM Afridi is also expected to visit the Punjab Assembly during his time in the provincial capital. To that end, the Opposition Leader in the Punjab Assembly Moeen Riaz Qureshi wrote a letter to the speaker — a copy of which is available with Dawn — to prepare for the CM’s visit. Meanwhile, the PTI posted a video on X of opposition lawmakers gathering at the Punjab Assembly to greet the KP chief minister. “During the visit, he (CM Afridi) will hold a meeting with the opposition members and will also interact with representatives of the media. The [honourable] chief minister will remain in the Assembly until 8pm,” the letter read. “In view of the above, you are kindly requested to make the necessary administrative and security arrangements for the said visit, including seating, protocol and media coordination, to ensure that the program is conducted smoothly.” Earlier today, KP Minister Meena Khan said CM Maryam should be “ashamed for trampling on Punjab’s traditions” by blocking roads and closing down restaurants. “I want to tell her that she cannot stop us from moving on our path or thwart our mission,” he said in a video posted by the party on X. “This is only practice, but the full match is coming.” Moreover, the CM’s aide on information and public relations Shafiullah Jan said that the “tsunami” would reach Lahore, despite “hurdles” he claimed were placed to stop the PTI march. “We are crossing these hurdles and moving forward. The convoy is moving. When we reach Lahore, God willing, Section 804 will be in place,“ he said, referring to Imran’s prisoner number. According to an update posted on PTI’’s official X account at 2:24pm, the KP CM had reached Bhera by then in Punjab. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had earlier said that CM Afridi, his cabinet members and members of the provincial assembly would make their first stop in Punjab at Bhera during their journey to Lahore. She had asked ticket-holders and party office-bearers from the Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin divisions to welcome Afridi at that location. An update shared by PTI‘s Central Punjab account at 1pm said that CM Afridi’s convoy had reached Chakri at the time after making its way through “blockades by police ”. Another post on the account said policemen in large numbers had been deployed at the site. Sharing a video, where PTI supporters were seen engaging with police, the party alleged that law enforcers had tried to block the CM’s convoy from moving forward at Chakri Interchange. PTI MPAs from Punjab have gathered at the provincial assembly to welcome and meet the KP CM. The PTI has also alleged that police arrested scores of party leaders and workers late on Thursday night. “The Punjab government is scared to the extent that police began carrying out raids on Thursday night and picked hundreds of party workers,” stated PTI MPA Farrukh Javed Moon in a video message. Instead, he said, the Punjab government should act democratically and welcome the KP CM. Sohail Afridi on Thursday had said that the PTI would launch a street movement in line with the directives of its founder, Imran Khan, with “ full force ”. Meanwhile, Malik had said that the PTI would follow party founder Imran Khan’s directives to launch a “mass protest movement” in Pakistan’s largest province by population. She said it would be a “historic moment” to convert Lahore’s main boulevard into a march for the release of Khan. The chief organiser instructed all ticket-holders, office-bearers, workers, and lawyers in the Lahore division to ensure their presence at Liberty Roundabout to welcome CM Afridi. More to follow",

      "summary": "LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, who arrived in Lahore earlier today with PTI leaders and workers, led a rally at Liberty Chowk in the provincial capital. Afridi arrived in Lahore to spearhead PTI‘s plans to launch a street movement and to meet the party’s local leadership. As of 11:43pm, PTI workers and supporters were participating in the rally, with the KP CM joining them in sloganeering. The PTI posted a video showing CM Afridi amid a crowd of supporters raising his fist and chanting slogans. At 10:18pm, the PTI’s Lahore chapter posted a video on X showing CM Afridi leaning out of a car and sloganeering, while supporters showered his vehicle with flowers. KP Minister for Higher Education and Local Government Meena Khan Afridi could also be seen chanting slogans. Another video posted at 10:37 showed the KP CM mingling with crowds of supporters chanting slogans. PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters, Aleema Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi are also present at Liberty Chowk. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja wrote in an earlier post on X at 9:32pm that he and CM Afridi were at Liberty Chowk, but the Punjab Police were “blocking their path”. Earlier, visiting PTI members, including Meena Khan, were involved in a fracas with guards at the Punjab Assembly. A video of the scuffle was shared by the PTI at 8:42 PM, showing pushing and shoving within a crowd that included Meena Khan, KP CM’s aide Shafiullah Jan, and guards, along with people shouting. CM Afridi addresses PTI lawmakers in Punjab Assembly The KP CM addressed PTI lawmakers during his visit to the Punjab Assembly, expressing gratitude to the people of Punjab for their hospitality, but highlighting his treatment by the police during the group’s journey to Lahore. “Today, the Punjab Police were rude to our workers at Chakri Interchange, Bhera, Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin,” he said. “Our workers, our parliamentarians, our leaders — they were harassed and arrested. This cannot be condemned enough.” CM Afridi assailed the federal government for failure to handle the economy, brain drain and declining industrial growth. “Farmers are being driven to suicide. And what are their priorities? Making sure the PTI cannot hold rallies, stopping Imran Khan from meeting his sisters and arresting our workers,” he stated. Earlier this evening, a video shared by the PTI on X showed the CM‘s vehicle showered with flowers by party workers and supporters as he arrived at PTI leader Latif Khosa’s residence. CM Afridi, flanked by Khosa, then addressed reporters at the latter’s residence, acknowledging party supporters who came out in support of the PTI. “They say that Punjab‘s people do not come out. But they did because on February 8, you only had 17 seats,” he said. “Punjab’s people came out because Imran Khan had 180 seats. “The people of Punjab and Pakistan stand with only one leader: he is sitting in Adiala jail right now and his name is Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi.” Traders shut markets in Gulberg Traders in Gulberg market closed down their shops, offices and business premises on Friday evening following the announcement of a PTI rally, led by KP CM Afridi at Liberty roundabout. “On the appeal of Gulberg Traders Board—a body of 18 major markets, the shopkeepers closed down their businesses at 7pm,” the board’s chairman Sohail Sarfraz Munj said while talking to Dawn. “No, we have closed down the shops voluntarily, keeping in view the law and order situation that may deteriorate due to the PTI rally . We took the decision after the police informed us about a possible security threat,“ said the senior trader when asked if the police had asked them to shut down. Faisal, a property dealer at Liberty Roundabout, also confirmed the development, adding that the traders had shut their shops after receiving a message from the traders’ board president. “All shops have been closed in view of the law and order situation,” he said.

Speaking at the graduation ceremony at the Kabul Police Academy, Haqqani announced that the doors for negotiations were open. He said that his government continues to adhere to the commitments made under the Doha Agreement, not allowing Afghanistan’s soil to be used against any country, the Afghan Taliban’s official media reported. However, despite earlier promises and the commitments made in the Doha Agreement, cross-border infiltration and attacks by militants continue in Pakistan. Haqqani said that Afghanistan posed no threat to any country or region and that the Taliban leadership continued to strive to find ways for reasonable and durable solutions to end mistrust and misunderstanding of the international community. “The doors for negotiations to resolve current issues are not closed,“ he said. Although Haqqani did not mention Pakistan by name, he appeared to refer to Pakistan’s long-standing demand from Kabul to rein in the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Relations between the two neighbours are strained following border skirmishes, which led to the closure of borders between the two countries since October 11, 2025.

The remarks by Haqqani are significant in that the TTP owes its allegiance to him and has been operating from areas in Afghanistan that have been under his control since long. It was precisely for this reason that Haqqani’s younger brother, Anas Haqqani, was part of the Afghan Taliban team negotiating with their Pakistani counterparts in Qatar and Turkiye.",

      "title_orig": "Nigeria signals more strikes likely in ‘joint’ US operations",
      "summary_orig": "Nigeria on Friday signaled that more strikes against terrorist groups were expected after a Christmas Day bombardment by US forces against militants in the north of the country, which it said was a joint operation with its military. The west African country faces multiple interlinked security crises, with terrorists waging an insurgency in the northeast since 2009 and armed “bandit” gangs raiding villages and staging kidnappings in the northwest. The strikes came after Abuja and Washington were locked in a diplomatic dispute over what US President Donald Trump has characterised as the mass killing of Christians amid Nigeria’s myriad armed conflicts. A Pentagon official told AFP that “the Department of War worked with the government of Nigeria to carry out these strikes” and that they “were approved by the government of Nigeria”, without saying whether Nigeria’s military had been involved. US defence officials later posted a video of what appeared to be a nighttime missile launch from the deck of a battleship flying the US flag. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s military said in a statement that its forces, “in conjunction with the United States”, had conducted “precision strike operations”. Both countries said the strikes targeted militants linked to the Islamic State group, without providing details. Washington’s framing of the violence in Nigeria as amounting to Christian “persecution” is rejected by the Nigerian government and independent analysts, but has nonetheless resulted in increased security coordination. “It’s Nigeria that provided the intelligence,” the country’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, told broadcaster Channels TV, saying he was on the phone with US State Secretary Marco Rubio ahead of the bombardment. Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: “It is an ongoing thing, and we are working with the US. We are working with other countries as well.” Targets unclear The Department of War’s US Africa Command said “multiple ISIS terrorists” were killed in an attack in the northwestern state of Sokoto. Residents in the far-flung villages of that state told AFP they were shocked by the blasts. The strikes hit multiple locations, including a town that residents said was not a militant stronghold. Which of Nigeria’s myriad, and well-documented, armed groups were targeted remains unclear. Nigeria’s terrorist groups are mostly concentrated in the northeast, but have made inroads into the northwest. Researchers have recently linked some members of an armed group known as Lakurawa — the main terrorist group located in Sokoto State — to Islamic State Sahel Province (ISSP), which is mostly active in neighbouring Niger and Mali. Other analysts have disputed those links, and research on Lakurawa is complicated as the term has been used to describe various armed fighters in the northwest. “We initially thought it was (an) attack by Lakurawa,” said Haruna Kallah, a resident of Jabo town. That the explosions were in fact the result of a US strike “surprised us because this area has never been a Lakurawa enclave, and we have never had any attacks in the last two years.” Tukur Shehu, a resident of Tangaza, a neighbouring district, said two strikes targeted Warriya and Alkassim villages — known to house Lakurawa camps, from where they launch attacks and keep hostages. Public opinion divided Public opinion on the surprise strikes was split. “America has made its way by force in our country, to kill our people,” said Sulaiman Ibrahim, an imam in Lagos. Emmanuel Udoh, a member of the clergy at Living Faith Church, told AFP : “We are grateful with what the US has done. We are grateful with what the Nigerian government is trying to do.” While the Nigerian government has welcomed the strikes, “I think Trump would not have accepted a ‘No,’” said Malik Samuel, an Abuja-based researcher for Good Governance Africa, an NGO. Security analyst Brant Philip called the timing, on Christmas Day, “a symbolic start to official US operations in Nigeria”, adding: “The operational results of the strikes are not significant, but much is expected soon.” Tuggar said that Nigerian President Bola Tinubu “gave the go-ahead” for the strikes. The foreign minister added: “It must be made clear that it is a joint operation, and it is not targeting any religion nor simply in the name of one religion or the other.“",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan summons UK high commissioner after ‘provocative’ Bradford demonstration",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday summoned the United Kingdom’s acting high commissioner in connection with a protest outside the Pakistani consulate in Bradford, where “provocative” statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership. FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the acting UK high commissioner was summoned and issued a démarche. “The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said. The FO urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”. Earlier, two ministers of state from the PML-N said that the Pakistan government had written a letter to the UK authorities, seeking action against over “inciteful” statements, particularly in reference to a video that was circulating on social media. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani confirmed that development to Geo News , with the latter particularly mentioning that “the head of armed forces was threatened” in the video. Kayani also mentioned the opposition PTI’s involvement in the matter, naming the party, which Chaudhry didn’t. In the video, a woman appears to be wishing ill on a person without taking any name, saying that they should be “blown up in a car”. The woman can be seen surrounded by people holding PTI flags. When asked about the video, Chaudhry said, “Pakistan has formally written to the UK, expecting them to act according to their laws and justice system.“ He maintained that Pakistan had the right to take legal action against those “targeting its institutions”. Chaudhry recalled that there had been complaints before as well regarding the “use of social media platforms to incite hatred against state institutions and political figures”. “The footage of the incident is available,” he added, referring to the video being discussed. He added, “This is not a political matter, nor one pertaining to the freedom of speech.” It was a clear violation of international law and the UK law, he said, particularly mentioning the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006. “Every state is responsible for ensuring its citizens, or those who have taken asylum, or those residing there, don’t act to incite rebellion or violence against other sovereign states,” he stressed. Chaudhry further noted: “What’s concerning is the specific mention of a car bomb blast, making it a targeted issue; it is not something generalised, it seems to be carefully planned.“ “Pakistan has raised these concerns,” he said. “It appears as if there is a larger plan involved, and Pakistan has raised these concerns,” Chaudhry said. He maintained that “inciting terrorism or provoking people was not akin to freedom of expression”. “You can not have people in one state promoting terrorism against another sovereign state,” he reiterated. He hoped that the British government would take action, adding that in case of non-compliance, “Pakistan has other options as well“. Minister of State for Finance Kayani termed the incident shown in the video “unacceptable” and “unfortunate”. “We have repeatedly said that PTI spreads violence and threats under the guise of politics, justifies threats, and misuses freedom of speech,” Kayani said. He added that the party had “crossed a limit” by “threatening the armed forces’ chief with murder under the guise of political protest”. “That’s not politics[..] it’s unacceptable,” he said. He termed PTI a “national security threat”, alleging that it had always used politics to cover for “violence”. “Whether on May 9, using KP police to attack soldiers, and threatening the army chief […] if that’s not a national security threat, what is?” he said. In response to a question on whether the Pakistani government would take action in the matter, he said, “First, we will urge the UK government to take immediate legal action and investigate the matter”. However, he added that the government was open to “exploring other legal options”. Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said that the government would repatriate from the UK those (YouTubers) involved in targeting the state institutions. When asked about criticism directed towards the army chief, Naqvi had said: “The state is clear. We will not spare them.“ On Dec 4, the interior minister, in a meeting with the UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, submitted extradition papers for former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja, who Naqvi said were involved in spreading “anti-Pakistan propaganda” online.",

      "summary_en": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday summoned the United Kingdom’s acting high commissioner in connection with a protest outside the Pakistani consulate in Bradford, where “provocative” statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership. FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that the acting UK high commissioner was summoned and issued a démarche. “The demarche was issued after provocative statements were made against Pakistan’s civil and military leadership from British soil,” the FO spokesperson said. The FO urged the UK to “hold responsible elements accountable in accordance with the law”. Earlier, two ministers of state from the PML-N said that the Pakistan government had written a letter to the UK authorities, seeking action against over “inciteful” statements, particularly in reference to a video that was circulating on social media. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani confirmed that development to Geo News , with the latter particularly mentioning that “the head of armed forces was threatened” in the video. Kayani also mentioned the opposition PTI’s involvement in the matter, naming the party, which Chaudhry didn’t. In the video, a woman appears to be wishing ill on a person without taking any name, saying that they should be “blown up in a car”. The woman can be seen surrounded by people holding PTI flags. When asked about the video, Chaudhry said, “Pakistan has formally written to the UK, expecting them to act according to their laws and justice system.“ He maintained that Pakistan had the right to take legal action against those “targeting its institutions”. Chaudhry recalled that there had been complaints before as well regarding the “use of social media platforms to incite hatred against state institutions and political figures”. “The footage of the incident is available,” he added, referring to the video being discussed. He added, “This is not a political matter, nor one pertaining to the freedom of speech.” It was a clear violation of international law and the UK law, he said, particularly mentioning the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006. “Every state is responsible for ensuring its citizens, or those who have taken asylum, or those residing there, don’t act to incite rebellion or violence against other sovereign states,” he stressed. Chaudhry further noted: “What’s concerning is the specific mention of a car bomb blast, making it a targeted issue; it is not something generalised, it seems to be carefully planned.“ “Pakistan has raised these concerns,” he said. “It appears as if there is a larger plan involved, and Pakistan has raised these concerns,” Chaudhry said. He maintained that “inciting terrorism or provoking people was not akin to freedom of expression”. “You can not have people in one state promoting terrorism against another sovereign state,” he reiterated. He hoped that the British government would take action, adding that in case of non-compliance, “Pakistan has other options as well“. Minister of State for Finance Kayani termed the incident shown in the video “unacceptable” and “unfortunate”. “We have repeatedly said that PTI spreads violence and threats under the guise of politics, justifies threats, and misuses freedom of speech,” Kayani said. He added that the party had “crossed a limit” by “threatening the armed forces’ chief with murder under the guise of political protest”. “That’s not politics[..] it’s unacceptable,” he said. He termed PTI a “national security threat”, alleging that it had always used politics to cover for “violence”. “Whether on May 9, using KP police to attack soldiers, and threatening the army chief […] if that’s not a national security threat, what is?” he said. In response to a question on whether the Pakistani government would take action in the matter, he said, “First, we will urge the UK government to take immediate legal action and investigate the matter”. However, he added that the government was open to “exploring other legal options”. Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said that the government would repatriate from the UK those (YouTubers) involved in targeting the state institutions. When asked about criticism directed towards the army chief, Naqvi had said: “The state is clear.

      "summary_orig": "An explosion killed at least eight worshippers at a mosque in a predominantly Alawite area of Syria’s Homs on Friday, state media said. The attack during Friday prayers is the latest on the Alawite community, and the second blast in a place of worship since extremist authorities took power a year ago, after a suicide bombing in a Damascus church killed 25 people in June. In a statement on Telegram, terrorist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunna said its fighters “detonated a number of explosive devices” in the Imam Ali Bin Abi Talib Mosque in the central Syrian city. The group formed after the ouster last year of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, himself a member of the Alawite community, and had claimed responsibility for the June church bombing, though authorities blamed the militant Islamic State group. State news agency SANA reported an explosion in the mosque in Homs’s Wadi al-Dahab neighbourhood and gave a preliminary toll of at least eight dead and 18 wounded, citing a health ministry official. An AFP photographer saw security forces cordoning off the area around the mosque while inside, personnel stood guard as red tape encircled the blackened, debris-strewn corner where the blast went off. Usama Ibrahim, 47, who was being treated in hospital for shrapnel wounds to his head and back, said he was at Friday prayers when he heard a loud explosion. “The world turned red… and I fell to the ground. Then I saw blood flowing from my head,” he told AFP . ‘Shrapnel all around’ Syria’s interior ministry said in a statement that “a terrorist explosion” targeted the mosque and that authorities had “begun investigating and collecting evidence to pursue the perpetrators of this criminal act”. SANA quoted a security source as saying that initial investigations indicated that “explosive devices planted inside the mosque” caused the blast. As victims’ families gathered at the hospital, wounded bookseller Ghadi Maarouf, 38, told AFP that the explosion occurred “just before the imam was to ascend the minbar to deliver the sermon”, referring to the imam’s raised platform. “It was a huge explosion, and I saw shrapnel flying all around me,” said Maarouf, whose leg was wounded in the blast. Syria’s foreign ministry condemned a “cowardly criminal act”, saying it came “in the context of repeated desperate attempts to undermine security and stability and spread chaos among the Syrian people”. The ministry statement reiterated its “firm stance in combating terrorism in all its forms”, vowing to hold the attackers accountable. Several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan condemned the attack. Since Assad’s fall, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor and Homs province residents have reported kidnappings and killings targeting members of the minority community, while the country has seen several bloody sectarian episodes. Detainees released Syria’s coastal areas saw the massacre of Alawite civilians in March, with authorities accusing armed Assad supporters of sparking the violence by attacking security forces. A national commission of inquiry said at least 1,426 members of the minority were killed, while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor put the toll at more than 1,700. Late last month, thousands of people demonstrated on the coast in protest at fresh attacks targeting Alawites in Homs and other regions. Before and after the March bloodshed, authorities carried out a massive arrest campaign in predominantly Alawite areas, which are also former Assad strongholds. On Friday, Syrian state television reported the release of 70 detainees in the coastal city of Latakia “after it was proven that they were not involved in war crimes”, saying more releases would follow. Despite assurances from Damascus that all Syria’s communities will be protected, the country’s minorities remain largely wary of their future under the new authorities. In July, sectarian clashes in southern Syria’s Druze-majority Sweida province saw more than 2,000 people killed , including hundreds of Druze civilians who the Observatory said were “summarily executed by defence and interior ministry personnel”. In a speech this month marking a year since the fall of Assad, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa emphasised the importance of all Syrians unifying efforts to “to build a strong Syria”. Despite major achievements in relaunching Syria’s foreign standing, Sharaa faces the major domestic challenge of maintaining security and unity nationwide.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed five terrorists in an intelligence based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Kohlu district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday. According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operation was conducted on December 25 on the “reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Hindustan ”. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR statement added that during the conduct of the operation, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”. The military’s media wing elaborated that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, “who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”. “Sanitization operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored terrorist found in the area as relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for killing the terrorists, saying, “We will foil the nefarious designs of terrorists who are enemies of humanity,” and that the entire nation stands with the security forces in the fight against terrorism. According to a statement, the PM said the government is determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country. Earlier this month, 12 terrorists were killed during an IBO in Balochistan’s Kalat. In October, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the third quarter of 2025 due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations. Last year, the federal government, in a meeting comprising top civilian and military leaders, announced a comprehensive, nationwide anti-militant operation codenamed ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ to mitigate a rise in attacks on security forces by militant groups.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least six terrorists were killed and several others injured on Friday in a clash between police forces, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) commandos and armed locals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat. “The terrorists armed with sniper rifles and quadcopters attacked the police in the rural area bordering Bannu district and located within the limits of Shaheed Asmatullah Khan Khattak police station of Serai Naurang town,“ said a police statement. “The attack triggered a fierce gun battle as the law enforcers returned the fire effectively,” it said. As per the release, the terrorists also targeted the “houses of villagers with quadcopter strikes”, resulting in “civilian casualties”. Although the official press release did not provide any details about police casualties, it stated that “during the armed clash, the law enforcers eliminated six terrorists and several of their accomplices were injured”. “The casualties occurred as a result of explosive payload released by the quadcopters.” Meanwhile, Additional Deputy Commissioner Habibullah Wazir, who visited the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Serai Naurang town, told media persons that ten injured had been brought to the hospital so far. “Some injured have been referred to a hospital in Bannu while others were in stable condition,” he said. “The district administration has declared an emergency at the THQ Hospital as all doctors and paramedics have been called to duty,“ he maintained, adding that doctors, along with a sufficient quantity of medicines, are available and standard treatment facilities are being provided to the injured people. The hospital’s medical superintendent, Dr Ishaq, also confirmed that they had received “ten injured so far and three of them had been referred to a hospital in Bannu owing to their critical condition”. The situation was tense, and security had been tightened in the remote rural area on the special instructions of Regional Police Officer (RPO) Bannu Sajjad Khan. “The RPO and Lakki Marwat DPO Nazir Khan are supervising the operation against Fitna al Khawarij terrorists as a large police contingent backed by the CTD personnel and volunteers of peace committees are present in the area,” added the release. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. It continued that the law enforcers had surrounded the entire area and a search and clearance operation was underway, while additional forces had also been put on “high alert” to counter any untoward eventuality. “Police will continue operations against the terrorists and anti-peace elements to establish lasting peace in the region and protect people’s lives and properties,” the RPO affirmed. Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Zulfiqar Hameed also praised the Bannu police and CTD for the successful operation against the terrorists. “Such successful actions against terrorists would be further accelerated for the protection of public life and regional peace,” he stated. A terrorist commander was also killed in an exchange of fire with police and a CTD team in the Wanda Amir area of Lakki Marwat on Thursday. On the same day, two wanted suspects, one of them wanted by the Punjab police, were arrested during a targeted operation in the district. Earlier, the security forces and police had destroyed several hideouts of terrorists during an operation in the Bettani subdivision of Lakki Marwat district on Tuesday. Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022.",

      "summary_orig": "Fresh from a widely-celebrated U-19 Asia Cup triumph, skipper of the Pakistan youth team Farhan Yousaf wants his side to show humility as they take on Zimbabwe and Afghanistan in the tri-series that starts in Harare on Saturday. The series will act as a warm-up for the teams ahead of the U-19 World Cup, which is set to be held from January 15 in Zimbabwe and Namibia. Pakistan won the U-19 Asia Cup title after beating an unbeaten India side by 191 runs in the final last week — the achievement sparking raucous celebrations back home with the national youth squad welcomed by a huge crowd at the Islamabad International Airport. The decider saw Pakistan opener Sameer Minhas smash a scintillating 172 and pacer Ali Raza routing the Indian batting line-up with a four-wicket show under the mentorship of former national skipper Sarfraz Ahmed. The achievement added star value to the Pakistan U-19 team, raising expectations ahead of the tri-series and the World Cup, but for Farhan, it is about focusing on what he believes are brand new assignments. “The past is in the past, this is a new journey and a new chapter and we are preparing for it accordingly,” he said in a statement issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday. “The Asia Cup was a good win for us and the players showed great morale and intensity. “The players are confident and excited as we head into the tri-series.” Pakistan will take on Afghanistan in the tri-series opener at the Harare Sports Club before playing hosts Zimbabwe at the Prince Edward School in the capital on Dec 29. The national side will clash against Afghanistan in the reverse fixture at the Sunrise Sports Club in Harare on Jan 2 and their last round-robin match, against Zimbabwe will be played on Jan 4. The tri-series final is set to be hosted by the Harare Sports Club on Jan 6. “Both teams in the tournament are strong and competitive and we respect every opposition as we look forward to a competitive event,” said Farhan. The tri-series provides a valuable opportunity for all three sides to prepare for the U-19 World Cup, set to run until Feb 6. Pakistan are placed in Group ‘C’ and will play their group-stage matches in Harare from Jan 16-22. The Super Six stage will take place from Jan 25 to Feb 1, followed by the semi-finals on Feb 3 and 4. The final of the 16-team tournament will be played at the Harare Sports Club on Feb 6. Pakistan held their first training session on Friday ahead of their first tri-series match. “The tri-series is very important for the players and will help us find the right combinations ahead of the U-19 World Cup,” Farhan noted. “The conditions here are similar and will be beneficial for our World Cup preparations.” Pakistan U-19 squad: Farhan Yousaf (captain), Usman Khan (vice-captain), Abdul Subhan, Ahmed Hussain, Ali Hasan Baloch, Ali Raza, Daniyal Ali Khan, Hamza Zahoor (wicket-keeper), Huzaifa Ahsan, Momin Qamar, Mohammad Sayyam, Mohammad Shayan (wicket-keeper), Niqab Shafiq, Sameer Minhas, Umar Zaib",

The tri-series final is set to be hosted by the Harare Sports Club on Jan 6. “Both teams in the tournament are strong and competitive and we respect every opposition as we look forward to a competitive event,” said Farhan. The tri-series provides a valuable opportunity for all three sides to prepare for the U-19 World Cup, set to run until Feb 6. Pakistan are placed in Group ‘C’ and will play their group-stage matches in Harare from Jan 16-22. The Super Six stage will take place from Jan 25 to Feb 1, followed by the semi-finals on Feb 3 and 4. The final of the 16-team tournament will be played at the Harare Sports Club on Feb 6. Pakistan held their first training session on Friday ahead of their first tri-series match. “The tri-series is very important for the players and will help us find the right combinations ahead of the U-19 World Cup,” Farhan noted. “The conditions here are similar and will be beneficial for our World Cup preparations.” Pakistan U-19 squad: Farhan Yousaf (captain), Usman Khan (vice-captain), Abdul Subhan, Ahmed Hussain, Ali Hasan Baloch, Ali Raza, Daniyal Ali Khan, Hamza Zahoor (wicket-keeper), Huzaifa Ahsan, Momin Qamar, Mohammad Sayyam, Mohammad Shayan (wicket-keeper), Niqab Shafiq, Sameer Minhas, Umar Zaib",

      "summary_orig": "President Donald Trump said US forces conducted “powerful and deadly” strikes on Thursday against Islamic State (IS) militants in northwestern Nigeria, weeks after he warned against any systemic assault on Christians in the country. The Nigerian foreign ministry early on Friday confirmed the air strikes, describing them as “precision hits on terrorist targets” in the country. The Department of Defence’s US Africa Command said “multiple ISIS terrorists” were killed in an attack in Sokoto state conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities, but few details were provided and it was not clear how many people died. The strikes hit IS targets on Christmas Day, according to Trump. View this post on Instagram “I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. “May God Bless our Military,” he said, adding provocatively, “MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, including the dead Terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues.” The attacks mark the first by US forces in Nigeria under Trump, and come after the Republican leader unexpectedly berated the west African nation in October and November, saying Christians there faced an “existential threat” that amounted to “genocide” amid Nigeria’s myriad armed conflicts. That diplomatic offensive was welcomed by some but interpreted by others as inflaming religious tensions in Africa’s most populous country, which has seen bouts of sectarian violence in the past. Nigeria’s government and independent analysts reject framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution — a narrative long used by the Christian right in the United States and Europe. But Trump, spotlighting what his administration says is global persecution of Christians, stressed last month that Washington was ready to take military action in Nigeria — with “guns-a-blazing” — to counter such killings. ‘Grateful’ for cooperation The Nigerian foreign ministry said the country was engaged with international partners against terrorism. “Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorism and violent extremism,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth took to X to say he was “grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.” The United States this year placed Nigeria back on the list of countries of “particular concern” regarding religious freedom, and has restricted the issuance of visas to Nigerians. Trump last month also threatened to stop all aid to Abuja if it “continues to allow the killing of Christians“. Nigeria is almost evenly divided between a Muslim-majority north and largely Christian south. Its northeast has been in the grip of violence for more than 15 years by the Boko Haram group, which has claimed more than 40,000 lives and displaced two million people. At the same time, large parts of the country’s northwest, north and centre have been hit by criminal gangs known as “bandits” who attack villages, killing and kidnapping residents. On Wednesday, an explosion ripped through a mosque in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, killing at least seven worshippers. No armed groups immediately claimed responsibility.",

      "summary_orig": "Fourteen people were injured in a stabbing attack in a factory in central Japan during which an unspecified liquid was also sprayed, an emergency services official said on Friday. “Fourteen people are subject to transportation by emergency services,” Tomoharu Sugiyama, a firefighting department official in the city of Mishima in the Shizuoka region, told AFP . He said a call was received at about 4.30pm (12:30pm PKT) from a nearby rubber factory saying “five or six people were stabbed by someone” and that a “spray-like liquid” had also been used. Japanese media, including public broadcaster NHK , reported that police had arrested a man on suspicion of attempted murder. The seriousness of the injuries was unknown, although NHK said all victims remained conscious. Sugiyama said at least six of the 14 victims had been sent to a hospital in a fleet of ambulances. The exact nature of the injuries was also unclear. The factory in Mishima is run by Yokohama Rubber Co., whose business includes manufacturing tyres for trucks and buses, according to its corporate website. Violent crime is relatively rare in Japan, which has a low murder rate and some of the world’s toughest gun laws. However, there are occasional stabbing attacks and even shootings, including the assassination of former prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2022. A Japanese man was sentenced to death in October for a shooting and stabbing rampage that killed four people, including two police officers, in 2023. A 43-year-old man was also charged with attempted murder in May over a knife attack at Tokyo’s Toda-mae metro station.",

Citing a statement by the Border Troops of the Tajik State Committee for National Security, state news agency Khovar reported that three people crossed into the country late on Tuesday in the Shamsiddin Shohin district of the country’s southwestern Khatlon region, and were later located on Wednesday. “The terrorists refused to obey orders from Tajik border guards to surrender and offered armed resistance. They intended to carry out an armed attack on one of the border posts of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan,” the statement said. “As a result of the combat operation, all three terrorists were neutralised,” the statement said, adding that two Tajik border officers were killed during the clashes. According to the statement, this was the third “armed attack, terrorist act, and border crossing” from Afghanistan in the past month. It also accused the Afghan government of “demonstrating serious and repeated irresponsibility and non-commitment in fulfilling its international obligations and consistent promises to ensure security and stability” on the Tajik-Afghan border. The Tajik statement additionally expressed hope that the Afghan administration will “apologise to the people of Tajikistan and take additional effective measures to ensure security on the border with Tajikistan”. Afghanistan did not immediately comment on the development. Earlier this month, Tajikistan said five people were killed and five others injured in two previous cross-border attacks from Afghanistan. On Wednesday, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon commissioned four new border outposts, as well as a training range for tanks at the Harb-Maidon training ground near the Tajik-Afghan border, as part of efforts to bolster border security amid growing concerns over cross-border attacks.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has condemned the recent surge of violence, vandalism, and arson targeting media houses in Bangladesh. A joint statement issued by PFUJ President Afzal Butt, and Secretary General Arshad Ansari on Friday said, “Silencing the press through physical intimidation is a direct violation of the constitutional right to freedom of expression and the rule of law.” The statement comes days after Bangladesh saw violent protests following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka on December 16 while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died in Singapore on December 18. Following his death, violent protests broke out and several buildings, including those housing leading newspapers Prothom Alo and The Daily Star , were set on fire and vandalised. Protesters accused the newspapers of enabling Hadi’s killing, calling them “Delhi’s lapdog” and “Sheikh Hasina’s enabler,” claims the newspapers denied. The PFUJ statement denounced these “targeted attacks”,  as well as the “deplorable physical assault“ on Nurul Kabir, the veteran editor of New Age newspaper and president of  Editors’ Council of Bangladesh. The PFUJ also expressed deep concern over reports that more than 100 journalists in Bangladesh remain detained without trial, demanding their immediate and unconditional release. Moreover, the statement highlighted a “disturbing regional trend”, pointing to similar violence in Nepal. “Just months ago, mob attacks targeted the Kantipur Group , Annapurna Post , and Image TV ,” the statement said, adding that the PFUJ leadership also paid tribute to photojournalist Suresh Rajak of Avenews TV , who tragically died in an arson attack on March 28, 2025, in Kathmandu. The PFUJ noted with “regret that perpetrators of these crimes remain unaccountable”. It called upon the governments concerned to conduct fair, impartial, and speedy investigations into all incidents of arson and violence; identify and bring the perpetrators to justice to end the culture of impunity; and ensure the safety of journalists as they perform their professional duties. “Violence and harassment aimed at silencing the media are unacceptable in any democratic society,” the statement concluded.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: China continues to strengthen its position as a major global arms supplier, with Pakistan emerging as its most significant and trusted partner in the air combat domain, according to a Pentagon report sent to the US Congress this week. The report states that as of December 2024, China remained the world’s fourth-largest arms exporter, relying primarily on state-owned defence companies such as the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and North Industries Corporation (Norinco). It notes that China’s arms exports are closely linked to its broader foreign policy and development outreach, including initiatives associated with the Belt and Road framework, and are particularly attractive to developing countries due to affordability and flexible terms. According to this report, Pakistan figures prominently in China’s aviation exports. Beijing currently offers three fixed-wing combat aircraft for export: the fifth-generation FC-31 stealth fighter, the fourth-generation J-10C multirole combat aircraft, and the JF-17 Thunder, which is jointly developed and produced by China and Pakistan. Importantly, the report confirms that Pakistan is the only country to which China has exported the J-10C. As of May 2025, China had delivered 20 J-10C aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force under two orders placed since 2020, with total orders amounting to 36 aircraft. While several other countries — including Egypt, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Iran and Bangladesh — have expressed interest, no J-10C exports beyond Pakistan have taken place. Pentagon report says Beijing has strengthened its position as major arms supplier The report also highlights the JF-17 programme as a successful example of defence collaboration between two developing countries. Jointly produced by Pakistan and China, the aircraft is already in service with multiple air forces. As of 2024, Azerbaijan, Myanmar and Nigeria were operating the JF-17, while Iraq was reported to be in discussions. For Pakistan, the aircraft remains a central component of its air force as well as an important defence export. In addition to manned aircraft, the Pentagon report notes that China has supplied Pakistan with advanced, strike-capable unma­nned aerial vehicles, including the Caihong and Wing Loong series. These systems have also been exported to several other countries, reflecting China’s growing role in the global UAV market. Beyond aviation, the report says China exports a wide range of military equipment across land, air defence and naval domains. Pakistan is identified as a long-standing recipient of Chinese naval platforms, including four frigates delivered in 2017 and 2018. The report adds that China is expected to expand its naval exports in the coming years, with Pakistan remaining among its core partners. The Pentagon assessment attributes China’s growing appeal in the global arms market to competitive pricing, flexible financing and the absence of restrictive political conditions. For Pakistan, the defence relationship with China is not limited to arms purchases but reflects a mature partnership encompassing joint development, production and long-term strategic cooperation, the report notes.

      "summary_orig": "• Also curbs powers to place names on passport control list for five years or more • Authority deemed beyond scope of parent law; Centre gets 30 days to revise rules LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has set aside the federal government’s power to inactivate a citizen’s passport and imp­ose a travel ban of five years or more by placing a person on the Passport Control List (PCL) — adjudicating that this authority was beyond the scope of the parent law. However, Justice Asim Hafeez upheld the government’s powers to cancel, impound, or confiscate passports, subject to the fulfilment of statutory requirements. The judgement was delivered at the Multan bench while allowing a petition filed by citizen Farhan Ali, who took up two grievances before the court. First, he sought the setting aside of an order that dismissed his representation against the placement of his name on the PCL as premature. Second, he questioned the legality and constitutionality of the power to inactivate a passport under Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, contending that such power was not provided under Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974 , which authorised only cancellation, impounding, or confiscation of a passport. The judge noted that the petitioner’s request for removal of name from the PCL had been dec­lined under clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 of the Passports Rules , 2021, which prescribed a normal retention period of five years or more. He observed that a person placed in Category ‘B’ might be omitted even before the completion of five years while an appeal was under consideration. Under category ‘B’, the list includes individuals refused passports for reasons other than anti-state activities. Names may also be placed in this category on the recommendations of government agencies or departments. ‘Lacking statutory backing’ Justice Hafeez held that clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 lacked statutory backing, describing it as arbitrary, disproportionate, and beyond the scope of the parent law. He noted that the provision offered no categorisation or guidelines for determining proportionate restraint and conferred unstructured discretion upon the executive. On the issue of passport inactivation, the judge held that Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974, did not provide for inactivation. Declaring the clause substantially ultra vires the law, the judge directed the federal government to rationalise restraint periods in proportion to the nature of violations, noting that illegal overstay could not be equated with migrant smuggling, human trafficking, or criminal conduct abroad. Justice Hafeez explained that inactivation was an informal action — wrapped in obscurity — often used to avoid procedural requirements and due-process obligations under the law. He noted that “surreptitious inactivation” had caused travellers to find themselves in unexpected and humiliating situations at airports despite holding valid passports and visas. Justice Hafeez ruled that Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, conflicted with the scheme of the parent law, and that the delegated legislation failed when it exceeded statutory limits or replaced legislative judgement with executive discretion. “Inactivation of a passport manifests denial of the right to travel in a covert manner not envisaged by the Act,” the judge observed. “I hold that power to inactivate passport under Rule 23 of the Rules 2021 is beyond the scope of Section 8 of the Act 1974 and same is declared ultra vires — only the power to inactivate is declared invalid and powers to cancel, impound or confiscate are intact and exercisable subject to the existence of conditions and fulfilment of requirements,” the judge wrote in the verdict. ‘30 days’ The judge ordered that the verdict would take effect after 30 days to allow the federal government to revise the rules in conformity with Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974. He allowed the petition and the impugned order dated Oct 6, 2025, was set aside. The government was directed to decide the petitioner’s representation afresh in light of the judgement. The verdict was announced after hearing arguments from the petitioner’s counsel, law officers representing the federal government, and officials from the Federal Investigation Agency and Immigration and Passports Department.
