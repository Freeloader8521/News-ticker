Over the past months, protesters aligned with conservative civic groups — mostly right-wing supporters of former President Yoon Suk Yeol — have staged demonstrations. Some participants even showed aggressive behavior, tearing down banners depicting the Chinese ambassador’s face, shouting slogans such as “China Out” and confronting foreign tourists with hostile remarks. Demonstrators have also linked their grievances to various alleged crimes by Chinese nationals, intensifying the wave of animosity. According to data released by Rep. Chung Choon-saeng of the minor Rebuilding Korea Party on Wednesday, the number of anti-China rallies in Seoul’s Myeong-dong area — where the Chinese Embassy is located — was 20 in 2022, 15 in 2023 and 13 in 2024.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Asia Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final. The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Subsequently, Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup. Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team. Today, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday , Financial Express and Hindustan Times , reported that Naqvi had now apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy. Responding to an India Today post about their report on social media platform X, Naqvi stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.” He called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people. The PCB chairman slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”. “As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.” During the Asia Cup, Naqvi had previously expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” from the Indian side after Yadav seemingly politicised the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May. Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention . Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. The PCB had lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Yadav’s remarks, leading to him reportedly being fined 30 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct. Meanwhile, pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against India. Following the final, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on winning the match, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor. Naqvi had also responded to Modi’s post on X, saying: “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”. “Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he had said.",

The spokesperson said that the “terrorists had previously been involved in attacking security forces and belonged to a banned terrorist outfit.” “The slain terrorists have not yet been identified,” the spokesperson said, adding that their “bodies have been transferred to a hospital for identification purposes.” “Further investigation into the matter is underway,” the statement said. The development comes a day after 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps (FC) in Quetta. The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency , have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.

      "summary_orig": "MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Tuesday witnessed an overwhelming shutter-down and wheeljam strike on the second consecutive day amid intermittent skirmishes between law enforcers and activists in the state capital Muzaffarabad. The atmosphere was highly charged following the death of one person and injuries to several others a day earlier. Although government offices remained open, attendance was thin for want of transport. Banks were also open but hardly saw any client. All private businesses and shops, including medical stores, remained closed. Even street vendors were nowhere to be seen. Angry youngsters, some carrying batons, blocked intercity roads in many areas of the state capital till afternoon by placing different obstacles and torching bushes. Nevertheless, some private vehicles and motorcycles were seen running through the roads sporadically, without facing serious resistance from the activists. On receiving information about blockades, police personnel swiftly rushed to clear the road obstacles. Skirmishes reported between activists of JKJAAC and law enforcers in Muzaffarabad; angry youngsters block inter-city roads in many areas According to witnesses, at several such places they lobbed tear gas shells to quell disturbance and also made arrests. In some areas, law enforcers were also pelted with stones from the mountain slopes, forced them to retreat to safety. On Tuesday, there were reports of minor casualties on both sides, but these could not be verified as government officials refrained from sharing anything with the media. Authentic figures of detainees could not be obtained either. This correspondent tried to reach out to a number of senior officials, but their staff said “they were busy in meetings and unable to take calls”. One senior police official did attend the call after several attempts, but declined to confirm or contradict the number of detainees. By the afternoon, thousands of people gathered at Muzaffarabad’s Lal Chowk where Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) leaders, including Shaukat Nawaz Mir, addressed them. “A state is like a mother, but unfortunately ours has turned out to be a witch that killed its own children,” fumed Mr Mir. On Monday, Muhammad Sudhir, a 30-year-old shopkeeper belonging to Neelum Valley, was killed in Muzaffarabad after sustaining gunshot wounds. The JKJAAC alleged the shots were fired by the participants of a government-backed rally, led by Raja Saqib Majeed of Muslim Conference. Late on Monday night, relatives and other activists had placed his body on the main artery in Chehla Bandi negibourhood to press the authorities for registration of an FIR against Mr Majeed and other accused. The body was removed only after their demands were met. “We have full recording evidence as to who fired upon peaceful protesters and at whose behest,” Mr Mir said. Reports from Rawalakot said that thousands of people had assembled at Tourism Chowk, but police avoided confronting them. According to local journalists, the participants might start a march on Wednesday either to some entry points or straight to Muzaffarabad. In Dadyal, where tensions had escalated immensely in a similar protest in May last year, thousands of people threw huge containers into the river from Palaak Bridge where they had been placed by the administration, apparently to block movement between Kotli and Mirpur district. Media affected Meanwhile, the absolute suspension of internet and mobile phone services since Sunday hit the journalist community hard as no local newspaper could be published for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Many of those working for the national and international media, as well as some of the vloggers, had to travel to Garhi Habibullah in the neighbouring KP, from where they filed their stories and uploaded the stuff on Sunday and Monday. But on Tuesday it was learnt that internet services had also been snapped in Garhi Habibullah, forcing some of the journalists to travel up to Mansehra for filing reports.

      "summary_orig": "The death toll from a 6.9-magnitude earthquake that hit the central Philippines has risen to 69, a disaster official said on Wednesday as the government mobilised agencies to search for survivors and restore power and water supplies. In Bogo city in the north of Cebu province, which was near the epicentre of the shallow quake that struck off the coast just before 10pm on Tuesday, the hospital has been “overwhelmed,” Civil Defence official Raffy Alejandro told reporters. The death toll of 69 was based on data from the Cebu provincial disaster office and was subject to validation, said Jane Abapo, an information officer at the regional Civil Defence office. Another official said more than 150 people were injured. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr assured survivors of swift assistance, saying cabinet secretaries were on the ground directing relief operations, as he expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones. Cebu, one of the Philippines’ most popular tourist destinations, is home to 3.4 million people. Despite the damage, Mactan-Cebu International Airport, the country’s second busiest gateway, remained operational. Another hard-hit town, San Remigio, was placed under a state of calamity to help the response and relief efforts. Vice Mayor Alfie Reynes appealed for food and water for evacuees, as well as heavy equipment to aid search and rescue workers. “It is raining heavily and there is no electricity, so we really need help, especially in the northern part because there’s a scarcity of water after supply lines were damaged by the earthquake,” Reynes told DZMM radio. In the nearby town of Pilar, resident Archel Coraza said most of his family were asleep when their house began to shake violently. “I woke them up and we all rushed outside into the street,” he told DZMM . Coraza, who lives close to the shoreline, said he saw seawater recede after the tremor. Local media posted videos of people rushing out of their homes as the ground shook and buildings collapsed, including a church that was more than 100 years old. Reynes said among the deceased were some people who had been playing basketball in a sports complex in San Remigio when it partially collapsed due to the quake. Earthquake monitoring agencies put the quake’s depth at around 10km and recorded multiple aftershocks, the strongest having a magnitude of 6. There was no tsunami threat following the quake. The Philippines lies in the Pacific “Ring of Fire“, where volcanic activity and earthquakes are common. The country had two major earthquakes in January, with no casualties reported. In 2023, a 6.7-magnitude offshore earthquake killed eight people.",

      "summary_orig": "• Four security personnel among those martyred as explosive-laden van explodes at well-guarded entrance to Hali Road • Four terrorists ‘in FC uniforms’ gunned down while trying to breach security installation QUETTA: At least 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred and over 30 others sustained injuries in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps, while five terrorists were killed while trying to breach the heavily guarded facility. Police officials said a suicide bomber driving an explosive-laden van  attempted to enter the well-guarded Hali Road from the Khojak Road area of Modal Town on Tuesday. At the entrance to Hali Road, the vehicle hit spikes and a barrier installed near the picket and exploded. The blast claimed the lives of six civilians, while four personnel were martyred, they added. Ten people lost their lives in the blast and 33 were injured, six of them seriously, Minister Health Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Dawn . There were at least two women among the seriously injured, he added. Shortly after the blast, four alleged terrorists in FC uniforms entered Hali Road attempted to breach the FC headquarters amid heavy firing. But security personnel foiled the atte­mpt. A gun battle with the terrorists ens­u­ed, who were armed with modern wea­pons and hand grenades, but they were gunned down by security personnel. “In all, five terrorists have been killed. One in an explosive-laden vehicle and four were eliminated by the FC personnel in the gun battle,” said a senior official of the home department while talking to Dawn. He disclosed that the attackers were wearing FC uniforms to dodge security. “No terrorist could reach up to the gates of the FC headquarters,” security officials said. They said that four AK-47 rifles, three grenade launchers, 15 grenades, hundreds of bullets and other items were recovered from the terrorists. An eyewitness said that all the attackers were very young. “The FC snipers sitting on a nearby building targeted the attacks from the roof,” he told Dawn , adding that the attackers also lobbed hand grenades at the security men.

The security guard of a TV channel also sustained injuries in the blast, witnesses said. They said the many of the victims were pedestrians and those travelling on the road at the time of the blast.

No one has claimed responsibility of the suicide attack so far. But interestingly, the president and PM attributed differing identities to the terrorists who carried out the attack in Quetta. A  statement issued by the President’s Secretariat said President Asif Ali  Zardari “strongly condemned the suicide attack in Quetta carried out by the Fitna-al-Khawarij , the misguided extremists acting on  India’s agenda”. However, the federal government posted on X that Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif had commended the security forces for killing the “terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan ” who carried out the attack. Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned  Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna al Hindustan refers to the  allegedly India-backed Baloch separatist groups. Balochistan Inspector General Mohammad Tahir visited the blast site along with senior police officers and was briefed on the initial evidence, the nature of the blast, the situation at the scene, and the progress of the investigation. Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the “terrorist attack”. A Balochistan government post on X, formerly Twitter, quoted him as saying that security forces gave a swift and effective response, eliminating four terrorists. “The terrorists cannot weaken the nation’s resolve through cowardly acts. The sacrifices of the people and security forces will not go in vain. We remain committed to making Balochistan peaceful and secure.

      "summary_en": "• Four security personnel among those martyred as explosive-laden van explodes at well-guarded entrance to Hali Road • Four terrorists ‘in FC uniforms’ gunned down while trying to breach security installation QUETTA: At least 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred and over 30 others sustained injuries in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps, while five terrorists were killed while trying to breach the heavily guarded facility. Police officials said a suicide bomber driving an explosive-laden van  attempted to enter the well-guarded Hali Road from the Khojak Road area of Modal Town on Tuesday. At the entrance to Hali Road, the vehicle hit spikes and a barrier installed near the picket and exploded. The blast claimed the lives of six civilians, while four personnel were martyred, they added. Ten people lost their lives in the blast and 33 were injured, six of them seriously, Minister Health Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Dawn . There were at least two women among the seriously injured, he added. Shortly after the blast, four alleged terrorists in FC uniforms entered Hali Road attempted to breach the FC headquarters amid heavy firing. But security personnel foiled the atte­mpt. A gun battle with the terrorists ens­u­ed, who were armed with modern wea­pons and hand grenades, but they were gunned down by security personnel. “In all, five terrorists have been killed. One in an explosive-laden vehicle and four were eliminated by the FC personnel in the gun battle,” said a senior official of the home department while talking to Dawn. He disclosed that the attackers were wearing FC uniforms to dodge security. “No terrorist could reach up to the gates of the FC headquarters,” security officials said. They said that four AK-47 rifles, three grenade launchers, 15 grenades, hundreds of bullets and other items were recovered from the terrorists. An eyewitness said that all the attackers were very young. “The FC snipers sitting on a nearby building targeted the attacks from the roof,” he told Dawn , adding that the attackers also lobbed hand grenades at the security men.

      "title_orig": "India plans mega dam to counter China water fears",
      "summary_orig": "RIEW: On a football field ringed by misty mountains, the air rang with fiery speeches as tribesmen protested a planned mega-dam, India’s latest move in its contest with China over Himalayan water. India says the proposed new structure could counteract rival China’s building of a likely record-breaking dam upstream in Tibet by stockpiling water and guarding against releases of weaponised torrents. But for those at one of the possible sites for what would be India’s largest dam, the project feels like a death sentence. “We will fight till the end of time,” said Tapir Jamoh, a resident of the thatch-hut village of Riew, raising a bow loaded with a poison-tipped arrow in a gesture of defiance against authorities. “We will not let a dam be built.” Jamoh’s homelands of the Adi people are in the far-flung northeastern corner of India, divided from Tibet and Myanmar by soaring snowy peaks. Beijing, which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, says its project will have no ‘negative impact’ downstream Proposed blueprints show India considering the site in Arunachal Pradesh for a massive storage reservoir, equal to four million Olympic-size swimming pools, behind a 280-metre (918-foot) high dam. The project comes as China presses ahead with the $167 billion Yaxia project upstream of Riew on the river known in India as the Siang, and in Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo. China’s plan includes five hydropower stations, that could produce three times more electricity than its vast Three Gorges dam — the world’s largest power station —though other details remain scant. Beijing — which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, rejected by India — says it will have no “negative impact” downstream. “China has never had, and will never have, any intention to use cross-border hydropower projects on rivers to harm the interests of downstream countries or coerce them,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said. Chinese reports hint at a tunnel-diversion project, while India eyes Riew for its mega-dam. Locals like 69-year-old Jamoh say damming the Siang would erase their culture and identity. Despite a thaw between New Delhi and Beijing, the two most populous nations have multiple areas of disputed border manned by tens of thousands of troops, and India has made no secret of its concerns. The river is a tributary of the mighty Brahmaputra, and Indian officials fear China could use its dam as a control tap — to create deadly droughts or release a “water bomb” downstream. China rejects that, saying that the “hype surrounding the Yaxia Hydropower Project as a ‘water bomb’ is groundless and malicious”. But Arunachal Pradesh state Chief Minister Pema Khandu said protective action against China’s dam is a “national security necessity”, and sees India’s dam as a safety valve to control the water. “China’s aggressive water resource development policy leaves little room for downstream riparian nations to ignore it,” said Maharaj K. Pandit, a Himalayan ecology specialist at the National University of Singapore. India’s dam could generate up to 11,600 MW, becoming its most powerful and cutting reliance on coal.

      "summary_en": "RIEW: On a football field ringed by misty mountains, the air rang with fiery speeches as tribesmen protested a planned mega-dam, India’s latest move in its contest with China over Himalayan water. India says the proposed new structure could counteract rival China’s building of a likely record-breaking dam upstream in Tibet by stockpiling water and guarding against releases of weaponised torrents. But for those at one of the possible sites for what would be India’s largest dam, the project feels like a death sentence. “We will fight till the end of time,” said Tapir Jamoh, a resident of the thatch-hut village of Riew, raising a bow loaded with a poison-tipped arrow in a gesture of defiance against authorities. “We will not let a dam be built.” Jamoh’s homelands of the Adi people are in the far-flung northeastern corner of India, divided from Tibet and Myanmar by soaring snowy peaks. Beijing, which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, says its project will have no ‘negative impact’ downstream Proposed blueprints show India considering the site in Arunachal Pradesh for a massive storage reservoir, equal to four million Olympic-size swimming pools, behind a 280-metre (918-foot) high dam. The project comes as China presses ahead with the $167 billion Yaxia project upstream of Riew on the river known in India as the Siang, and in Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo. China’s plan includes five hydropower stations, that could produce three times more electricity than its vast Three Gorges dam — the world’s largest power station —though other details remain scant. Beijing — which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, rejected by India — says it will have no “negative impact” downstream. “China has never had, and will never have, any intention to use cross-border hydropower projects on rivers to harm the interests of downstream countries or coerce them,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said. Chinese reports hint at a tunnel-diversion project, while India eyes Riew for its mega-dam. Locals like 69-year-old Jamoh say damming the Siang would erase their culture and identity. Despite a thaw between New Delhi and Beijing, the two most populous nations have multiple areas of disputed border manned by tens of thousands of troops, and India has made no secret of its concerns. The river is a tributary of the mighty Brahmaputra, and Indian officials fear China could use its dam as a control tap — to create deadly droughts or release a “water bomb” downstream. China rejects that, saying that the “hype surrounding the Yaxia Hydropower Project as a ‘water bomb’ is groundless and malicious”. But Arunachal Pradesh state Chief Minister Pema Khandu said protective action against China’s dam is a “national security necessity”, and sees India’s dam as a safety valve to control the water. “China’s aggressive water resource development policy leaves little room for downstream riparian nations to ignore it,” said Maharaj K. Pandit, a Himalayan ecology specialist at the National University of Singapore. India’s dam could generate up to 11,600 MW, becoming its most powerful and cutting reliance on coal.

      "summary_orig": "• ‘This is not our document’, says Dar about White House plan; sticks to joint statement from Muslim bloc • Reveals Indonesia has committed 20,000 troops; Islamabad expected to make a decision soon • Axios claims Netanyahu negotiated changes to draft agreed between Trump, Muslim leaders • US president gives Hamas ‘three to four days’ to agree to deal; insiders say group will ‘likely reject’ proposal ISLAMABAD / WASHI­N­GTON: A day after US President Donald Trump unveiled his ambitious plan to end the war in Ga­za, signs have began to emerge that not everyone is happy with the draft made public by White House. This was evident from Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s presser on Tuesday, where he made it clear in so many words that the US peace plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included. The “document has been issued by the US”, he said, seemingly distancing Pakistani decision-makers from the plan, even though Trump has previously claimed that both PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir are behind it ‘100pc’. “This is not our document, which we sent to them. There are some key areas that we want covered… If they are not covered, they will be covered,” he said. Consider Trump’s anno­u­ncement of the 20-point plan as “an announcement from their side”, he said. Mr Dar, who is also the deputy prime minister, added that Pakistan owned the joint statement given on behalf of eight Muslim countries. “If there is a difference, we will go by this,” he said. In response to a question, the foreign minister said the plan put forward by Trump envisions an independent technocrat government of Pales­tinians, to be overseen by an international body — mostly comprised of Palestinians. He was also guarded about the possibility of sending troops to become part of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF). “On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies… there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan’s leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said. Mr Dar maintained that this would be a special force for Gaza alone, and the arrangement for its deployment would be documented at the UN Security Council. Road to deal During the presser, Mr Dar expounded on the diplomatic process that led to the finalisation of the pea­ce plan, saying that one of the main purposes of attending the UN General Assembly was to work with some “like-minded countries” on trying to end the misery in Gaza as a “member of the Muslim ummah”. Eight countries, including Pakistan, agreed to take up this matter very proactively with President Trump during the US visit, he said. Dar said a preparatory meeting was held before the Muslim leaders’ huddle with Trump. The meeting with Trump was meant to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid to the strip without any hurdles, stop the forced displacement of Pales­tinians and make arrangements for the return of those displaced from the Gaza, plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and stop Israel’s attempts to annex the West Bank, he said. “These objectives were conveyed to him (Trump), and he was asked to work with us on achieving them,” Dar said, adding that the US president then proposed that his team would devise a “workable solution” with the foreign ministers of the eight Muslim countries that participated in the meeting. He said it was decided that the details of meetings held in this regard would be “secret” and “classified”. After sharing further details of how the proposal for ending the Isr­aeli onslaught in Gaza was finalised, Dar said he had received messages from the Saudi foreign minister. “He told me that five countries had reached a consensus on joint statem­ent [regarding the Gaza plan] and that our agreement was needed on this matter as well, and that they had also reached out to Indonesia and the UAE. “I then consulted the foreign secretary and proposed some changes. I spoke to the Saudi foreign minister again … as I had some objections … He then send me a revised version … and the joint statement was released.” When asked to assure that “you still believe in the two-state solution”, he said there was no change in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine. “And I rather would say the seven other countries are also with us on this.” The repeated reference to the Mus­lim bloc’s joint statement is being seen as a ‘mild protestation’ over cha­nges to the terms of the deal, which were ostensibly carried out at Israeli PM Benjamin Netan­yahu’s request. Changes to the draft According to US news outlet Axios , the deal now before Hamas is significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention. The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process. Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”. Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported. According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios. Quoting a senior Arab official involved in the negotiations, the Axios report said that while Netanyahu had managed to change the text, it still has a lot of very positive elements for the Palestinians. Deadline for Hamas After Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas on Monday, President Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal, or meet “a very sad end”. Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said Israeli and Arab leaders had already endorsed the plan and that “were just waiting for Hamas” to make its decision. “Hamas is either going to be doing it or not, and if it’s not, it’s going to be a very sad end,” Trump said as he left the White House. Asked whether there was scope for further talks on the proposal, he replied: “Not much.” A source close to Hamas told Reu­t­ers the plan was “completely biased to Israel” and imposed “impossible conditions” that aimed to eliminate the group. Qatar’s foreign ministry has said Hamas is studying the White House proposal “responsibly”. However, a senior Hamas figure told the BBC that the group is likely to reject Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, saying it “serves Israel’s interests” and “ignores those of the Palestinian people”. The source said the group is unlikely to agree to disarming and handing over their weapons. Published in Dawn, October 1st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Tuesday accused PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan of creating a divide within the party and alleged that she was being facilitated by the Military Intelligence (MI) and “establishment”. In a video statement, Gandapur said: “Imran Khan is my leader, I am loyal to him. It is my right to convey the truth to him … I made him aware of all that has been happening [during my meeting with him yesterday].” He said that initially he was not being given the permission to meet Imran in jail and his messages were conveyed to the public only through his sisters. “So there is a big divide in the party now,” he continued. Gandapur said his provincial government had presented KP’s budget as otherwise the PTI government would have been “disqualified”. And since there were no instructions from Imran to the effect of not presenting the budget, it was presented, he added. “But after that, campaigns that were launched declaring me and parliament traitors were highly inappropriate. And we repeatedly asked [Imran’s] sisters to bring some clarity on it but to no avail. So an impression was created that we were going against you (Imran). But it was not the case. “And when the time came to pass the budget, the situation was same. They were not allowing us to meet (Imran). Mirza Saif was eventually able to meet him after great difficulty in which Khan sahib was informed of the situation …  We eventually passed the budget after making it clear to Khan sahib that he could make any changes he wanted.” Gandapur also claimed that he had told Imran that he had the authority to stop them from passing the budget and they would comply. “But my MPAs and party members were accused that we committed treachery passing this budget … They are running these campaigns.” He said he had also been accused of applying the “minus Imran Khan” formula. “But I [told Imran] that nobody could think or have the courage to do so.” The KP CM added that he had conveyed to the party founder that “Aleema Khan had a big role in dividing the party. Because some party members are being discredited. And the party is losing hope. That steps were not being taken for your release. Instead there is groupism in party which some people are using to serve their own interests”. He further alleged that Aleema was in contact with “vloggers” working to create divide in the party. “And instead of stopping them … she is provoking them. And Hafeezullah Niazi sahib refers to Aleema Khan as the prime minister in his articles. He writes that she should become the party chairperson,” he alleged. He alleged that campaigns were being carried out to declare Aleema the chairperson of the party. Gandapur said he told Imran that the party was being harmed by these campaigns and agendas. “If you (Imran) want to elect a chairperson then go ahead … whoever you nominate will be acceptable but do it,” he said, referring to his conversation with Imran. Gandapur said that petty issues were being created within the party and no work was being done on getting Imran out of jail. He alleged that instead of standing united, “our trajectory is such that complies with the objectives of the institutions and establishment, and Aleema is playing a direct role in this”. “I clearly told him that institutions are working to weaken us … I told him that the MI was facilitating Aleema Khan in this process, according to my knowledge … It is supporting Aleema Khan in weakening us.” Gandapur’s statement came after Aleema spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, where Imran is incarcerated, earlier in the day. During the interaction , Aleema was asked about Gandapur’s meeting with Imran. To that, she said the KP CM had alleged during the meeting that she was working with the MI, was behind “all” the attacks directed towards Gandapur on social media and that she wanted to become the PTI chairperson. According to Aleema Imran shared with us. “He was laughing while telling us.” “Remember that Imran Khan is PTI’s chairman. Only he is the chairman and no one else,” she asserted. “We will do everything for Imran Khan, we will tolerate everything for him. But we will not leave him [alone] no matter what they do.” She maintained that Imran conveyed his messages to the outside world through his family only when a party member was not available. “He also specifies what has to be told publicly and what privately.”",

Gandapur said his provincial government had presented KP’s budget as otherwise the PTI government would have been “disqualified”. And since there were no instructions from Imran to the effect of not presenting the budget, it was presented, he added. “But after that, campaigns that were launched declaring me and parliament traitors were highly inappropriate. And we repeatedly asked [Imran’s] sisters to bring some clarity on it but to no avail. So an impression was created that we were going against you (Imran). But it was not the case. “And when the time came to pass the budget, the situation was same. They were not allowing us to meet (Imran). Mirza Saif was eventually able to meet him after great difficulty in which Khan sahib was informed of the situation …  We eventually passed the budget after making it clear to Khan sahib that he could make any changes he wanted.” Gandapur also claimed that he had told Imran that he had the authority to stop them from passing the budget and they would comply. “But my MPAs and party members were accused that we committed treachery passing this budget … They are running these campaigns.” He said he had also been accused of applying the “minus Imran Khan” formula. “But I [told Imran] that nobody could think or have the courage to do so.” The KP CM added that he had conveyed to the party founder that “Aleema Khan had a big role in dividing the party. Because some party members are being discredited. And the party is losing hope. That steps were not being taken for your release. Instead there is groupism in party which some people are using to serve their own interests”. He further alleged that Aleema was in contact with “vloggers” working to create divide in the party. “And instead of stopping them … she is provoking them. And Hafeezullah Niazi sahib refers to Aleema Khan as the prime minister in his articles. He writes that she should become the party chairperson,” he alleged. He alleged that campaigns were being carried out to declare Aleema the chairperson of the party. Gandapur said he told Imran that the party was being harmed by these campaigns and agendas. “If you (Imran) want to elect a chairperson then go ahead … whoever you nominate will be acceptable but do it,” he said, referring to his conversation with Imran. Gandapur said that petty issues were being created within the party and no work was being done on getting Imran out of jail. He alleged that instead of standing united, “our trajectory is such that complies with the objectives of the institutions and establishment, and Aleema is playing a direct role in this”. “I clearly told him that institutions are working to weaken us … I told him that the MI was facilitating Aleema Khan in this process, according to my knowledge … It is supporting Aleema Khan in weakening us.” Gandapur’s statement came after Aleema spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, where Imran is incarcerated, earlier in the day. During the interaction , Aleema was asked about Gandapur’s meeting with Imran. To that, she said the KP CM had alleged during the meeting that she was working with the MI, was behind “all” the attacks directed towards Gandapur on social media and that she wanted to become the PTI chairperson. According to Aleema Imran shared with us. “He was laughing while telling us.” “Remember that Imran Khan is PTI’s chairman. Only he is the chairman and no one else,” she asserted. “We will do everything for Imran Khan, we will tolerate everything for him. But we will not leave him [alone] no matter what they do.” She maintained that Imran conveyed his messages to the outside world through his family only when a party member was not available. “He also specifies what has to be told publicly and what privately.”",
