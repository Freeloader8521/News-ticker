      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Monday criticised newly elected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, accusing the provincial government of undermining counter-terrorism efforts for political point scoring. The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations , which tribal people also resist as they often lead to displacements. The remarks come a day after the KP CM blamed the federal government’s “flawed policy” for the resurgence of terrorism in KP, during his first official high-level meeting since assuming office on October 15, after the former CM Ali Amin Gandapur resigned earlier this month on the directions of party chairman Imran Khan. He alleged that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”. He also criticised the Centre for providing KP Police “defective and old” armoured vehicles and asked that the vehicles be recalled. Addressing the media today, the state minister took exception to the KP CM’s earlier remarks and stated, “the operation you are rejecting may serve you well politically, but it will also lead to loss of lives, for which you alone will be held responsible.” Talal expressed disappointment that the “fight against terrorism and sacrifices made by soldiers were being overshadowed by politics”. “You don’t want to fight against terrorists, you are scared, you have political motives,” said Talal, alleging that the PTI-led provincial government was choosing not to fight the war against terrorism, “so they could use it to blackmail the government.” Citing Article 148 of the Constitution, the minister warned that “provinces can not unilaterally make any decision which affects the rest of the country”. “The fight against terrorism is the entire country’s fight,” maintained the state minister for interior. On the matter of the CM’s recent appointment, Talal said that it was a deliberate decision to elect someone “who would not hesitate to prioritise political point scoring and his chairman’s narrative over matters of national interests and his responsibilities as the chief minister”. Responding to KP CM’s comments about “defective bulletproof vehicles”, the minister maintained that “it was unfortunate that CM Afridi was returning necessary equipment to make the Centre look weak for political point scoring”. “If you did not like the bulletproof cars, then maybe give your own instead,” he said, stressing that the KP govt was “not fighting a war but only wasting time and creating unnecessary drama.” A day earlier, the minister had called the move “immature” and a setback in the fight against terrorism, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported. “What’s unfortunate is that the police officers in KP are fighting terrorists without any equipment,” he said, adding that the provincial govt was “refusing to stand with them.” He also claimed that there was a “different agenda” at play, stating that “changing the chief minister was never about benefiting the people”. Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan. Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.",

India had closed its embassy in Kabul after the Taliban seized power following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces in 2021, but opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support, and humanitarian aid. About a dozen countries, including China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkiye have embassies operating in Kabul, although Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration. “In keeping with the decision announced during the recent visit of the Afghan FM to India, the government is restoring the status of the technical mission of India in Kabul to that of embassy of India in Afghanistan with immediate effect,” said a press release issued today by India’s Ministry of External Affairs. It added the decision underscored India’s resolve to deepen its bilateral engagement with the Afghan side in all spheres of mutual interest. The MEA elaborated that the embassy will “further augment India’s contribution to Afghanistan’s comprehensive development, humanitarian assistance and capacity-building initiatives, in keeping with the priorities and aspirations of Afghan society”. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar had announced the embassy’s reopening earlier this month as he began talks with Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi on what was the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since 2021.

      "summary_orig": "The deadlock over the Asia Cup trophy — which India refused to collect at the closing ceremony last month amid Pakistan-India hostilities — continued on Tuesday as the Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) contacted Asian Cricket Council (ACC) head Mohsin Naqvi to hand over the trophy, Indian media reported citing sources. Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told reporters in Karachi on Tuesday that the ACC has informed the BCCI that a formal ceremony will be held in Dubai on December 10 to present India with the trophy. Dawn.com understands that Naqvi, as ACC chief, is keen on handing over the trophy himself following the farcical scenes that followed after last month’s final between Pakistan and India. Defending champions India edged Pakistan by five-wickets in a last-over thriller to win the Asia Cup title at the Dubai International Stadium last month. However, the closing ceremony descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi. There were no customary handshakes before the match between the teams after India refused. Pakistan captain Sal­m­an Agha said India had “ disrespected cricket ”, whe­­­r­­eas his counterpart Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup, which has been overshadowed by ill-will on both sides. A couple days after the incident, Naqvi posted on X saying: “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me. The Press Trust of India reported today that the cricket boards of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka backed BCCI’s correspondence to Naqvi. “A top ACC source told PTI that Naqvi has insisted that a BCCI representative collect the trophy from him at the body’s headquarters in Dubai but the Indian board has rejected that stance,” PTI said. “The BCCI will bring this matter up in an ICC meeting next month.” According to the ACC source: “The BCCI secretary, BCCI’s ACC representative Rajeev Shukla and representatives of other member boards including Sri Lanka Cricket and Afghanistan had written to the ACC president last week over handing the trophy to India.” The eight-nation Asia Cup remained under spotlight due to political strains between India and Pakistan, the nuclear-armed neighbours, who were competing in an international cricket event four months after a brief but intense military conflict in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgaam attack that killed 26 local tourists in the Indian-occupied Kashmir. The tension between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over into the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Asia Cup staged in the UAE when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts when the arch-rivals met in their group stage match in Dubai. Suryakumar was widely criticised for politicising the Asia Cup when he mentioned Pahalgaam incident and Indian armed forces during his post-ma­tch talk and subsequent news conference. The Pakistan camp, on their part, had avoided media interaction on the occasion of the India match. The tense situation remained the same, rather aggravated as on-field verbal skirmishes between some players took place, when the two sides met in the Super Four stage of the event.",

      "summary_orig": "Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Tuesday reiterated that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity would be met with a ’firm and decisive response The army chief’s affirmation came in the wake of a border conflict with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan as long-simmering tensions over cross-border terrorism boiled over into outright fighting , along with charged statements from India’s civil-military leadership. The military’s top brass had warned India earlier this month that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”. A press release issued from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief interacted with participants of the 17th National Workshop Balochistan at the General Headquarters. “The COAS reiterated that while Pakistan seeks regional peace and stability, any violation of its territorial integrity, direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response to safeguard the lives and well-being of its citizens,” the ISPR said. The military’s media wing added that the army chief underscored that “Indian sponsored proxies” Fitna al-Hindustan and Fitna al-Khawarij propagated “anti-people and anti-development agendas with malicious intent to perpetrate violence”. He reaffirmed that all necessary actions were being taken to pursue them and rid Balochistan of their menace. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. “The COAS, during his interaction with the participants, remarked that Balochistan is the pride of Pakistan, endowed with highly vibrant, resilient and patriotic people who are its true wealth. He also highlighted the federal and provincial governments’ development initiatives, being undertaken to uplift the socio-economic landscape of Balochistan through a people-centric approach. He emphasised upon realisation of the immense economic potential of the province for the benefit of the people of Balochistan.” “Acknowledging the constructive role of civil society, particularly in engaging and empowering the youth, the COAS underscored their pivotal role in sustainable development, negating vested political agendas in the interest of long-term prosperity in Balochistan,” the ISPR added. On Saturday, the army chief had cautioned India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country. He had also urged the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence and called on the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”. “Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he had asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “ Operation Bunyanum Marsoos ”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.",

In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. “The COAS, during his interaction with the participants, remarked that Balochistan is the pride of Pakistan, endowed with highly vibrant, resilient and patriotic people who are its true wealth. He also highlighted the federal and provincial governments’ development initiatives, being undertaken to uplift the socio-economic landscape of Balochistan through a people-centric approach. He emphasised upon realisation of the immense economic potential of the province for the benefit of the people of Balochistan.” “Acknowledging the constructive role of civil society, particularly in engaging and empowering the youth, the COAS underscored their pivotal role in sustainable development, negating vested political agendas in the interest of long-term prosperity in Balochistan,” the ISPR added. On Saturday, the army chief had cautioned India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country. He had also urged the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence and called on the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”. “Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he had asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “ Operation Bunyanum Marsoos ”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.",

      "summary": "Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Tuesday reiterated that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity would be met with a ’firm and decisive response The army chief’s affirmation came in the wake of a border conflict with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan as long-simmering tensions over cross-border terrorism boiled over into outright fighting , along with charged statements from India’s civil-military leadership. The military’s top brass had warned India earlier this month that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”. A press release issued from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief interacted with participants of the 17th National Workshop Balochistan at the General Headquarters. “The COAS reiterated that while Pakistan seeks regional peace and stability, any violation of its territorial integrity, direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response to safeguard the lives and well-being of its citizens,” the ISPR said. The military’s media wing added that the army chief underscored that “Indian sponsored proxies” Fitna al-Hindustan and Fitna al-Khawarij propagated “anti-people and anti-development agendas with malicious intent to perpetrate violence”. He reaffirmed that all necessary actions were being taken to pursue them and rid Balochistan of their menace. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari claimed on Tuesday that three civilians were killed during the operation in Muridke that dispersed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protesters. The TLP, which began a protest march in Lahore earlier this month, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. The march and sit-in, which reached Muridke , quickly turned into violent clashes between protesters and police before the protesters were dispersed, leading to a crackdown on the party and its supporters. Addressing a press conference in Lahore today, the Punjab information minister said “false stories” were being perpetuated about the operation in Muridke. “Three civilians were martyred in Muridke. These were people who were passing by or standing off to the side,” she said, adding that 48 civilians and 110 police officers were also injured. Eighteen out of 110 have sustained firearm injuries, she said. The minister also said that police vans had been stolen and eight were set on fire. Referring to “exclusive” footage of the clashes that was aired at the press conference, she said, “They brought trolleys full of bricks … and the sad thing is, they did all of this in the name of religion, Palestine, and Gaza.” She also displayed footage of valuable items recovered from the residence of the party’s leader, saying, “1.920 kilograms of gold; 898g of silver; 69 branded watches, 28 gold bracelets … in the name of charity, they bring it back home,” she said. She urged children “who love their faith” not to be taken in by groups that use it for political or financial gain, and requested parents to not send their children to be involved in such activities. “Don’t be used in the political agendas of others,” she said. “Stories on social media are scripted.” “We are not moving or transferring anyone’s grave or shrine,” she said, adding, “But to use that grave to collect charity, to gather people and provoke violence — the Punjab government won’t allow that.” Bokhari said that all the accounts of those who financed terrorist groups were frozen and that those who financed them, or supported them on social media, would be prosecuted and charged with terrorism. “No mosque is being demolished; what Muslim can even think of that?” she said, adding that the mosques and seminaries would be turned over to “righteous religious groups”. The provincial information minister stressed that the government was “not against any sect”, but rather against “that mindset that makes people resort to violence”. She further said that the government had now taken over 330 mosques that were under the TLP. “We are not against any group, but this is for the country,” she said. “The loudspeakers will be used only for azaan and the mosques only for prayers.” She also said that 223 seminaries of the TLP had been geotagged and details of them obtained, adding that they would soon be reopened and that most had already reopened. “Six madressahs were built on government property, that had no records,” the minister pointed out, “and no one had the right to question it, because then a fatwa-i-qatal would have been announced.” She said that those who had taken the law into their own hands and were responsible for the injuries and deaths of civilians and police would be prosecuted under anti-terror laws. “Both the brothers are being traced; they have not been shot or arrested,” she said, referring to Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas. “They have fled, and we will arrest them soon.” Bokhari also said that the decision to ban the TLP is expected in the next few days. The minister added that the time was “now or never” for Pakistan to decide if it wanted to be a democratic and progressive Islamic country. “The government has decided, now it is on the people.” Authorities in Punjab claimed yesterday to have traced the whereabouts of Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas, saying the absconding leaders fled to Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) after the crackdown in Muridke.",

      "summary_orig": "Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on Tuesday remarked that the Supreme Court’s regular and constitutional benches (CBs) were “branches of one tree” as an eight-member CB heard arguments on petitions challenging the 26th Amendment . The Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate , with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment . According to the cause list for today, the CB has taken up 37 petitions pertaining to the 26th Amendment. The hearing The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. Retired Justice Syed Shabbar Raza Rizvi, a former Lahore High Court judge, concluded his arguments today. Dr Adnan Khan, counsel for Mohammad Anas, also presented his contentions. The hearing was adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow. Retired Justice Syed Shabbar Raza Rizvi speaks at the rostrum, as an eight-member SC Constitutional Bench hears challenges against the 26th Amendment on Oct 21, 2025. — screengrab from SC’s YouTube channel As Rizvi continued his arguments, Justice Mandokhail said, “Even if we accept your stance that the Supreme Court and the bench are separate, then this shows that the bench’s suo motu power is maintained but has been taken away from the Supreme Court.” However, Rizvi replied that while the CB had been given some powers under the 26th Amendment, none were taken away from the apex court. Referring to the provision that was introduced through the 26th Amendment, Justice Hilali observed, “The amendment has been made in the Constitution. Article 191A has come into existence and constitutional benches have been made under it. “Now you are saying there should be a full bench. So will we need to go into the pre-Amendment era […] and suspend the 26th Amendment for it?” she asked, adding that how Article 191A can be “bypassed”. Rizvi responded that Article 191A should be read in conjunction with other provisions, not on its own. He argued that Article 191A had not “ended the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction under Article 184(3) ” (original jurisdiction). At this, Justice Mazhar observed that the powers under Article 184(3) had been transferred to the CB under Article 191A, adding that the latter provision “clearly mentioned” the same. Rizvi then proceeded to cite several past judgments to support his arguments, adding that Article 191A should be read with Article 176, which provides the constitution of the SC. The retired judge noted that despite having special powers, the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) was a part of SC and could also use powers vested in the apex court under Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution. He termed Article 187 a “helpful provision to enact complete justice ”. “The Constitutional Bench can also use powers provided under Article 187. The Constitutional Bench was also made within the Supreme Court, right?” Justice Mazhar said. Justice Aminuddin remarked that the question at hand was not about the CB’s powers, but rather how to “make judges of non-constitutional benches” part of the CB. Rizvi, echoing Sheikh’s arguments from yesterday, contended that the CB judges had two roles: “You are the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Bench as well.” At this,  Justice Mazhar remarked, “Regular bench and Constitutional Bench, both are two branches of one tree. […] Nobody is saying it (CB) is not the Supreme Court, or above or below it.” Justice Mandokhail wondered whether Rizvi meant that benches could not hear the case, but a full court had the powers to do so. Justice Mazhar pointed out that even in India, whose example Rizvi cited, cases before constitutional benches were not referred to regular ones. He further noted that while the neighbouring country still had the concept of the chief justice being the “Master of the Roster” , Pakistan no longer had the same as committees had been formed to fix cases for hearing. At one point, Rizvi suggested that the CB be considered a constitutional court . “This was being established as a constitutional court, but it became a constitutional bench,” he said, referring to the proposals mulled as part of the 26th Amendment last year. “The advice you are giving is good,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. “The confusion is that instead of ‘court’, the term ‘bench’ was used,” Rizvi said. Recalling Rizvi’s and Sheikh’s requests for a full court comprising all 24 judges, Justice Mazhar observed, “Now we have to decide whether this Constitutional Bench has the power to form a full court of 24 judges or not.” In response, the retired judge suggested that the CB was, after all, a bench of the apex court and could refer the matter to the CJP just as any regular bench could. Here, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “Are you saying that we should give power to those judges who do not have it under the law?” Addressing Rizvi,  Justice Mazhar said, “Tell us a way to circumvent Article 191A.” Rizvi then suggested that the CB could refer the matter ahead, at which Justice Mazhar asked to whom. The petitioner replied that the CB would know this better, but the judge pointed out that the issue with forwarding the matter to the CJP was that he was not a part of the CB. At one point, Justice Hilali corrected Rizvi, clarifying that “no one said we cannot do anything” about the 26th Amendment. Upon Justice Mandokhail urging Rizvi to conclude his arguments soon, the latter said, “The Amendment that is in place does not have the sanctity [it should].” After the retired judge completed his arguments, Adnan came to the rostrum and highlighted previous contentions about a bench and a full court being separate entities. Lawyer Dr Adnan Khan speaks at the rostrum, as an eight-member SC Constitutional Bench hears challenges against the 26th Amendment on Oct 21, 2025. — screengrab from SC’s YouTube channel “A bench is constituted, whereas the full court is not. A bench is a part of the full court, while the full court is a permanent body,” the lawyer said. The hearing witnessed some back and forth when Adnan contended that before the 2023 Practice and Procedure Act , the CJP could constitute benches, but there was no specific provision for forming full courts; rather, it was a convention. Justice Mandokhail asked whether Adnan meant that a full court already existed and matters were to be simply referred there, whereas in the case of benches, benches were first constituted and then cases were fixed. The lawyer replied in the affirmative. Justice Hilali wondered how the CB could “bypass” Article 191A to include all judges. Adnan replied that Article 191A only barred other benches from hearing constitutional cases but not the full court. Justice Aminuddin observed that the bench had “absolutely no objection or reservation if the full court has the jurisdiction” to hear the case. Adnan contended that both the CB and a full court could hear the 26th Amendment case, but precedence and the concept of “collective wisdom” favoured that the full court hear the case. “Has this Amendment not blocked the path of convention?” Justice Hilali wondered. She asked the lawyer if he could suggest a “safe path through which the Constitutional Amendment could be bypassed and it would not be illegal either”. At one point, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “Let’s also talk about this today. This matter is raised again and again. Tell us how many members there are in the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and who they are.” Adnan responded that the law minister was among the “many” members of the JCP, adding that the topic pertained to the arguments of the main case, and so it was inappropriate to discuss at this point. “Look at our patience; we are continuously hearing lies while sitting here. Tell us what their dominant role is in the constitution of benches,” Justice Aminuddin quipped. The counsel stated that he had no objection to any of the judges in the current CB, adding that “we have no role in the formation of constitutional benches”. “Let the collective wisdom of the Supreme Court prevail over the collective wisdom of the parliament,” Adnan said, concluding his arguments. The petitions Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan , Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s counsel Munir A. Malik , and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners. The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request . The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself. The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",

The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",

      "summary_orig": "Three lesser-known opposition parties on Tuesday withdrew an application filed with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking to be registered as an alliance under the name of Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), while also distancing themselves from the request itself. The matter gained traction as the proposed name is already the name of an opposition alliance led by Mehmood Khan Achakzai. The applicants, who also sought the allocation of a joint election symbol, included Pakistan Aman Tehreek Chairman Ali Sher Yousafzai, Pakistan Falahi Tehreek Chairman Fazal Aman Khan, and Pakistan Welfare Party Chairman Muhammad Farooq. The TTAP — which saw the move as an attempt to take away its title and sabotage its resistance movement — had formed a legal team to defend its position before the ECP, with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar appearing before the commission today. The matter was heard by a three-member ECP bench headed by the member from Balochistan, Shah Mohammad Jatoi. During the hearing, the Pakistan Falahi Tehreek chairman told the ECP that the parties had not applied for the registration of the alliance. “We were informed that we had filed an application through a notice issued by the election commission,” he said. At this, the ECP member from Punjab, Babar Hassan Bharwana, remarked, “We did not issue a notice ourselves; someone must have applied.” He also called for a forensic analysis of the application, saying, “You should consult your legal adviser and apologise if you have applied by mistake.” The ECP told the three parties to withdraw the application, warning that action would be taken against them otherwise. For his part, Khokhar filed a request seeking the provision of records. Khokhar said that an opposition alliance had been formed under Achakzai’s leadership called the TTAP. He urged the ECP to not entertain the plea. The ECP then sought detailed statements from the three applicants and said it would issue and appropriate order. Later, the applicants submitted handwritten requests seeking the withdrawal of their application. Veteran politician Achakzai, who also heads his own Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), was made chairman of the TTAP, weeks after the February 8 general elections . The PTI, PkMAP and Balochistan National Party-Mengal are among the major parties of the alliance. The alliance alleges that the mandate of PTI was stolen and it does not acknowledge the present government as a genuine representative of the voters. The opposition alliance recently put on hold its countrywide public meetings and protests, mainly, in the wake of floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. ‘Space for opposition getting narrower’ Speaking to the media outside the ECP, Khokhar termed the application a “childish thought”. “Space for the opposition in this country is growing narrower and narrower,” Khokhar said, decrying the move to steal the TTAP’s name. Speaking about the opposition alliance, he said, “This has been underway for a long time … the largest opposition party, PTI is a part of it; the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen is also a part of it; Balochistan National Party’s Akhtar Mengal is also a part of it; other parties and civil society individuals are also a part of it.” He also went on to say that such requests should not be entertained. “If we want to run this country in a better way, in an acceptable way where the rule of law governs, then we should refrain from these kind of requests,” he said. “The three parties that came today — we didn’t even know who they were — they submitted their withdrawal application. But for the future … we are also clever, and we will not back off in the face of such efforts. We will continue to defend and promote our right to political opposition,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "An Islamabad district and sessions and court on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur on a 2016 liquor and weapons recovery case over his continued absence from the proceedings. Senior Civil Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti presided over the proceedings and directed that Gandapur — who did not show up today — be arrested and presented before the court. The hearing was adjourned till October 28. The case dates back to October 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located. The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on November 2. Gandapur had rejected police claims, saying that two of the five assault rifles found on him were licensed while the others were official weapons provided to his security guards. He had also claimed that the teargas launcher and bottles of liquor were not his and that he had been carrying honey in the liquor bottle. Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the capital’s Bhara Kahu police station. Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024 , September 4, 2024 , July 19, 2025 and Sept 10, 2025 .",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Newly-elected Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mohammad Sohail Afridi on Monday said he believed in the supremacy of the law and would confront the Centre’s every unlawful and unconstitutional step. “A narrative is being built that I will go for confrontation with the federal government. Yes, I will, if anything is done by it against the Constitution. I will continue to speak for the supremacy of the Constitution,” he told a provincial assembly session chaired by Speaker Babar Saleem Swati here. The chief minister said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even petitioned the Islamabad High Court for ensuring his meeting with detained founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan but to no avail. He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it. Informs assembly that there won’t be any political arrests under MPO in province Mr Afridi said that after exhausting all legal options for the purpose, he would place his case before the people to devise the future course of action. He said that the law and order situation was worsening as the decisions were taken behind closed doors. “Our [PTI’s] stand is that policies for KP should be made by the province’s government and its residents only,” he said, vowing to resist any decisions taken behind closed doors. The chief minister said his government welcomed peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban in Doha but had reservations about it as elders and public representatives from KP should be part of the dialogue as advocated by the PTI founder. He announced that no political worker would be arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order in the province, while the police won’t register FIR against any student leader. Mr Afridi also announced the establishment of police stations for women across the province. He said that the meeting called by the prime minister was about Afghan refugees and food security and not the law and order situation, so he sent the chief secretary as the province’s representative besides Muzammil Asalam who was aware of the situation in KP. “Our stand on Afghan refugees is clear. Those, who have lived here for over 40 years, should be sent back in a dignified way. Those stationed on the border should not create issues about the repatriation of Afghan refugees,” he said. The chief minister said that the police and the counter-terrorism department were leading the fight against terrorists from the front. “The vehicles gifted by the federal government to our police force have become outdated, so we have decided to return them,” he said. Earlier, Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Dr Ibadullah said working for peace in the province was the top priority of every MPA. He urged the chair to call a meeting of the house’s peace committee. Dr Ibadullah said that the opposition would never allow any action that went against the interest of the province. “The opposition will stand with the government in case of any positive step taken in the interest of the province,” he said. The opposition leader vowed to highlight the government’s weak performances. He insisted that the opposition never opposed Mr Afridi’s meeting with Mr Imran. Mr Swati observed that the first meeting of the house’s peace committee would be held soon after the finalisation of its terms of references, with all relevant government officers being asked to show up. Treasury lawmaker Adnan Qadri said Mr Afridi’s victory in the chief minister’s election was the victory of the people and the defeat of all “other powers.” He said people from tribal districts thanked the PTI founder for nominating Mr Afridi from among them as the province’s chief executive. ”Those who held news conferences against the new chief minister disheartened the tribesmen,” he said. Mr Qadri also condemned the alleged killing of TLP workers during street protests in Punjab and demanded their names be made public. MPA Dr Amjad Ali said if the Pakistan Army could take over 34 posts on Pak-Afghan border, why they didn’t eliminate 500 terrorists from Bajaur district in the last three months. He said Pakistan wanted talks with India after border clashes but never held negotiations with Pakhtuns. The MPA said he, as the minister for mines and minerals, was denied access to mines in merged tribal districts by security forces citing the delicate law and order situation as the reason. “The Katlang area where a drone strike was carried out, has vast pink topaz reserves. Pink topaz is found in Brazil or Katlang only,” he said. Mohammad Nisar of the opposition ANP said for the first time, he felt the house was serious about discussing the issues of merged tribal districts. He said terrorists were identified in some villages but even then, 13 civilians, including women, children and elderly, were martyred with no body of the terrorists found. “We are not aliens. We want an end to the buffer zone. We want developmental funds to be spent in our merged areas,” he said. The lawmaker said efforts were under way for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, to get control of KP’s mines and minerals and declare the merged districts federal territory,” he said. The speaker congratulated Hindu community’s members on diwali, the festival of lights. The house also passed a resolution by a majority vote, urging the provincial government to inform the United Nations that the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa do not accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the nation’s representatives nor does they recognise Israel. The resolution was tabled by Abdul Salam Afridi, whose another resolution seeking medical facilities for Imran and his wife in jail, was also adopted. The chair later adjourned the sitting until 2 pm today (Tuesday). Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2025",

The chief minister said that he wrote letters to the chief justice of Pakistan and federal and provincial governments and even petitioned the Islamabad High Court for ensuring his meeting with detained founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan but to no avail. He said he would challenge the federal government over the continued denial of his meeting with Imran and would boycott meetings called by it. Informs assembly that there won’t be any political arrests under MPO in province Mr Afridi said that after exhausting all legal options for the purpose, he would place his case before the people to devise the future course of action. He said that the law and order situation was worsening as the decisions were taken behind closed doors. “Our [PTI’s] stand is that policies for KP should be made by the province’s government and its residents only,” he said, vowing to resist any decisions taken behind closed doors. The chief minister said his government welcomed peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban in Doha but had reservations about it as elders and public representatives from KP should be part of the dialogue as advocated by the PTI founder. He announced that no political worker would be arrested under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order in the province, while the police won’t register FIR against any student leader. Mr Afridi also announced the establishment of police stations for women across the province. He said that the meeting called by the prime minister was about Afghan refugees and food security and not the law and order situation, so he sent the chief secretary as the province’s representative besides Muzammil Asalam who was aware of the situation in KP. “Our stand on Afghan refugees is clear. Those, who have lived here for over 40 years, should be sent back in a dignified way. Those stationed on the border should not create issues about the repatriation of Afghan refugees,” he said. The chief minister said that the police and the counter-terrorism department were leading the fight against terrorists from the front. “The vehicles gifted by the federal government to our police force have become outdated, so we have decided to return them,” he said. Earlier, Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Dr Ibadullah said working for peace in the province was the top priority of every MPA. He urged the chair to call a meeting of the house’s peace committee. Dr Ibadullah said that the opposition would never allow any action that went against the interest of the province. “The opposition will stand with the government in case of any positive step taken in the interest of the province,” he said. The opposition leader vowed to highlight the government’s weak performances. He insisted that the opposition never opposed Mr Afridi’s meeting with Mr Imran. Mr Swati observed that the first meeting of the house’s peace committee would be held soon after the finalisation of its terms of references, with all relevant government officers being asked to show up. Treasury lawmaker Adnan Qadri said Mr Afridi’s victory in the chief minister’s election was the victory of the people and the defeat of all “other powers.” He said people from tribal districts thanked the PTI founder for nominating Mr Afridi from among them as the province’s chief executive. ”Those who held news conferences against the new chief minister disheartened the tribesmen,” he said. Mr Qadri also condemned the alleged killing of TLP workers during street protests in Punjab and demanded their names be made public. MPA Dr Amjad Ali said if the Pakistan Army could take over 34 posts on Pak-Afghan border, why they didn’t eliminate 500 terrorists from Bajaur district in the last three months. He said Pakistan wanted talks with India after border clashes but never held negotiations with Pakhtuns. The MPA said he, as the minister for mines and minerals, was denied access to mines in merged tribal districts by security forces citing the delicate law and order situation as the reason. “The Katlang area where a drone strike was carried out, has vast pink topaz reserves. Pink topaz is found in Brazil or Katlang only,” he said. Mohammad Nisar of the opposition ANP said for the first time, he felt the house was serious about discussing the issues of merged tribal districts. He said terrorists were identified in some villages but even then, 13 civilians, including women, children and elderly, were martyred with no body of the terrorists found. “We are not aliens. We want an end to the buffer zone. We want developmental funds to be spent in our merged areas,” he said. The lawmaker said efforts were under way for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, to get control of KP’s mines and minerals and declare the merged districts federal territory,” he said. The speaker congratulated Hindu community’s members on diwali, the festival of lights. The house also passed a resolution by a majority vote, urging the provincial government to inform the United Nations that the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa do not accept Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the nation’s representatives nor does they recognise Israel. The resolution was tabled by Abdul Salam Afridi, whose another resolution seeking medical facilities for Imran and his wife in jail, was also adopted. The chair later adjourned the sitting until 2 pm today (Tuesday). Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least eight alleged terrorists were gunned down by security forces in an operation on Monday, after a team from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) came under attack near the Kot Lalu area in Daraban, Dera Ismail Khan. The action came in an apparent response to an attack on the SNGPL team, in which security forces reportedly also suffered casualties. However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) or other security agencies about their losses until going to press. Sources said the militants were killed after intelligence reports were received about their presence in a nearby jungle, prompting the security forces to launch an offensive in which eight suspects were gunned down. Following the action, the forces cordoned off the area and initiated wide-ranging search-and-clearance operations in the surrounding terrain. Reinforcements were dispatched to secure the site and to pursue the fleeing suspects. Two suspects killed in Swabi encounter; attack on Bannu police station repulsed Officials told reporters that the slain militants allegedly were members of a cell that had been planning a direct attack on the pipeline project. They said the group intended to sabotage the installation — a project of national importance aimed at providing energy, employment and improved services to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Investigations were ongoing and local authorities said they would share further details as the clearance operation and forensic work proceeded. Two killed in Swabi Separately, two militants were killed in a joint operation conducted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Mardan and the Swabi district police before midnight, Ziauddin Ahmad, the district police officer, said on Monday. The incident took place three days after a hand grenade was hurled at the Kalabat police post by unidentified men, in which a constable was martyred. According to a separate press release, the CTD and Swabi police were engaged in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in mountainous Maini village when four alleged militants riding two motorcycles opened fire on the law enforcers. “The CTD operation party retaliated with full vigour. As a result, terrorists were killed on the spot, and their two accomplices escaped, taking advantage of darkness,” said DPO Ahmad. Soon after the incident, a search and strike operation was launched in the area. The slain men allegedly belonged to the TTP Tayyip Akbar Group and were wanted in numerous cases, including attacks on the police. Attack repelled Separately, an attack targeting the police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu district late Sunday night was thwarted by the police. A police official said that a group of militants attacked the police station with advanced light and heavy weapons in a bid to breach the building. “But the personnel deployed there were fully alert as they had noticed the terrorists’ movements with the help of thermal vision cameras,” he said, adding that the law enforcers countered the attack vigorously and forced the assailants to flee. The official said that after hearing about the attack on the police station, local residents armed with weapons also came out of their houses and assisted police in their action against terrorists. He said that all policemen remain safe in the attack. Meanwhile, two policemen who had been kidnapped from the Peepal Bazaar in Bannu on Monday were freed by their captors. A police official said that two police officials, including Naheedullah and Eid Muhammad, were kidnapped by unknown armed men when they were returning to their duty place after performing their duty with the polio teams.

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that the ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and Kabul was linked to the Afghan Taliban’s ability to rein in terrorists attacking Pakistan from neighbouring soil. The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of border clashes that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021. Ground fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani airstrikes across their contested 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control terrorists it says operate from safe havens in Afghanistan. “Anything coming from Afghanistan will be [a] violation of this agreement,” Asif said in his office at Parliament in Islamabad. “Everything hinges on this one clause.” The Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “In the agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkiye and Qatar, it was clearly spelled out that there would not be any incursions,” the minister said. “We have a ceasefire agreement as long as there is no violation of the agreement which is already in force.” The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group operated out of Afghanistan to attack Pakistan “in connivance” with the Taliban, the defence minister said. Kabul has previously denied such accusations. In a separate interview to Al-Jazeera Arabic , he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”. Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years. He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats. Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord. The defence minister also appreciated the role played by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement. Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries. He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed. The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise. As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again. Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added. The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said. In a separate interview to Arab News , he ruled out the notion that Pakistan had conducted the airstrikes in Kabul on the urging of the United States, saying: “It is total nonsense and nothing else.” He questioned why Pakistan would do so, saying the country had had enough of its involvement in Afghanistan for the past few decades. “We want to stay away and live like decent neighbours. We don’t want to have any involvement in Afghan affairs,” Asif said, adding that Pakistan had “no business” in Afghanistan’s relationship with India or any other country. “Absolutely not. Whatever they want to do in their own territory and doesn’t spill over to our territory, doesn’t become our business.” Doha talks and press release controversy Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Asif said the Doha talks were not held in a bitter atmosphere and credited the Qatari and Turkish officials for it. “Not even an opportunity for confrontation was provided on any conflicting point,” he said, adding that all talk of amendments and additions or deletions was done through the Qatari and Turkish officials. “Direct interaction only happened at the opening, where both sides talked … but all of the engagement was done through Qatar and Turkiye.” Asif added the draft agreement was only one page, contrary to a longer version he said was circulating on social media. He added that an upcoming meeting in Turkiye would further refine the details, such as the mechanism to implement the deal’s aspects. Questioned about his own thoughts about whether the ceasefire would hold, the defence minister said: “I have guarded optimism on the matter; I am hopeful but also remain cautious. Can only say something conclusively given the circumstantial evidence. It is too early at the moment, we must remain hopeful of course.” The minister added that he hoped that the Afghan Taliban would act as a “unified government” and conclude the matter with Pakistan instead of returning tomorrow and saying that separate factions were behind the tensions. He elaborated that in the case of any violation, Qatar and Turkiye would be asked to play their role. Asif added that the mechanism for this entire process would be decided in the meeting on the October 25. The defence minister also stated that the entire TTP leadership was present in Afghanistan, adding that the matter would be taken up in Istanbul as well. He further said that the talks should not be taken to mean that Pakistan would negotiate or hold talks with the TTP, dismissing such a notion. Questioned about changes in Qatar’s press releases on the ceasefire with “tensions on the border” removed in a subsequent statement, Asif acknowledged that there was debate on wherever the word was used, but ultimately Qatar’s press release had nothing to do with the draft of the agreement, adding that he could not divulge its contents. “It is between them. It has absolutely no effect on the agreement,” he said, adding that the incident had no particular implications as were being derived by others.",

      "summary_en": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that the ceasefire agreement between Islamabad and Kabul was linked to the Afghan Taliban’s ability to rein in terrorists attacking Pakistan from neighbouring soil. The two countries agreed to a ceasefire in Doha at the weekend after days of border clashes that killed dozens, the worst such violence since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021. Ground fighting between the one-time allies and Pakistani airstrikes across their contested 2,600-kilometre frontier were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control terrorists it says operate from safe havens in Afghanistan. “Anything coming from Afghanistan will be [a] violation of this agreement,” Asif said in his office at Parliament in Islamabad. “Everything hinges on this one clause.” The Taliban administration and Afghanistan’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “In the agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkiye and Qatar, it was clearly spelled out that there would not be any incursions,” the minister said. “We have a ceasefire agreement as long as there is no violation of the agreement which is already in force.” The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group operated out of Afghanistan to attack Pakistan “in connivance” with the Taliban, the defence minister said. Kabul has previously denied such accusations. In a separate interview to Al-Jazeera Arabic , he said the primary objective of the ceasefire agreement was to “eliminate the menace of terrorism”. Asif added that terrorism has been affecting the Pak-Afghan border areas for years. He elaborated that both countries concluded that the immediate eradication of terrorism was essential. The two sides, he added, would make serious efforts to curb terrorism; otherwise, regional peace could face grave threats. Asif said the agreement was primarily reached through the mediation of Qatar and Turkiye, adding that both countries’ presence served as a guarantee for the accord. The defence minister also appreciated the role played by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in facilitating the agreement. Asif maintained that another meeting would be held next week in Istanbul to finalise the details of the agreement, and an effective mechanism would also be devised to resolve the existing issues between the two countries. He further said that his Afghan counterpart had also acknowledged terrorism as the main cause of tension in bilateral relations, which would now be addressed. The defence czar stated that Pakistan has suffered immense human and financial losses over the past years due to terrorism. However, he expressed hope that peace would now return and relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan would normalise. As a result, he said, Pakistan-Afghanistan trade and transit activities would resume, enabling the latter to use the former’s ports once again. Asif also added that Afghan refugees holding valid visas and documents would be allowed to stay in Pakistan. However, a large number of undocumented refugees would continue to be repatriated, he added. The minister said it was premature to claim satisfaction over the resolution of all concerns. “We will have to see in the coming weeks and months how effectively the agreement is implemented,” he said.

One of the most shocking blows was to the Okhmatdyt children’s hospital in central Kyiv , which reduced the country’s largest paediatric clinic to rubble. Tim, 43, was delivering aid on the outskirts of Kyiv when he heard a missile fly overhead. A short while later, he saw the news on his phone that the children’s hospital had been hit. Along with a British friend, the Chinese national, who asked to be referred to by just his English name, rushed to the scene to help with the recovery efforts. “Seeing the severed limbs, some of them belonging to children, I started crying,” the father-of-two said, tears in his eyes at the memory. “I thought about the kind of anger that Chinese people have.
