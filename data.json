No exact date was given in the announcement, which was posted on X. “High Commissioner [Dr Muhammad Faisal] is grateful to the Civil Aviation Authority UK for issuing the Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit (FOP) today, the final document enabling commercial flights between the UK and Pakistan,” the post read. “PIA has already received the Third Country Operator (TCO) approval for flight operations in the United Kingdom, and in the first phase, flight operations to Manchester will be resumed, after which Birmingham and London will be included.” In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. The carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”. The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.",

      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudry on Friday apologised for the attack on journalists in Islamabad a day prior, assuring the media that steps will be taken to ensure such an incident does not reoccur. On Thursday, a raid was carried out by Islamabad police at the National Press Club (NPC), where several journalists were allegedly assaulted. Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen armed with batons attacking journalists on the press club premises. Moreover, visuals shared on social media also showed police dragging journalists out of what appeared to be the cafeteria. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had ordered an inquiry into the incident. Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad today, Tallal said that he apologises for the incident on behalf of the government and that the information minister was on board regarding the matter. Condemning the incident, he reassured the media that steps will be taken so no one dares to “disrespect the press club” again. “I went to the press club immediately and asked for an unconditional apology,” Tallal said. “Whatever shortcomings there have been, we have apologised and action will be taken.” When it comes to freedom of speech, journalists, and the sanctity of the press club, Tallal reiterated that “there can be no compromise”. He added that the administration of the press club and other stakeholders will collectively make a decision and the corresponding action will be seen. Meanwhile, in a post on X, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui also condemned the incident, saying the decision to investigate it is a good step, but it should not be a mere formality. “The officials who are irresponsible and abusive should be identified and punished under the law,” Senator Siddiqui said. “While keeping the investigation process transparent, journalist organisations should also be involved.” He added that the sanctity of press clubs should not be violated. “No justification for violence against a journalist performing professional duties can be acceptable. A solid arrangement to permanently prevent such actions is very important,” he said. In May, Freedom Network’s annual Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom Report for 2025 said Pakistan’s media is “standing at a crossroad amid an existential threat and increased restrictive environment, deteriorating safety and job security, significant challenges to professional integrity of media and its practitioners”. Last year, Pakistan dropped two places in the World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders, with the country ranking 152 out of 180 countries. Additional input by Irfan Sadozai.",

According to FBR, five consignments by a company registered in Dubai were cleared using fake gate passes while being concealed from the Web-Based One Customs (WeBOC) system, resulting in an estimated duty and tax evasion of Rs384 million. “Two first information reports (FIRs) have been lodged, employees arrested, and further arrests are expected,” the statement said. It added that the operation reflected the FBR’s “commitment to safeguarding national revenue”, warning that negligent customs officials would not be spared. FBR has lately been intensifying its crackdown on tax evasion and smuggling, carrying out a series of operations at ports and airports across the country to safeguard national revenue. Last month, it emerged that the revenue watchdog launched a “Lifestyle Monitoring Cell” with 40 investigators to scan Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube for signs of tax evasion.",

If confirmed, it would be the first visit to India by a senior leader of the Taliban-run Afghan administration since it seized power in 2021 after 20 years of US military presence. Delhi and Kabul have traditionally enjoyed close ties when the Islamist Taliban were not in power. Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is among Afghan Taliban members who are under UN sanctions, including a travel ban and asset freeze. Temporary exemptions are sometimes granted for diplomacy. The Afghan administration did not immediately respond to inquiries about Muttaqi’s travel plans. India’s foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters that New Delhi had already been speaking to the Afghan administration, and noted that it had provided support after an earthquake on August 31. He did not specifically confirm that the visit would take place. Indian and Afghan media have reported that Muttaqi will travel to Russia before visiting New Delhi. In Moscow, he is expected to discuss the situation in Afghanistan with representatives from Russia, China, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Central Asian countries, the reports say. Hekmatullah Hekmat, an Afghan political analyst, said the visit to India was highly significant for the Taliban government: “Afghanistan is in dire need of establishing relations with regional countries, especially its neighbours. It needs to build political, economic, and trade ties and to gain recognition.” Only Russia has so far recognised the Taliban government. India closed its embassy in Kabul in 2021, but a year later opened a technical mission to coordinate humanitarian assistance.",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on Friday said that she would “never apologise” over a recent outburst which escalated into a rift between her party, the PML-N, and its coalition partner, the PPP. The war of words between the two sides — kicked off over flood compensation — expanded to water rights on the Indus River as the Punjab chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP, the ruling party in Sindh, had lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe. On Wednesday, PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces. Addressing a ceremony in Lahore, the Punjab CM censured the PPP for hurling “wrongful criticism” at the Punjab government amid devastating floods sweeping the country. “When floods swept through Punjab, the people of one province not only wrongly criticised the Punjab government, but they also rubbed salt in the wound,” she said. “If there is any issue in any province, do we level false allegations at press conferences? Do we spread lies? What we do is help them.” The Punjab CM said she called KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and offered any assistance she could to him during the floods, despite him being a political opponent. “Those in other provinces are my Pakistani brothers and sisters; whenever a CM likes a project I’ve done and asks me for the technology, I immediately send a minister and secretary. So when people say that I celebrate anything bad happening in another province, it is upsetting,” she added. “I want to tell [President] Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal [Bhutto-Zardari] that I was upset when the people of Punjab were in distress. We saw Bilawal doing those three press conferences, where he mocked Punjab and spread lies that things were not being done. She added that she remained quiet about Bilawal’s remarks because she “did not want to get into a fight” because she was “serving the people of Punjab 24 hours a day and did not have the time”. “I am not going to leave my people alone,” CM Maryam said. “If you talk, I’ll respond befittingly. “I was asked why I didn’t take money from BISP [Benazir Income Support Programme] — I did not want the data of poor people, but the data of the people affected by floods,” she added. “I have 10,000 people in the field going door-to-door to perform damage assessments, so that we can compensate them.” CM Maryam referenced the PPP’s walkouts from parliament, asking why she needed to apologise. “That spokesperson who criticised the Punjab government and politicised the suffering of Punjab’s people is the one who needs to apologise,” she said. “If I respond to anyone, I raise my voice for my people. Maryam Nawaz Sharif will never apologise.” The CM said that Punjabis love their land and that the people’s self-respect was also her responsibility. “Think 100 times over before talking negatively about Punjab.” She then moved to the canals issue, stating that she was ready to pay for the canals project and “brought the case of Punjab’s people before the CCI [Council of Common Interests]”. The now-shelved canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between the Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. “That water is the right of Punjab’s farmers, but it was politicised,” the CM continued. However, the chief minister distanced herself from controversial remarks made by YouTuber Rizwan Razi, also known as Razi Dada, who had made derogatory remarks about the people of Sindh. “He said something inappropriate and I cannot endorse it,” she said. “Even he realised it. He was summoned to a Senate standing committee, where he apologised unconditionally. “When someone apologises, you forgive them, right? But these people [the PPP] made fun of him. Still, I remained silent. However, I will not let this happen to another person in Punjab.”",

Addressing a ceremony in Lahore, the Punjab CM censured the PPP for hurling “wrongful criticism” at the Punjab government amid devastating floods sweeping the country. “When floods swept through Punjab, the people of one province not only wrongly criticised the Punjab government, but they also rubbed salt in the wound,” she said. “If there is any issue in any province, do we level false allegations at press conferences? Do we spread lies? What we do is help them.” The Punjab CM said she called KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and offered any assistance she could to him during the floods, despite him being a political opponent. “Those in other provinces are my Pakistani brothers and sisters; whenever a CM likes a project I’ve done and asks me for the technology, I immediately send a minister and secretary. So when people say that I celebrate anything bad happening in another province, it is upsetting,” she added. “I want to tell [President] Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal [Bhutto-Zardari] that I was upset when the people of Punjab were in distress. We saw Bilawal doing those three press conferences, where he mocked Punjab and spread lies that things were not being done. She added that she remained quiet about Bilawal’s remarks because she “did not want to get into a fight” because she was “serving the people of Punjab 24 hours a day and did not have the time”. “I am not going to leave my people alone,” CM Maryam said. “If you talk, I’ll respond befittingly. “I was asked why I didn’t take money from BISP [Benazir Income Support Programme] — I did not want the data of poor people, but the data of the people affected by floods,” she added. “I have 10,000 people in the field going door-to-door to perform damage assessments, so that we can compensate them.” CM Maryam referenced the PPP’s walkouts from parliament, asking why she needed to apologise. “That spokesperson who criticised the Punjab government and politicised the suffering of Punjab’s people is the one who needs to apologise,” she said. “If I respond to anyone, I raise my voice for my people. Maryam Nawaz Sharif will never apologise.” The CM said that Punjabis love their land and that the people’s self-respect was also her responsibility. “Think 100 times over before talking negatively about Punjab.” She then moved to the canals issue, stating that she was ready to pay for the canals project and “brought the case of Punjab’s people before the CCI [Council of Common Interests]”. The now-shelved canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between the Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. “That water is the right of Punjab’s farmers, but it was politicised,” the CM continued. However, the chief minister distanced herself from controversial remarks made by YouTuber Rizwan Razi, also known as Razi Dada, who had made derogatory remarks about the people of Sindh. “He said something inappropriate and I cannot endorse it,” she said. “Even he realised it. He was summoned to a Senate standing committee, where he apologised unconditionally. “When someone apologises, you forgive them, right? But these people [the PPP] made fun of him. Still, I remained silent. However, I will not let this happen to another person in Punjab.”",

      "summary": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif on Friday said that she would “never apologise” over a recent outburst which escalated into a rift between her party, the PML-N, and its coalition partner, the PPP.

      "title_orig": "Dar asserts Trump’s Gaza peace plan ‘not ours’ but says no room for politicking",
      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Friday that the 20-point Gaza peace plan released by US President Donald Trump was “not ours” but insisted that there was no room for politicking on the matter. Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, Dar referred to his earlier press briefing in Islamabad and said: “I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record.” However, he went on to say: “This is the end result, and there is no room for politicking.” Eight Muslim and Arab countries — Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — had held a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly session, where the US president discussed his plan for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. On Sept 29, US President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had met and, in a press conference after the meeting, announced the former’s 20-point plan for Gaza. However, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s initial welcoming of the plan, Dar had later made it clear in so many words that the plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included. During his speech, Dar said that the eight Arab and Muslim countries had come together for a meeting on Gaza on the sidelines of the UNGA. “During the meeting, there was no other agenda. Today I am telling you the details,” he said, adding that it was decided to keep the meetings “discreet”. He further said that before the main meeting, a preparatory meeting of all the foreign ministers of the eight countries was held in New York, where the situation in Gaza was discussed. He said that for his part, US President Trump took this positively and said his team would sit with the foreign ministers to find a “workable solution”. He said Trump also said that he was scheduled to meet Israeli PM Netanyahu soon, and to try and stop the bombardment of Gaza. He said that Qatar’s embassy was the convener for these meetings, which were not released to the media. “President Trump’s committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted […]. They gave us a 20-point proposal.” Dar further said that the ministers took the proposal and decided to deliberate on it for the next 24 hours. “Instead of making a completely new draft, we decided to remain within this framework and decided to either amend or delete points based on our wish list,” he said. “We held different meetings in the next 24 hours. We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms.” He said that the final draft prepared by the eight countries, not just Pakistan, was then sent onward as a “counter draft”. He said that two hours after the Pakistani delegation left New York, he received a phone call where he was told that some countries wanted all eight foreign ministers to sign off on the document, while some were saying it was not necessary. “This was a small thing in my eyes,” Dar said, adding that he asked the majority to make a decision in this regard. “By the time we landed at our next destination, I was told the American side had received the draft.” He said that during Monday’s meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, a 20-point plan was announced. He said that he then spoke to the Saudi foreign minister, who said that the urgent points put forth by the eight countries were accepted but some things still required further engagement. Quoting the Saudi minister, he said that at that point there were two choices: to continue and perhaps Israel will continue its bloodshed, or we let Trump’s plan be implemented and issue a joint statement. “I said you are right, we should do this,” he said, adding that the statement was later finalised. Dar then proceeded to read out the joint statement issued on September 29. He said that this was the only way to end Israel’s bombardment of Gaza when all other forums had failed. “Statements will not suffice. We need practical work,” he said, extending his thanks to the other countries involved. During his speech, Dar also said that Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. “There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” he said, reiterating Pakistan’s unwavering demand for an independent and sovereign Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital. Gaza flotilla Dar also talked about Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), on board which was former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan. He said that out of the 45 vessels part of the fleet, reports indicated that Israel had captured 22 and detained several activists. “According to our information, it is not confirmed yet, […] but according to our information, Khan is included in this,” he said. Dar further said that Pakistan had involved a third European country that was “influential” for the ex-senator’s release. Without naming the country, he said that definitive information would be known by Sunday. He asserted that he and the foreign ministry were working on retrieving the Pakistanis who were with the flotilla.",

      "summary_en": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Friday that the 20-point Gaza peace plan released by US President Donald Trump was “not ours” but insisted that there was no room for politicking on the matter. Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, Dar referred to his earlier press briefing in Islamabad and said: “I made it clear that the 20 points that President Trump made public are not ours. Changes were made to our draft. I have the record.” However, he went on to say: “This is the end result, and there is no room for politicking.” Eight Muslim and Arab countries — Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Pakistan, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Egypt — had held a meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly session, where the US president discussed his plan for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. On Sept 29, US President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had met and, in a press conference after the meeting, announced the former’s 20-point plan for Gaza. However, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s initial welcoming of the plan, Dar had later made it clear in so many words that the plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included. During his speech, Dar said that the eight Arab and Muslim countries had come together for a meeting on Gaza on the sidelines of the UNGA. “During the meeting, there was no other agenda. Today I am telling you the details,” he said, adding that it was decided to keep the meetings “discreet”. He further said that before the main meeting, a preparatory meeting of all the foreign ministers of the eight countries was held in New York, where the situation in Gaza was discussed. He said that for his part, US President Trump took this positively and said his team would sit with the foreign ministers to find a “workable solution”. He said Trump also said that he was scheduled to meet Israeli PM Netanyahu soon, and to try and stop the bombardment of Gaza. He said that Qatar’s embassy was the convener for these meetings, which were not released to the media. “President Trump’s committee also came and open talks were held on what they wanted […]. They gave us a 20-point proposal.” Dar further said that the ministers took the proposal and decided to deliberate on it for the next 24 hours. “Instead of making a completely new draft, we decided to remain within this framework and decided to either amend or delete points based on our wish list,” he said. “We held different meetings in the next 24 hours. We were exchanging hard copies in hotel rooms.” He said that the final draft prepared by the eight countries, not just Pakistan, was then sent onward as a “counter draft”. He said that two hours after the Pakistani delegation left New York, he received a phone call where he was told that some countries wanted all eight foreign ministers to sign off on the document, while some were saying it was not necessary. “This was a small thing in my eyes,” Dar said, adding that he asked the majority to make a decision in this regard. “By the time we landed at our next destination, I was told the American side had received the draft.” He said that during Monday’s meeting between Trump and Netanyahu, a 20-point plan was announced. He said that he then spoke to the Saudi foreign minister, who said that the urgent points put forth by the eight countries were accepted but some things still required further engagement. Quoting the Saudi minister, he said that at that point there were two choices: to continue and perhaps Israel will continue its bloodshed, or we let Trump’s plan be implemented and issue a joint statement. “I said you are right, we should do this,” he said, adding that the statement was later finalised. Dar then proceeded to read out the joint statement issued on September 29. He said that this was the only way to end Israel’s bombardment of Gaza when all other forums had failed. “Statements will not suffice. We need practical work,” he said, extending his thanks to the other countries involved. During his speech, Dar also said that Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remained the same as that of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. “There has not been any change nor will there ever be,” he said, reiterating Pakistan’s unwavering demand for an independent and sovereign Palestinian state with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.

      "summary_orig": "Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh on Friday claimed that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. “As far as air defence part is concerned, we have evidence of one long-range strike … along with that five fighters, high-tech fighters between F-16 and JF-17 class, our system tells us,” Singh told reporters at the Indian Air Force annual day press conference. However, he did not share the said evidence. The F-16 is a US-made fighter jet, while the JF-17 is of Chinese origin. Although Singh had previously too claimed without credible evidence that five Pakistani fighter jets and another military aircraft were shot down during the conflict, this is the first time New Delhi has mentioned the class of jets in public. He also refused to comment on Pakistan downing Indian jets in May. The first time the Indian air chief had claimed that Pakistan’s jets were downed during the four-day escalation, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had dismissed the “implausible” Indian assertions, offering instead to open both countries’ air fleets to independent verification. “The belated assertions made by the Indian Air Force chief regarding alleged destruction of Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor are as implausible as they are ill-timed,” Khawaja Asif had said in a sharply worded August statement. “It is also ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by the strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians.” He also said that India did not make any such claims for three months after the conflict ended, while Pakistan immediately presented deta­iled technical briefings to the international media, and independent obser­vers recorded widespread acknowledgement of the loss of multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafales, by sources ranging from world leaders, senior Indian politicians, to foreign intelligence assessments. Indian air chief’s latest claims of downing jets come a week after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, during a United Nations General Assembly speech, said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “ seven of the Indian jets ” into scrap and dust. Earlier this week, United States President Donald Trump also described how he confronted both nations during an active war that saw “ seven aircraft shot down ” and tensions rapidly escalating between the two neighbours. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale . New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. The May fighting, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. Ties between the countries have downgraded since the attack, with the impact being felt in areas ranging from trade and travel to sports. India has also kept in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty — a move Pakistan termed an “act of war”.",

      "summary_orig": "A second round of negotiations between a negotiating team of the government and the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) was held in Muzaffarabad on Friday, in a continued bid to end the ongoing unrest in the territory. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Rival groups have since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. A fresh round of talks between a high-level government delegation and a civil society alliance was held yesterday, followed by another one today. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in a post on X that the government’s committee was holding a second round of talks with the JAAC representatives in Muzaffarabad. “We fully support the rights of the people of Kashmir,” he said, maintaining that most of their demands, which were in public interest, had already been accepted. “Constitutional amendments are required to fulfil the remaining few demands and talks are ongoing regarding that. “We believe that violence is not the solution to any problem. We hope that the Action Committee will resolve all issues through peaceful dialogue,” the minister said. In an earlier post, he shared that PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf,\nSenator Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, Adviser to Prime Minister on Kashmir Affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, Masood Ahmed and Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam Chaudhry himself were part of the government’s negotiating team. Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to the AJK capital and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues. A shutter-down strike has paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continues to press its demands. HRCP sounds alarm Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has said it is\n“deeply alarmed by the ongoing violence in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), where reportedly at least nine people, including three police officers, have lost their lives and hundreds have been injured during protests”. “We strongly condemn the use of excessive force and the deaths of civilians and law enforcers alike as well as communication blackouts,” the HRCP posted on X. It underlined that while “dialogue is essential, it cannot be meaningful amid the continued political disenfranchisement of the region’s people. The right to peaceful protest must be upheld and grievances addressed transparently”. “We urge both the federal and AJK governments to avoid further escalation, respect people’s fundamental rights and commit to genuine, inclusive negotiations. To this end, HRCP intends to send a fact-finding mission to AJK as soon as possible to assess the situation,” it added.",

HRCP sounds alarm Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has said it is\n“deeply alarmed by the ongoing violence in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), where reportedly at least nine people, including three police officers, have lost their lives and hundreds have been injured during protests”. “We strongly condemn the use of excessive force and the deaths of civilians and law enforcers alike as well as communication blackouts,” the HRCP posted on X. It underlined that while “dialogue is essential, it cannot be meaningful amid the continued political disenfranchisement of the region’s people. The right to peaceful protest must be upheld and grievances addressed transparently”. “We urge both the federal and AJK governments to avoid further escalation, respect people’s fundamental rights and commit to genuine, inclusive negotiations. To this end, HRCP intends to send a fact-finding mission to AJK as soon as possible to assess the situation,” it added.",

      "summary": "A second round of negotiations between a negotiating team of the government and the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) was held in Muzaffarabad on Friday, in a continued bid to end the ongoing unrest in the territory. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Rival groups have since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. A fresh round of talks between a high-level government delegation and a civil society alliance was held yesterday, followed by another one today. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in a post on X that the government’s committee was holding a second round of talks with the JAAC representatives in Muzaffarabad. “We fully support the rights of the people of Kashmir,” he said, maintaining that most of their demands, which were in public interest, had already been accepted. “Constitutional amendments are required to fulfil the remaining few demands and talks are ongoing regarding that. “We believe that violence is not the solution to any problem. We hope that the Action Committee will resolve all issues through peaceful dialogue,” the minister said. In an earlier post, he shared that PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf,\nSenator Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, Adviser to Prime Minister on Kashmir Affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, Masood Ahmed and Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam Chaudhry himself were part of the government’s negotiating team. Yesterday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to the AJK capital and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues.

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Sherani district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday. In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on October 1, security forces conducted an IBO in Sherani on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said. It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in “numerous terrorist activities” in the area. According to the ISPR, a sanitisation operation was underway to eliminate other terrorists in the area. “The security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” it added. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the armed forces on the successful completion of the operation in Sherani, reiterating the state’s resolve to uproot the menace of terrorism“ from the country. “We will never allow those who seek to harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he said, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) . Meanwhile, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti expressed pride for the security forces, who “stand as a shield for the defence of the homeland in every difficult time”. “The failure of Pakistan-hostile networks and Indian proxies in Shirani district is the result of the great sacrifices and splendid capabilities of our brave security forces,” the CM wrote in a post on X. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Two reports , issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) on Wednesday, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.",

Meanwhile, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti expressed pride for the security forces, who “stand as a shield for the defence of the homeland in every difficult time”. “The failure of Pakistan-hostile networks and Indian proxies in Shirani district is the result of the great sacrifices and splendid capabilities of our brave security forces,” the CM wrote in a post on X. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Two reports , issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) on Wednesday, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.",

      "summary": "Security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Sherani district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday. In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on October 1, security forces conducted an IBO in Sherani on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said. It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in “numerous terrorist activities” in the area.

      "summary_orig": "The Sindh High Court on Friday suspended a notification issued by the University of Karachi (KU) that cancelled the law degree of Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri. The court’s decision came during the hearing of a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri on Monday impugning the decisions of the KU’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate, which cancelled his degree in August last year. The KU registrar, the Sindh advocate general and others appeared before the court as it took up the plea today. They sought more time for submitting their replies on the plea, saying that they had received notices pertaining to the case yesterday. At that, Justice Iqbal Kalhoro remarked, “We are ready to give more time but what if any action is taken against the petitioner in this duration? If we accept your request today and any action is taken tomorrow, who will take responsibility in that case?” He further enquired whether the respondents had issued any notice to Jahangiri before “taking action against him”. Noting that questions were being raised on Justice Jahangiri’s degree, Justice Kalhoro observed that he should have been issued a notice if an application was moved against him 30 to 35 years after the issuance of his degree. He further stated, “We are not saying that action cannot be taken against him because the law allows it … [but] how can we put someone’s honour at stake? Someone’s life-long earning is at stake here.” The court then adjourned the hearing, seeking replies from respondents on October 24. The petition In his petition, Justice Jahangiri contended that the “illegal and mala fide” cancellation of his LLB degree occurred in the context of his “unflinching judicial independence”. Justice Jahangiri claimed that when the campaign to have him removed through the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) failed, “a new strategy” was adopted by misusing official processes and institutions. He said the degree cancellation became the basis for the IHC’s decision to restrain him from judicial duties. He described the KU Unfair Means Committee’s decision as “shocking and surprising,” noting that the committee revived the issue after 32 years without issuing him a notice or providing reasons. Fake degree controversy The controversy pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s law degree began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations regarding the validity of the degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC . The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016. It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri. Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme. On July 10, 2024, the IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.” As the degree accusations came to light, a writ petition was filed, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer. At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that the petitioner was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC. On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said. The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree. Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself. To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person. On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the Supreme Court (SC). The IHC decision was declared “null and void” by the SC on Sept 30. Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea by Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions challenging the cancellation of his law degree. As lawyers protested the move, the bench also dismissed the set of pleas against the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree for “non-prosecution”. On Thursday, Justice Jahangiri moved the SC, challenging the SHC ruling of dismissing his application.",

At that, Justice Iqbal Kalhoro remarked, “We are ready to give more time but what if any action is taken against the petitioner in this duration? If we accept your request today and any action is taken tomorrow, who will take responsibility in that case?” He further enquired whether the respondents had issued any notice to Jahangiri before “taking action against him”. Noting that questions were being raised on Justice Jahangiri’s degree, Justice Kalhoro observed that he should have been issued a notice if an application was moved against him 30 to 35 years after the issuance of his degree. He further stated, “We are not saying that action cannot be taken against him because the law allows it … [but] how can we put someone’s honour at stake? Someone’s life-long earning is at stake here.” The court then adjourned the hearing, seeking replies from respondents on October 24. The petition In his petition, Justice Jahangiri contended that the “illegal and mala fide” cancellation of his LLB degree occurred in the context of his “unflinching judicial independence”. Justice Jahangiri claimed that when the campaign to have him removed through the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) failed, “a new strategy” was adopted by misusing official processes and institutions. He said the degree cancellation became the basis for the IHC’s decision to restrain him from judicial duties. He described the KU Unfair Means Committee’s decision as “shocking and surprising,” noting that the committee revived the issue after 32 years without issuing him a notice or providing reasons. Fake degree controversy The controversy pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s law degree began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations regarding the validity of the degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC . The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016. It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri. Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme. On July 10, 2024, the IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.” As the degree accusations came to light, a writ petition was filed, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer. At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that the petitioner was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC. On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said. The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree. Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself. To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person. On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the Supreme Court (SC). The IHC decision was declared “null and void” by the SC on Sept 30. Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea by Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions challenging the cancellation of his law degree. As lawyers protested the move, the bench also dismissed the set of pleas against the cancellation of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree for “non-prosecution”. On Thursday, Justice Jahangiri moved the SC, challenging the SHC ruling of dismissing his application.",

      "summary_orig": "• PM Shehbaz dispatches eight-member team to Muzaffarabad • Calls for peace, orders restraint by LEAs, seeks probe into deaths • AJK paralysed by fourth day of strike, communications blackout • Funerals in Muzaffarabad galvanise crowds; locals demand justice over alleged police firing MUZAFFARABAD: A high-level government delegation held negotiations with a civil society alliance in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Thursday after days of fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers that have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured. The eight-member committee, dispatched by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, comprises federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Amir Muq­am, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Rana Sanaullah and Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, along with PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf and Qamar Zaman Kaira, and former AJK president Sardar Masood Khan. They were accompanied by AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, who had been staying at Kashmir House in Islamabad for the past several days. Negotiations began in the committee room of the Chief Secretary’s office in the afternoon, with Shaukat Nawaz Mir, Raja Amjad Ali Khan and Anjum Zaman Awan from the Muzaffarabad division representing the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), which has been spearheading the rights movement in the territory. However, core members from the other two divisions — Poonch and Mirpur — could not immediately join the negotiations as they were away from the capital. Sources said the Muzaffarabad trio, along with other core members, later left for Dhirkot, where their colleagues from Poonch and Mirpur had already gathered for consultations. The meeting continued until late in the night on Thursday and talks with the government’s high-level committee were expected to resume on Friday morning. A strike has paralysed Azad Jammu and Kashmir under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JKJAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wed­nesday, the AJK prime minister and Parliamentary Affairs Mini­ster Tariq Fazal Chaudhry invited the alliance for fresh dialogue. On Thursday, the entire region observed a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike for the fourth consecutive day, under a ceaseless communications blackout imposed since Monday. No fresh incidents of violence were reported. Though government offices and banks technically remained open, attendance was negligible. Interestingly, many government officials avoided using official vehicles for commuting and instead preferred to walk or use rented motorcycles. ‘Enemies of Pakistan’ Before the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarabad, members of the government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days, Dawn.com reported. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role to address the issues in AJK. However, he added that given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”. He said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK, but they should also be mindful that no such situation was being created, which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage of. AJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks in the region and expressed the hope that members of the JKJAAC would also work towards ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We are all saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives.” Rana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace. Amir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end. We hope that [JKJAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.” Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views. The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad on Thursday to consider steps to defuse the situation. PM calls for peace According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on X earlier on Thursday, PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad. According to the statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as Wednesday’s violent protests left three policemen dead. He urged citizens to remain peaceful and instructed law enforcement agencies to show restraint. “The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful. He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.” The premier also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters. “The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers. Expressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter. Funerals in Muzaffarabad Earlier in the day, hundreds of people gathered at Khurshid Football Stadium and the AJK capital’s famous Lala Chowk to attend the funerals of two people killed in an alleged police firing in Muzaffarabad. Addressing the mourners, Mr Mir of JKJAAC updated the crowd on the latest developments, vowing that the struggle would continue until the acceptance of key demands. These include the abolition of 12 refugee seats, withdrawal of elite privileges, implementation of a June 2019 High Court decision regarding agreements on power projects in AJK, and provision of health cards. He stressed that before discussing these issues, the alliance would demand the immediate arrest and exemplary punishment of those responsible for killing “unarmed protesters” in Muzaffarabad, Dhirkot and other areas of AJK. He also sought a public mandate to engage in negotiations with the official committee, pledging that there would be no compromise on people’s rights. Reports from Kohala, a border town about 35km away, said that thousands of people from AJK’s southern districts had reached there by evening. A source told Dawn that JKJAAC leaders had directed the crowd to wait in Kohala until further instructions after the conclusion of their consultations. Published in Dawn, October 3rd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "THE statistics related to the frequency of militant attacks in Pakistan released by two local think tanks are cause for concern. They highlight that the state needs a much more proactive counterterrorism policy. As per the Pakistan Institute of Conflict and Security Studies, the number of militant attacks in the country last month had dropped compared to August’s figures. However, as a report from the Centre for Research and Security Studies points out, the current year may be the deadliest in a decade where terrorism-related fatalities are concerned. According to the PICSS findings, there were 69 militant attacks in September, causing 135 deaths. The overwhelming number of fatalities were those of security men and civilians. Also, in keeping with the general trend, KP and Balochistan were the hardest hit by terrorist violence, with the former recording 45 attacks in September, and the latter province witnessing 21 attacks. The most recent of these was Tuesday’s deadly bombing targeting the Frontier Corps headquarters in Quetta. While there may have been a dip in militant violence last month, the overall numbers for 2025 are nevertheless extremely worrying. The CRSS says that in the first three quarters of this year, over 2,400 fatalities were recorded, which means that “2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade”. Yet, despite the perturbing statistics, the sense of urgency to deal with the terrorist threat seems to be lacking within the corridors of power. This is so despite the fact that the country has lost a high number of troops and civilians. The state’s response is more reactive, going after militants after every deadly incident of terrorism. In fact, the state needs to defeat both major insurgencies — the TTP-led campaign in KP and the separatist movement in Balochistan. While inimical external forces that are supporting these insurgencies need to be dealt with on the diplomatic front, we very much need to raise our own level of preparedness too. Pakistan cannot go through endless cycles of terrorist violence, followed by security operations, only for the situation to deteriorate once again. A mix of kinetic and policy actions are needed to address the core issues fuelling both insurgencies. While there should be zero tolerance for terrorism, the socioeconomic and political issues that are often used to ‘justify’ these violent campaigns also need to be addressed by the state.

      "summary": "THE statistics related to the frequency of militant attacks in Pakistan released by two local think tanks are cause for concern. They highlight that the state needs a much more proactive counterterrorism policy. As per the Pakistan Institute of Conflict and Security Studies, the number of militant attacks in the country last month had dropped compared to August’s figures. However, as a report from the Centre for Research and Security Studies points out, the current year may be the deadliest in a decade where terrorism-related fatalities are concerned. According to the PICSS findings, there were 69 militant attacks in September, causing 135 deaths. The overwhelming number of fatalities were those of security men and civilians. Also, in keeping with the general trend, KP and Balochistan were the hardest hit by terrorist violence, with the former recording 45 attacks in September, and the latter province witnessing 21 attacks. The most recent of these was Tuesday’s deadly bombing targeting the Frontier Corps headquarters in Quetta. While there may have been a dip in militant violence last month, the overall numbers for 2025 are nevertheless extremely worrying. The CRSS says that in the first three quarters of this year, over 2,400 fatalities were recorded, which means that “2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade”. Yet, despite the perturbing statistics, the sense of urgency to deal with the terrorist threat seems to be lacking within the corridors of power. This is so despite the fact that the country has lost a high number of troops and civilians. The state’s response is more reactive, going after militants after every deadly incident of terrorism. In fact, the state needs to defeat both major insurgencies — the TTP-led campaign in KP and the separatist movement in Balochistan. While inimical external forces that are supporting these insurgencies need to be dealt with on the diplomatic front, we very much need to raise our own level of preparedness too. Pakistan cannot go through endless cycles of terrorist violence, followed by security operations, only for the situation to deteriorate once again. A mix of kinetic and policy actions are needed to address the core issues fuelling both insurgencies. While there should be zero tolerance for terrorism, the socioeconomic and political issues that are often used to ‘justify’ these violent campaigns also need to be addressed by the state.
