      "summary_orig": "A man stabbed three people at an office in eastern Seoul on Tuesday after being fired for an alleged sexual assault against one of the victims, police said. The 60-something man, surnamed Jo, attacked two women in their 50s and 60s and a man in his 70s inside an office of a redevelopment cooperative in Cheonho-dong, Gangdong District, around 10:20 a.m. according to the police. The victims were taken to nearby hospitals but not in life-threatening condition. The suspect, who previously headed the cooperative, was apprehended at the scene on charges of attempted murder and questioned about his motives. According to members of the cooperative, Jo has been standing trial on charges of sexually assaulting the 50-something woman, who works for the organization, in July. Prior to Tuesday's stabbing, he reportedly visited the woman at the office and sought to reach a settlement after prosecutors demanded a fine. Jo was dismissed from his post over the incident.",

      "summary_orig": "Twelve people were injured in a “gas” explosion at the Supreme Court building in Islamabad on Tuesday, police said. “A gas blast occurred at a canteen in the basement of the Supreme Court building at around 10:55am,” Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said while speaking to the media after the incident. He added that of the 12 injured, nine were taken to the Polyclinic hospital and three to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). IG Rizvi further told the reporters that the condition of two of the injured was “serious” who had sustained 80 per cent and 30pc burns. “The rest suffered minor injuries, most of which are burn injuries.” In multiple videos received by Dawn following the incident, the damaged interior of parts of the SC building is visible with blood stains on the floor. In other videos recorded outside, people, including lawyers, could be seen spilling out of the building. The IG said police, including special branch and along with bomb disposal squad and Rescue 1122 personnel, had visited the scene of the incident and carried out an investigation. “Initial probe revealed that there had been complaints of gas leakage in the canteen located in the basement and a tea room for around past three days. Plumbers and technicians who work at the Supreme Court were looking into those,” he said. He further stated that there was considerable leakage in the canteen today as well. Meanwhile, two of the air conditioners in the canteen were not working properly, he added. “Technicians were repairing them, during which gas accumulated […] and a blast occurred.” The IG said among the injured, the technicians repairing the air conditioners were most affected. He also assured that no traces of any kind of explosives were found at the site. Additional reporting by Umer Mehtab",

      "summary_orig": "Led by newly-appointed captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, Pakistan won the toss and opted to field first in the first One-day International of the three-match series against South Africa at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad on Tuesday. The match marks the return of international cricket to the iconic venue after 17 years — the city last hosted an international fixture in 2008 when Pakistan faced Bangladesh. Following the 2009 militant attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore, Pakistan endured a six-year exile from home international cricket, playing their matches at neutral venues in the United Arab Emirates. While other cities gradually returned to the international fold from 2015 onwards, Faisalabad remained off the map due to inadequate facilities — which have since been upgraded. Shaheen, who replaced Mohammad Rizwan as skipper after a string of poor results, expressed delight over Faisal­abad’s return as a host venue on Monday. “It’s a special occasion that Faisalabad is hosting an international match after 17 years; it will be good for the fans of the city,” he told reporters, adding that leading Pakistan was “an honour”.\n“.. the responsibility is big, but I will try to give my best,” said the 25-year-old. Shaheen’s comments came as he threw full support behind former captain Babar Azam, who rediscovered form during Pakistan’s 2-1 T20I series win over the Proteas last week. “Every cricketer struggles, but Babar must have realised in his last innings that he’s back in form,” Shaheen said. “He’s been performing for Pakistan for the past four or five years and is our top T20 run-scorer. He has the ability to play big innings and inspire others to do the same.” Babar’s composed knock in the decisive T20I on Saturday complemented Shaheen’s fiery bowling as Pakistan sealed a four-wicket win in Lahore. Shaheen, who previously captained the T20 side briefly last year before a 4-1 defeat in New Zealand ended his first stint, said he aimed to “lead from the front” in his new role. “It’s always been this way — when senior players perform, the team wins,” he said. “I try to step up whether I’m captain or not.” The left-armer leads a full-strength side featuring Haris Rauf, Naseem Shah, Fakhar Zaman, Babar and Rizwan. South Africa, meanwhile, will be without several first-choice players, including regular captain Temba Bavuma and fast bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen, who have been rested. Promising youngster Dewald Brevis was also ruled out hours before the match after sustaining a low-grade shoulder muscle strain in the third Twenty20 International on Saturday. In Bavuma’s absence, young opener Matthew Breetzke will lead the visitors. “We are missing our core ODI group, but this gives the younger guys an opportunity to step up and take the challenge,” he said. Quinton de Kock, who reversed his 2023 ODI retirement, is also set to make a comeback.\nThe remaining ODIs will be played on Thursday and Saturday, all at the same venue. Teams: Pakistan: Fakhar Zaman, Saim Ayub, Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan (wciekt-keeper), Salman Agha, Hussain Talat, Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi (captain), Naseem Shah, Abrar Ahmed South Africa: Quinton de Kock (wicket-keeper), Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Tony de Zorzi, Matthew Breetzke (captain), Sinethemba Qeshile, Donovan Ferreira, George Linde, Corbin Bosch, Bjorn Fortuin, Lungi Ngidi, Lizaad Williams",

In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on the night of November 1, security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of militants belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan . The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and resultantly, four Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said. “Weapons and ammunition [were] also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” it added. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area,” the statement said, adding that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to wipe out foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country. President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for eliminating the terrorists, his official account posted on social media platform X. “The nation stands firmly with its forces in their resolve to root out terrorism under Operation Azm-i-Istehkam ,” he said. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also hailed the armed forces, reiterating that the entire nation stood in their support with an unwavering resolve to protect the homeland, APP reported . “Pakistan would continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication from the country,” the premier reaffirmed. The development comes a day after the ISPR said at least three terrorists were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.",

      "summary_orig": "The PIA is struggling to continue its flight operations that have been marred by delays due to what the airline describes as a “strike” by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP). However, the SAEP made it clear that there was no strike from their side. “The SAEP and its members are strictly working within the rules and procedures defined in the PIA Engineering Manual and Pakistan Civil Aviation Regulations,” a senior official of the SAEP told Dawn . “The ongoing situation has been misinterpreted by certain quarters of the management as a ‘strike’, whereas in reality, engineers are adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols,” he claimed. He said that the protocols are legally required for ensuring airworthiness and passenger safety, “responsibilities that no licensed aircraft engineer can compromise under any circumstances”. “Unfortunately, instead of addressing long-pending professional and financial concerns, the PIA management has chosen to label lawful compliance as disruption, which is misleading,” he said, adding: “The SAEP’s stance remains consistent: safety comes first, and engineers will continue performing their duties strictly according to regulatory and procedural requirements.” On Tuesday, officials said three PIA flights to Saudi Arabia and one to Dubai left Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar airports on Tuesday after a considerable delay, leaving hund­reds of air travellers stranded at the three airports for hours. Officials added that due to the alleged “strike” by the SAEP, the national carrier had to rely on “alternative means” to ensure its flight operations. A spokesman for PIA had said the SAEP had no legal status and alleged that the main aim of this movement was to sabotage PIA’s privatisation, which was in its final stages. Similar delays occurred at nearly all major airports in the last two months due to engineers’ protests seeking a pay hike and other issues.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump endorsed former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for mayor of New York City on Monday and threatened to hold back federal funds to the city if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the mayoral election on Tuesday. Trump, a Republican who has offered frequent commentary on the New York mayoral election, injected himself further into the race by crossing party lines to support Cuomo over Mamdani and the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, who trails badly in public opinion polls in the heavily Democratic city. Cuomo, a longtime stalwart in the Democratic Party, is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary. Tuesday’s New York City election has been closely watched nationally as one that could help shape the image of the Democratic Party as it seeks its identity in opposition to Trump. Mamdani, 34, a self-described democratic socialist who is leading Cuomo in the polls, has energised younger and more progressive voters, but he has also alarmed more moderate Democrats who fear a shift too far to the left may backfire. Republicans have attacked Mamdani’s candidacy throughout the campaign, with Trump casting him as a communist. “Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Trump said a vote for Sliwa would only help Mamdani. “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home,” said Trump, a native New Yorker. The US federal government is providing $7.4 billion to New York City in fiscal year 2026, or about 6.4 per cent of the city’s total spending, according to a report from the New York State Comptroller. Trump has threatened federal funding cuts throughout his second term in office over climate initiatives, transgender policies, pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s onslaught on Gaza and diversity, equity and inclusion practices. Mamdani, a Uganda-born state assembly member, shocked political observers on June 24 with a convincing victory in the primary. Mamdani has used his campaign to rally New Yorkers against establishment candidates like Cuomo, who was elected governor of New York three times but resigned in 2021 following a report from the New York Attorney General that concluded he had sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees. A US Justice Department investigation later concluded Cuomo subjected at least 13 female state employees to a “sexually hostile work environment.” “The MAGA movement’s embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump’s understanding that this would be the best mayor for him,” Mamdani said at a campaign event following Trump’s endorsement of Cuomo. “They (Trump and Cuomo) share the same donors, they share the same small vision, they share the same sense of impunity,” Mamdani said. Mamdani’s policies include hiking taxes on New York City’s wealthiest, raising the corporation tax rate, freezing stabilised apartment rental rates and increasing publicly subsidised housing. His rise presents both risks and rewards for the national Democratic Party, which acknowledges the need to appeal to young voters but is wary of Republican attacks over Mamdani’s criticism of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories and his democratic socialism, which has concerned New York’s finance community.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States is seeking approval from the United Nations for the establishment of an International Security Force (ISF) in Gaza with a mandate of at least two years, Axios reported on Tuesday. According to the report, the US sent several UN Security Council (UNSC) members a draft resolution yesterday outlining the establishment of its proposed security force to maintain security in the Palestinian enclave. Axios , which obtained a copy of the draft, said that the resolution was designated “sensitive but unclassified”. It reported that the resolution would give the US and other participating countries a broad mandate to deploy security forces to govern Gaza until the end of 2027, and allowed the possibility of extensions beyond that time. The force would be established “in consultation with the Gaza ‘Board of Peace’”, to be chaired by US President Donald Trump, the publication reported. The Board of Peace is also to remain in place “at least through the end of 2027”. However, a US official told Axios that the ISF was to be an “enforcement force and not a peacekeeping force”. The official said that the goal was to vote to establish the force in the next few weeks and deploy the first troops to Gaza by January. The publication said the draft would serve as the basis for upcoming negotiations between UNSC members. It further said that the proposed resolution tasked the ISF with “securing Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt, protecting civilians and humanitarian corridors, and training a new Palestinian police force, with which it’s to partner in its mission”. The ISF would also “stabilise the security environment in Gaza by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” the draft stated, as well as taking on “additional tasks” as required to support the Gaza peace deal. Axios said that this suggested that the mandate included disarming Hamas if it does not do so of its own volition. The resolution further said that the ISF would deploy in Gaza “under unified command acceptable to the Board of Peace” and stressed that there would be “close consultation and cooperation with Egypt and Israel”. The proposed force would have the power “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate consistent with international law, including international humanitarian law”. According to Axios , the ISF was intended to provide security in Gaza during a transition period during which Israel would gradually withdraw from additional parts of Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority would conduct reforms that would enable it to take over Gaza longer-term. The draft resolution also called for the empowerment of the Board of Peace as “a transitional governance administration”. The draft resolution said that the board would be “supervising and supporting a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip … which shall be responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza’s civil service and administration”. It added that aid would be delivered by organisations working with the Board of Peace, including the UN, Red Cross and Red Crescent; meanwhile, any organisation that misuses or diverts this aid it will be banned“. Muslim nations’ meeting in Istanbul The establishment of the ISF is a cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement , which paved the way for the October 10 ceasefire in the Palestinian territory. The ceasefire, which halted two years of continuous bloodshed, has been tested by fresh Israeli strikes in Gaza. The ceasefire was achieved with the efforts of eight Muslim countries —Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — that worked with the Trump administration on the Gaza peace plan. Foreign ministers from seven of these countries, namely Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — met in Istanbul yesterday and agreed to back a post-war framework for Gaza, where Palest­ine’s governance and security is ensured by Palestinians. They also stressed the importance of a UN mandate for the proposed task force for stabilisation in Gaza. After the meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters that the propsoed taskforce to monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UNSC and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries would decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave. Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” Fidan said yesterday. “First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council. “And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington. Top-level consultations are reportedly also underway in Pakistan over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella.",

The force would be established “in consultation with the Gaza ‘Board of Peace’”, to be chaired by US President Donald Trump, the publication reported. The Board of Peace is also to remain in place “at least through the end of 2027”. However, a US official told Axios that the ISF was to be an “enforcement force and not a peacekeeping force”. The official said that the goal was to vote to establish the force in the next few weeks and deploy the first troops to Gaza by January. The publication said the draft would serve as the basis for upcoming negotiations between UNSC members. It further said that the proposed resolution tasked the ISF with “securing Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt, protecting civilians and humanitarian corridors, and training a new Palestinian police force, with which it’s to partner in its mission”. The ISF would also “stabilise the security environment in Gaza by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” the draft stated, as well as taking on “additional tasks” as required to support the Gaza peace deal. Axios said that this suggested that the mandate included disarming Hamas if it does not do so of its own volition. The resolution further said that the ISF would deploy in Gaza “under unified command acceptable to the Board of Peace” and stressed that there would be “close consultation and cooperation with Egypt and Israel”. The proposed force would have the power “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate consistent with international law, including international humanitarian law”. According to Axios , the ISF was intended to provide security in Gaza during a transition period during which Israel would gradually withdraw from additional parts of Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority would conduct reforms that would enable it to take over Gaza longer-term. The draft resolution also called for the empowerment of the Board of Peace as “a transitional governance administration”. The draft resolution said that the board would be “supervising and supporting a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip … which shall be responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza’s civil service and administration”. It added that aid would be delivered by organisations working with the Board of Peace, including the UN, Red Cross and Red Crescent; meanwhile, any organisation that misuses or diverts this aid it will be banned“. Muslim nations’ meeting in Istanbul The establishment of the ISF is a cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement , which paved the way for the October 10 ceasefire in the Palestinian territory. The ceasefire, which halted two years of continuous bloodshed, has been tested by fresh Israeli strikes in Gaza. The ceasefire was achieved with the efforts of eight Muslim countries —Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — that worked with the Trump administration on the Gaza peace plan. Foreign ministers from seven of these countries, namely Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — met in Istanbul yesterday and agreed to back a post-war framework for Gaza, where Palest­ine’s governance and security is ensured by Palestinians. They also stressed the importance of a UN mandate for the proposed task force for stabilisation in Gaza. After the meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters that the propsoed taskforce to monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UNSC and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries would decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave. Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” Fidan said yesterday. “First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council. “And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington. Top-level consultations are reportedly also underway in Pakistan over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella.",

      "summary": "The United States is seeking approval from the United Nations for the establishment of an International Security Force (ISF) in Gaza with a mandate of at least two years, Axios reported on Tuesday. According to the report, the US sent several UN Security Council (UNSC) members a draft resolution yesterday outlining the establishment of its proposed security force to maintain security in the Palestinian enclave. Axios , which obtained a copy of the draft, said that the resolution was designated “sensitive but unclassified”.

      "summary_orig": "Angered citizens set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it killed a man and injured his wife, resulting in some people opening fire on them, police said on Tuesday. “A garbage dumper hit a motorcyclist on Nishtar Road near Karachi Sweets, killing him,” South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn . He identified the deceased man as 23-year-old Shahzeb Shahid and his wife as Misbah. The driver, Niazullah Afzal, was arrested and taken to a police station, DIG Raza said. “The public set the dumper on fire,” the police officer said. He added that the blaze was later extinguished and 40 per cent of the vehicle was burnt. Police reached the site of the incident and the injured woman was taken to a hospital, a statement by the Karachi police’s media cell said. A first information report (FIR) was registered against the dumper driver under Sections 320 (negligent driving) and 337-G (hurt by rash or negligent driving) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the complaint of the victim’s father. As per the FIR, the father received information about the accident of Shahzeb, who had gotten married three to four months ago, at around 12 midnight. When he, along with other relatives, arrived at the hospital, his son had already expired, the complainant said. The complainant said the dumper driver was involved in rash and negligent driving. Meanwhile, police also registered a separate FIR against Liaquat Mehsood, the Sindh president of the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, and other suspects for firing on the enraged protesters. The FIR invoked Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed) and 337-H (ii) (rash or negligent act to endanger human life) against the dumpers association’s head and others. In the FIR, complainant Abdul Qadir, who introduced himself as a social worker, said he was present at Nishter Road, where the dumper had killed the man and injured his wife when the public set the heavy vehicle on fire. He claimed that at around 3:30am, Mehsood arrived with 20-25 people, including two to three armed men, who resorted to firing and fled. The armed men continued firing while fleeing, the complainant said. The social worker said he wanted to initiate legal proceedings against Mehsood and other unidentified persons for open firing. On the other hand, in a statement shared on Mehsood’s Facebook account, the dumpers’ association claimed people opened fire at the official’s car and attempted to set it on fire. The association’s spokesperson threatened to block the Super Highway in protest at 2pm if a case was not registered over the incident. Rise in heavy vehicle accidents In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumpers and water tankers. Nearly 500 people lost their lives and 4,879 were injured in 2024 in road accidents resulting from various reasons, from reckless driving to construction activities, hospital data showed . On October 12, a reckless dumper driver smashed into six vehicles , including three ambulances of the Edhi Foundation, near Merewether Clock Tower, killing a man and injuring two others. The driver, who possessed a “fake” licence, was arrested. On August 10, two siblings were killed and their father was injured when a dumper truck ran over them on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall. A mob then set seven trucks on fire, which sparked protests from transporters. August 15 recorded two accidents involving heavy vehicles, including one where a speeding water tanker ran over and killed a four-year-old boy in Orangi Town. In another accident, a young couple lost their lives when a fast-moving dumper truck hit their motorcycle in the Sultanabad area on M.T. Khan Road.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Uzbekistan Embassy in Islamabad on Monday announced the expansion of its flight operations to Pakistan, enhancing connectivity between the two countries and reducing travel time from Islamabad to Tashkent to just two hours. “Direct flights have cut travel time significantly, especially when layovers in Dubai have been eliminated,” an official from the Uzbekistan Embassy told Dawn . Uzbekistan Airways, the national carrier of the Republic of Uzbekistan, now operates a total of four weekly flights between Uzbekistan and Pakistan, doubling the frequency of its Tashkent–Islamabad service while continuing its regular Tashkent–Lahore flights. According to Uzbekistan Airways, the decision to expand services was driven by strong passenger demand, as previous Islamabad flights often operated at full capacity and tickets sold out days in advance. “Tashkent–Islamabad–Tashkent” flights operate twice weekly, every Tuesday and Saturday, while “Tashkent–Lahore–Tashkent” flights operate twice weekly, every Wednesday and Friday. The embassy said that with this expansion, Uzbekistan Airways has strengthened its role as a key bridge between Central and South Asia, offering Pakistani travelers greater choice, convenience, and connectivity to destinations across the world. Flights from Tashkent to Islamabad take around two hours, providing a fast and efficient link between the two capitals. One-way fares start at approximately $200, while round-trip tickets are available from $400, making this route one of the most affordable and time-saving options for business, education, and leisure travelers alike. The embassy added that the “Tashkent–Lahore” route is equally attractive, with one-way fares from about $200 and round-trip fares from $400. All flights are operated on modern, comfortable aircraft, ensuring passengers enjoy world-class onboard service, professional crews, and the highest safety standards. Tashkent International Airport, the airline’s primary hub, is strategically positioned at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, offering passengers efficient connections and a comfortable travel experience. Beyond direct travel between Pakistan and Uzbekistan, the airport serves as a strategic transit hub, connecting travelers to over 50 international destinations across Europe, North America, the Middle East, East Asia and Southeast Asia. Passengers flying via Tashkent can enjoy smooth transit connections to major global cities including Istanbul, Frankfurt, Paris, London, New York, Moscow, Dubai, Tokyo, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, Baku, Astana, Batumi and many more. According to the embassy, this extensive network makes Uzbekistan Airways an increasingly popular choice for Pakistani travelers seeking both regional and long-haul connections, combining competitive pricing with superior comfort and efficiency. The embassy said that Uzbekistan and Pakistan share centuries-old historical, cultural and spiritual ties rooted in the heritage of the Silk Road and Islamic civilization. The enhanced air links will further strengthen tourism, trade and people-to-people exchanges between the two brotherly nations. For Pakistani tourists, Uzbekistan offers a gateway to the legendary Silk Road cities of Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva and Kokand. The embassy added that Uzbek visitors are increasingly drawn to Pakistan’s diverse landscapes, historic landmarks and renowned hospitality. Enhanced air links will make it easier for companies, students, and families to connect, while boosting mutual investment and tourism growth. Published in Dawn, November 4th, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Injectable polio vaccine debuted in Punjab",
      "summary_orig": "• Provides better protection than oral variety • Children up to 15 to be immunised as older kids now identified as key to transmission • Drive to be extended to other high-risk urban centres, such as Karachi, Hyderabad • Police rescue polio team detained at private school ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Health auth­orities in Punjab on Monday launched a massive Extended-Age Fractional IPV Campaign, aiming to vaccinate up to 2 million children with an injectable polio vaccine as part of a critical effort to eradicate the virus from its last reservoir in the region. The campaign, which will run until Nov 12, targets children aged 4 months to 15 years, across 122 high-risk union councils (UCs) in Lahore. Officials hope the drive will interrupt the transmission of poliovirus detected in the city’s environmental samples, a key step toward declaring the entire province polio-free. The fractional inactivated polio vaccine (fIPV) campaign was formally launched by Punjab Minister for Health and Popu­lation Khwaja Imran Nazeer and Health & Pop­u­lation Department Secretary Nadia Saqib. The initiative follows a recommendation from the global Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio, which identified that while children under 5 are mostly protected, the virus is now being spread by older, unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children. “Our priority is to remain vigilant and continue building population immunity until transmission ends everywhere in Pakistan,” Mr Nazeer said at the launch ceremony. “Children who repeatedly miss vaccination remain our biggest vulnerability. Every single child must be vaccinated in every campaign.” The campaign is a significant logistical undertaking, with approximately 10,848 frontline workers participating. This force includes 2,700 skilled vaccinators, 2,700 team assistants, 4,800 community mobilisers, 496 area in charges and 122 UC medical officers. Former health minister Dr Nadeem Jan, while talking to Dawn , called the decision a positive step that should have been taken much earlier. “IPV enhances individual protection of a child and further transmission of virus through child is stopped,” Mr Jan said. “Moreover it also saves child from chances of vaccine derived paralysis and keeps child safe.” He recommended that at least two or three similar rounds should be held in each targeted block to fully eradicate the virus. Lahore is considered the only remaining polio reservoir in Punjab. According to a polio programme expert, DNA sampling indicates the virus circulating in Punjab has not travelled from other hotspot areas like southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “It has been decided to start with Laho­­re as if Lahore block will be cured the whole Punjab province will be declared polio free,” the expert said, noting that South KP remains a more problematic area. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) remains in a child’s gut and stops the further spread of the virus, while the injectable polio vaccine (IPV) offers complete protection from infection. TAG suggested using IPV in reservoirs that were less severely affected. Secretary Saqib emphasised that the fIPV provides an essential boost to immunity. “The fIPV provides an additional layer of protection by boosting immunity, especially where environmental virus detections are recorded,” she said. She highlighted that Punjab has already conducted four national immunisation ca­­mpaigns this year. However, the campaign faces significant challenges. Officials acknowledged there is resistance to injectable vaccines, similar to what was encountered during a recent HPV vaccine drive. There is also a limited supply of equipment, with only 4,000 specialised injectors available, each costing $500. Following the Lahore campaign, similar drives are plan­ned for other high-risk ur­­ban blocks, including Karachi, Hydera­bad and Chaman. Polio workers rescued Separately, police on Monday rescued a group of female polio workers who were attacked and detained by staff at a private school in Gulberg Town, Lahore. The health workers had arrived at the school in Union Council 31 to administer polio vaccines to children when the confrontation occurred. The school’s management refused to allow the vaccinations and the workers were assaulted and locked in a room. One of the workers sustained a head injury, and others were reportedly beaten when they attempted to help their colleague. Video clips later emerged showing the women crying and pleading for help during the incident. The police response was swift following the Punjab CM’s intervention, which included instructions to apprehend the suspects and pursue criminal charges.

The campaign, which will run until Nov 12, targets children aged 4 months to 15 years, across 122 high-risk union councils (UCs) in Lahore. Officials hope the drive will interrupt the transmission of poliovirus detected in the city’s environmental samples, a key step toward declaring the entire province polio-free. The fractional inactivated polio vaccine (fIPV) campaign was formally launched by Punjab Minister for Health and Popu­lation Khwaja Imran Nazeer and Health & Pop­u­lation Department Secretary Nadia Saqib. The initiative follows a recommendation from the global Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio, which identified that while children under 5 are mostly protected, the virus is now being spread by older, unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children. “Our priority is to remain vigilant and continue building population immunity until transmission ends everywhere in Pakistan,” Mr Nazeer said at the launch ceremony. “Children who repeatedly miss vaccination remain our biggest vulnerability. Every single child must be vaccinated in every campaign.” The campaign is a significant logistical undertaking, with approximately 10,848 frontline workers participating. This force includes 2,700 skilled vaccinators, 2,700 team assistants, 4,800 community mobilisers, 496 area in charges and 122 UC medical officers. Former health minister Dr Nadeem Jan, while talking to Dawn , called the decision a positive step that should have been taken much earlier. “IPV enhances individual protection of a child and further transmission of virus through child is stopped,” Mr Jan said. “Moreover it also saves child from chances of vaccine derived paralysis and keeps child safe.” He recommended that at least two or three similar rounds should be held in each targeted block to fully eradicate the virus. Lahore is considered the only remaining polio reservoir in Punjab. According to a polio programme expert, DNA sampling indicates the virus circulating in Punjab has not travelled from other hotspot areas like southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “It has been decided to start with Laho­­re as if Lahore block will be cured the whole Punjab province will be declared polio free,” the expert said, noting that South KP remains a more problematic area. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) remains in a child’s gut and stops the further spread of the virus, while the injectable polio vaccine (IPV) offers complete protection from infection. TAG suggested using IPV in reservoirs that were less severely affected. Secretary Saqib emphasised that the fIPV provides an essential boost to immunity. “The fIPV provides an additional layer of protection by boosting immunity, especially where environmental virus detections are recorded,” she said. She highlighted that Punjab has already conducted four national immunisation ca­­mpaigns this year. However, the campaign faces significant challenges. Officials acknowledged there is resistance to injectable vaccines, similar to what was encountered during a recent HPV vaccine drive. There is also a limited supply of equipment, with only 4,000 specialised injectors available, each costing $500. Following the Lahore campaign, similar drives are plan­ned for other high-risk ur­­ban blocks, including Karachi, Hydera­bad and Chaman. Polio workers rescued Separately, police on Monday rescued a group of female polio workers who were attacked and detained by staff at a private school in Gulberg Town, Lahore. The health workers had arrived at the school in Union Council 31 to administer polio vaccines to children when the confrontation occurred. The school’s management refused to allow the vaccinations and the workers were assaulted and locked in a room. One of the workers sustained a head injury, and others were reportedly beaten when they attempted to help their colleague.

Turkiye wants to see a post-war framework for Gaza in which “Palestinians ensure Palestine’s governance and security,” Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters after a meeting in Istanbul involving Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Turkiye. Brokered by US President Donald Trump, the October 10 ceasefire — which halted two years of continuous bloodshed — has been tested by fresh Israeli strikes in civilians in Gaza. Mr Fidan said the taskforce that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UN Security Council and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries will decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave. He said it was crucial that the emerging International Stabilisa­tion Force that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire under Trump’s plan, have a “mandate defined by a UN Security Council resolution and a framework for legitimacy”. Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” he said. It may be noted that top-level consultations are reportedly underway in Pakistan as well over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force , and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella. “First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council. “And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Mr Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington. Israel has long viewed Turkey’s diplomatic overtures with suspicion over Ankara’s close ties with Hamas and adamantly opposes it joining the task force that is meant to take over after Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza. “Our principle is that Palestinians should govern the Palestinians and ensure their own security, the international community should support this in the best possible way – diplomatically, institutionally and economically,” Mr Fidan said. “Nobody wants to see a new system of tutelage emerge,” he said. “We’ve now reached an extremely critical stage: we do not want the genocide in Gaza to resume,” Mr Fidan added, saying all seven nations supported plans for the Palestinians to take control of Gaza’s security and governance. Mr Fidan, who also held talks at the weekend with a Hamas delegation led by its chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, said the movement was “ready to hand Gaza to a committee of Palestinians”. He also expressed hope that reconciliation efforts between Hamas and the rival West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, “will bear fruit as soon as possible,” saying inter-Palestinian unity would “strengthen Palestine’s representation in the international community”. Hamas in compliance Earlier on Monday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Hamas appeared committed to the truce, pointing the finger of blame at Israel. “It seems Hamas is quite determined to adhere to the agreement while Israel’s record is very poor,” he told an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) gathering in Istanbul, saying Muslim states should play “a leading role” in Gaza’s recovery. “At this point, we need to deliver more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza and then begin reconstruction efforts. “The Israeli government is doing everything in its power to prevent this,” Mr Erdogan said. He also urged Muslim states to play “a leading role” in Gaza’s recovery. “We believe the reconstruction plan prepared by the Arab League and the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) should be implemented immediately,” he said of the plan unveiled in March. Ceasefire violations denounced Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, along with other “Arab-Islamic foreign ministers”, deliberated on the way forward for a lasting ceasefire and sustainable peace in Gaza. “The leaders jointly called for urgent humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, condemned Israeli ceasefire violations, demanded Israel’s withdrawal from the Occupied Palestinian Territory and emphasised the rebuilding of Gaza,” the statement added. “Pakistan reaffirmed its principled stance for the establishment of an independent, viable and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line with the UN and OIC resolutions,” it said.

      "summary_orig": "• ISPR chief rejects reports regarding US drone operations • Warns India against ‘false flag operation’ in deep waters • Says decision to join Gaza peacekeeping force will be made by govt ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Monday adopted a tougher stance toward the Taliban regime ahead of the next round of talks in Istanbul , declaring that Pakistan’s only and non-negotiable demand is an end to terrorism emanating from Afghan territory. “The conditions that Afghan Taliban keep putting forward are meaningless, what matters is the end of terrorism,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s spokesman, while briefing a group of journalists at Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). “Pakistan has a one-point agenda: Afghan soil must not be used against us,” he asserted. Gen Chaudhry’s remarks came as Islamabad prepares for the Nov 6 meeting in Turkiye, the next phase of negotiations following last month’s six-day talks in Istanbul between Pakistan and the Taliban regime. Those talks, mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, produced a reaffirmation by both sides to ceasefire agreed in Doha and an agreement on establishing a monitoring and verification mechanism for cross-border terrorism, though implementation details remain unresolved. Ahead of the upcoming Istanbul talks, Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah also held consultations with his negotiators, led by Mullah Najib, to deliberate on the next phase of dialogue with Pakistan, according to sources familiar with the discussions in Kandahar. During his briefing, the military’s spokesperson highlighted that operations were underway against terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned TTP — with 1,667 terrorists killed. Gen Chaudhry disclosed that 206 Afghan Taliban fighters and 112 TTP terrorists were killed during the recent border tensions. Pointing to growing participation of Afghans in TTP and subsequent blurring of lines between the two groups, he said about 60 per cent of the terrorists killed during infiltration attempts in the last three to four months were Afghan nationals. Afghan Tailban’s support to TTP “The TTP is not a separate entity, it is a branch of the Afghan Taliban,” Gen Chaudhry observed, explaining that the outfit had sworn allegiance to the Taliban’s emir, “and we have clear evidence that the Taliban are settling TTP fighters in densely populated areas to provide them a protective shield”. He added that while Pakistan continues efforts to settle matters peacefully with Afghanistan, “there can be no compromise on our security and sovereignty”. The spokesman dismissed recent Taliban statements suggesting preconditions for dialogue, including demands that Pakistan end alleged support for the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP) and anti-Taliban propaganda. “Such conditions are meaningless. The only meaningful step is verifiable action against terrorists,” he said. US drone operations He categorically denied reports in “Afghan and Indian media” about a supposed secret US-Pakistan understanding allowing American drone operations in Afghanistan. “This is fake news propagated by Zabihullah Mujahid,” the Taliban spokesman, he said. “Pakistan has not given permission to the US or any other country to use its territory for attacks inside Afghanistan. These claims are baseless propaganda.” Pakistani officials view the Istanbul process as a test of the Taliban’s credibility. A senior security source said last week that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action including dismantling of hideouts, disruption of logistical networks, and arrests of TTP leadership.” False flag operation The military spokesman warned that India was planning a “false flag” operation in the maritime domain to fabricate evidence of a major Pakistani strike or act of aggression, potentially triggering a new round of tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals. Gen Chaudhry, citing intelligence reports, indicated India could stage the incident “in deep waters,” portraying it as a Pakistani attack to justify escalation and malign Islamabad internationally. He said Pakistan’s armed forces were on “high alert” and would deliver a “far stronger, more decisive, and severe” response than in previous incidents if provoked. Security observers say the military’s unusually pointed warning coincides with several converging developments that Pakistan views as provocative or politically timed including India’s Trishul exercise, Bihar state elections, and regional tensions. Last Saturday, the government released a video confession by Ijaz Mallah, a fisherman from Sindh who had been detained by Indian forces in 2024. In the video, Malah claims he was coerced by India’s external intelligence agency, RAW, to engage in espionage-related activities in Pakistan. ISPR officials cited the testimony as partial evidence of Indian maritime sabotage plans, connecting it to what they describe as a “covert Indian terror network” disrupted earlier this year. Gaza peace force The military spokesman said that any decision regarding the deployment of Pakistani troops to a proposed Gaza peacekeeping force would be made by the government and parliament. His comments came amid reports that Pakistan is weighing a potential contribution of troops to an International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza. The proposed mission could also include disarmament and security enforcement tasks, which have drawn criticism from opposition parties. They argue the government has not held a full parliamentary debate and warn that participation without clear UN oversight could risk Pakistan’s complicity in coercive actions against Palestinians.

A senior security source said last week that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action including dismantling of hideouts, disruption of logistical networks, and arrests of TTP leadership.” False flag operation The military spokesman warned that India was planning a “false flag” operation in the maritime domain to fabricate evidence of a major Pakistani strike or act of aggression, potentially triggering a new round of tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals. Gen Chaudhry, citing intelligence reports, indicated India could stage the incident “in deep waters,” portraying it as a Pakistani attack to justify escalation and malign Islamabad internationally. He said Pakistan’s armed forces were on “high alert” and would deliver a “far stronger, more decisive, and severe” response than in previous incidents if provoked. Security observers say the military’s unusually pointed warning coincides with several converging developments that Pakistan views as provocative or politically timed including India’s Trishul exercise, Bihar state elections, and regional tensions. Last Saturday, the government released a video confession by Ijaz Mallah, a fisherman from Sindh who had been detained by Indian forces in 2024. In the video, Malah claims he was coerced by India’s external intelligence agency, RAW, to engage in espionage-related activities in Pakistan. ISPR officials cited the testimony as partial evidence of Indian maritime sabotage plans, connecting it to what they describe as a “covert Indian terror network” disrupted earlier this year. Gaza peace force The military spokesman said that any decision regarding the deployment of Pakistani troops to a proposed Gaza peacekeeping force would be made by the government and parliament. His comments came amid reports that Pakistan is weighing a potential contribution of troops to an International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza. The proposed mission could also include disarmament and security enforcement tasks, which have drawn criticism from opposition parties. They argue the government has not held a full parliamentary debate and warn that participation without clear UN oversight could risk Pakistan’s complicity in coercive actions against Palestinians.

      "title": "Demand to end terror from Afghan soil ‘non-negotiable’: army",
      "summary": "• ISPR chief rejects reports regarding US drone operations • Warns India against ‘false flag operation’ in deep waters • Says decision to join Gaza peacekeeping force will be made by govt ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Monday adopted a tougher stance toward the Taliban regime ahead of the next round of talks in Istanbul , declaring that Pakistan’s only and non-negotiable demand is an end to terrorism emanating from Afghan territory. “The conditions that Afghan Taliban keep putting forward are meaningless, what matters is the end of terrorism,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s spokesman, while briefing a group of journalists at Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). “Pakistan has a one-point agenda: Afghan soil must not be used against us,” he asserted. Gen Chaudhry’s remarks came as Islamabad prepares for the Nov 6 meeting in Turkiye, the next phase of negotiations following last month’s six-day talks in Istanbul between Pakistan and the Taliban regime. Those talks, mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, produced a reaffirmation by both sides to ceasefire agreed in Doha and an agreement on establishing a monitoring and verification mechanism for cross-border terrorism, though implementation details remain unresolved. Ahead of the upcoming Istanbul talks, Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah also held consultations with his negotiators, led by Mullah Najib, to deliberate on the next phase of dialogue with Pakistan, according to sources familiar with the discussions in Kandahar. During his briefing, the military’s spokesperson highlighted that operations were underway against terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned TTP — with 1,667 terrorists killed. Gen Chaudhry disclosed that 206 Afghan Taliban fighters and 112 TTP terrorists were killed during the recent border tensions. Pointing to growing participation of Afghans in TTP and subsequent blurring of lines between the two groups, he said about 60 per cent of the terrorists killed during infiltration attempts in the last three to four months were Afghan nationals. Afghan Tailban’s support to TTP “The TTP is not a separate entity, it is a branch of the Afghan Taliban,” Gen Chaudhry observed, explaining that the outfit had sworn allegiance to the Taliban’s emir, “and we have clear evidence that the Taliban are settling TTP fighters in densely populated areas to provide them a protective shield”. He added that while Pakistan continues efforts to settle matters peacefully with Afghanistan, “there can be no compromise on our security and sovereignty”. The spokesman dismissed recent Taliban statements suggesting preconditions for dialogue, including demands that Pakistan end alleged support for the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP) and anti-Taliban propaganda. “Such conditions are meaningless. The only meaningful step is verifiable action against terrorists,” he said. US drone operations He categorically denied reports in “Afghan and Indian media” about a supposed secret US-Pakistan understanding allowing American drone operations in Afghanistan. “This is fake news propagated by Zabihullah Mujahid,” the Taliban spokesman, he said. “Pakistan has not given permission to the US or any other country to use its territory for attacks inside Afghanistan.
