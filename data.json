      "title_orig": "Any military escalation involving Iran could destabilise Gulf region, South Asia, Western Asia: President Zardari",
      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday appreciated efforts for easing tensions and promoting regional peace, warning that any military escalation involving Iran could destabilise the Gulf region, South Asia and Western Asia. He said this while addressing a ceremony hosted by the Iranian embassy in Islamabad on the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. “Any instability involving Iran, or any attempt to resolve issues through military means, carries grave risks. Such actions could … undermine global peace, and cause serious harm to the global economy. The stakes are far too high for confrontation,” Zardari said. He further stated that Pakistan opposed unilateral sanctions and coercive measures, including against Iran, and believed that “peaceful engagement best serves regional and global security”. “Pakistan welcomes efforts aimed at easing tensions and encourages continued dialogue among relevant parties in a constructive spirit, with the objective of promoting peace and stability in the region,” he added. Earlier, the president requested the participants of the ceremony to observe one minute of silence in the memory of victims of the recent blast in Islamabad , and the tragedies in Iran. “Let’s pray that wars never come to us,” he said. Referring to ongoing conflicts, terrorism, external interference and unresolved regional flashpoints in the region, the president said Pakistan firmly believed that such challenges could not be addressed through force or unilateral actions. He also emphasised that Pakistan and Iran shared responsibilities as neighbouring countries and remained committed to cooperating on border management, counter-terrorism and “turning the shared frontier into a zone of cooperation, lawful trade and development”. The president stressed that Pakistan valued balanced relations globally and was ready to play a constructive role in promoting restraint, dialogue and regional peace. He extended his warm congratulations to the leadership and people of Iran. “May our partnership continue to grow, and may our region move towards security, stability and shared prosperity,” he said. The president added Pakistan and Iran were not just neighbours, but also “civilisational partners”. “Our shared border reflects centuries of interaction, coexistence and mutual respect,” he stated. “Our relationship is rooted in faith, history and enduring cultural bonds that continue to shape our region.” He noted that the Persian language and its great literary tradition had profoundly influenced Pakistan’s intellectual life, adding that for hundreds of years, it was the official language of some of the regions that were now a part of Pakistan. “Its influence remains deeply embedded in our national consciousness. Pakistan’s national anthem itself reflects the deep imprint of the Persian language on our collective identity,” he stated. The president remembered Sachal Sarmast, a renowned 18th-century poet in Sindh, on the occasion, saying that he composed poetry in Persian, which reflected “a shared spiritual and philosophical space”. “Poets and thinkers such as Rumi, Hafiz, Saadi and Ferdowsi are widely respected in Pakistan, while Iqbal, who wrote much of his work in Persian, remains a shared symbol of dignity and renewal for both our societies,” he added. In his welcome address, Iranian Ambassador Reza Amiri Moghadam said that despite facing various external pressures and challenges, Iran had made remarkable progress in key sectors, including technology, defence, science and the economy. He noted that the Iranian nation had “consistently demonstrated resilience and self-reliance”, turning challenges into opportunities and continuing its journey of development with determination. Moghadam said that Iran did “not seek war and believes in resolving disputes through dialogue and diplomacy”. However, he made it clear that if a war broke out, Iran would “fully retaliate in defence of its sovereignty”. The ambassador appreciated the government and people of Pakistan for their support, particularly during “Israeli aggression against Iran”.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least four policemen, including a station house officer (SHO), were martyred on Wednesday as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area, police said. According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. The operation was conducted in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Nawab police station following intelligence reports about militants’ presence in the area, it said, adding that the area was cordoned off before the search operation was initiated. While the police party was returning, militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire, the statement said. Four policemen were martyred in the attack and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire. The officers who lost their lives included SHO Faheem Mumtaz, Constable Irfan Khan, Constable Ghulam Subhani, and Constable Wajahat, the statement said. Paharpur Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police Hafiz Adnan and Assistant Sub-Inspector Tariq were injured in the attack. A police spokesperson earlier said that the martyrs and the wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital for treatment. Following the incident, the spokesperson said, a heavy contingent of police, led by District Police Officer Sajad Ahmed Sahebzada, reached the scene and launched clearance a search operation to apprehend the militants. The police statement said that the area had been sealed off and the search and clearance operation was under way. It added that efforts were being made to recover the bodies of the slain militants from the forest area, while security in nearby localities has been further tightened. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack. “Eliminating the cancer of terrorism sponsored from abroad from the country is the topmost priority,” the president was quoted as saying. The statement added that he extended his prayers to the martyrs’ families and wished the wounded a swift recovery. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took notice of the incident and strongly condemned it. In a statement, he paid tribute to the sacrifices of the martyred personnel. “The provincial government will provide all possible assistance to the affected families,” he said. He further said that the KP police were at the frontline in the fight against terrorism. “Terrorism is a common challenge for the entire country. Actions against elements hostile to peace will be further intensified in the province,” he said. He said police morale could not be dampened by such cowardly acts. CM Afridi said that a comprehensive and effective strategy was essential for the complete eradication of terrorism. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi expressed deep sorrow over the attack. He said he was saddened by the deaths of the police personnel and praised the bravery and sacrifice of Dera Ismail Khan police in protecting the public and the nation. The governor also directed that all possible medical care be provided to the injured officers and prayed for their speedy recovery. PTI’s Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, the former chief minister of the province, also expressed profound grief over the incident, stating that the officers laid down their lives in defence of the country and the people. He prayed for the swift recovery of the injured officers and extended his condolences to the families of the martyred personnel, while praying for the elevation of the martyrs’ ranks.",

The operation was conducted in the jurisdiction of Shaheed Nawab police station following intelligence reports about militants’ presence in the area, it said, adding that the area was cordoned off before the search operation was initiated. While the police party was returning, militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire, the statement said. Four policemen were martyred in the attack and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire. The officers who lost their lives included SHO Faheem Mumtaz, Constable Irfan Khan, Constable Ghulam Subhani, and Constable Wajahat, the statement said. Paharpur Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police Hafiz Adnan and Assistant Sub-Inspector Tariq were injured in the attack. A police spokesperson earlier said that the martyrs and the wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Teaching Hospital for treatment.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Wednesday, with the latter expected to press him to widen talks with Iran to include limits on Tehran’s missile arsenal and other security threats beyond its nuclear programme. In his seventh meeting with Trump since the president returned to office nearly 13 months ago, Netanyahu was looking to influence the next round of US discussions with Iran following nuclear negotiations held in Oman last Friday. Trump threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war. He has repeatedly voiced support for a secure Israel, a longstanding US ally and arch-foe of Iran. In media interviews on Tuesday, Trump reiterated his warning, saying that while he believes Iran wants a deal, he would do “something very tough” if it refused. Trump says no to Iranian nuclear weapons, missiles Trump told Fox Business that a good deal with Iran would mean “no nuclear weapons, no missiles,” without elaborating. He also told Axios he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier strike group as part of a major US buildup near Iran. Israel was concerned that the US might pursue a narrow nuclear deal that does not include restrictions on Iran’s ballistic missile programme or an end to Iranian support for armed proxies, according to people familiar with the matter. Israeli officials have urged the US not to trust Iran’s promises. “I will present to the president our perceptions of the principles in the negotiations,” Netanyahu told reporters before departing for the US. The two leaders could also discuss potential military action if diplomacy with Iran fails, one source said. Iran said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions, but ruled out linking the issue to missiles. “The Islamic republic’s missile capabilities are non-negotiable ,” Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said on Wednesday. Netanyahu’s arrival at the White House was lower-key than usual. He entered the building away from the view of reporters and cameras, and a White House official then confirmed he was inside meeting with Trump. Gaza on the agenda Also on the agenda was Gaza, with Trump looking to push ahead with a ceasefire agreement he helped to broker. Progress on his 20-point plan to end the war and rebuild the shattered Palestinian enclave stalled, with major gaps over steps such as Hamas disarming as Israeli troops withdraw in phases. Netanyahu’s visit, originally scheduled for February 18, was brought forward amid renewed US engagement with Iran. Both sides at last week’s Oman meeting said the talks were positive and further talks were expected soon. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said ahead of the Oman meeting that negotiations would need to address Iran’s missiles, its proxy groups, and its treatment of its own population. Iran said Friday’s talks focused only on nuclear issues. Trump has been vague about broadening the negotiations. He was quoted as telling Axios on Tuesday that it was a “no-brainer” for any deal to cover Iran’s nuclear programme, but that he also thought it possible to address its missile stockpiles. Iran says its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes, while the US and Israel have previously accused it of past efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Last June, the US joined Israel’s strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during a 12-day war. Israel also heavily damaged Iran’s air defences and missile arsenal. Two Israeli officials say there are signs Iran is working to restore those capabilities. Trump threatened last month to intervene militarily during a crackdown on anti-government protests in Iran, but ultimately held off. Israel wary of a weakened Iran rebuilding Tehran’s regional influence was weakened by the 12-day war, losses suffered by proxies in the region and the ousting of its ally, former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. But Israel was wary of its adversaries rebuilding after the multi-front war, triggered by Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel. While Trump and Netanyahu have mostly been in sync and the US remains Israel’s main arms supplier, Wednesday’s meeting could expose tensions. Part of Trump’s Gaza plan held out the prospect for eventual Palestinian statehood, which Netanyahu and his coalition — the most far-right in Israel’s history — have long resisted . Netanyahu’s security cabinet on Sunday authorised steps that would make it easier for Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank to buy land while granting Israel broader powers in what the Palestinians see as the heartland of a future state. The decision drew international condemnation . “I am against annexation,” Trump told Axios , reiterating his stance. “We have enough things to think about now.”",

      "summary_orig": "Prolific India opener Abhishek Sharma was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday after being treated for an upset stomach, teammate Tilak Varma told reporters. The explosive left-hander is an integral part of India’s T20 World Cup title defence and is doubtful for the Group A fixture against Namibia on Thursday in New Delhi. “He has been discharged today and he is doing well,” Varma, an attacking batter, told reporters on the eve of the match at Delhi’s Arun Jaitley Stadium. “We have got one more day for the game. Hopefully, we decide by tomorrow on how he feels and we’ll go with it.” The 25-year-old was admitted to a Delhi hospital on Tuesday with a stomach issue he had carried since their opening win on Saturday, an official told AFP on condition of anonymity. Abhishek was out for a duck in India’s win over the United States. India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah is expected to return for the second group match after he missed the opener due to having a fever, Varma said. India will move on after the Namibia match to Colombo, where they face a blockbuster clash against Pakistan on Sunday. The Pakistan government late Monday ended a week-long stand-off by reversing its order for the cricket team to boycott the big game due to political reasons. “We are actually excited to play (against Pakistan),” said the 23-year-old Varma. “We were already prepared for the game even before we got to know about it a couple of days back. We are in match zone now.” The explosive left-hander is key to India’s chances of defending their title at the 20-team tournament and is doubtful for the Group A fixture on Thursday in New Delhi.",

      "summary_orig": "Ten people including the shooter are dead after an assailant opened fire at a high school in western Canada on Tuesday in one of the country’s deadliest mass casualty events in recent history. The outburst brought to Canada the type of mass shooting more common in the neighbouring United States, and was carried out by a shooter described as female, police said. Six people were found dead inside a high school in the town of Tumbler Ridge in British Columbia, two more people were found dead at a residence believed to be connected to the incident, and another person died on the way to hospital, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. At least two other people were hospitalised with serious or life-threatening injuries, and as many as 25 people were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said. A suspected shooter was also found dead from what appears to be a self-inflicted injury, police said, adding they did not believe there were any more suspects or an ongoing threat to the public. “It’s hard to know what to say on a night like tonight. It’s the kind of thing that feels like it happens in other places and not close to home,” British Columbia Premier David Eby told reporters. Police released almost no details about the shooter except to say the person was described as a female — potentially an unusual development as mass shootings in North America are almost always carried out by men. A police active shooter alert said the suspect was described “as female in a dress with brown hair.” Police Superintendent Ken Floyd later confirmed at a news conference that the suspect described in the alert was the same person found dead in the school. Police did not say how many of the victims may have been minors. Tumbler Ridge student Darian Quist told the public broadcaster CBC that he was in his mechanics class when there was an announcement that the school was in lockdown. He said that initially he “didn’t think anything was going on,” but started receiving “disturbing” photos about the carnage at the school. Then “it set in what was happening”, Quist said. He said he stayed in lockdown for more than two hours when police stormed in, ordering everyone to put their hands up before escorting them out of the school. Darian’s mother Shelley Quist, also interviewed, said she embraced her son when they finally connected after the site was declared safe. “He’s not going to be out of my sight for a while now,” she told the CBC . ‘Tight-knit community’ Tumbler Ridge is a remote municipality with a population of around 2,400 people in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in northern British Columbia, approximately 1,155 km (717 miles) northeast of Vancouver. Images of the town show a snow-covered landscape filled with pine trees. Tumbler Ridge Secondary School has 160 students in grades seven through 12, roughly ages 12 to 18, according to its website. The school was closed for the rest of the week and counselling will be made available to those in need, school officials said. Officials said the town’s small police force was on the scene within two minutes of receiving a call, and that victims were still being assessed hours after the incident. “This is a small, tight-knit community with a small RCMP detachment as well, who responded in two minutes, no doubt saving lives today,” Nina Krieger, British Columbia’s public safety minister, told reporters. ‘Horrific violence’ In response to the shooting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney postponed a planned announcement in Halifax on Wednesday for a new Defence Industrial Strategy and subsequent trip to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, a spokesperson said. “I am devastated by todays horrific shootings in Tumbler Ridge, B.C. My prayers and deepest condolences are with the families and friends who have lost loved ones to these horrific acts of violence,” Carney said on X. British Columbia Premier David Eby called the violence “unimaginable”. The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history. In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a gas station about 90 km (60 miles) from the site of his first killings. In Canada’s worst school shooting, in December 1989, a gunman killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, before committing suicide. Pakistan offers condolences Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan stood in solidarity with the people and the government of Canada during this difficult time. Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said he was deeply saddened to learn about the incident. “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families and convey our profound sympathies to the people and government of Canada,” he said. “We pray for the swift and full recovery of those injured, and for strength and solace for the families who have lost their loved ones,” he said.",

In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a gas station about 90 km (60 miles) from the site of his first killings.

      "title": "10 dead after shooter opens fire at high school in Canada",
      "summary": "Ten people including the shooter are dead after an assailant opened fire at a high school in western Canada on Tuesday in one of the country’s deadliest mass casualty events in recent history. The outburst brought to Canada the type of mass shooting more common in the neighbouring United States, and was carried out by a shooter described as female, police said. Six people were found dead inside a high school in the town of Tumbler Ridge in British Columbia, two more people were found dead at a residence believed to be connected to the incident, and another person died on the way to hospital, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. At least two other people were hospitalised with serious or life-threatening injuries, and as many as 25 people were being treated for non-life-threatening injuries, police said. A suspected shooter was also found dead from what appears to be a self-inflicted injury, police said, adding they did not believe there were any more suspects or an ongoing threat to the public. “It’s hard to know what to say on a night like tonight. It’s the kind of thing that feels like it happens in other places and not close to home,” British Columbia Premier David Eby told reporters. Police released almost no details about the shooter except to say the person was described as a female — potentially an unusual development as mass shootings in North America are almost always carried out by men. A police active shooter alert said the suspect was described “as female in a dress with brown hair.” Police Superintendent Ken Floyd later confirmed at a news conference that the suspect described in the alert was the same person found dead in the school. Police did not say how many of the victims may have been minors. Tumbler Ridge student Darian Quist told the public broadcaster CBC that he was in his mechanics class when there was an announcement that the school was in lockdown. He said that initially he “didn’t think anything was going on,” but started receiving “disturbing” photos about the carnage at the school. Then “it set in what was happening”, Quist said. He said he stayed in lockdown for more than two hours when police stormed in, ordering everyone to put their hands up before escorting them out of the school. Darian’s mother Shelley Quist, also interviewed, said she embraced her son when they finally connected after the site was declared safe. “He’s not going to be out of my sight for a while now,” she told the CBC . ‘Tight-knit community’ Tumbler Ridge is a remote municipality with a population of around 2,400 people in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in northern British Columbia, approximately 1,155 km (717 miles) northeast of Vancouver. Images of the town show a snow-covered landscape filled with pine trees. Tumbler Ridge Secondary School has 160 students in grades seven through 12, roughly ages 12 to 18, according to its website. The school was closed for the rest of the week and counselling will be made available to those in need, school officials said. Officials said the town’s small police force was on the scene within two minutes of receiving a call, and that victims were still being assessed hours after the incident. “This is a small, tight-knit community with a small RCMP detachment as well, who responded in two minutes, no doubt saving lives today,” Nina Krieger, British Columbia’s public safety minister, told reporters. ‘Horrific violence’ In response to the shooting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney postponed a planned announcement in Halifax on Wednesday for a new Defence Industrial Strategy and subsequent trip to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, a spokesperson said. “I am devastated by todays horrific shootings in Tumbler Ridge, B.C. My prayers and deepest condolences are with the families and friends who have lost loved ones to these horrific acts of violence,” Carney said on X. British Columbia Premier David Eby called the violence “unimaginable”. The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history. In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a gas station about 90 km (60 miles) from the site of his first killings.

      "summary_orig": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti addressed the issue of terrorism in the province on Wednesday, asserting that no one was allowed to take up arms and kill innocent people. He made this statement while addressing the Balochistan Assembly, around 10 days after a spate of attacks on January 31 brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days . Security forces responded to the attacks by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ”. Speaking about terrorism today, Bugti said there was, unfortunately, “confusion” on the issue in Pakistan. He linked this “confusion” to the use of “propaganda”, which he said was used to create distance between the state and the youth of Balochistan. Moreover, he claimed, “a forced narrative has been created against Pakistan that is purely based on perceptions and devoid of reality”. The minister decried that terrorism in Balochistan was linked to the lack of development in the province, adding that the problem of “unparalleled development” existed across the country. Why were arms not being taken up elsewhere, the CM said, adding, “How are you rationalising violence?” Again criticising the linking of terrorism with the lack of development, he remarked: “The monopoly of the right of violence is only with the state [ sic ]; be it whichever state in the world.” The CM then emphasised that no one was allowed to take up arms and kill innocent people on any issue. He said that those involved in terrorism in Balochistan wanted to “break the country and create a nation state on the basis of Baloch identity”. Bugti further said the aim behind the creation of such a nation state was to employ it for the use of three “tools”. “The first tool is of violence, the second is of social manoeuvre and legitimate voices, and the third is of social media,” he outlined, without elaborating any further on this. Bugti said that the “Baloch are being pushed towards a futile war. What can be gained of this futile war except for bloodshed?” he said, reiterating that he “feels that attempts are made to rationalise violence”. “This is very dangerous,” he added. The CM said that the National Action Plan was the most important document after the Constitution. In the NAP, he added, terrorism in the name of religion had been recognised with consensus as an act of terrorism. But, he continued, “terrorism in the name of so-called nationalism is treated differently”. The CM said that as far as the prospect of dialogue was concerned, “what will be the end result? What do you want from it?” He said he had requested the opposition in the provincial assembly multiple times to “take the lead” if they believed a resolution was possible through dialogue. “I, on behalf of the state of Pakistan, am ready to talk. But I cannot talk to those who are talking to us with the barrels of guns, those who are killing us, those who are killing our innocent children, those who are killing our innocent teachers, our doctors, our policemen and our security forces.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday criticised National Assembly (NA) Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai over his recent remarks about the army, saying that the “irresponsible” statement was an attempt to “belittle the sacrifices” of security personnel. Asif’s rebuke came during a session of the lower house of Parliament, where he recalled Achakzai’s recent remarks and quoted him as saying that the army was a “force of four districts”. Asif did not elaborate on the context of the remarks attributed to Achakzai. Terming it “highly irresponsible” and a “deliberate attempt to malign” the national institution, Asif asserted that the army was a national force. “It is the force of the federation, with representation from all provinces,” he stressed. “It is the force of the entire country.” During his address, the minister also shared data about the representation of different provinces in the army, reading out statistics from a document. According to the document, seen by Dawn , the province-wise representation in consonance with the population of districts in the army as per the 2023 census was 51.1 per cent from Punjab, 16.28pc from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 20.52pc from Sindh, 6.04pc from Balochistan, 2.54pc from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan and 3.52pc from the minorities. However, while reading out the numbers, Asif mistakenly stated that representation from Punjab was 91.1pc instead of 51.1pc. He also highlighted that the armed forces had rendered several sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. “Over the past five years, 3,141 personnel, including officers, junior commissioned officers, and jawans have embraced martyrdom in this fight,” the defence minister said, adding that those martyrs were from all regions of the country. According to data shared by Asif, those martyrs included 170 officers, 212 junior commissioned officers and 2759 soldiers. He added that the opposition leader’s “irresponsible statement is an attempt to belittle these sacrifices and tantamount to attacking public sentiments”. The minister said that the opposition leader’s position was a respectable one and such statements were not expected from Achakzai. He further asserted that the fight against terrorism was not confined to any particular province or district, but “is a collective struggle of the entire nation”. “Martyrs are our red line … We are indebted to the martyrs, who sacrificed their lives for our safety and protection,” he said. Asif went on to say, “We are in the middle of a very bloody war. Daily …” At this point, the NA’s live stream was disrupted for less than a minute. When the stream resumed, the defence minister said that “such attacks and behaviour, the spilling of blood is not allowed in our religion”. “The bodies of our soldiers are decapitated after their martyrdom. This is also happening. It is happening in Tirah Valley,” he said. Turning his attention to politicians, he said, “We are fighting a war for our political interests. If someone says that we are fighting for the country, then they are wrong. We are fighting a war for our political interests and power. Over the past 60-70 years, whenever someone was deprived of power, they fought for it, and there were no underlying principles in that fight. “And then a voice is raised in this house that it (army) is a force of four districts. I don’t want to use any strong words for this house as it has earned me immense respect.” But, he continued, if an individual crossed a “line drawn with blood” while safeguarding their political interests, they had no right to “sit in this house”. The defence minister also said that “no voice is raised from Balochistan when Punjabis are shot after their identity cards are checked … I don’t believe in provincial discrimination, but I take strong exception [to Achakzai’s remark]”. He also moved a resolution, which paid tribute to the armed forces for their “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism. The resolution was adopted by the house, which reaffirmed its commitment that the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain. The resolution underscored that the nation was standing firmly alongside the armed forces in the fight against terrorism. It further lauded the “professional capabilities, bravery and dedication” of the military, declaring full support for its continued efforts to safeguard national security, uphold stability and maintain peace across the country. Achakzai, who joined the NA proceedings midway through Asif’s speech, responded to the defence minister, saying that he stood by his words and would continue to speak against the “enemies of democracy”. “You have punished us for supporting democracy”, he remarked and raised the question that whether Parliament was supposed to “justify martial law”. The opposition leader also commented that relations with Afghanistan could not improve until “we stop deeming the neighbouring country as our fifth province”. PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan also spoke during the session, raising objection to his party being held responsible for terrorism in the country. “Terrorists are our enemies wherever they are”, he said. Gohar further criticised the government for “using the crutches of the establishment to rule the country”. Gohar also reminded the defence minister that he used to openly criticise the army in the past and alleged that his statement in the house was “an attempt to divide the nation”. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, however, contended that sharing data on the number of martyrs could not be termed an attempt to divide the nation. NA passes 6 bills During the session, the short of quorum NA also passed six bills amid an outcry from the opposition, with Speaker Sadiq refusing to order a count. Just 66 members were present in the house at the time of passage of the bills after rules were suspended to take those up for immediate consideration. The bills included the Pakistan Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2025, Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026, The Pakistan Names and Emblems (Prevention of Unauthorised Use) (Amendment) Bill, 2026, National Archives (Amendment) Bill, 2026, Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026 and Islamabad Capital Territory Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2025.",

The opposition leader also commented that relations with Afghanistan could not improve until “we stop deeming the neighbouring country as our fifth province”. PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan also spoke during the session, raising objection to his party being held responsible for terrorism in the country. “Terrorists are our enemies wherever they are”, he said. Gohar further criticised the government for “using the crutches of the establishment to rule the country”. Gohar also reminded the defence minister that he used to openly criticise the army in the past and alleged that his statement in the house was “an attempt to divide the nation”. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, however, contended that sharing data on the number of martyrs could not be termed an attempt to divide the nation. NA passes 6 bills During the session, the short of quorum NA also passed six bills amid an outcry from the opposition, with Speaker Sadiq refusing to order a count. Just 66 members were present in the house at the time of passage of the bills after rules were suspended to take those up for immediate consideration. The bills included the Pakistan Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2025, Cannabis Control and Regulatory Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026, The Pakistan Names and Emblems (Prevention of Unauthorised Use) (Amendment) Bill, 2026, National Archives (Amendment) Bill, 2026, Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2026 and Islamabad Capital Territory Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2025.",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday criticised National Assembly (NA) Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai over his recent remarks about the army, saying that the “irresponsible” statement was an attempt to “belittle the sacrifices” of security personnel. Asif’s rebuke came during a session of the lower house of Parliament, where he recalled Achakzai’s recent remarks and quoted him as saying that the army was a “force of four districts”. Asif did not elaborate on the context of the remarks attributed to Achakzai. Terming it “highly irresponsible” and a “deliberate attempt to malign” the national institution, Asif asserted that the army was a national force. “It is the force of the federation, with representation from all provinces,” he stressed. “It is the force of the entire country.” During his address, the minister also shared data about the representation of different provinces in the army, reading out statistics from a document. According to the document, seen by Dawn , the province-wise representation in consonance with the population of districts in the army as per the 2023 census was 51.1 per cent from Punjab, 16.28pc from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 20.52pc from Sindh, 6.04pc from Balochistan, 2.54pc from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan and 3.52pc from the minorities. However, while reading out the numbers, Asif mistakenly stated that representation from Punjab was 91.1pc instead of 51.1pc. He also highlighted that the armed forces had rendered several sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. “Over the past five years, 3,141 personnel, including officers, junior commissioned officers, and jawans have embraced martyrdom in this fight,” the defence minister said, adding that those martyrs were from all regions of the country. According to data shared by Asif, those martyrs included 170 officers, 212 junior commissioned officers and 2759 soldiers. He added that the opposition leader’s “irresponsible statement is an attempt to belittle these sacrifices and tantamount to attacking public sentiments”. The minister said that the opposition leader’s position was a respectable one and such statements were not expected from Achakzai. He further asserted that the fight against terrorism was not confined to any particular province or district, but “is a collective struggle of the entire nation”. “Martyrs are our red line … We are indebted to the martyrs, who sacrificed their lives for our safety and protection,” he said. Asif went on to say, “We are in the middle of a very bloody war. Daily …” At this point, the NA’s live stream was disrupted for less than a minute. When the stream resumed, the defence minister said that “such attacks and behaviour, the spilling of blood is not allowed in our religion”. “The bodies of our soldiers are decapitated after their martyrdom. This is also happening. It is happening in Tirah Valley,” he said. Turning his attention to politicians, he said, “We are fighting a war for our political interests. If someone says that we are fighting for the country, then they are wrong. We are fighting a war for our political interests and power. Over the past 60-70 years, whenever someone was deprived of power, they fought for it, and there were no underlying principles in that fight. “And then a voice is raised in this house that it (army) is a force of four districts. I don’t want to use any strong words for this house as it has earned me immense respect.” But, he continued, if an individual crossed a “line drawn with blood” while safeguarding their political interests, they had no right to “sit in this house”. The defence minister also said that “no voice is raised from Balochistan when Punjabis are shot after their identity cards are checked … I don’t believe in provincial discrimination, but I take strong exception [to Achakzai’s remark]”. He also moved a resolution, which paid tribute to the armed forces for their “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism. The resolution was adopted by the house, which reaffirmed its commitment that the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain. The resolution underscored that the nation was standing firmly alongside the armed forces in the fight against terrorism. It further lauded the “professional capabilities, bravery and dedication” of the military, declaring full support for its continued efforts to safeguard national security, uphold stability and maintain peace across the country. Achakzai, who joined the NA proceedings midway through Asif’s speech, responded to the defence minister, saying that he stood by his words and would continue to speak against the “enemies of democracy”. “You have punished us for supporting democracy”, he remarked and raised the question that whether Parliament was supposed to “justify martial law”.

      "summary_orig": "National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Wednesday accepted the resignation of veteran politician Sardar Akhtar Mengal, chief of his faction of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M). Mengal, who was elected as an MNA from Khuzdar (NA-256) in the 2024 general elections, had submitted his resignation in September that year, citing the “prevailing situation in Balochistan”. “PML-N has at last accepted my resignation after dragging its feet long enough to expose its own fear,” Mengal said in a social media post, referring to the speaker’s party. “Was it the applause that unsettled you or the fact that I could draw crowds in Punjab’s core?” he asked, apparently referring to his participation in a charged discussion about Balochistan at the Asma Jahangir Conference held recently in Lahore. At the event, Mengal had criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined. He also expressed concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties. In his post on X, Mengal said he had “not withdrawn one rupee” since he tendered his resignation, adding that he had vacated Parliament Lodges 17 months ago. “For the record, not one rupee has been withdrawn since my resignation. Every amount remains in Parliament’s bank. The lodges were vacated 17 months ago and I have not resided there since. Adios!” In a separate post, he said, “My resignation was submitted on 3rd September 2024 by choice and with full conviction.” He said the decision was taken on principle, in response to the “unresolved grievances of Balochistan”. “Instead of addressing those grievances, the authorities chose to suppress the issue, once again demonstrating that this federation has no real space for a Baloch voice,” he said. “What is now public is not just my resignation, but the mindset of those in power toward Balochistan’s suffering and how my appearance in Lahore was enough to unsettle many egos. I stand by this decision,” he said. The senior politician had resigned over security tensions in Balochistan after the Aug 26, 2024 deadly attacks across the province and increased protests against enforced disappearances. Soon after the resignation was submitted, the government and the PTI beseeched Mengal to take back his resignation and continue to be a voice for Balochistan in the lower house of Parliament. In July 2025, the BNP-M chief was barred from travelling abroad , with immigration officials at the Quetta airport info­rming him that his name had been placed in the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL), a temporary travel ban to stop people from going abroad. Two months later, the Balochistan High Court had declared the travel ban illegal and directed authorities to immediately lift the restriction. ‘Marginalised and ignored’ In his resignation letter addressed to the NA speaker, Mengal had said the “prevailing situation in Balochistan has compelled me to take this step”. “Our province has consistently been marginalised and ignored by this House. Each day, we are pushed further against the wall, leaving us with no choice but to reconsider our roles. “The lack of genuine representation in this Assembly for the people of Balochistan has left voices like mine unable to bring meaningful change. “It has become increasingly clear that our attempts to speak or protest are met with hostility, our people are either silenced, labelled as traitors, or worse, killed,” Mengal wrote in his letter. “Under such circumstances, I find it impossible to continue in this capacity, as my presence here no longer serves any purpose for the people I represent,” Mengal wrote.",

      "title_orig": "Systemic rot: How a ‘system’ of corrupt officials and politicians is usurping Karachi’s prime real estate",
      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Around 4.30pm on Feb 25 last year, an altercation took place between two groups of people on Mai Kolachi Road, near the US consulate. While the details of the brawl itself are unclear, the bone of contention was allegedly a three-acre chunk of prime real estate located just off the thoroughfare. One of its two co-owners, builder and developer Javed Iqbal had employed a local JUI-F leader named Jibrail Khan, 32, to work there as a supervisor. Several sources claim that the huge plot is coveted by extremely powerful individuals at the top of the political food chain. Some days earlier, this party had sent in their supporters to occupy the plot. On Feb 25, Jibrail got into a heated confrontation with them. An FIR was filed against him for rioting armed with a deadly weapon, kidnapping and attempted murder. Several other FIRs (copies of which are in Dawn ’s possession) were also filed against him in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, including Shikarpur, Moro, Qazi Ahmed and Nawabshah for various crimes, ostensibly committed within the span of a few weeks, including theft of cattle, cash and a motorbike. He was arrested, taken to Central Jail and a few weeks later, transferred to prison in Nawabshah. According to an individual close to Jibrail, who originally hails from KP, “He’s never been anywhere in Sindh except for Karachi”. Even after he was acquitted by a Shaheed Benazirabad court, with the judicial magistrate in his order saying there had been an abuse of power and that Jibrail had been falsely implicated, he continued to be detained in the same prison. The plot’s co-owner, Mr Iqbal, alleges that a fake FIR was filed against him as well and he was detained by the Counter Terrorism Department police for four days, during which, he says, he was ordered to surrender the plot in writing. He refused; ultimately, he obtained relief from the Sindh High Court. Political big guns soon became involved. Rashid Mehmood Soomro, secretary general of JUI-F Sindh, issued a strongly worded statement on social media in Jibrail’s defence, describing the dispute as one in connection with a plot which “two big crocodiles are rushing to grab”. He denounced one of them as “someone who perhaps believes he owns Sindh, owns the country, and thinks he can use brute force to grab land…”; he warned that if the matter was not resolved quickly, Sindh would go up in flames. This is the tip of the iceberg that illustrates the lawlessness prevailing in Sindh, where an entire system allegedly operates free from the constraints of the law and institutional guardrails, beholden only to its political masters and their whims, and existing solely to rake in eyewatering fortunes for everyone involved. While the sources of this wealth are many and varied, Karachi’s precious real estate is the gift that keeps on giving, and it is the focus of this report. Sources within the political leadership, bureaucracy and civil society speak of a city divided up into zones, with a trusted front man (sometimes several) presiding over receipts from each area under his control. Among these are a seasoned medical professional, a civil servant active in brokering land deals, a business group that allegedly handles all the ‘earnings’ generated in the province, etc. Given the heft of the personalities involved, most sources were unwilling to speak on the record, but there is sufficient documentary evidence and on-ground reporting by Dawn to support their statements. Certain names have been changed to protect the individuals’ identity. With the law having been weaponised to silence the media, drawing too clear a picture can be fraught with risk, so readers are invited to connect the dots where possible. King of the West? In a country where political fortunes can go through cycles of boom and bust, Ali Hassan Brohi — also known as Ali Hassan Zehri because of his Baloch tribal ancestry — has suffered a setback of sorts. On Feb 3, he tendered his resignation from the Balochistan cabinet. But, given his powerful connections, this may be only a bump in the road. There was a time he was said to be on the run and allegedly in the crosshairs of the ‘encounter specialist’ — Rao Anwar, then SSP Malir. Fast forward to December 2024, he was sworn in as Balochistan’s minister for agriculture and cooperatives. His recent setbacks in that province notwithstanding, he is arguably one of the most powerful people in Sindh, rumoured to have the ear of no less than the president himself. Letter of resignation by Ali Hassan Zehri to CM Balochistan. Hailing from Bandhi, Nawabshah district (since renamed Shaheed Benazirabad), he was once, as a prominent politician told Dawn , in the employ of an octroi tax collector in Bolari, district Jamshoro. “He wasn’t even a manager, but a helper. However, according to the contractor, he was extremely sharp.” Showing a political savvy that was to stand him in good stead, Mr Brohi developed contacts with low-level PPP workers and over time, with senior party leaders in Nawabshah. With the help of his connections, alleges the politician, Mr Brohi gradually worked his way out of small-town Sindh to providing muscle for the PPP in connection with Karachi’s pricey real estate — but then, there was a falling out. Several sources confirmed to Dawn that Mr Brohi made a run for Balochistan; police close to the Sindh-Balochistan border had received orders from SSP Rao to ‘intercept’ him, and they fired upon his vehicle in the Mochko area, but he made it across. There he sought shelter with certain political and tribal heavyweights, two of whom are said to have paved the way for his rapprochement with his former benefactor several years later when they joined the PPP. Until then, though, Mr Brohi’s travails were far from over. On May 20, 2020, English and Urdu newspapers carried a public notice by the deputy commissioner, district West (the DC office is the most senior in the district revenue department). The notice declared Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claimed he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees. It read: “For his immense crimes of forgery and land grabs, Ali Hassan Brohi is under a comprehensive and impartial inquiry by this office. A significant number of fake entries managed by Ali Hassan Brohi in the revenue record of district West have been found, which will be conveyed to higher authorities with recommendations for cancellation and penal action after completion of scrutiny.” The notice asked for public assistance in gathering further information. Public notice published in a national daily, declaring Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claiming he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees. On the orders of Owais Muzaffar Tappi who was believed to run the system at the time, the then DC West Fayyaz Solangi retrieved the lands that Mr Brohi had allegedly grabbed. However, as this story will later show, Mr Solangi would come to regret following those orders so faithfully. In 2021, FIA’s corporate crime circle, Karachi office, instituted an enquiry based on what it claimed was a reference from the DIG CTD, Sindh, in which Mr Brohi and eight others were named on the basis of an FIR (no 811/2021) filed in Karachi. Briefly, the FIR accused Mr Brohi of having taken Rs20 million from drug dealers to bribe two policemen with Rs7m to get two of his alleged front men to spring three Nigerian nationals from custody. According to the FIA’s brief, subsequent enquiries brought to light 14 FIRs dating from 2007 till 2020, in which Mr Brohi is named as the accused in eight, while the rest nominate two other individuals described as his “front men”. The charges against him include terrorism, murder, attempted murder, rioting armed with a deadly weapon, dacoity, causing hurt and criminal intimidation, among others. The document also names nine “front men” of Mr Brohi in whose name the latter had “acquired/ purchased various properties in different areas” of Karachi. These findings, according to the brief, are based on only a partial record, some of it obtained from the digitised records compiled by the Land Revenue Management Information Systems (LARMIS), Board of Revenue (BoR), Sindh. Mr Brohi did not respond to questions put to him in writing by Dawn regarding these allegations and other claims about him by sources quoted in this report. (Of the eight FIRs in which Mr Brohi is nominated as the sole accused, police sources contacted by Dawn were able to confirm three FIRs from their record, plus two more registered in 2021 that are not listed in the FIA brief.) In conclusion, the brief says that in December 2021, the enquiry was transferred to FIA headquarters in Islamabad. The story of that transfer is revealing in its brazen conflict of interest. In March 2021, Mr Brohi’s wife, Samina Mumtaz Zehri was elected to the Senate on a reserved women’s seat. According to a senior political leader, her election was managed by former ISI chief Faiz Hameed, who had her vote shifted to Hub from Karachi and presented her as a Senate candidate from the Balochistan Awami Party. (The BAP is well known to have the military establishment’s backing.) After her election, Ms Zehri became a member of the standing committee on interior. At its meeting on Oct 22, 2021, the minutes of which are in Dawn ’s possession, the members made several recommendations. One of these reads: “Senators Rana Maqbool Ahmed, Azam Nazir Tarar and Muhammad Talha Mahmood were of the considered opinion that Dr Farooq, deputy director of FIA, Karachi has now become a controversial officer and the case pointed by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri should be transferred to Islamabad and interrogated…” The case in question was the FIA’s inquiry into Ms Zehri’s own husband. As per its letter dated Dec 27, 2021 acknowledging the standing committee’s decision, the DG FIA’s Islamabad office directed that the enquiry report be submitted for perusal to the DG, FIA within a fortnight. The DG FIA did not respond to repeated requests in writing from Dawn as to the fate of the enquiry. Minutes of the meeting of the Senate standing committee on interior from Oct 22, 2021. On Nov 4, 2024, Senior Vice President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry Saquib Fayyaz Magoon wrote to Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah about a complaint forwarded to him by President, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industries Jawed Bilwani. The complaint, by businessman Shoaib Razzak Makkad and also dated Nov 4, 2024, was enclosed with the letter to the chief secretary. Mr Makkad in his complaint stated that he was a partner in Salina International, a salt manufacturing business. According to him, he was “in possession of land measuring 54.3 acres since 2019” in Mauripur, district Keamari. “…[O]n June 28, 2024, Tapedar … and Tapedar …, notable front men of Ali Hassan Brohi, with some unknown people came with heavy weapons and … encroached on the entire land. They are still today residing [there] with heavy weapons.” Saquib Fayyaz Magoon’s letter to chief secretary Sindh. A senior government officer told Dawn , “In districts West and Keamari, without Ali Hassan’s NOC, neither DC, nor SSP, nor mukhtiarkar, nor some ACs — such as of Manghopir and Mauripur — can be appointed.” This view was corroborated by sources in the police, bureaucracy, business sector and PPP itself. A seasoned bureaucrat said that even after lease papers for a particular housing society in district West had been signed, “the AC and mukhtiarkar wouldn’t make an entry in their mutation registers because they don’t do anything unless specifically ordered by Ali Hassan.” (A mukhtiarkar is a BoR official just below the assistant commissioner, responsible for processing and issuing documents related to land revenue, which makes this an extremely powerful post.) This is not to suggest that Mr Brohi is the only one whose name crops up in context of allegedly questionable land dealings. However, given his political profile, he is arguably the most prominent among these individuals. Dirty business Before moving on to the other actors in the sordid saga of land grabbing in Karachi, a brief note on how land ownership is created followed by some instances of shady real estate dealings that Dawn has uncovered. The Board of Revenue, Sindh is original custodian of all the land in the province. Aside from revenue collection and maintaining land records in Sindh, BoR allots land to individuals, societies and various institutions and development authorities such as Karachi Development Authority (KDA), Lyari Development Authority (LDA), Defence Housing Authority, etc to develop schemes for specific purposes. Relevant revenue officials ‘survey’ an area of state land and divide it into blocks with each given a unique identifier called a “survey number”. The surveyed land can then be allotted according to a procedure specified under the Sindh Colonisation and Disposal of Government Land Rules, 2005. Unsurveyed land is termed ‘ na class’ land, which belongs to the original owner, the state, which holds it in trust for the public. Na class or unsurveyed land is distinguished on BoR maps by a different colour and different sequence of numbers than surveyed land. But evidence that rules of procedure are being violated with breathtaking impunity — and with full knowledge of the authorities — lies scattered all across Karachi. Districts West (particularly in Halkani, Bund Murad and Jam Chakro), Keamari (which was carved out of the original district West in 2020), East and Malir have become increasingly attractive for builders. “To make a project viable inside the city is quite difficult because you can’t find big chunks of land there, and whatever land that does exist there is expensive,” says Hamid Khan* of the Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD). “That’s why builders tend to focus on the suburbs.” No doubt there are countless examples of illegal land use within Karachi proper, including encroachment on amenity plots, by elements connected with all political parties — PPP, MQM and ANP (during the latter two’s heyday in the city), and even by the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan for a period. For reasons of space, however, this report focuses on Karachi’s outlying areas and encroachments within recent years. Dawn Investigations visited multiple sites in district West, as well as the huge development scheme known as Hawkesbay Scheme 42 in district Keamari. Where until some years ago there were vast stretches of empty land dotted with goths (rural settlements), dozens of gated housing schemes are now coming up, many boasting little more than an entrance, a boundary wall and a booking office where dubious claims about the builders’ title to land are made. Take Al-Jannat City by MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd in deh Halkani, for example. Mohammed Aqeel in the booking office informs the Dawn correspondent, who approaches him as a prospective investor, that there are 575 residential plots of 120 sq yards each available here, and a number of commercial plots. The proposed layout plan displayed in the booking office shows the project as being spread across 32.8 acres on survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61. The salesperson says six families are already residing in the society while around 20 houses are under construction. Residential plots cost between Rs3 to 3.5 million, with all sales final. Calculated at Rs3.3m each, the residential plots alone add up to at least Rs1.84 billion. A masterplan of the housing society is plastered on a wall inside the Al Jannat City office. “If you delay buying for a month, the price could cross four million rupees,” cautions Mr Aqeel. “Construction has been picking up pace here and there’s no other leased project nearing completion in the area.” He adds: “We have been issuing sub-leases to owners of the plots.” The question is: how is that possible when the land on which Al-Jannat City is coming up does not even belong to the builder? Mr Aqeel claims LDA has leased the land to the builders, but tellingly, he refuses to show the lease. “Not until you purchase a plot,” he says firmly. (Deh Halkani is part of what is known as Scheme 43, which the BoR has given only as a ‘controlled’ area to LDA. The Authority itself has no lease for it.) To delve deeper into the builder’s claims, Dawn GIS department referred to the digitised data in LARMIS. The apex court in 2012 banned the mutation of public land in Sindh, but in 2019, it partially lifted the ban in areas where the land record had been digitised. Thus, one can reasonably assume that the LARMIS data, where it exists, is up to date. It turns out that survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61 actually lie on the other side of the road from where Al-Jannat City is coming up. The project is located on what is entirely state land. Interestingly, taken together, these survey numbers almost mirror the dimensions of the project itself. A short drive away on the main road is Alvisha Housing Society by the same builder, located opposite the Ijtema Gah where a mammoth religious congregation gathers every year. The salesman at the project office tells the correspondent that 120- and 160-sq yard residential and 200 sq yard commercial plots are available for sale in blocks A, B and C. In block C, a 120 sq yard plot costs Rs2.8m lump sum, and Rs3.6m on a 42-month installment plan. When asked about official approvals, one of the two men present says that for the time being, the plots in block A, where the office is located, are being offered on sale to “those who have faith in the builder” and not to the general public. When asked why that is so, he admits that the “paperwork for block A is not 100 per cent complete, unlike blocks B and C.” He lays out the society’s proposed layout plan on the desk; it lists the survey numbers (86, 87, 88 and 89) on which it is being constructed. Frontline Marketing, which is handling the project, shares with Dawn an NOC issued by LDA which also mentions the same survey numbers, 86 to 89. However, Dawn ’s GIS department has determined that these survey numbers lie quite some distance away, in the direction where the men in the sales office vaguely indicated that blocks B and C will come up. Moreover, Alvisha’s block A is actually situated on survey numbers 96 and 97. It is not known what is the reason for this discrepancy. Maps showing the Alvisha and Al-Jannat housing schemes. But revenue officials tell Dawn this kind of discrepancy is very common. One explains it thus: “Sometimes there are other claimants to the land; sometimes builders will use ownership of one piece of survey land to falsely claim ownership over other surveyed land, or even over unsurveyed land; another ploy is to get a fake allotment of unsurveyed land and, after possession, go to the revenue department for a survey number.” Dawn ’s letter to MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd was returned. Another letter with questions to Frontline Marketing received no response either. With around 60 projects in Karachi, GFS Builders & Developers is one of the big players in Pakistan’s real estate market. Supported by a slick marketing campaign, its numerous smooth-talking salespersons push discount offers, and district West is dotted with a number of their projects. A closer look at North Town Residency Phase-2 exposes some shocking facts. According to an ‘NOC’ for sale and advertisement of plots in NTR phase 2 issued by the Sindh Building Control Association, the project measures 30 acres on land bearing survey numbers 363 to 367 “out of na class no 294 in deh Halkani”. The BoR map submitted to the Supreme Court in 2013 clearly shows this entire area — which falls partly in deh Halkani and partly in deh Bund Murad — as being na class (or unsurveyed/state land). The LARMIS website currently shows the same situation in deh Halkani. The map for deh Bund Murad is missing. Dawn received no response to questions it sent in writing to the GFS CEO. Map of GFS North Town Phase 2. (Dawn repeatedly contacted the DC West; Senior Member Board of Revenue, Sindh with a cc to the Chief Secretary, Sindh; Member, Land Utilisation, BoR; and Project Director, LARMIS to ask about the provenance of the survey numbers in connection with the aforementioned housing projects. There was no response from any of them except for LARMIS Assistant Director, Coordination, Hafeezullah Abbasi. Mr Abbasi informed Dawn over the phone that LARMIS does not possess the data in question. “We can only digitise the data that we have been provided.”) Filthy rich Interestingly, the above-mentioned na class number — no 294 — from which piece of land GFS representatives claim that survey numbers 363 to 367 have been carved out for its North Town Residency-Phase 2, crops up in a complaint to NAB about huge tracts of land being illegally taken over and sold. A list of suspicious sales/allotments was enclosed with the complaint, mentioning the survey/ na class numbers, area and value, and ‘sellers’ and ‘purchasers’ of the land in question. According to this, 82 acres on na class numbers 284 – 294 were illegally sold/allotted to GFS. The dubious transactions listed in the complaint to NAB involve nearly 1,500 acres, including around 1,150 acres of state land. On Oct 11, 2023, NAB wrote to DC West informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land”, and asking him to furnish NAB with a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023. Letter written by NAB to the DC West, informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land” in the district and seeking a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023. Repeated attempts to seek NAB’s official response to this complaint went unanswered. Sources told Dawn that NAB had initiated a formal enquiry based on the allegations in this complaint, but recently, 166 cases, enquiries, references and complaints relating to the departments of revenue, local government and food had been transferred to Sindh’s Anti-Corruption Establishment. The list enclosed with the complaint to NAB lays bare how predatory networks have hollowed out governance in Sindh — like locusts stripping bare every field they descend upon. Those who acquired the land allegedly through illegal sale/allotment include a number of well-known builders and developers. And among those accused of supplying them the land — the ‘sellers’ — are Ali Hassan Brohi, an SHO and a mukhtiarkar. The cop is Ghulam Hussain Korai, then SHO Manghopir in district West. Consider just one of the parcels of land that he, jointly with one Yousuf Brohi, is accused of grabbing: 200 acres of state land in deh Bund Murad which was, as per this document, worth an eye-watering Rs4 bn. An SHO can be a grade 14 (sub-inspector) or grade 16 (inspector) officer, whose monthly salary is at the most Rs120,000. In December 2024, after complaints by a number of businessmen about brazen land grabbing in Karachi became too vociferous to ignore, the powers that be ordered the Sindh government to address the issue. Inspector Korai was among five police officers who were subsequently transferred to desk jobs at the police headquarters. (A number of revenue officials were also transferred, though often replaced, say sources, with others of equally ill repute but boasting strong ties with those who matter in the provincial leadership.) In response to Dawn ’s questions, Inspector Korai described the allegations against him as “false, fabricated, and baseless … the [Association of Builders & Developers] have withdrawn their application, and the issue has been resolved accordingly.” He enclosed a letter from ABAD with his response. An excerpt from it reads: “… due to unavoidable circumstances the complainant currently displaying a lack of coordination with ABAD regarding their submitted complaints … We hereby request to withdraw the complaint against him.” Dawn was unable to confirm the nature of the “unavoidable circumstances”. Mr Korai remains without any posting. Sources say he has been sanctioned several times for misconduct. There is on the same list one Ejaz, described as mukhtiarkar Scheme 33, who is alleged to have handed over in a fraudulent manner seven acres in Scheme 33 itself to an undisclosed builder and developer. This appears to be a reference to Aijazul Hassan Khan. Incidentally, Mr Aijaz was among 11 mukhtiarkars suspended in 2023 for land fraud. It is difficult to overstate the cruel irony in this situation. While public land gets siphoned away by unscrupulous builders hand in glove with rapacious elements from the ruling elite and corrupt government officials, affordable public sector housing schemes almost never go beyond the blueprint. Hawkesbay Scheme 42, Karachi’s oldest public sector project, is a stark example. This scheme was started in 1984 for the low- and middle-income segment by KDA and transferred to LDA in 1996. Over four decades later, much of it is still undeveloped and without electricity or water. Many original allottees remained unable during their lifetime to take possession of their plots, which they had paid for with their hard-earned money. Scheme 42 even includes a block exclusively for overseas Pakistanis, but they too have nothing to show for their investment till today. And yet, those with no right to the land but plenty of clout have staked their claim to the overseas block by building a boundary wall around its perimeter, repeatedly. Each time the wall is bulldozed by the authorities, it comes up again within no time. An illegal housing society called Aashqan-e-Mustafa has materialised along the Suparco Road which cuts through Scheme 42. Two front men of an MPA are said to be handling transactions. A view of the Aashqan-e-Mustafa society’s site office. A view of the Aashqan-e-Mustafa society on Suparco Road. When a Dawn Investigations team visits, a man strolls up, asking if they are interested in a plot and if so, to take their queries to Madina Real Estate nearby. There are 100- or 120-square yard plots available for sale here, says the realtor: “a 400-sq yard commercial plot alongside the main road costs Rs6.5m with cash payment over three months.” When asked whether the society has a lease from the development authority, he replies: “No, it’s not leased but this is part of the Gothabad Scheme, so you’ll get a sanad if you buy here.” This means the government had notified this piece of state land for a goth situated here — ostensibly in this case, Kachelo Goth. However, sanads can only be issued to the original residents of a goth . Incidentally, Kachelo Goth actually lies around 2km away. A map of the Aashqan-e-Mustafa society. Predictably, the Gothabad Scheme over the years has become another vehicle for corruption since it began in 1987 to provide housing to the deserving indigenous population in rural Sindh. Gothabad mukhiarkars began issuing fake sanads, even multiple sanads to one individual to enable the latter to claim title over a large area. Mohammed Shahnawaz at the Aashqan-e-Mustafa housing society site office in fact claimed that buyers would be given backdated sanads because “sanads stopped being issued after 2012”. Dawn received no response to questions addressed in writing to the proprietors of Aashqan-e-Mustafa. In June 2014, during Supreme Court hearings into the Karachi unrest case, BoR submitted a report stating that 59,803 acres of state land had been encroached upon. Backroom land deals are not mere irregularities — they are a fundamental breach of public trust. State land is not for the government to bestow upon whomever it favours, which is why a recent Sindh High Court judgement underscored that, in the interest of transparency, state land must be disposed of through an open auction. Fake NOCs, no paper trail All the housing societies investigated for this report happen to fall under LDA. Ahmed Saeed*, who is very familiar with the LDA’s workings, reveals that the Authority has in umpteen instances showed ‘ na class ’ land (ie unsurveyed land which cannot be allotted to anyone and on which no project can be constructed) as survey land. He alleges that everyone, including BoR, is party to the fraud. According to him, the landgrabber writes to the Director General LDA to request an NOC for the layout plan on what they claim is their land. The DG sends the letter to the relevant DC, asking for clarification on the status of the land in question. The DC forwards it to the mukhtiarkar who takes out a report which then goes back to the DC, who forwards it to the DG confirming the land does indeed belong to the interested party. “The official fee for approval of the layout plan is Rs1.3m per acre, and the bribe for showing na class land as survey land is Rs500,000 per acre,” says Mr Saeed. “But because the letters have been sent around by hand, not by a dispatcher, there’s no trail. LDA will say they did this on BoR’s say-so; if you ask BoR for verification, they’ll say this is state land and they never gave approval for it. You show them the correspondence — and they’ll say it’s fake, but they all know. They’re all involved.” In other words, classic smoke and mirrors. At his office, a rather harried-looking DG LDA Safdar Bughio, tells Dawn : “Our planning department verifies ownership through the concerned DC office; it’s BoR that checks whether the builder has ownership or not. When they confirm ownership title, then our planning department does the technical work on it [to issue NOC for layout plan].” LDA planning department head, Mohammed Arbab, toes a similar line: “Our mandate and function is the KBTPR [Karachi Building and Town Planning Rules]. We are only a town planning agency. The identification of the land is done by the DC, title verification is done by the DC, record of survey numbers is with the DC.” However, Mr Bughio concedes there are some illegal housing societies. “It is also our responsibility to stop them. We do stop them, but officially we deal only with those who come for [layout plan] NOCs from us. But definitely I will soon start a programme in which we will take on the responsibility of dealing with them.” As for Mr Arbab, when pressed further on the issue, he says: “ Qabzay bhi wohi log kartay hain … na class land pay jin kay hukoomati links hotay hain.” (Encroachment on state land is done by those who have government connections.) Other cogs in the wheel There are nevertheless some public servants who try to discharge their duty with at least a degree of integrity. In instances where the mukhtiarkar concerned takes action and issues a notice to a suspected land grabber, the latter can approach the anti-encroachment tribunal. The Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010, empowers anti-encroachment tribunals headed by a retired district and sessions judge or an advocate of 10 years’ standing to determine the rights of the parties involved. Too often, though, the only anti-encroachment tribunal in Karachi has given questionable decisions. In fact, several sources told Dawn that encroachers go to the tribunal with fake/ forged documents to establish title to the land they have grabbed by obtaining a stay order. “It’s simple,” says Umair Rafiq*, a senior bureaucrat. “Go meet the court reader, file an application quickly and get a stay. Then anyone who visits that land becomes guilty of contempt. You just pay one or two million rupees for this.” Dawn has in its possession the copy of an order in suit no 15/ 2024, issued on July 23, 2024, by Muneer Bhutto, district and sessions judge and, until recently, presiding officer of the anti-encroachment tribunal. The plaintiff is Al-Faiz Builders Pvt Ltd while the defendants include officials from BoR, SBCA, LDA, anti-encroachment police personnel, etc. In his interim order, the presiding offer restrained “the defendants, their agents and anyone on their behalf from eject[ting], evict[ing], dispossess[ing] the plaintiff from the suit property ie 32 acres land na class No 42 situated at Deh Methan, tapo Manghopir, district Keamari”. Interestingly, the same presiding officer (now heading the Karachi Water & Sewerage Tribunal) was the focus of a complaint made earlier that year. In a letter dated Jan 30, 2024, a copy of which is available with Dawn , the DC East wrote to the Sindh High Court Registrar, the Member Inspection Team-II (a body that handles complaints against judicial officers in the district and lower courts), requesting further action on a complaint against Mr Bhutto that had been forwarded to him by the assistant commissioner East. With his letter, he enclosed a report submitted by a mukhtiarkar of Karachi East, Muhammad Irfan Lashari. Mr Lashari in his complaint alleged that the presiding officer had granted a stay to land grabbers on 500 sq yards of state land at Fateh Mohammed Gabol Goth that had been reserved by the Sindh government for a dispensary for the local residents. In fact, he said in his report, possession had already been given to the health department representative with documentation to the effect. According to him, through the stay order, a contempt of court notice against him and letter of suspension, he was “pressurised to follow the unlawful order passed by the presiding officer of the tribunal. … The stay orders … not only provide cover to the land grabbers but also encourage them to usurp more state land in connivance with support of presiding officer of the said tribunal and his staff…” Nothing came of this complaint. In fact, sources said that a “fake case” had been filed against the DC concerned, his properties were attached and he was declared an absconder. (On Oct 15, 2025, in a development unrelated to Mr Lashari’s complaint, Muneer Bhutto was found guilty of misconduct after an enquiry by MIT member Justice Muhammad Faisal Kamal Alam of the Sindh High Court that began in 2021. Concluding that Mr Bhutto had “misused” his “senior official position”, the MIT imposed on him “the minor penalty of withholding of annual increment for a period of three years”.) Despite repeated attempts, Mr Bhutto refused to receive Dawn ’s letter with questions regarding the above allegations. Nothing oils the wheels of elite capture like a corrupt bureaucracy. Seasoned bureaucrats hold that officers were generally appointed on merit in Benazir Bhutto’s time, but this changed after her assassination in December 2007. “As soon as PPP’s victory in the 2008 election seemed assured, officers began to get calls from the PPP leadership telling them to refrain from recruitment and from making any appointments,” says Rashid Saleem*, a retired assistant commissioner. “As soon as they came in, they began to recruit their own people.” The passage of the 18th Amendment, say old-school bureaucrats, removed the guardrails entirely. “The 2012 recruits were rapidly promoted and are now in grade 19. Soon they’ll be in grade 20, secretary level. God help Sindh when that happens,” says Mr Saleem. According to several senior civil servants, the Sindh Public Service Commission’s (SPSC) examination process has become seriously compromised, with ‘favoured’ candidates awarded inflated scores in the oral segment while deserving candidates are failed despite strong written performances. Each recruitment, appointment and promotion has a price, they claim. Journalist Imdad Soomro has extensively investigated corruption in the SPSC. “To get recruited into a department, one has to pay between Rs5m to Rs10m,” he alleges. At the other end of the spectrum are the top posts, such as assistant commissioner, excise and taxation officer, DSP, mukhtiarkar, etc for which candidates must sit the Combined Competitive Examination or CCE. The ‘rates’ are higher for such “ kamanay walay [lucrative] posts” as Mr Soomro puts it. According to him, to become AC or ETO, one must pay Rs80m; appointment as mukhtiarkar entails a bribe of Rs40m. According to a retired official, “There’s an exam called the revenue qualifier exam for clerical staff who have served three years in the Revenue Department. Clerks have paid Rs15m to Rs20m to become assistant mukhtiarkar. Close to 30 clerks have become assistant mukhtiarkars in this manner.” Often, all it takes for career advancement is to cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship with a political patron. Dawn was told that in one land development authority, an individual on a contingency contract as a watchman was now a grade-19 officer on an extremely important post. The great Karachi land grab Real estate in Karachi has been the cause of much disorder and violence. The final JIT report looking into the murder on March 13, 2013 of Perween Rahman, director of the Orangi Pilot Project, offered a revealing commentary. Referring to the period between 2006-2012, and the ethnic conflict between Pashtuns and Mohajirs, it noted that cadres of both MQM and ANP were heavily involved in various criminal activities, especially land grabbing, as were the Taliban who were a potent militant force in Karachi at the time. “… whatever their stated political differences, all three groups worked hand in glove … Big developers … would ally themselves with these groups, using the militant wings of these groups as their ‘muscle’, in order to forcibly seize land. Anyone who came in their way was either threatened, or if they refused to back off, killed. …[O]ften murders that were declared as being politically motivated or acts of terrorism, were in actual fact land disputes that were made to look like political killings to cover up the real facts. The state apparatus, in the shape of the land revenue administration or the police, was either too weak, or complicit in the face of the great Karachi land grab.” It was against this backdrop that the then Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in 2012 while hearing the Karachi ‘badamni’ (unrest) case, banned the Sindh government from effecting mutation, allotment, or transfer of any government land in Sindh until the province’s land record — huge amounts of which was destroyed in the rioting following the murder of Benazir Bhutto — was digitised. (The court conditionally lifted the ban in 2019 in instances where the record had been computerised.) But the ban meant little in the areas of Karachi where state land was plentiful. During retired Justice Maqbool Baqar’s tenure as chief minister Sindh in the runup to the 2024 election, an enquiry was held into allotments and mutations made by BoR Sindh between 2012 and 2023. That is, after the Supreme Court ban. Some of the findings are as follows. In Manghopir, district West, there were forged entries and fake allotments in land record; an incident of arson was committed in 2021 by revenue officials, including mukhtiarkars and tapedars, “to deliberately destroy fake entries kept by the revenue officials in collusion with private beneficiaries”. In deh Bund Murad, also district West, the enquiry found that “Government land worth billions of rupees in various na class … was illegally transferred to private individuals… .” Numerous revenue officials were named as being complicit and acquiring assets beyond their means. None of them appears to have been prosecuted. According to the 2018 JIT report on money laundering worth billions of rupees through fake bank accounts, 562 acres of state land in Sindh, including 363 acres of Pakistan Steel Mill land, were “illegally allotted to private builders causing a loss of Rs4.14 billion to the national exchequer”. The report also alleged that Bahria Town Ltd had remitted Rs10bn into the fake accounts as kickbacks for grabbing thousands of acres of state as well as private lands for its projects in Karachi. In 2023, a member of Sindh’s caretaker cabinet told Dawn : “[During the previous government,] the sub registrars and mukhtiarkars in Karachi would collect 600 to 700 million rupees per month for ‘upward’ distribution. They had a free hand. Even if someone’s land was legal, they would still charge according to the ‘system’ at the rate they had set, eg Korangi, Rs300,000 per acre. By transferring mukhtiarkars, we disrupted that system of collection.” Under the caretaker setup, per one government official, security agencies were said to have taken up the task of ‘cleaning the system’. Officials were assured that “ qabzas will not happen like before”. A number of people were even put on the ECL, unofficially if not officially. But despite those claims, rather little has changed in the way that real estate is occupied in the city. The faces may be different, but the practices remain the same. Thus, individuals like Mr Brohi have even greater sway than before; they are fixtures in the corridors of power, protected by their formidable patrons. According to a bureaucrat, “Even DIGs, senior government officials will go out of their way to maintain good relations with them.” Perhaps that is why Fayyaz Solangi, the former DC West who placed that damning notice in the newspapers against Mr Brohi back in 2020, put in another notice on July 8, 2025 — five years later — in Urdu, English and Sindhi newspapers containing a grovelling apology, and stating that an enquiry had not established allegations of land grabbing against him. An excerpt from the notice reads “…I had already apologized to him in person and directed my staff to issue corrigendum to this effect but unfortunately the same [was] not published on a timely basis and I was transferred…” Former DC West Fayyaz Solangi’s public apology to Mr Brohi published in Dawn on July 8, 2025. That shameful apology was a step too far, even for a severely compromised bureaucracy. Two days later, the former DC West swiftly found himself reduced to officer on special duty by the chief secretary Sindh. Mr Solangi did not respond to Dawn ’s repeated requests for comment. As for Jibrail Khan, the JUI-F local leader who ran afoul of certain political bigwigs, the intercession of his party leadership appears to have magically made the FIRs against him melt into thin air. Even though he has yet to obtain bail in all the cases, he is out of prison. The ‘system’ knows when compromise is a better closing gambit. *Some names have been changed to protect identity.

      "summary_en": "KARACHI: Around 4.30pm on Feb 25 last year, an altercation took place between two groups of people on Mai Kolachi Road, near the US consulate. While the details of the brawl itself are unclear, the bone of contention was allegedly a three-acre chunk of prime real estate located just off the thoroughfare. One of its two co-owners, builder and developer Javed Iqbal had employed a local JUI-F leader named Jibrail Khan, 32, to work there as a supervisor. Several sources claim that the huge plot is coveted by extremely powerful individuals at the top of the political food chain. Some days earlier, this party had sent in their supporters to occupy the plot. On Feb 25, Jibrail got into a heated confrontation with them. An FIR was filed against him for rioting armed with a deadly weapon, kidnapping and attempted murder. Several other FIRs (copies of which are in Dawn ’s possession) were also filed against him in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, including Shikarpur, Moro, Qazi Ahmed and Nawabshah for various crimes, ostensibly committed within the span of a few weeks, including theft of cattle, cash and a motorbike. He was arrested, taken to Central Jail and a few weeks later, transferred to prison in Nawabshah. According to an individual close to Jibrail, who originally hails from KP, “He’s never been anywhere in Sindh except for Karachi”. Even after he was acquitted by a Shaheed Benazirabad court, with the judicial magistrate in his order saying there had been an abuse of power and that Jibrail had been falsely implicated, he continued to be detained in the same prison. The plot’s co-owner, Mr Iqbal, alleges that a fake FIR was filed against him as well and he was detained by the Counter Terrorism Department police for four days, during which, he says, he was ordered to surrender the plot in writing. He refused; ultimately, he obtained relief from the Sindh High Court. Political big guns soon became involved. Rashid Mehmood Soomro, secretary general of JUI-F Sindh, issued a strongly worded statement on social media in Jibrail’s defence, describing the dispute as one in connection with a plot which “two big crocodiles are rushing to grab”. He denounced one of them as “someone who perhaps believes he owns Sindh, owns the country, and thinks he can use brute force to grab land…”; he warned that if the matter was not resolved quickly, Sindh would go up in flames. This is the tip of the iceberg that illustrates the lawlessness prevailing in Sindh, where an entire system allegedly operates free from the constraints of the law and institutional guardrails, beholden only to its political masters and their whims, and existing solely to rake in eyewatering fortunes for everyone involved. While the sources of this wealth are many and varied, Karachi’s precious real estate is the gift that keeps on giving, and it is the focus of this report. Sources within the political leadership, bureaucracy and civil society speak of a city divided up into zones, with a trusted front man (sometimes several) presiding over receipts from each area under his control. Among these are a seasoned medical professional, a civil servant active in brokering land deals, a business group that allegedly handles all the ‘earnings’ generated in the province, etc. Given the heft of the personalities involved, most sources were unwilling to speak on the record, but there is sufficient documentary evidence and on-ground reporting by Dawn to support their statements. Certain names have been changed to protect the individuals’ identity. With the law having been weaponised to silence the media, drawing too clear a picture can be fraught with risk, so readers are invited to connect the dots where possible. King of the West? In a country where political fortunes can go through cycles of boom and bust, Ali Hassan Brohi — also known as Ali Hassan Zehri because of his Baloch tribal ancestry — has suffered a setback of sorts. On Feb 3, he tendered his resignation from the Balochistan cabinet. But, given his powerful connections, this may be only a bump in the road. There was a time he was said to be on the run and allegedly in the crosshairs of the ‘encounter specialist’ — Rao Anwar, then SSP Malir. Fast forward to December 2024, he was sworn in as Balochistan’s minister for agriculture and cooperatives. His recent setbacks in that province notwithstanding, he is arguably one of the most powerful people in Sindh, rumoured to have the ear of no less than the president himself. Letter of resignation by Ali Hassan Zehri to CM Balochistan. Hailing from Bandhi, Nawabshah district (since renamed Shaheed Benazirabad), he was once, as a prominent politician told Dawn , in the employ of an octroi tax collector in Bolari, district Jamshoro. “He wasn’t even a manager, but a helper. However, according to the contractor, he was extremely sharp.” Showing a political savvy that was to stand him in good stead, Mr Brohi developed contacts with low-level PPP workers and over time, with senior party leaders in Nawabshah. With the help of his connections, alleges the politician, Mr Brohi gradually worked his way out of small-town Sindh to providing muscle for the PPP in connection with Karachi’s pricey real estate — but then, there was a falling out. Several sources confirmed to Dawn that Mr Brohi made a run for Balochistan; police close to the Sindh-Balochistan border had received orders from SSP Rao to ‘intercept’ him, and they fired upon his vehicle in the Mochko area, but he made it across. There he sought shelter with certain political and tribal heavyweights, two of whom are said to have paved the way for his rapprochement with his former benefactor several years later when they joined the PPP. Until then, though, Mr Brohi’s travails were far from over. On May 20, 2020, English and Urdu newspapers carried a public notice by the deputy commissioner, district West (the DC office is the most senior in the district revenue department). The notice declared Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claimed he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees. It read: “For his immense crimes of forgery and land grabs, Ali Hassan Brohi is under a comprehensive and impartial inquiry by this office. A significant number of fake entries managed by Ali Hassan Brohi in the revenue record of district West have been found, which will be conveyed to higher authorities with recommendations for cancellation and penal action after completion of scrutiny.” The notice asked for public assistance in gathering further information. Public notice published in a national daily, declaring Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claiming he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees. On the orders of Owais Muzaffar Tappi who was believed to run the system at the time, the then DC West Fayyaz Solangi retrieved the lands that Mr Brohi had allegedly grabbed. However, as this story will later show, Mr Solangi would come to regret following those orders so faithfully. In 2021, FIA’s corporate crime circle, Karachi office, instituted an enquiry based on what it claimed was a reference from the DIG CTD, Sindh, in which Mr Brohi and eight others were named on the basis of an FIR (no 811/2021) filed in Karachi. Briefly, the FIR accused Mr Brohi of having taken Rs20 million from drug dealers to bribe two policemen with Rs7m to get two of his alleged front men to spring three Nigerian nationals from custody. According to the FIA’s brief, subsequent enquiries brought to light 14 FIRs dating from 2007 till 2020, in which Mr Brohi is named as the accused in eight, while the rest nominate two other individuals described as his “front men”. The charges against him include terrorism, murder, attempted murder, rioting armed with a deadly weapon, dacoity, causing hurt and criminal intimidation, among others. The document also names nine “front men” of Mr Brohi in whose name the latter had “acquired/ purchased various properties in different areas” of Karachi. These findings, according to the brief, are based on only a partial record, some of it obtained from the digitised records compiled by the Land Revenue Management Information Systems (LARMIS), Board of Revenue (BoR), Sindh. Mr Brohi did not respond to questions put to him in writing by Dawn regarding these allegations and other claims about him by sources quoted in this report. (Of the eight FIRs in which Mr Brohi is nominated as the sole accused, police sources contacted by Dawn were able to confirm three FIRs from their record, plus two more registered in 2021 that are not listed in the FIA brief.) In conclusion, the brief says that in December 2021, the enquiry was transferred to FIA headquarters in Islamabad. The story of that transfer is revealing in its brazen conflict of interest. In March 2021, Mr Brohi’s wife, Samina Mumtaz Zehri was elected to the Senate on a reserved women’s seat. According to a senior political leader, her election was managed by former ISI chief Faiz Hameed, who had her vote shifted to Hub from Karachi and presented her as a Senate candidate from the Balochistan Awami Party. (The BAP is well known to have the military establishment’s backing.) After her election, Ms Zehri became a member of the standing committee on interior. At its meeting on Oct 22, 2021, the minutes of which are in Dawn ’s possession, the members made several recommendations. One of these reads: “Senators Rana Maqbool Ahmed, Azam Nazir Tarar and Muhammad Talha Mahmood were of the considered opinion that Dr Farooq, deputy director of FIA, Karachi has now become a controversial officer and the case pointed by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri should be transferred to Islamabad and interrogated…” The case in question was the FIA’s inquiry into Ms Zehri’s own husband. As per its letter dated Dec 27, 2021 acknowledging the standing committee’s decision, the DG FIA’s Islamabad office directed that the enquiry report be submitted for perusal to the DG, FIA within a fortnight. The DG FIA did not respond to repeated requests in writing from Dawn as to the fate of the enquiry. Minutes of the meeting of the Senate standing committee on interior from Oct 22, 2021. On Nov 4, 2024, Senior Vice President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry Saquib Fayyaz Magoon wrote to Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah about a complaint forwarded to him by President, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industries Jawed Bilwani. The complaint, by businessman Shoaib Razzak Makkad and also dated Nov 4, 2024, was enclosed with the letter to the chief secretary. Mr Makkad in his complaint stated that he was a partner in Salina International, a salt manufacturing business. According to him, he was “in possession of land measuring 54.3 acres since 2019” in Mauripur, district Keamari. “…[O]n June 28, 2024, Tapedar … and Tapedar …, notable front men of Ali Hassan Brohi, with some unknown people came with heavy weapons and … encroached on the entire land. They are still today residing [there] with heavy weapons.” Saquib Fayyaz Magoon’s letter to chief secretary Sindh. A senior government officer told Dawn , “In districts West and Keamari, without Ali Hassan’s NOC, neither DC, nor SSP, nor mukhtiarkar, nor some ACs — such as of Manghopir and Mauripur — can be appointed.” This view was corroborated by sources in the police, bureaucracy, business sector and PPP itself. A seasoned bureaucrat said that even after lease papers for a particular housing society in district West had been signed, “the AC and mukhtiarkar wouldn’t make an entry in their mutation registers because they don’t do anything unless specifically ordered by Ali Hassan.” (A mukhtiarkar is a BoR official just below the assistant commissioner, responsible for processing and issuing documents related to land revenue, which makes this an extremely powerful post.) This is not to suggest that Mr Brohi is the only one whose name crops up in context of allegedly questionable land dealings. However, given his political profile, he is arguably the most prominent among these individuals. Dirty business Before moving on to the other actors in the sordid saga of land grabbing in Karachi, a brief note on how land ownership is created followed by some instances of shady real estate dealings that Dawn has uncovered. The Board of Revenue, Sindh is original custodian of all the land in the province. Aside from revenue collection and maintaining land records in Sindh, BoR allots land to individuals, societies and various institutions and development authorities such as Karachi Development Authority (KDA), Lyari Development Authority (LDA), Defence Housing Authority, etc to develop schemes for specific purposes. Relevant revenue officials ‘survey’ an area of state land and divide it into blocks with each given a unique identifier called a “survey number”. The surveyed land can then be allotted according to a procedure specified under the Sindh Colonisation and Disposal of Government Land Rules, 2005. Unsurveyed land is termed ‘ na class’ land, which belongs to the original owner, the state, which holds it in trust for the public. Na class or unsurveyed land is distinguished on BoR maps by a different colour and different sequence of numbers than surveyed land. But evidence that rules of procedure are being violated with breathtaking impunity — and with full knowledge of the authorities — lies scattered all across Karachi. Districts West (particularly in Halkani, Bund Murad and Jam Chakro), Keamari (which was carved out of the original district West in 2020), East and Malir have become increasingly attractive for builders. “To make a project viable inside the city is quite difficult because you can’t find big chunks of land there, and whatever land that does exist there is expensive,” says Hamid Khan* of the Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD). “That’s why builders tend to focus on the suburbs.” No doubt there are countless examples of illegal land use within Karachi proper, including encroachment on amenity plots, by elements connected with all political parties — PPP, MQM and ANP (during the latter two’s heyday in the city), and even by the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan for a period. For reasons of space, however, this report focuses on Karachi’s outlying areas and encroachments within recent years. Dawn Investigations visited multiple sites in district West, as well as the huge development scheme known as Hawkesbay Scheme 42 in district Keamari. Where until some years ago there were vast stretches of empty land dotted with goths (rural settlements), dozens of gated housing schemes are now coming up, many boasting little more than an entrance, a boundary wall and a booking office where dubious claims about the builders’ title to land are made. Take Al-Jannat City by MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd in deh Halkani, for example. Mohammed Aqeel in the booking office informs the Dawn correspondent, who approaches him as a prospective investor, that there are 575 residential plots of 120 sq yards each available here, and a number of commercial plots. The proposed layout plan displayed in the booking office shows the project as being spread across 32.8 acres on survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61. The salesperson says six families are already residing in the society while around 20 houses are under construction. Residential plots cost between Rs3 to 3.5 million, with all sales final. Calculated at Rs3.3m each, the residential plots alone add up to at least Rs1.84 billion. A masterplan of the housing society is plastered on a wall inside the Al Jannat City office. “If you delay buying for a month, the price could cross four million rupees,” cautions Mr Aqeel. “Construction has been picking up pace here and there’s no other leased project nearing completion in the area.” He adds: “We have been issuing sub-leases to owners of the plots.” The question is: how is that possible when the land on which Al-Jannat City is coming up does not even belong to the builder? Mr Aqeel claims LDA has leased the land to the builders, but tellingly, he refuses to show the lease. “Not until you purchase a plot,” he says firmly. (Deh Halkani is part of what is known as Scheme 43, which the BoR has given only as a ‘controlled’ area to LDA. The Authority itself has no lease for it.) To delve deeper into the builder’s claims, Dawn GIS department referred to the digitised data in LARMIS. The apex court in 2012 banned the mutation of public land in Sindh, but in 2019, it partially lifted the ban in areas where the land record had been digitised. Thus, one can reasonably assume that the LARMIS data, where it exists, is up to date. It turns out that survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61 actually lie on the other side of the road from where Al-Jannat City is coming up. The project is located on what is entirely state land. Interestingly, taken together, these survey numbers almost mirror the dimensions of the project itself. A short drive away on the main road is Alvisha Housing Society by the same builder, located opposite the Ijtema Gah where a mammoth religious congregation gathers every year. The salesman at the project office tells the correspondent that 120- and 160-sq yard residential and 200 sq yard commercial plots are available for sale in blocks A, B and C. In block C, a 120 sq yard plot costs Rs2.8m lump sum, and Rs3.6m on a 42-month installment plan. When asked about official approvals, one of the two men present says that for the time being, the plots in block A, where the office is located, are being offered on sale to “those who have faith in the builder” and not to the general public. When asked why that is so, he admits that the “paperwork for block A is not 100 per cent complete, unlike blocks B and C.” He lays out the society’s proposed layout plan on the desk; it lists the survey numbers (86, 87, 88 and 89) on which it is being constructed. Frontline Marketing, which is handling the project, shares with Dawn an NOC issued by LDA which also mentions the same survey numbers, 86 to 89. However, Dawn ’s GIS department has determined that these survey numbers lie quite some distance away, in the direction where the men in the sales office vaguely indicated that blocks B and C will come up. Moreover, Alvisha’s block A is actually situated on survey numbers 96 and 97. It is not known what is the reason for this discrepancy. Maps showing the Alvisha and Al-Jannat housing schemes. But revenue officials tell Dawn this kind of discrepancy is very common. One explains it thus: “Sometimes there are other claimants to the land; sometimes builders will use ownership of one piece of survey land to falsely claim ownership over other surveyed land, or even over unsurveyed land; another ploy is to get a fake allotment of unsurveyed land and, after possession, go to the revenue department for a survey number.” Dawn ’s letter to MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd was returned. Another letter with questions to Frontline Marketing received no response either. With around 60 projects in Karachi, GFS Builders & Developers is one of the big players in Pakistan’s real estate market. Supported by a slick marketing campaign, its numerous smooth-talking salespersons push discount offers, and district West is dotted with a number of their projects. A closer look at North Town Residency Phase-2 exposes some shocking facts. According to an ‘NOC’ for sale and advertisement of plots in NTR phase 2 issued by the Sindh Building Control Association, the project measures 30 acres on land bearing survey numbers 363 to 367 “out of na class no 294 in deh Halkani”. The BoR map submitted to the Supreme Court in 2013 clearly shows this entire area — which falls partly in deh Halkani and partly in deh Bund Murad — as being na class (or unsurveyed/state land). The LARMIS website currently shows the same situation in deh Halkani. The map for deh Bund Murad is missing. Dawn received no response to questions it sent in writing to the GFS CEO. Map of GFS North Town Phase 2. (Dawn repeatedly contacted the DC West; Senior Member Board of Revenue, Sindh with a cc to the Chief Secretary, Sindh; Member, Land Utilisation, BoR; and Project Director, LARMIS to ask about the provenance of the survey numbers in connection with the aforementioned housing projects. There was no response from any of them except for LARMIS Assistant Director, Coordination, Hafeezullah Abbasi. Mr Abbasi informed Dawn over the phone that LARMIS does not possess the data in question. “We can only digitise the data that we have been provided.”) Filthy rich Interestingly, the above-mentioned na class number — no 294 — from which piece of land GFS representatives claim that survey numbers 363 to 367 have been carved out for its North Town Residency-Phase 2, crops up in a complaint to NAB about huge tracts of land being illegally taken over and sold. A list of suspicious sales/allotments was enclosed with the complaint, mentioning the survey/ na class numbers, area and value, and ‘sellers’ and ‘purchasers’ of the land in question. According to this, 82 acres on na class numbers 284 – 294 were illegally sold/allotted to GFS. The dubious transactions listed in the complaint to NAB involve nearly 1,500 acres, including around 1,150 acres of state land. On Oct 11, 2023, NAB wrote to DC West informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land”, and asking him to furnish NAB with a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023. Letter written by NAB to the DC West, informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land” in the district and seeking a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023. Repeated attempts to seek NAB’s official response to this complaint went unanswered. Sources told Dawn that NAB had initiated a formal enquiry based on the allegations in this complaint, but recently, 166 cases, enquiries, references and complaints relating to the departments of revenue, local government and food had been transferred to Sindh’s Anti-Corruption Establishment. The list enclosed with the complaint to NAB lays bare how predatory networks have hollowed out governance in Sindh — like locusts stripping bare every field they descend upon. Those who acquired the land allegedly through illegal sale/allotment include a number of well-known builders and developers. And among those accused of supplying them the land — the ‘sellers’ — are Ali Hassan Brohi, an SHO and a mukhtiarkar. The cop is Ghulam Hussain Korai, then SHO Manghopir in district West. Consider just one of the parcels of land that he, jointly with one Yousuf Brohi, is accused of grabbing: 200 acres of state land in deh Bund Murad which was, as per this document, worth an eye-watering Rs4 bn. An SHO can be a grade 14 (sub-inspector) or grade 16 (inspector) officer, whose monthly salary is at the most Rs120,000. In December 2024, after complaints by a number of businessmen about brazen land grabbing in Karachi became too vociferous to ignore, the powers that be ordered the Sindh government to address the issue. Inspector Korai was among five police officers who were subsequently transferred to desk jobs at the police headquarters. (A number of revenue officials were also transferred, though often replaced, say sources, with others of equally ill repute but boasting strong ties with those who matter in the provincial leadership.) In response to Dawn ’s questions, Inspector Korai described the allegations against him as “false, fabricated, and baseless … the [Association of Builders & Developers] have withdrawn their application, and the issue has been resolved accordingly.” He enclosed a letter from ABAD with his response. An excerpt from it reads: “… due to unavoidable circumstances the complainant currently displaying a lack of coordination with ABAD regarding their submitted complaints … We hereby request to withdraw the complaint against him.” Dawn was unable to confirm the nature of the “unavoidable circumstances”. Mr Korai remains without any posting. Sources say he has been sanctioned several times for misconduct. There is on the same list one Ejaz, described as mukhtiarkar Scheme 33, who is alleged to have handed over in a fraudulent manner seven acres in Scheme 33 itself to an undisclosed builder and developer. This appears to be a reference to Aijazul Hassan Khan. Incidentally, Mr Aijaz was among 11 mukhtiarkars suspended in 2023 for land fraud. It is difficult to overstate the cruel irony in this situation. While public land gets siphoned away by unscrupulous builders hand in glove with rapacious elements from the ruling elite and corrupt government officials, affordable public sector housing schemes almost never go beyond the blueprint. Hawkesbay Scheme 42, Karachi’s oldest public sector project, is a stark example. This scheme was started in 1984 for the low- and middle-income segment by KDA and transferred to LDA in 1996. Over four decades later, much of it is still undeveloped and without electricity or water. Many original allottees remained unable during their lifetime to take possession of their plots, which they had paid for with their hard-earned money. Scheme 42 even includes a block exclusively for overseas Pakistanis, but they too have nothing to show for their investment till today. And yet, those with no right to the land but plenty of clout have staked their claim to the overseas block by building a boundary wall around its perimeter, repeatedly. Each time the wall is bulldozed by the authorities, it comes up again within no time. An illegal housing society called Aashqan-e-Mustafa has materialised along the Suparco Road which cuts through Scheme 42. Two front men of an MPA are said to be handling transactions. A view of the Aashqan-e-Mustafa society’s site office. A view of the Aashqan-e-Mustafa society on Suparco Road. When a Dawn Investigations team visits, a man strolls up, asking if they are interested in a plot and if so, to take their queries to Madina Real Estate nearby. There are 100- or 120-square yard plots available for sale here, says the realtor: “a 400-sq yard commercial plot alongside the main road costs Rs6.5m with cash payment over three months.” When asked whether the society has a lease from the development authority, he replies: “No, it’s not leased but this is part of the Gothabad Scheme, so you’ll get a sanad if you buy here.” This means the government had notified this piece of state land for a goth situated here — ostensibly in this case, Kachelo Goth. However, sanads can only be issued to the original residents of a goth . Incidentally, Kachelo Goth actually lies around 2km away. A map of the Aashqan-e-Mustafa society. Predictably, the Gothabad Scheme over the years has become another vehicle for corruption since it began in 1987 to provide housing to the deserving indigenous population in rural Sindh. Gothabad mukhiarkars began issuing fake sanads, even multiple sanads to one individual to enable the latter to claim title over a large area. Mohammed Shahnawaz at the Aashqan-e-Mustafa housing society site office in fact claimed that buyers would be given backdated sanads because “sanads stopped being issued after 2012”. Dawn received no response to questions addressed in writing to the proprietors of Aashqan-e-Mustafa. In June 2014, during Supreme Court hearings into the Karachi unrest case, BoR submitted a report stating that 59,803 acres of state land had been encroached upon. Backroom land deals are not mere irregularities — they are a fundamental breach of public trust. State land is not for the government to bestow upon whomever it favours, which is why a recent Sindh High Court judgement underscored that, in the interest of transparency, state land must be disposed of through an open auction. Fake NOCs, no paper trail All the housing societies investigated for this report happen to fall under LDA. Ahmed Saeed*, who is very familiar with the LDA’s workings, reveals that the Authority has in umpteen instances showed ‘ na class ’ land (ie unsurveyed land which cannot be allotted to anyone and on which no project can be constructed) as survey land. He alleges that everyone, including BoR, is party to the fraud. According to him, the landgrabber writes to the Director General LDA to request an NOC for the layout plan on what they claim is their land. The DG sends the letter to the relevant DC, asking for clarification on the status of the land in question. The DC forwards it to the mukhtiarkar who takes out a report which then goes back to the DC, who forwards it to the DG confirming the land does indeed belong to the interested party. “The official fee for approval of the layout plan is Rs1.3m per acre, and the bribe for showing na class land as survey land is Rs500,000 per acre,” says Mr Saeed. “But because the letters have been sent around by hand, not by a dispatcher, there’s no trail. LDA will say they did this on BoR’s say-so; if you ask BoR for verification, they’ll say this is state land and they never gave approval for it. You show them the correspondence — and they’ll say it’s fake, but they all know. They’re all involved.” In other words, classic smoke and mirrors. At his office, a rather harried-looking DG LDA Safdar Bughio, tells Dawn : “Our planning department verifies ownership through the concerned DC office; it’s BoR that checks whether the builder has ownership or not. When they confirm ownership title, then our planning department does the technical work on it [to issue NOC for layout plan].” LDA planning department head, Mohammed Arbab, toes a similar line: “Our mandate and function is the KBTPR [Karachi Building and Town Planning Rules]. We are only a town planning agency. The identification of the land is done by the DC, title verification is done by the DC, record of survey numbers is with the DC.” However, Mr Bughio concedes there are some illegal housing societies. “It is also our responsibility to stop them. We do stop them, but officially we deal only with those who come for [layout plan] NOCs from us. But definitely I will soon start a programme in which we will take on the responsibility of dealing with them.” As for Mr Arbab, when pressed further on the issue, he says: “ Qabzay bhi wohi log kartay hain … na class land pay jin kay hukoomati links hotay hain.” (Encroachment on state land is done by those who have government connections.) Other cogs in the wheel There are nevertheless some public servants who try to discharge their duty with at least a degree of integrity. In instances where the mukhtiarkar concerned takes action and issues a notice to a suspected land grabber, the latter can approach the anti-encroachment tribunal. The Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010, empowers anti-encroachment tribunals headed by a retired district and sessions judge or an advocate of 10 years’ standing to determine the rights of the parties involved. Too often, though, the only anti-encroachment tribunal in Karachi has given questionable decisions. In fact, several sources told Dawn that encroachers go to the tribunal with fake/ forged documents to establish title to the land they have grabbed by obtaining a stay order. “It’s simple,” says Umair Rafiq*, a senior bureaucrat. “Go meet the court reader, file an application quickly and get a stay. Then anyone who visits that land becomes guilty of contempt. You just pay one or two million rupees for this.” Dawn has in its possession the copy of an order in suit no 15/ 2024, issued on July 23, 2024, by Muneer Bhutto, district and sessions judge and, until recently, presiding officer of the anti-encroachment tribunal. The plaintiff is Al-Faiz Builders Pvt Ltd while the defendants include officials from BoR, SBCA, LDA, anti-encroachment police personnel, etc. In his interim order, the presiding offer restrained “the defendants, their agents and anyone on their behalf from eject[ting], evict[ing], dispossess[ing] the plaintiff from the suit property ie 32 acres land na class No 42 situated at Deh Methan, tapo Manghopir, district Keamari”. Interestingly, the same presiding officer (now heading the Karachi Water & Sewerage Tribunal) was the focus of a complaint made earlier that year. In a letter dated Jan 30, 2024, a copy of which is available with Dawn , the DC East wrote to the Sindh High Court Registrar, the Member Inspection Team-II (a body that handles complaints against judicial officers in the district and lower courts), requesting further action on a complaint against Mr Bhutto that had been forwarded to him by the assistant commissioner East. With his letter, he enclosed a report submitted by a mukhtiarkar of Karachi East, Muhammad Irfan Lashari. Mr Lashari in his complaint alleged that the presiding officer had granted a stay to land grabbers on 500 sq yards of state land at Fateh Mohammed Gabol Goth that had been reserved by the Sindh government for a dispensary for the local residents. In fact, he said in his report, possession had already been given to the health department representative with documentation to the effect. According to him, through the stay order, a contempt of court notice against him and letter of suspension, he was “pressurised to follow the unlawful order passed by the presiding officer of the tribunal. … The stay orders … not only provide cover to the land grabbers but also encourage them to usurp more state land in connivance with support of presiding officer of the said tribunal and his staff…” Nothing came of this complaint. In fact, sources said that a “fake case” had been filed against the DC concerned, his properties were attached and he was declared an absconder. (On Oct 15, 2025, in a development unrelated to Mr Lashari’s complaint, Muneer Bhutto was found guilty of misconduct after an enquiry by MIT member Justice Muhammad Faisal Kamal Alam of the Sindh High Court that began in 2021. Concluding that Mr Bhutto had “misused” his “senior official position”, the MIT imposed on him “the minor penalty of withholding of annual increment for a period of three years”.) Despite repeated attempts, Mr Bhutto refused to receive Dawn ’s letter with questions regarding the above allegations. Nothing oils the wheels of elite capture like a corrupt bureaucracy. Seasoned bureaucrats hold that officers were generally appointed on merit in Benazir Bhutto’s time, but this changed after her assassination in December 2007. “As soon as PPP’s victory in the 2008 election seemed assured, officers began to get calls from the PPP leadership telling them to refrain from recruitment and from making any appointments,” says Rashid Saleem*, a retired assistant commissioner. “As soon as they came in, they began to recruit their own people.” The passage of the 18th Amendment, say old-school bureaucrats, removed the guardrails entirely. “The 2012 recruits were rapidly promoted and are now in grade 19. Soon they’ll be in grade 20, secretary level. God help Sindh when that happens,” says Mr Saleem. According to several senior civil servants, the Sindh Public Service Commission’s (SPSC) examination process has become seriously compromised, with ‘favoured’ candidates awarded inflated scores in the oral segment while deserving candidates are failed despite strong written performances. Each recruitment, appointment and promotion has a price, they claim. Journalist Imdad Soomro has extensively investigated corruption in the SPSC. “To get recruited into a department, one has to pay between Rs5m to Rs10m,” he alleges. At the other end of the spectrum are the top posts, such as assistant commissioner, excise and taxation officer, DSP, mukhtiarkar, etc for which candidates must sit the Combined Competitive Examination or CCE. The ‘rates’ are higher for such “ kamanay walay [lucrative] posts” as Mr Soomro puts it. According to him, to become AC or ETO, one must pay Rs80m; appointment as mukhtiarkar entails a bribe of Rs40m. According to a retired official, “There’s an exam called the revenue qualifier exam for clerical staff who have served three years in the Revenue Department. Clerks have paid Rs15m to Rs20m to become assistant mukhtiarkar. Close to 30 clerks have become assistant mukhtiarkars in this manner.” Often, all it takes for career advancement is to cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship with a political patron. Dawn was told that in one land development authority, an individual on a contingency contract as a watchman was now a grade-19 officer on an extremely important post. The great Karachi land grab Real estate in Karachi has been the cause of much disorder and violence. The final JIT report looking into the murder on March 13, 2013 of Perween Rahman, director of the Orangi Pilot Project, offered a revealing commentary. Referring to the period between 2006-2012, and the ethnic conflict between Pashtuns and Mohajirs, it noted that cadres of both MQM and ANP were heavily involved in various criminal activities, especially land grabbing, as were the Taliban who were a potent militant force in Karachi at the time. “… whatever their stated political differences, all three groups worked hand in glove … Big developers … would ally themselves with these groups, using the militant wings of these groups as their ‘muscle’, in order to forcibly seize land. Anyone who came in their way was either threatened, or if they refused to back off, killed. …[O]ften murders that were declared as being politically motivated or acts of terrorism, were in actual fact land disputes that were made to look like political killings to cover up the real facts. The state apparatus, in the shape of the land revenue administration or the police, was either too weak, or complicit in the face of the great Karachi land grab.” It was against this backdrop that the then Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in 2012 while hearing the Karachi ‘badamni’ (unrest) case, banned the Sindh government from effecting mutation, allotment, or transfer of any government land in Sindh until the province’s land record — huge amounts of which was destroyed in the rioting following the murder of Benazir Bhutto — was digitised. (The court conditionally lifted the ban in 2019 in instances where the record had been computerised.) But the ban meant little in the areas of Karachi where state land was plentiful. During retired Justice Maqbool Baqar’s tenure as chief minister Sindh in the runup to the 2024 election, an enquiry was held into allotments and mutations made by BoR Sindh between 2012 and 2023. That is, after the Supreme Court ban. Some of the findings are as follows. In Manghopir, district West, there were forged entries and fake allotments in land record; an incident of arson was committed in 2021 by revenue officials, including mukhtiarkars and tapedars, “to deliberately destroy fake entries kept by the revenue officials in collusion with private beneficiaries”. In deh Bund Murad, also district West, the enquiry found that “Government land worth billions of rupees in various na class … was illegally transferred to private individuals… .” Numerous revenue officials were named as being complicit and acquiring assets beyond their means. None of them appears to have been prosecuted. According to the 2018 JIT report on money laundering worth billions of rupees through fake bank accounts, 562 acres of state land in Sindh, including 363 acres of Pakistan Steel Mill land, were “illegally allotted to private builders causing a loss of Rs4.14 billion to the national exchequer”. The report also alleged that Bahria Town Ltd had remitted Rs10bn into the fake accounts as kickbacks for grabbing thousands of acres of state as well as private lands for its projects in Karachi. In 2023, a member of Sindh’s caretaker cabinet told Dawn : “[During the previous government,] the sub registrars and mukhtiarkars in Karachi would collect 600 to 700 million rupees per month for ‘upward’ distribution. They had a free hand. Even if someone’s land was legal, they would still charge according to the ‘system’ at the rate they had set, eg Korangi, Rs300,000 per acre. By transferring mukhtiarkars, we disrupted that system of collection.” Under the caretaker setup, per one government official, security agencies were said to have taken up the task of ‘cleaning the system’. Officials were assured that “ qabzas will not happen like before”. A number of people were even put on the ECL, unofficially if not officially. But despite those claims, rather little has changed in the way that real estate is occupied in the city. The faces may be different, but the practices remain the same. Thus, individuals like Mr Brohi have even greater sway than before; they are fixtures in the corridors of power, protected by their formidable patrons. According to a bureaucrat, “Even DIGs, senior government officials will go out of their way to maintain good relations with them.” Perhaps that is why Fayyaz Solangi, the former DC West who placed that damning notice in the newspapers against Mr Brohi back in 2020, put in another notice on July 8, 2025 — five years later — in Urdu, English and Sindhi newspapers containing a grovelling apology, and stating that an enquiry had not established allegations of land grabbing against him. An excerpt from the notice reads “…I had already apologized to him in person and directed my staff to issue corrigendum to this effect but unfortunately the same [was] not published on a timely basis and I was transferred…” Former DC West Fayyaz Solangi’s public apology to Mr Brohi published in Dawn on July 8, 2025. That shameful apology was a step too far, even for a severely compromised bureaucracy. Two days later, the former DC West swiftly found himself reduced to officer on special duty by the chief secretary Sindh. Mr Solangi did not respond to Dawn ’s repeated requests for comment. As for Jibrail Khan, the JUI-F local leader who ran afoul of certain political bigwigs, the intercession of his party leadership appears to have magically made the FIRs against him melt into thin air. Even though he has yet to obtain bail in all the cases, he is out of prison. The ‘system’ knows when compromise is a better closing gambit. *Some names have been changed to protect identity.

      "title": "Systemic rot: How a ‘system’ of corrupt officials and politicians is usurping Karachi’s prime real estate",
      "summary": "KARACHI: Around 4.30pm on Feb 25 last year, an altercation took place between two groups of people on Mai Kolachi Road, near the US consulate. While the details of the brawl itself are unclear, the bone of contention was allegedly a three-acre chunk of prime real estate located just off the thoroughfare. One of its two co-owners, builder and developer Javed Iqbal had employed a local JUI-F leader named Jibrail Khan, 32, to work there as a supervisor. Several sources claim that the huge plot is coveted by extremely powerful individuals at the top of the political food chain. Some days earlier, this party had sent in their supporters to occupy the plot. On Feb 25, Jibrail got into a heated confrontation with them. An FIR was filed against him for rioting armed with a deadly weapon, kidnapping and attempted murder. Several other FIRs (copies of which are in Dawn ’s possession) were also filed against him in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, including Shikarpur, Moro, Qazi Ahmed and Nawabshah for various crimes, ostensibly committed within the span of a few weeks, including theft of cattle, cash and a motorbike. He was arrested, taken to Central Jail and a few weeks later, transferred to prison in Nawabshah. According to an individual close to Jibrail, who originally hails from KP, “He’s never been anywhere in Sindh except for Karachi”. Even after he was acquitted by a Shaheed Benazirabad court, with the judicial magistrate in his order saying there had been an abuse of power and that Jibrail had been falsely implicated, he continued to be detained in the same prison. The plot’s co-owner, Mr Iqbal, alleges that a fake FIR was filed against him as well and he was detained by the Counter Terrorism Department police for four days, during which, he says, he was ordered to surrender the plot in writing. He refused; ultimately, he obtained relief from the Sindh High Court. Political big guns soon became involved. Rashid Mehmood Soomro, secretary general of JUI-F Sindh, issued a strongly worded statement on social media in Jibrail’s defence, describing the dispute as one in connection with a plot which “two big crocodiles are rushing to grab”. He denounced one of them as “someone who perhaps believes he owns Sindh, owns the country, and thinks he can use brute force to grab land…”; he warned that if the matter was not resolved quickly, Sindh would go up in flames. This is the tip of the iceberg that illustrates the lawlessness prevailing in Sindh, where an entire system allegedly operates free from the constraints of the law and institutional guardrails, beholden only to its political masters and their whims, and existing solely to rake in eyewatering fortunes for everyone involved. While the sources of this wealth are many and varied, Karachi’s precious real estate is the gift that keeps on giving, and it is the focus of this report. Sources within the political leadership, bureaucracy and civil society speak of a city divided up into zones, with a trusted front man (sometimes several) presiding over receipts from each area under his control. Among these are a seasoned medical professional, a civil servant active in brokering land deals, a business group that allegedly handles all the ‘earnings’ generated in the province, etc. Given the heft of the personalities involved, most sources were unwilling to speak on the record, but there is sufficient documentary evidence and on-ground reporting by Dawn to support their statements. Certain names have been changed to protect the individuals’ identity. With the law having been weaponised to silence the media, drawing too clear a picture can be fraught with risk, so readers are invited to connect the dots where possible. King of the West? In a country where political fortunes can go through cycles of boom and bust, Ali Hassan Brohi — also known as Ali Hassan Zehri because of his Baloch tribal ancestry — has suffered a setback of sorts. On Feb 3, he tendered his resignation from the Balochistan cabinet. But, given his powerful connections, this may be only a bump in the road. There was a time he was said to be on the run and allegedly in the crosshairs of the ‘encounter specialist’ — Rao Anwar, then SSP Malir. Fast forward to December 2024, he was sworn in as Balochistan’s minister for agriculture and cooperatives. His recent setbacks in that province notwithstanding, he is arguably one of the most powerful people in Sindh, rumoured to have the ear of no less than the president himself. Letter of resignation by Ali Hassan Zehri to CM Balochistan. Hailing from Bandhi, Nawabshah district (since renamed Shaheed Benazirabad), he was once, as a prominent politician told Dawn , in the employ of an octroi tax collector in Bolari, district Jamshoro. “He wasn’t even a manager, but a helper. However, according to the contractor, he was extremely sharp.” Showing a political savvy that was to stand him in good stead, Mr Brohi developed contacts with low-level PPP workers and over time, with senior party leaders in Nawabshah. With the help of his connections, alleges the politician, Mr Brohi gradually worked his way out of small-town Sindh to providing muscle for the PPP in connection with Karachi’s pricey real estate — but then, there was a falling out. Several sources confirmed to Dawn that Mr Brohi made a run for Balochistan; police close to the Sindh-Balochistan border had received orders from SSP Rao to ‘intercept’ him, and they fired upon his vehicle in the Mochko area, but he made it across. There he sought shelter with certain political and tribal heavyweights, two of whom are said to have paved the way for his rapprochement with his former benefactor several years later when they joined the PPP. Until then, though, Mr Brohi’s travails were far from over. On May 20, 2020, English and Urdu newspapers carried a public notice by the deputy commissioner, district West (the DC office is the most senior in the district revenue department). The notice declared Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claimed he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees. It read: “For his immense crimes of forgery and land grabs, Ali Hassan Brohi is under a comprehensive and impartial inquiry by this office. A significant number of fake entries managed by Ali Hassan Brohi in the revenue record of district West have been found, which will be conveyed to higher authorities with recommendations for cancellation and penal action after completion of scrutiny.” The notice asked for public assistance in gathering further information. Public notice published in a national daily, declaring Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claiming he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees. On the orders of Owais Muzaffar Tappi who was believed to run the system at the time, the then DC West Fayyaz Solangi retrieved the lands that Mr Brohi had allegedly grabbed. However, as this story will later show, Mr Solangi would come to regret following those orders so faithfully. In 2021, FIA’s corporate crime circle, Karachi office, instituted an enquiry based on what it claimed was a reference from the DIG CTD, Sindh, in which Mr Brohi and eight others were named on the basis of an FIR (no 811/2021) filed in Karachi. Briefly, the FIR accused Mr Brohi of having taken Rs20 million from drug dealers to bribe two policemen with Rs7m to get two of his alleged front men to spring three Nigerian nationals from custody. According to the FIA’s brief, subsequent enquiries brought to light 14 FIRs dating from 2007 till 2020, in which Mr Brohi is named as the accused in eight, while the rest nominate two other individuals described as his “front men”. The charges against him include terrorism, murder, attempted murder, rioting armed with a deadly weapon, dacoity, causing hurt and criminal intimidation, among others. The document also names nine “front men” of Mr Brohi in whose name the latter had “acquired/ purchased various properties in different areas” of Karachi. These findings, according to the brief, are based on only a partial record, some of it obtained from the digitised records compiled by the Land Revenue Management Information Systems (LARMIS), Board of Revenue (BoR), Sindh. Mr Brohi did not respond to questions put to him in writing by Dawn regarding these allegations and other claims about him by sources quoted in this report. (Of the eight FIRs in which Mr Brohi is nominated as the sole accused, police sources contacted by Dawn were able to confirm three FIRs from their record, plus two more registered in 2021 that are not listed in the FIA brief.) In conclusion, the brief says that in December 2021, the enquiry was transferred to FIA headquarters in Islamabad. The story of that transfer is revealing in its brazen conflict of interest. In March 2021, Mr Brohi’s wife, Samina Mumtaz Zehri was elected to the Senate on a reserved women’s seat. According to a senior political leader, her election was managed by former ISI chief Faiz Hameed, who had her vote shifted to Hub from Karachi and presented her as a Senate candidate from the Balochistan Awami Party. (The BAP is well known to have the military establishment’s backing.) After her election, Ms Zehri became a member of the standing committee on interior. At its meeting on Oct 22, 2021, the minutes of which are in Dawn ’s possession, the members made several recommendations. One of these reads: “Senators Rana Maqbool Ahmed, Azam Nazir Tarar and Muhammad Talha Mahmood were of the considered opinion that Dr Farooq, deputy director of FIA, Karachi has now become a controversial officer and the case pointed by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri should be transferred to Islamabad and interrogated…” The case in question was the FIA’s inquiry into Ms Zehri’s own husband. As per its letter dated Dec 27, 2021 acknowledging the standing committee’s decision, the DG FIA’s Islamabad office directed that the enquiry report be submitted for perusal to the DG, FIA within a fortnight. The DG FIA did not respond to repeated requests in writing from Dawn as to the fate of the enquiry. Minutes of the meeting of the Senate standing committee on interior from Oct 22, 2021. On Nov 4, 2024, Senior Vice President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry Saquib Fayyaz Magoon wrote to Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah about a complaint forwarded to him by President, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industries Jawed Bilwani. The complaint, by businessman Shoaib Razzak Makkad and also dated Nov 4, 2024, was enclosed with the letter to the chief secretary. Mr Makkad in his complaint stated that he was a partner in Salina International, a salt manufacturing business. According to him, he was “in possession of land measuring 54.3 acres since 2019” in Mauripur, district Keamari. “…[O]n June 28, 2024, Tapedar … and Tapedar …, notable front men of Ali Hassan Brohi, with some unknown people came with heavy weapons and … encroached on the entire land. They are still today residing [there] with heavy weapons.” Saquib Fayyaz Magoon’s letter to chief secretary Sindh. A senior government officer told Dawn , “In districts West and Keamari, without Ali Hassan’s NOC, neither DC, nor SSP, nor mukhtiarkar, nor some ACs — such as of Manghopir and Mauripur — can be appointed.” This view was corroborated by sources in the police, bureaucracy, business sector and PPP itself. A seasoned bureaucrat said that even after lease papers for a particular housing society in district West had been signed, “the AC and mukhtiarkar wouldn’t make an entry in their mutation registers because they don’t do anything unless specifically ordered by Ali Hassan.” (A mukhtiarkar is a BoR official just below the assistant commissioner, responsible for processing and issuing documents related to land revenue, which makes this an extremely powerful post.) This is not to suggest that Mr Brohi is the only one whose name crops up in context of allegedly questionable land dealings. However, given his political profile, he is arguably the most prominent among these individuals. Dirty business Before moving on to the other actors in the sordid saga of land grabbing in Karachi, a brief note on how land ownership is created followed by some instances of shady real estate dealings that Dawn has uncovered. The Board of Revenue, Sindh is original custodian of all the land in the province. Aside from revenue collection and maintaining land records in Sindh, BoR allots land to individuals, societies and various institutions and development authorities such as Karachi Development Authority (KDA), Lyari Development Authority (LDA), Defence Housing Authority, etc to develop schemes for specific purposes. Relevant revenue officials ‘survey’ an area of state land and divide it into blocks with each given a unique identifier called a “survey number”. The surveyed land can then be allotted according to a procedure specified under the Sindh Colonisation and Disposal of Government Land Rules, 2005. Unsurveyed land is termed ‘ na class’ land, which belongs to the original owner, the state, which holds it in trust for the public. Na class or unsurveyed land is distinguished on BoR maps by a different colour and different sequence of numbers than surveyed land. But evidence that rules of procedure are being violated with breathtaking impunity — and with full knowledge of the authorities — lies scattered all across Karachi. Districts West (particularly in Halkani, Bund Murad and Jam Chakro), Keamari (which was carved out of the original district West in 2020), East and Malir have become increasingly attractive for builders. “To make a project viable inside the city is quite difficult because you can’t find big chunks of land there, and whatever land that does exist there is expensive,” says Hamid Khan* of the Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD). “That’s why builders tend to focus on the suburbs.” No doubt there are countless examples of illegal land use within Karachi proper, including encroachment on amenity plots, by elements connected with all political parties — PPP, MQM and ANP (during the latter two’s heyday in the city), and even by the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan for a period. For reasons of space, however, this report focuses on Karachi’s outlying areas and encroachments within recent years. Dawn Investigations visited multiple sites in district West, as well as the huge development scheme known as Hawkesbay Scheme 42 in district Keamari. Where until some years ago there were vast stretches of empty land dotted with goths (rural settlements), dozens of gated housing schemes are now coming up, many boasting little more than an entrance, a boundary wall and a booking office where dubious claims about the builders’ title to land are made. Take Al-Jannat City by MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd in deh Halkani, for example. Mohammed Aqeel in the booking office informs the Dawn correspondent, who approaches him as a prospective investor, that there are 575 residential plots of 120 sq yards each available here, and a number of commercial plots. The proposed layout plan displayed in the booking office shows the project as being spread across 32.8 acres on survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61. The salesperson says six families are already residing in the society while around 20 houses are under construction. Residential plots cost between Rs3 to 3.5 million, with all sales final. Calculated at Rs3.3m each, the residential plots alone add up to at least Rs1.84 billion. A masterplan of the housing society is plastered on a wall inside the Al Jannat City office. “If you delay buying for a month, the price could cross four million rupees,” cautions Mr Aqeel. “Construction has been picking up pace here and there’s no other leased project nearing completion in the area.” He adds: “We have been issuing sub-leases to owners of the plots.” The question is: how is that possible when the land on which Al-Jannat City is coming up does not even belong to the builder? Mr Aqeel claims LDA has leased the land to the builders, but tellingly, he refuses to show the lease. “Not until you purchase a plot,” he says firmly. (Deh Halkani is part of what is known as Scheme 43, which the BoR has given only as a ‘controlled’ area to LDA. The Authority itself has no lease for it.) To delve deeper into the builder’s claims, Dawn GIS department referred to the digitised data in LARMIS. The apex court in 2012 banned the mutation of public land in Sindh, but in 2019, it partially lifted the ban in areas where the land record had been digitised. Thus, one can reasonably assume that the LARMIS data, where it exists, is up to date. It turns out that survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61 actually lie on the other side of the road from where Al-Jannat City is coming up. The project is located on what is entirely state land. Interestingly, taken together, these survey numbers almost mirror the dimensions of the project itself. A short drive away on the main road is Alvisha Housing Society by the same builder, located opposite the Ijtema Gah where a mammoth religious congregation gathers every year. The salesman at the project office tells the correspondent that 120- and 160-sq yard residential and 200 sq yard commercial plots are available for sale in blocks A, B and C. In block C, a 120 sq yard plot costs Rs2.8m lump sum, and Rs3.6m on a 42-month installment plan. When asked about official approvals, one of the two men present says that for the time being, the plots in block A, where the office is located, are being offered on sale to “those who have faith in the builder” and not to the general public. When asked why that is so, he admits that the “paperwork for block A is not 100 per cent complete, unlike blocks B and C.” He lays out the society’s proposed layout plan on the desk; it lists the survey numbers (86, 87, 88 and 89) on which it is being constructed. Frontline Marketing, which is handling the project, shares with Dawn an NOC issued by LDA which also mentions the same survey numbers, 86 to 89. However, Dawn ’s GIS department has determined that these survey numbers lie quite some distance away, in the direction where the men in the sales office vaguely indicated that blocks B and C will come up. Moreover, Alvisha’s block A is actually situated on survey numbers 96 and 97. It is not known what is the reason for this discrepancy. Maps showing the Alvisha and Al-Jannat housing schemes. But revenue officials tell Dawn this kind of discrepancy is very common. One explains it thus: “Sometimes there are other claimants to the land; sometimes builders will use ownership of one piece of survey land to falsely claim ownership over other surveyed land, or even over unsurveyed land; another ploy is to get a fake allotment of unsurveyed land and, after possession, go to the revenue department for a survey number.” Dawn ’s letter to MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd was returned. Another letter with questions to Frontline Marketing received no response either. With around 60 projects in Karachi, GFS Builders & Developers is one of the big players in Pakistan’s real estate market. Supported by a slick marketing campaign, its numerous smooth-talking salespersons push discount offers, and district West is dotted with a number of their projects. A closer look at North Town Residency Phase-2 exposes some shocking facts. According to an ‘NOC’ for sale and advertisement of plots in NTR phase 2 issued by the Sindh Building Control Association, the project measures 30 acres on land bearing survey numbers 363 to 367 “out of na class no 294 in deh Halkani”. The BoR map submitted to the Supreme Court in 2013 clearly shows this entire area — which falls partly in deh Halkani and partly in deh Bund Murad — as being na class (or unsurveyed/state land). The LARMIS website currently shows the same situation in deh Halkani. The map for deh Bund Murad is missing. Dawn received no response to questions it sent in writing to the GFS CEO. Map of GFS North Town Phase 2. (Dawn repeatedly contacted the DC West; Senior Member Board of Revenue, Sindh with a cc to the Chief Secretary, Sindh; Member, Land Utilisation, BoR; and Project Director, LARMIS to ask about the provenance of the survey numbers in connection with the aforementioned housing projects. There was no response from any of them except for LARMIS Assistant Director, Coordination, Hafeezullah Abbasi. Mr Abbasi informed Dawn over the phone that LARMIS does not possess the data in question. “We can only digitise the data that we have been provided.”) Filthy rich Interestingly, the above-mentioned na class number — no 294 — from which piece of land GFS representatives claim that survey numbers 363 to 367 have been carved out for its North Town Residency-Phase 2, crops up in a complaint to NAB about huge tracts of land being illegally taken over and sold. A list of suspicious sales/allotments was enclosed with the complaint, mentioning the survey/ na class numbers, area and value, and ‘sellers’ and ‘purchasers’ of the land in question. According to this, 82 acres on na class numbers 284 – 294 were illegally sold/allotted to GFS. The dubious transactions listed in the complaint to NAB involve nearly 1,500 acres, including around 1,150 acres of state land. On Oct 11, 2023, NAB wrote to DC West informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land”, and asking him to furnish NAB with a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023. Letter written by NAB to the DC West, informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land” in the district and seeking a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023. Repeated attempts to seek NAB’s official response to this complaint went unanswered. Sources told Dawn that NAB had initiated a formal enquiry based on the allegations in this complaint, but recently, 166 cases, enquiries, references and complaints relating to the departments of revenue, local government and food had been transferred to Sindh’s Anti-Corruption Establishment. The list enclosed with the complaint to NAB lays bare how predatory networks have hollowed out governance in Sindh — like locusts stripping bare every field they descend upon. Those who acquired the land allegedly through illegal sale/allotment include a number of well-known builders and developers. And among those accused of supplying them the land — the ‘sellers’ — are Ali Hassan Brohi, an SHO and a mukhtiarkar. The cop is Ghulam Hussain Korai, then SHO Manghopir in district West. Consider just one of the parcels of land that he, jointly with one Yousuf Brohi, is accused of grabbing: 200 acres of state land in deh Bund Murad which was, as per this document, worth an eye-watering Rs4 bn. An SHO can be a grade 14 (sub-inspector) or grade 16 (inspector) officer, whose monthly salary is at the most Rs120,000. In December 2024, after complaints by a number of businessmen about brazen land grabbing in Karachi became too vociferous to ignore, the powers that be ordered the Sindh government to address the issue. Inspector Korai was among five police officers who were subsequently transferred to desk jobs at the police headquarters. (A number of revenue officials were also transferred, though often replaced, say sources, with others of equally ill repute but boasting strong ties with those who matter in the provincial leadership.) In response to Dawn ’s questions, Inspector Korai described the allegations against him as “false, fabricated, and baseless … the [Association of Builders & Developers] have withdrawn their application, and the issue has been resolved accordingly.” He enclosed a letter from ABAD with his response. An excerpt from it reads: “… due to unavoidable circumstances the complainant currently displaying a lack of coordination with ABAD regarding their submitted complaints … We hereby request to withdraw the complaint against him.” Dawn was unable to confirm the nature of the “unavoidable circumstances”. Mr Korai remains without any posting. Sources say he has been sanctioned several times for misconduct. There is on the same list one Ejaz, described as mukhtiarkar Scheme 33, who is alleged to have handed over in a fraudulent manner seven acres in Scheme 33 itself to an undisclosed builder and developer. This appears to be a reference to Aijazul Hassan Khan. Incidentally, Mr Aijaz was among 11 mukhtiarkars suspended in 2023 for land fraud. It is difficult to overstate the cruel irony in this situation. While public land gets siphoned away by unscrupulous builders hand in glove with rapacious elements from the ruling elite and corrupt government officials, affordable public sector housing schemes almost never go beyond the blueprint. Hawkesbay Scheme 42, Karachi’s oldest public sector project, is a stark example. This scheme was started in 1984 for the low- and middle-income segment by KDA and transferred to LDA in 1996. Over four decades later, much of it is still undeveloped and without electricity or water. Many original allottees remained unable during their lifetime to take possession of their plots, which they had paid for with their hard-earned money. Scheme 42 even includes a block exclusively for overseas Pakistanis, but they too have nothing to show for their investment till today. And yet, those with no right to the land but plenty of clout have staked their claim to the overseas block by building a boundary wall around its perimeter, repeatedly. Each time the wall is bulldozed by the authorities, it comes up again within no time. An illegal housing society called Aashqan-e-Mustafa has materialised along the Suparco Road which cuts through Scheme 42. Two front men of an MPA are said to be handling transactions. A view of the Aashqan-e-Mustafa society’s site office. A view of the Aashqan-e-Mustafa society on Suparco Road. When a Dawn Investigations team visits, a man strolls up, asking if they are interested in a plot and if so, to take their queries to Madina Real Estate nearby. There are 100- or 120-square yard plots available for sale here, says the realtor: “a 400-sq yard commercial plot alongside the main road costs Rs6.5m with cash payment over three months.” When asked whether the society has a lease from the development authority, he replies: “No, it’s not leased but this is part of the Gothabad Scheme, so you’ll get a sanad if you buy here.” This means the government had notified this piece of state land for a goth situated here — ostensibly in this case, Kachelo Goth. However, sanads can only be issued to the original residents of a goth . Incidentally, Kachelo Goth actually lies around 2km away. A map of the Aashqan-e-Mustafa society. Predictably, the Gothabad Scheme over the years has become another vehicle for corruption since it began in 1987 to provide housing to the deserving indigenous population in rural Sindh. Gothabad mukhiarkars began issuing fake sanads, even multiple sanads to one individual to enable the latter to claim title over a large area. Mohammed Shahnawaz at the Aashqan-e-Mustafa housing society site office in fact claimed that buyers would be given backdated sanads because “sanads stopped being issued after 2012”. Dawn received no response to questions addressed in writing to the proprietors of Aashqan-e-Mustafa. In June 2014, during Supreme Court hearings into the Karachi unrest case, BoR submitted a report stating that 59,803 acres of state land had been encroached upon. Backroom land deals are not mere irregularities — they are a fundamental breach of public trust. State land is not for the government to bestow upon whomever it favours, which is why a recent Sindh High Court judgement underscored that, in the interest of transparency, state land must be disposed of through an open auction. Fake NOCs, no paper trail All the housing societies investigated for this report happen to fall under LDA. Ahmed Saeed*, who is very familiar with the LDA’s workings, reveals that the Authority has in umpteen instances showed ‘ na class ’ land (ie unsurveyed land which cannot be allotted to anyone and on which no project can be constructed) as survey land. He alleges that everyone, including BoR, is party to the fraud. According to him, the landgrabber writes to the Director General LDA to request an NOC for the layout plan on what they claim is their land. The DG sends the letter to the relevant DC, asking for clarification on the status of the land in question. The DC forwards it to the mukhtiarkar who takes out a report which then goes back to the DC, who forwards it to the DG confirming the land does indeed belong to the interested party. “The official fee for approval of the layout plan is Rs1.3m per acre, and the bribe for showing na class land as survey land is Rs500,000 per acre,” says Mr Saeed. “But because the letters have been sent around by hand, not by a dispatcher, there’s no trail. LDA will say they did this on BoR’s say-so; if you ask BoR for verification, they’ll say this is state land and they never gave approval for it. You show them the correspondence — and they’ll say it’s fake, but they all know. They’re all involved.” In other words, classic smoke and mirrors. At his office, a rather harried-looking DG LDA Safdar Bughio, tells Dawn : “Our planning department verifies ownership through the concerned DC office; it’s BoR that checks whether the builder has ownership or not. When they confirm ownership title, then our planning department does the technical work on it [to issue NOC for layout plan].” LDA planning department head, Mohammed Arbab, toes a similar line: “Our mandate and function is the KBTPR [Karachi Building and Town Planning Rules]. We are only a town planning agency. The identification of the land is done by the DC, title verification is done by the DC, record of survey numbers is with the DC.” However, Mr Bughio concedes there are some illegal housing societies. “It is also our responsibility to stop them. We do stop them, but officially we deal only with those who come for [layout plan] NOCs from us. But definitely I will soon start a programme in which we will take on the responsibility of dealing with them.” As for Mr Arbab, when pressed further on the issue, he says: “ Qabzay bhi wohi log kartay hain … na class land pay jin kay hukoomati links hotay hain.” (Encroachment on state land is done by those who have government connections.) Other cogs in the wheel There are nevertheless some public servants who try to discharge their duty with at least a degree of integrity. In instances where the mukhtiarkar concerned takes action and issues a notice to a suspected land grabber, the latter can approach the anti-encroachment tribunal. The Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010, empowers anti-encroachment tribunals headed by a retired district and sessions judge or an advocate of 10 years’ standing to determine the rights of the parties involved. Too often, though, the only anti-encroachment tribunal in Karachi has given questionable decisions. In fact, several sources told Dawn that encroachers go to the tribunal with fake/ forged documents to establish title to the land they have grabbed by obtaining a stay order. “It’s simple,” says Umair Rafiq*, a senior bureaucrat. “Go meet the court reader, file an application quickly and get a stay. Then anyone who visits that land becomes guilty of contempt. You just pay one or two million rupees for this.” Dawn has in its possession the copy of an order in suit no 15/ 2024, issued on July 23, 2024, by Muneer Bhutto, district and sessions judge and, until recently, presiding officer of the anti-encroachment tribunal. The plaintiff is Al-Faiz Builders Pvt Ltd while the defendants include officials from BoR, SBCA, LDA, anti-encroachment police personnel, etc. In his interim order, the presiding offer restrained “the defendants, their agents and anyone on their behalf from eject[ting], evict[ing], dispossess[ing] the plaintiff from the suit property ie 32 acres land na class No 42 situated at Deh Methan, tapo Manghopir, district Keamari”. Interestingly, the same presiding officer (now heading the Karachi Water & Sewerage Tribunal) was the focus of a complaint made earlier that year. In a letter dated Jan 30, 2024, a copy of which is available with Dawn , the DC East wrote to the Sindh High Court Registrar, the Member Inspection Team-II (a body that handles complaints against judicial officers in the district and lower courts), requesting further action on a complaint against Mr Bhutto that had been forwarded to him by the assistant commissioner East. With his letter, he enclosed a report submitted by a mukhtiarkar of Karachi East, Muhammad Irfan Lashari. Mr Lashari in his complaint alleged that the presiding officer had granted a stay to land grabbers on 500 sq yards of state land at Fateh Mohammed Gabol Goth that had been reserved by the Sindh government for a dispensary for the local residents. In fact, he said in his report, possession had already been given to the health department representative with documentation to the effect. According to him, through the stay order, a contempt of court notice against him and letter of suspension, he was “pressurised to follow the unlawful order passed by the presiding officer of the tribunal. … The stay orders … not only provide cover to the land grabbers but also encourage them to usurp more state land in connivance with support of presiding officer of the said tribunal and his staff…” Nothing came of this complaint. In fact, sources said that a “fake case” had been filed against the DC concerned, his properties were attached and he was declared an absconder. (On Oct 15, 2025, in a development unrelated to Mr Lashari’s complaint, Muneer Bhutto was found guilty of misconduct after an enquiry by MIT member Justice Muhammad Faisal Kamal Alam of the Sindh High Court that began in 2021. Concluding that Mr Bhutto had “misused” his “senior official position”, the MIT imposed on him “the minor penalty of withholding of annual increment for a period of three years”.) Despite repeated attempts, Mr Bhutto refused to receive Dawn ’s letter with questions regarding the above allegations. Nothing oils the wheels of elite capture like a corrupt bureaucracy. Seasoned bureaucrats hold that officers were generally appointed on merit in Benazir Bhutto’s time, but this changed after her assassination in December 2007. “As soon as PPP’s victory in the 2008 election seemed assured, officers began to get calls from the PPP leadership telling them to refrain from recruitment and from making any appointments,” says Rashid Saleem*, a retired assistant commissioner. “As soon as they came in, they began to recruit their own people.” The passage of the 18th Amendment, say old-school bureaucrats, removed the guardrails entirely. “The 2012 recruits were rapidly promoted and are now in grade 19. Soon they’ll be in grade 20, secretary level. God help Sindh when that happens,” says Mr Saleem. According to several senior civil servants, the Sindh Public Service Commission’s (SPSC) examination process has become seriously compromised, with ‘favoured’ candidates awarded inflated scores in the oral segment while deserving candidates are failed despite strong written performances. Each recruitment, appointment and promotion has a price, they claim. Journalist Imdad Soomro has extensively investigated corruption in the SPSC. “To get recruited into a department, one has to pay between Rs5m to Rs10m,” he alleges. At the other end of the spectrum are the top posts, such as assistant commissioner, excise and taxation officer, DSP, mukhtiarkar, etc for which candidates must sit the Combined Competitive Examination or CCE. The ‘rates’ are higher for such “ kamanay walay [lucrative] posts” as Mr Soomro puts it. According to him, to become AC or ETO, one must pay Rs80m; appointment as mukhtiarkar entails a bribe of Rs40m. According to a retired official, “There’s an exam called the revenue qualifier exam for clerical staff who have served three years in the Revenue Department. Clerks have paid Rs15m to Rs20m to become assistant mukhtiarkar. Close to 30 clerks have become assistant mukhtiarkars in this manner.” Often, all it takes for career advancement is to cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship with a political patron. Dawn was told that in one land development authority, an individual on a contingency contract as a watchman was now a grade-19 officer on an extremely important post. The great Karachi land grab Real estate in Karachi has been the cause of much disorder and violence. The final JIT report looking into the murder on March 13, 2013 of Perween Rahman, director of the Orangi Pilot Project, offered a revealing commentary. Referring to the period between 2006-2012, and the ethnic conflict between Pashtuns and Mohajirs, it noted that cadres of both MQM and ANP were heavily involved in various criminal activities, especially land grabbing, as were the Taliban who were a potent militant force in Karachi at the time. “… whatever their stated political differences, all three groups worked hand in glove … Big developers … would ally themselves with these groups, using the militant wings of these groups as their ‘muscle’, in order to forcibly seize land. Anyone who came in their way was either threatened, or if they refused to back off, killed. …[O]ften murders that were declared as being politically motivated or acts of terrorism, were in actual fact land disputes that were made to look like political killings to cover up the real facts. The state apparatus, in the shape of the land revenue administration or the police, was either too weak, or complicit in the face of the great Karachi land grab.” It was against this backdrop that the then Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in 2012 while hearing the Karachi ‘badamni’ (unrest) case, banned the Sindh government from effecting mutation, allotment, or transfer of any government land in Sindh until the province’s land record — huge amounts of which was destroyed in the rioting following the murder of Benazir Bhutto — was digitised. (The court conditionally lifted the ban in 2019 in instances where the record had been computerised.) But the ban meant little in the areas of Karachi where state land was plentiful. During retired Justice Maqbool Baqar’s tenure as chief minister Sindh in the runup to the 2024 election, an enquiry was held into allotments and mutations made by BoR Sindh between 2012 and 2023. That is, after the Supreme Court ban. Some of the findings are as follows. In Manghopir, district West, there were forged entries and fake allotments in land record; an incident of arson was committed in 2021 by revenue officials, including mukhtiarkars and tapedars, “to deliberately destroy fake entries kept by the revenue officials in collusion with private beneficiaries”. In deh Bund Murad, also district West, the enquiry found that “Government land worth billions of rupees in various na class … was illegally transferred to private individuals… .” Numerous revenue officials were named as being complicit and acquiring assets beyond their means. None of them appears to have been prosecuted. According to the 2018 JIT report on money laundering worth billions of rupees through fake bank accounts, 562 acres of state land in Sindh, including 363 acres of Pakistan Steel Mill land, were “illegally allotted to private builders causing a loss of Rs4.14 billion to the national exchequer”. The report also alleged that Bahria Town Ltd had remitted Rs10bn into the fake accounts as kickbacks for grabbing thousands of acres of state as well as private lands for its projects in Karachi. In 2023, a member of Sindh’s caretaker cabinet told Dawn : “[During the previous government,] the sub registrars and mukhtiarkars in Karachi would collect 600 to 700 million rupees per month for ‘upward’ distribution. They had a free hand. Even if someone’s land was legal, they would still charge according to the ‘system’ at the rate they had set, eg Korangi, Rs300,000 per acre. By transferring mukhtiarkars, we disrupted that system of collection.” Under the caretaker setup, per one government official, security agencies were said to have taken up the task of ‘cleaning the system’. Officials were assured that “ qabzas will not happen like before”. A number of people were even put on the ECL, unofficially if not officially. But despite those claims, rather little has changed in the way that real estate is occupied in the city. The faces may be different, but the practices remain the same. Thus, individuals like Mr Brohi have even greater sway than before; they are fixtures in the corridors of power, protected by their formidable patrons. According to a bureaucrat, “Even DIGs, senior government officials will go out of their way to maintain good relations with them.” Perhaps that is why Fayyaz Solangi, the former DC West who placed that damning notice in the newspapers against Mr Brohi back in 2020, put in another notice on July 8, 2025 — five years later — in Urdu, English and Sindhi newspapers containing a grovelling apology, and stating that an enquiry had not established allegations of land grabbing against him. An excerpt from the notice reads “…I had already apologized to him in person and directed my staff to issue corrigendum to this effect but unfortunately the same [was] not published on a timely basis and I was transferred…” Former DC West Fayyaz Solangi’s public apology to Mr Brohi published in Dawn on July 8, 2025. That shameful apology was a step too far, even for a severely compromised bureaucracy. Two days later, the former DC West swiftly found himself reduced to officer on special duty by the chief secretary Sindh. Mr Solangi did not respond to Dawn ’s repeated requests for comment. As for Jibrail Khan, the JUI-F local leader who ran afoul of certain political bigwigs, the intercession of his party leadership appears to have magically made the FIRs against him melt into thin air. Even though he has yet to obtain bail in all the cases, he is out of prison. The ‘system’ knows when compromise is a better closing gambit. *Some names have been changed to protect identity.

      "summary_orig": "South Africa prevailed in a double Super Over thriller as Afghanistan came up agonisingly short of a famous victory after their T20 World Cup clash ended in a tie on Wednesday. Afghanistan were 187 all out after South Africa scored 187-6 in Ahmedabad. The teams were tied again after a breathless first Super Over saw them both score 17, before South Africa won off the final ball of a heart-thumping second sudden-death showdown. After South Africa bludgeoned 23 from their second super over and Afghanistan lost a wicket off the second ball of theirs, Rahmanullah Gurbaz was left needing four sixes off four balls for an unlikely victory. Gurbaz sensationally launched Keshav Maharaj into the crowd three times with some huge blows. A wide off the fifth ball meant Afghanistan still needed six to win but now a four would send it, incredibly, to a third Super Over. With nerves jangling and pulses racing, the left-arm spinner held his nerve to bowl a wide yorker that saw Gurbaz smack into the grateful hands of Davis Miller at point as he looked to hit a boundary. It was South Africa’s second win in as many matches in Group D to be placed second behind toppers New Zealand. A few minutes earlier, after Gurbaz scored a brilliant 42-ball 84 in the chase, Afghanistan had needed 13 off the last over of the match to win with one wicket in hand. After Kagiso Rabada bowled two no balls and a wide and Noor Ahmad hit a six, Afghanistan needed two to win off three balls. But Noor was run out going for the the winning second run with the scores level. In the match’s first innings, Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton hit blazing half-centuries after Afghanistan invited South Africa to bat first. South Africa lost an early wicket but de Kock, who hit 59, and Rickelton (61) got going in a partnership of 114 to take the attack to the opposition. Afghanistan bowlers pulled things back after the duo fell to star spinner Rashid Khan as South Africa fell short of what looked like a total of more than 200 at one stage. De Kock reached his fifty off 34 balls with a four off Mujeebur Rahman and two balls later fellow left-hander Rickelton struck a six to get to his half-century. The duo unleashed a flurry of fours and sixes, forcing Afghanistan to rotate their bowlers at the world’s biggest cricket stadium, which was largely empty. Leg-spinner Rashid hit back as he got the dangermen in the space of three balls with de Kock caught out at deep mid-wicket and Rickelton trapped lbw. The wickets slowed down South Africa’s run-scoring and Dewald Brevis fell in his attempt to accelerate after his 23 off 19 balls. David Miller hit an unbeaten 20 and Marco Jansen made 16 off seven balls to help the Proteas finish strong.",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has announced a Rs10 billion allocation for the Frontier Corps (FC) to strengthen the force’s capacity-building and bolster security in Balochistan. Addressing FC headquarters during her visit to Balochistan on Tuesday, she paid tribute to those serving in Balochistan under difficult and dangerous circumstances. In her speech, which was aired on Wednesday, Maryam shared that she found out a few months ago that the FC required Rs10 billion for “capacity building”. “I was asked to contribute whatever Punjab could,” she stated. “I decided it was not a favour … it was a responsibility. I said we will provide them the entire Rs10bn.” The chief minister highlighted that the allocation aimed to enhance operational readiness and strengthen security efforts in Balochistan, particularly in light of recent threats and attacks. CM Maryam’s visit came in the wake of a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days . Security forces had responded by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ” in the province. During her speech, Maryam expressed deep concern for the safety of security personnel and acknowledged the sacrifices being made daily to defend the country. “I worry about your safety because you are fighting for me, for the nation, and for this country … and you are sacrificing your lives,” she told the FC gathering. “Despite the challenges you are facing here, fighting for your people, I salute your bravery from the depths of my heart,” she said. “On behalf of Nawaz Sharif, who has special love for Balochistan, and on behalf of the people of Punjab, I not only thank you but salute you. Balochistan is not alone — Punjab stands with Balochistan at every moment.” ‘Whoever weakens Pakistan is worst enemy, whether external or internal’ The Punjab CM also issued a stern warning against forces attempting to destabilise the country. Maryam stressed that there should be no “grey area” in the people’s or the political leadership’s minds, calling for an “indiscriminate decision”. “Whoever weakens Pakistan is not a friend but the worst enemy, whether external or internal,” she declared. Highlighting the evolving nature of threats, she stressed that the country was facing not only conventional terrorism but also “fifth-generation warfare” and psychological operations aimed at attacking the nation’s unity and mindset. “It’s not just physical warfare that we are facing. We are facing fifth-generation warfare, which is psychological warfare. They have come with great preparation and attacked our minds,” Maryam said. Calling for political honesty and clarity, she emphasised the importance of acknowledging past realities in the fight against terrorism. Recalling the Islamabad incident, the Punjab CM stated that even places of worship were not spared. “Until some of our leaders keep calling terrorists ‘our brothers’ — [which happened] from 2018 to 2022 — […] I am not saying anything political, but this is a decision that the nation must make,” she added. “The day the Islamabad attack happened, I immediately posted on my Twitter account that we ought to make a tough decision as a nation, which is that we must call black if it is black, and white if it is white; there is no grey area in our minds,” Maryam said. She stressed that such elements must be dealt with firmly and without ambiguity. “If such people remain in Pakistan under the cloak of political parties and leaders, our soldiers will continue to be martyred,” she contended. She added, “Our country would remain in conflict […] if it would be said ‘terrorists are our brothers; not only open the doors for them but also open their offices here’. […] There must be clarity.”",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: A major terrorist attack on a police post in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district was foiled on Wednesday, with security forces killing three attackers and injuring nine others. Terrorists launched a late-night assault on the Khonia Khel Police Post in the district’s Wazir sub-division with heavy weapons, intending to seize control of the facility. A large number of attackers attempted to surround the police post, however, police personnel deployed at the installation were alert and responded to the threat promptly. The effective response by the law enforcers forced the militants to retreat. On the directives of RPO Bannu Sajjad Khan and DPO Bannu Yasir Afridi, additional police contingents, along with Quick Response Force (QRF) and Rapid Response Force (RRF) units, were immediately dispatched to the scene, compelling the militants to flee. According to a press release issued by the police, three terrorists were killed and nine others were injured during the operation, dealing a significant blow to their network. One of the slain militants was identified as terrorist commander Umar Azam alias Khizmeti, while another was identified as Shahidullah. The identification process of the third militant is underway. During the exchange of fire, one police officer sustained minor injuries but is reported to be out of danger. Police further stated that, in an apparent attempt to avenge the killing of their associates, militants also tried to attack Ahmadzai Police Station and Fateh Khel Police Post last night. However, both attempts were thwarted, and the attackers fled the scene. RPO Bannu Sajjad Khan praised the bravery and professionalism of the police personnel and announced commendation certificates and cash rewards for the officers involved. He reiterated that operations against anti-state elements will continue without discrimination. Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security forces coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence. Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump has now raised the tally of aircraft shot down during the May 2025 conflict between Pakistan and India to 10. The latest remarks by the US president came during an interview with Fox Business , which was aired on Wednesday. The host was praising Trump’s “reciprocity policy” in trade and using tariffs for that when the US president chimed in: “And that’s being very nice and gentle. Look, I settled eight wars. Out of the eight wars, at least six were settled because of tariffs.” Trump then explained: “In other words, I said, ‘if you don’t settle this war, I’m gonna charge you tariffs because I don’t wanna see people getting killed.’ And they said, ‘no, what does this have to do with it?’ I said, ‘you’re gonna be charged.’” “Like India and Pakistan would’ve been a nuclear war in my opinion. They were really going at it. Ten planes were shot down. They were going at it,” he added. Over the past 10 months, the US president has stated numerous times that aircraft were shot down during the conflict — albeit without specifying whose. Initially stating that five jets were shot down, Trump gradually raised that number to seven in October , and then eight in November . @dawn.today US President Donald Trump said that a conflict between India and Pakistan “would have been a nuclear war” and suggested the two countries “were really going at it.” In remarks during an interview with Fox News, Trump claimed that “ten planes were shot down” during the confrontation and said he believed the situation could have escalated to nuclear conflict “without tariffs.” DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com During the interview, Trump quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as praising him for “saving at least 10 million lives when he got us to stop fighting”. “Because, see, they were going to nuclear, in my opinion. Without tariffs, that (ceasefire) wouldn’t have happened,” the US president asserted. He also recalled Armenia and Azerbaijan’s decades-long conflict , which saw tensions reduce when Trump brokered an initial peace agreement in August 2025. During the interview, Trump also termed “every single” US president during the last 50 years as “bad on trade”. “But I’m not bad on trade. I’m real good on trade,” he boasted. US ties with Pakistan, India During his Oval Office meeting with Trump in September 2025, PM Shehbaz had thanked the US president for his role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in their four-day military conflict in May 2025. Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared in April 2025 when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was, without evidence, blamed on Islamabad, which strongly refuted the allegations. The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in May with the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries. He has also praised Chief of the Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on several occasions, calling him a “ highly respected general ”, a “ great fighter ” and “ my favourite ”. India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks. After what some saw as strained relations between the US and India after failed talks , Trump earlier this month announced a “ trade deal ” with New Delhi. Days later, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also made a three-day official visit to the US, where he held talks with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told Dawn on Wednesday. The map, which accompanied a USTR press release announcing a framework for an interim US-India trade agreement, showed the entire Jammu and Kashmir region — including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan — within Indian boundaries. It also depicted China’s Aksai Chin region as part of India, despite the fact that the area is claimed by China and remains disputed . It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend. Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh. The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as sensitive as Kashmir. The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories. Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction. Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn. By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly. The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi announced , over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce. According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels. Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi revoked the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law. Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality. The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China. US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.",

      "summary": "WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told Dawn on Wednesday. The map, which accompanied a USTR press release announcing a framework for an interim US-India trade agreement, showed the entire Jammu and Kashmir region — including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan — within Indian boundaries. It also depicted China’s Aksai Chin region as part of India, despite the fact that the area is claimed by China and remains disputed . It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend. Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh. The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as sensitive as Kashmir. The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories. Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction. Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn. By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly. The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi announced , over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce. According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels. Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi revoked the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law. Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality. The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China. US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.",
