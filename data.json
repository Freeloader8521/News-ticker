      "title_orig": "PIA ‘not affected’ by Airbus recall as airlines race to fix A320 jets",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan International Airlines remained unaffected even as global airlines scrambled on Saturday to fix a software glitch on their Airbus A320 jets after a recall by the European planemaker temporarily grounded aircraft in Asia and Europe and threatened travel in the United States during the busiest weekend of the year. The recall of 6,000 planes, covering more than half of Airbus’ global A320-family fleet, is among the broadest in its 55-year history and is a blow for the planemaker weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model. “PIA has confirmed that its entire A320 fleet is not affected by this Airbus alert. PIA’s Engineering and Maintenance department is closely monitoring their fleet’s airworthiness, ensuring safe operations,” said a statement by the airlines spokesperson issued today. Meanwhile, airlines worked through the night to make fixes after Airbus issued the emergency recall to 350 operators around the world, and global regulators directed carriers to remedy the software problem before resuming flights. That appeared to help head off the worst-case scenario and capped the number of flight delays in Asia and Europe early on Saturday. The US will face high travel demand later in the day after the Thanksgiving holiday period. “It’s not as chaotic as some people might think,” said Asia-based independent aviation analyst Brendan Sobie, adding that airlines were always prepared for various potential disruptions. “But it does create some short-term headaches for operations.” Airbus is also now telling airlines that emergency repairs to some of the A320 jets affected may be less burdensome than first thought, industry sources said, with fewer than feared likely to need hardware changes rather than the software fix. Even so, industry executives said the abrupt action was a rare and potentially costly headache at a time when maintenance is under pressure worldwide from labour and parts shortages. Fix is simple but necessary Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320 model. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again. European low-budget airline Wizz Air said early on Saturday that software updates had been implemented overnight on all its affected A320-family jets with no further disruption expected. Flight tracker data from Cirium and FlightAware showed most global airports operating with good-to-moderate levels of delays. AirAsia, one of the world’s largest A320 customers, said that it aimed to complete fixes in 48 hours, with engineering teams “working around the clock”. India’s aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected, but the software reset would be completed by Sunday. The country’s largest airline, IndiGo, said it had completed the reset on 160 out of 200 aircraft, while Air India said it had done 42 of its 113 impacted planes. Both airlines warned of delays. Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island’s carriers are affected. The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimise any disruption to passengers. ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline, cancelled 95 flights on Saturday, affecting 13,500 travellers. ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320. October incident triggered recall, sources say Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight on October 30 from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall. Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia’s flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected. South Korea’s Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service. South Korea’s Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning. Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half of its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal. The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 209 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, revised down from an earlier estimate, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday. Other US carriers, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and United Airlines, are also among the world’s 10 biggest A320-family operators. Germany’s Lufthansa and Britain’s easyJet were among other airlines that said they would do the repairs. Middle East low-cost carrier Air Arabia said it would implement “required measures” across impacted aircraft. Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70 per cent of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.",

He said the government had turned parliament into a rubber stamp and that National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq was taking dictation from elsewhere. He said people were being killed in the tribal areas, yet the NA speaker did not allow the opposition to speak on this grave issue. He questioned why Imran Khan was kept in jail and why he was not being allowed to meet his sisters and party leaders. “The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is sitting outside Adiala Jail , but no one is paying any heed to his request to meet the PTI founder,” he said. Democracy buried Speaking on the occasion, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said democracy had been buried in the recent by-elections . He claimed that the results of a by-election in Haripur, where the wife of former opposition leader Omar Ayub was contesting, had been changed. “The result on Form 47 was different from the one altered on a computer,” he alleged. Barrister Gohar said the opposition wanted to remain part of parliament and the democratic system, but the alleged rigging in the by-elections had made this difficult. “As far as I know [Imran] Khan, he will not allow us to be part of parliament anymore,” he added.

      "title_orig": "Afghan forces open fire across border to facilitate infiltration of terrorists into Pakistan: DG ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Afghan forces open fire at Pakistani checkposts across the border to facilitate the infiltration of terrorists into the country. He made the comments during a briefing with journalists on November 25, a video of which was released by the ISPR on Friday evening. “Borders are always mutually guarded. Both countries [guard] them. Now, on the other side is such a country whose posts first engage your posts through fire, and an exchange begins. And then they have them (terrorists) pass through the gaps in between,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. The DG ISPR said one would barely find any “administration” on the borders in terrorism-prone areas, except in “hardly five to 10 per cent” of the areas. “Go to Tirah, Khyber; you will not find any governance. Neither will you find any courts, nor any departments that deal with law enforcement and writ of the government.” The ISPR chief also pointed out that villages and populations were “divided” across the Pak-Afghan border. “There are 29 tribes here that are divided, whose population is here (Pakistan) and there (Afghanistan) as well. Right on the border. How will you control the movement there?” he asked. He noted that many questioned how terrorists could infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border, how smuggling was carried out, and how non-custom paid vehicles were able to pass through if the army and the Frontier Corps were stationed at the border. The military spokesperson then showed images of border fences. He highlighted that military posts were set up at a distance of about 15-25 kilometres from the border. Noting suggestions for hermetically sealing the border, the DG ISPR questioned whether even the United States, with its vast resources, was able to do the same to its border with Mexico. “What you call a fence has no value in military terms if it is not covered by observation of fire, because someone can hold and cut that obstacle to bridge it,” he said. The military spokesman said building a security post every 2-5km and having drone surveillance would incur a “huge cost”. “You will have to invest in the infrastructure, as well as manpower,” he emphasised. Speaking on the “terror-crime nexus”, the DG ISPR said cells of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on the Pakistani side provided support to this network. Similar to the strategy he explained for terrorists’ infiltration, Lt Gen Chaudhry said there were extremely coordinated attacks on the army and FC deployments on the routes. “[They] attack the posts and have smugglers’ vehicles pass from below,” he said. He further said that non-custom-paid vehicles were a part of this network. “If there are 0.40-0.45 million non-custom-paid vehicles moving in your province, then why do you not stop them? Who is to stop them […] why are they not stopping it, why are they not checking it, whose responsibility is this?” he asked. “The non-customs paid vehicles are part of this political-terror-crime nexus, are being used in vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and by these terrorists in their movement,” the DG ISPR said. ‘Afghan side could not deny evidence presented by Pakistan’ On the Pak-Afghan dialogue that broke down earlier this month, Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted that Pakistan’s stance was “absolutely clear”, with Islamabad conveying that the presence of TTP cells, and their funding and functioning from Afghan soil, was not acceptable. “We presented all kinds of evidence, and they could not deny that evidence. It was absolutely clear to the mediators, as well as to the Afghans there,” the military spokesman highlighted. He said that Pakistan was even open to a “third-party agreement” that would detail a verifiable mechanism to combat cross-border terrorism. He cited a report by the United States’ Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) that said more than $7.2 billion worth of US military equipment had been left behind in the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lt Gen Chaudhry said the Afghan Taliban had been unable to “convert” themselves into a state after 2021, and were now patronising various non-state actors, including those that were “country-specific and region-specific”. He noted that Fitna Al Khawarij (TTP), Fitna al Hindustan , the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , Al Qaeda and Daesh were among those groups found in Afghanistan. “We say that you need to act like a state now. […] They had said that ‘we will not allow our soil to be used for terrorism’,” the DG ISPR said, adding that the Kabul regime was not representative of the Afghans. The military spokesperson recalled the promises made in the 2020 Doha agreement and asserted that Pakistan had been engaging with the Afghan Taliban since 2021. “Our problem is not with the Afghans. Our problem is with the Afghan Taliban regime,” he added. “Blood and business cannot go together,” he said, stressing that trade had been halted as Pakistan’s security was paramount. During the same briefing, Lt Gen Chaudhry also refuted allegations by the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan had conducted overnight strikes in Afghanistan earlier this week. “In our view, there is only one sort of terrorist which is good, which is a dead terrorist,” he quipped, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists. The DG ISPR also highlighted statistics for the repatriation of illegal migrants, stating that 971,604 individuals had been sent back this year so far — 239,574 in November alone — compared to 366,704 people in 2024. ‘Delusional India wants to sell defeat as victory’ Lt Gen Chaudhry also spoke about India during his media talk. “We can’t do anything about a delusional mind,” the DG ISPR said, recalling the Indian army chief’s comments on the May conflict being a “trailer”. “Seven jets were downed, 26 locations were attacked, and the S400 batteries were lost in that ‘trailer’. So, I think now he wants to watch a full horror film,” he said, adding that India wanted to sell its defeat as a victory to its population. “Any country that provides any kind of equipment to the Afghan Taliban, saying they are giving it to their army, you can consider that it is available to the terrorists.” The military spokesperson also highlighted that there were social media accounts based outside of Pakistan that were involved in inciting violence in the country. Using social media platform X’s new feature to show the country a user is located in, Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted certain handles that post about Balochistan. He said the accounts were “doing politics inside Pakistan, and concocting a narrative against the state, against your army, against your leaders”. ‘Seems local population engagement missing in KP’ “All our governments and political parties agree that the solution to terrorism lies in a comprehensive National Action Plan ,” the DG ISPR said. He detailed that there were provincial apex committees chaired by the chief minister with 23 members, a provincial steering committee with 25 members, followed by a division-level monitoring committee, and then a district-level implementation body. Speaking further on the non-kinetic aspects, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that the administration and the military had 140 engagements per day with the local population, including school visits and jirgas. “The actual solution to terrorism lies in these, which the provincial and district governments ought to do […] We feel all this is missing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said. The ISPR chief also noted that 949 projects were underway in 35 districts, and that work was also being carried out on the Green Balochistan Initiative, a part of the Green Pakistan Initiative . The military spokesman highlighted that the smuggling of Iranian diesel was a huge contributor to the “illegal spectrum, the funding of the terrorists”. “Before the army, FC and the provincial government started this crackdown, permits were given for 20.5 million litres per day, or it was smuggled. We have brought it down to the current average of 2.7m litres,“ he said. ‘Over 67,000 IBOs conducted since Jan’ Detailing the counter-terrorism efforts, the DG ISPR said 4,910 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) had been carried out since November 4, amounting to 233 IBOs per day. “The intensity of the kinetic counter-terrorism effort is going up,” he said, noting that 206 terrorists were killed in these operations. Providing a breakdown of the security situation since January, Lt Gen Chaudhry said 67,023 IBOs had been conducted across the country since then. Balochistan had the highest number of such operations, with over 53,000, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had over 12,800, and the rest of the country recorded about 850. The military spokesperson said the country had witnessed 4,729 terrorist incidents since January, with 3,357 in KP, 1,346 in Balochistan and 26 in other regions. A breakdown of the terrorist attacks recorded across the country since January, as of Nov 25, 2025. — screengrab via YouTube/ISPR Official",

Balochistan had the highest number of such operations, with over 53,000, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had over 12,800, and the rest of the country recorded about 850. The military spokesperson said the country had witnessed 4,729 terrorist incidents since January, with 3,357 in KP, 1,346 in Balochistan and 26 in other regions.

      "title": "Afghan forces open fire across border to facilitate infiltration of terrorists into Pakistan: DG ISPR",
      "summary": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Afghan forces open fire at Pakistani checkposts across the border to facilitate the infiltration of terrorists into the country. He made the comments during a briefing with journalists on November 25, a video of which was released by the ISPR on Friday evening. “Borders are always mutually guarded. Both countries [guard] them. Now, on the other side is such a country whose posts first engage your posts through fire, and an exchange begins. And then they have them (terrorists) pass through the gaps in between,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. The DG ISPR said one would barely find any “administration” on the borders in terrorism-prone areas, except in “hardly five to 10 per cent” of the areas. “Go to Tirah, Khyber; you will not find any governance. Neither will you find any courts, nor any departments that deal with law enforcement and writ of the government.” The ISPR chief also pointed out that villages and populations were “divided” across the Pak-Afghan border. “There are 29 tribes here that are divided, whose population is here (Pakistan) and there (Afghanistan) as well. Right on the border. How will you control the movement there?” he asked. He noted that many questioned how terrorists could infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border, how smuggling was carried out, and how non-custom paid vehicles were able to pass through if the army and the Frontier Corps were stationed at the border. The military spokesperson then showed images of border fences. He highlighted that military posts were set up at a distance of about 15-25 kilometres from the border. Noting suggestions for hermetically sealing the border, the DG ISPR questioned whether even the United States, with its vast resources, was able to do the same to its border with Mexico. “What you call a fence has no value in military terms if it is not covered by observation of fire, because someone can hold and cut that obstacle to bridge it,” he said. The military spokesman said building a security post every 2-5km and having drone surveillance would incur a “huge cost”. “You will have to invest in the infrastructure, as well as manpower,” he emphasised. Speaking on the “terror-crime nexus”, the DG ISPR said cells of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on the Pakistani side provided support to this network. Similar to the strategy he explained for terrorists’ infiltration, Lt Gen Chaudhry said there were extremely coordinated attacks on the army and FC deployments on the routes. “[They] attack the posts and have smugglers’ vehicles pass from below,” he said. He further said that non-custom-paid vehicles were a part of this network. “If there are 0.40-0.45 million non-custom-paid vehicles moving in your province, then why do you not stop them? Who is to stop them […] why are they not stopping it, why are they not checking it, whose responsibility is this?” he asked. “The non-customs paid vehicles are part of this political-terror-crime nexus, are being used in vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and by these terrorists in their movement,” the DG ISPR said. ‘Afghan side could not deny evidence presented by Pakistan’ On the Pak-Afghan dialogue that broke down earlier this month, Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted that Pakistan’s stance was “absolutely clear”, with Islamabad conveying that the presence of TTP cells, and their funding and functioning from Afghan soil, was not acceptable. “We presented all kinds of evidence, and they could not deny that evidence. It was absolutely clear to the mediators, as well as to the Afghans there,” the military spokesman highlighted. He said that Pakistan was even open to a “third-party agreement” that would detail a verifiable mechanism to combat cross-border terrorism. He cited a report by the United States’ Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) that said more than $7.2 billion worth of US military equipment had been left behind in the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Lt Gen Chaudhry said the Afghan Taliban had been unable to “convert” themselves into a state after 2021, and were now patronising various non-state actors, including those that were “country-specific and region-specific”. He noted that Fitna Al Khawarij (TTP), Fitna al Hindustan , the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , Al Qaeda and Daesh were among those groups found in Afghanistan. “We say that you need to act like a state now. […] They had said that ‘we will not allow our soil to be used for terrorism’,” the DG ISPR said, adding that the Kabul regime was not representative of the Afghans. The military spokesperson recalled the promises made in the 2020 Doha agreement and asserted that Pakistan had been engaging with the Afghan Taliban since 2021. “Our problem is not with the Afghans. Our problem is with the Afghan Taliban regime,” he added. “Blood and business cannot go together,” he said, stressing that trade had been halted as Pakistan’s security was paramount. During the same briefing, Lt Gen Chaudhry also refuted allegations by the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan had conducted overnight strikes in Afghanistan earlier this week. “In our view, there is only one sort of terrorist which is good, which is a dead terrorist,” he quipped, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists. The DG ISPR also highlighted statistics for the repatriation of illegal migrants, stating that 971,604 individuals had been sent back this year so far — 239,574 in November alone — compared to 366,704 people in 2024. ‘Delusional India wants to sell defeat as victory’ Lt Gen Chaudhry also spoke about India during his media talk. “We can’t do anything about a delusional mind,” the DG ISPR said, recalling the Indian army chief’s comments on the May conflict being a “trailer”. “Seven jets were downed, 26 locations were attacked, and the S400 batteries were lost in that ‘trailer’. So, I think now he wants to watch a full horror film,” he said, adding that India wanted to sell its defeat as a victory to its population. “Any country that provides any kind of equipment to the Afghan Taliban, saying they are giving it to their army, you can consider that it is available to the terrorists.” The military spokesperson also highlighted that there were social media accounts based outside of Pakistan that were involved in inciting violence in the country. Using social media platform X’s new feature to show the country a user is located in, Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted certain handles that post about Balochistan. He said the accounts were “doing politics inside Pakistan, and concocting a narrative against the state, against your army, against your leaders”. ‘Seems local population engagement missing in KP’ “All our governments and political parties agree that the solution to terrorism lies in a comprehensive National Action Plan ,” the DG ISPR said. He detailed that there were provincial apex committees chaired by the chief minister with 23 members, a provincial steering committee with 25 members, followed by a division-level monitoring committee, and then a district-level implementation body. Speaking further on the non-kinetic aspects, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that the administration and the military had 140 engagements per day with the local population, including school visits and jirgas. “The actual solution to terrorism lies in these, which the provincial and district governments ought to do […] We feel all this is missing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said. The ISPR chief also noted that 949 projects were underway in 35 districts, and that work was also being carried out on the Green Balochistan Initiative, a part of the Green Pakistan Initiative . The military spokesman highlighted that the smuggling of Iranian diesel was a huge contributor to the “illegal spectrum, the funding of the terrorists”. “Before the army, FC and the provincial government started this crackdown, permits were given for 20.5 million litres per day, or it was smuggled. We have brought it down to the current average of 2.7m litres,“ he said. ‘Over 67,000 IBOs conducted since Jan’ Detailing the counter-terrorism efforts, the DG ISPR said 4,910 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) had been carried out since November 4, amounting to 233 IBOs per day. “The intensity of the kinetic counter-terrorism effort is going up,” he said, noting that 206 terrorists were killed in these operations.

      "summary_orig": "Sri Lanka made an appeal for international assistance on Saturday as the death toll from heavy rains and floods triggered by Cyclone Ditwah rose to 123, with another 130 reported missing. The extreme weather system has destroyed nearly 15,000 homes, sending almost 44,000 people to state-run temporary shelters, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said. Director-General Sampath Kotuwegoda said relief operations had been strengthened with the deployment of thousands of troops from the army, navy and air force. “We have 123 confirmed dead and another 130 missing,” Kotuwegoda told reporters in Colombo. Cyclone Ditwah was moving away from the island on Saturday and was heading towards neighbouring India to the north, but it had already left massive destruction in its wake. “Relief operations with the help of the armed forces are underway,” Kotuwegoda said. Fresh landslides hit the central district of Kandy, 115 kilometres east of Colombo, with the main access road under water at several locations. “Fibre optic cables have snapped at many places and mobile phones are not working because base stations have been flooded,” a DMC official told AFP. He said a special unit had been deployed to restore communication lines, as several remote areas remained inaccessible by road after mudslides in tea-growing mountainous regions. The government issued an appeal for international help and asked Sri Lankans abroad to make cash donations to support nearly half a million affected people Officials said Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya had met with Colombo-based diplomats to update them on the situation and seek the help of their governments. PM says Pakistan ready to extend support India was the first to respond, sending two planeloads of relief supplies, while an Indian warship already in Colombo on a previously planned goodwill visit donated its rations to help victims. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences over the loss of lives in Sri Lanka and said New Delhi was ready to send more aid. “We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” Modi said on X. Meanwhile, Priem Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan was ready to extend “any support in rescue, recovery and relief efforts as a symbol of our solidarity with our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters”. “Pakistan stands in solidarity with the people and government of Sri Lanka in this hour of grief,” he said. Flooding in low-lying areas worsened on Saturday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for those living along the banks of the Kelani River, which flows into the Indian Ocean from Colombo. The Kelani burst its banks on Friday evening, forcing hundreds of people into temporary shelters, DMC said. Rain had eased in most parts of the country, including the capital, but parts of the island’s north were still experiencing showers due to the residual effects of Cyclone Ditwah. DMC officials said they expected flood levels to exceed those recorded in 2016, when 71 people were killed nationwide. This week’s weather-related toll is the highest since June last year, when 26 people were killed following heavy rains. In December, 17 people died in flooding and landslides. The worst flooding Sri Lanka has experienced since the turn of the century occurred in June 2003, when 254 people were killed.",

      "summary_orig": "No loss of life was reported after two separate blasts targeted a police checkpoint and a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) vehicle on Quetta’s Qambrani Road. Police said the first blast occurred near a police checkpoint in the area around Qambrani Road, when unknown motorcyclists hurled a grenade at the post. A second blast, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), took place in the same area as miscreants targeted a CTD vehicle that was heading towards the scene of the first explosion. However, the vehicle escaped the IED blast and all CTD officials remained safe, police said. Police added that the IED was fixed to a motorcycle, adding that a remote was used to detonate it. The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) , in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces. Three explosions were reported across Balochistan yesterday, with one person injured in a blast in Kachhi district’s Mach Town. Another two blasts took place at Major Chowk in Mastung, which were followed by an exchange of fire between armed men and security forces. Earlier this week, the Jaffar Express escaped an armed attack while passing through the Bolan Pass area of Kachhi distr­i­­ct. The incident marked the sixth attack on the train during the past one and a half months. On September 30, at least 10 people , including four personnel, lost their lives and 33 were injured when a bomb blast ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters.",

      "title_orig": "Hong Kong mourns victims of blaze that killed 128 and counting",
      "summary_orig": "Hong Kong on Saturday mourned the 128 people known to have died in a massive fire at a high-rise apartment complex, a toll that is likely to rise with 200 others still unaccounted for days after the disaster. Authorities have arrested 11 people in connection with the city’s worst blaze in nearly 80 years as they investigate possible corruption and the use of unsafe materials during renovations at the Wang Fuk Court complex. Rescue operations at the site in the district of Tai Po, near the border with mainland China, concluded on Friday, though police say they may find more bodies as they search the burnt-out buildings as part of ongoing investigations. The fire started on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly engulfed seven of the eight 32-storey blocks at the complex, which were wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green mesh and layered with foam insulation for the renovations. Search for bodies continues Authorities have said the fire alarms at the estate, home to more than 4,600 people, had not been working properly. Hong Kong leader John Lee, other officials and civil servants, all dressed in black, stood in silence for three minutes early on Saturday outside the central government offices, where flags were lowered to half-mast. Condolence books have been set up at 18 points around the former British colony for the public to pay their respects. “Our most heartfelt thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones and with those that are now living with shock and uncertainty,” Britain’s King Charles said in a statement about the “appalling tragedy”. At Wang Fuk Court, police officers from the disaster victim identification unit, wearing white overalls, helmets and oxygen masks, entered one of the charred buildings to continue their search for remains. They climbed over mounds of bamboo scaffolding that had fallen during the disaster and around large puddles of water created after firemen doused the buildings for days to try to lower the temperatures inside. Families and mourners gathered to lay flowers while some faced the grim task of looking at photographs of the dead taken by rescue workers. Authorities said on Friday that only 39 of the 128 dead had been identified. Hong Kong’s Lee has said the government would set up a HK$300 million ($40m) fund to help residents, while some of China’s biggest listed companies have pledged donations. Hundreds of volunteers have also mobilised to help the victims, sorting and distributing items from nappies to hot food. They formed teams to collect, transport and distribute goods in round-the-clock shifts and have set up a sprawling support camp for displaced residents beside a shopping mall across from the complex. Domestic workers from Indonesia and the Philippines were also caught up in the tragedy. Hong Kong has around 368,000 such workers, mostly women from low-income Asian countries who live with their employers, often in cramped spaces. Indonesia said six of its citizens died in the incident. The Philippines said one of its nationals is critically injured, another is confirmed missing, and 28 are thought to be residents of the area but their whereabouts are unknown. Deadliest blaze since 1948 The fire is Hong Kong’s deadliest since 1948, when 176 people died in a warehouse blaze, and has prompted comparisons to London’s Grenfell Tower inferno, which killed 72 people in 2017. Residents of Wang Fuk Court were told by authorities last year that they faced “relatively low fire risks” after complaining repeatedly about fire hazards posed by ongoing renovation, the city’s Labour Department told Reuters. The residents had raised concerns in September 2024, including about the potential flammability of the protective green mesh contractors had used to cover the bamboo scaffolding, a department spokesperson said. Hong Kong’s anti-graft body said it had arrested eight people on Friday, including an engineering consultant, a scaffolding subcontractor and an intermediary. Earlier, police arrested two directors and an engineering consultant of Prestige Construction, a firm identified by the government as doing maintenance on Wang Fuk Court for more than a year, on suspicion of manslaughter for using unsafe materials, including flammable foam boards blocking windows. Prestige did not answer repeated calls for comment. Public anger over the fire has so far been muted, a stark contrast to mass pro-democracy protests of 2019 that prompted Beijing to tighten its grip on the city. Yet some frustrated volunteers handed out flyers near the estate on Friday, demanding proper resettlement of affected residents, an overhaul of government oversight of construction projects, and an independent probe into the blaze. As with other major fire incidents like Grenfell, analysts say pressure for answers may quickly spread beyond the construction firms to government regulators. The Hong Kong government has traditionally staged open inquiries into large-scale tragedies, often headed by an independent judge.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: A judicial magistrate on Friday granted the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) a four-day physical remand of Sohrab Barkat, an Islamabad-based digital media journalist, in a case of spreading misinformation about state institutions. A team of NCCIA produced the journalist before the magistrate at district courts and sought his physical remand for 30 days. The investigating officer said physical custody of the suspect was required for the recovery of social media accounts and completion of investigation. A counsel for the suspect opposed the remand request, saying the journalist was illegally offloaded and arrested from Islamabad airport when he was going abroad to attend a United Nations conference. He said the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) told a court in Islamabad that there was no case registered against the journalist. But later he was booked in the cybercrime case. The counsel argued that there was a delay of 24 hours in the production of the suspect before the court. He said the suspect had not committed any offence. He pointed out that the alleged derogatory remarks were made by PTI activist Sanam Javed, who was a guest in a programme hosted by the journalist for a digital media channel. In his order, Magistrate Naeem Wattoo noted that the record shows that the suspect is nominated in the FIR registered on Aug 5 and an inquiry has been decided against him. He said the suspect was even declared a proclaimed offender after obtaining arrest warrants from the court. “Therefore, it cannot be said that this case was registered for justifying his arrest on alleged offloading,” the magistrate held in his order, approving a four-day physical remand of the journalist. The magistrate directed the NCCIA to produce the suspect again on Dec 2. Published in Dawn, November 29th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump has announced that he is terminating all executive actions, proclamations, and directives issued during the presidency of his predecessor Joe Biden that were signed using a mechanical signature device known as an autopen. According to The Guardian , the autopen, which was patented in the US in 1803, is a robotic device that replicates signatures of a person using real ink. The decision comes amid a broader political offensive, including renewed attacks on immigration and personal criticism of Biden. Trump has often sought to drum up outrage over Biden’s alleged use of autopen to sign pardons, executive orders and other documents — accusing Biden of being too senile to govern while in power. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote: “Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92 per cent of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect.” “The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the United States,” he said. Trump insisted that “the Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him”. “I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,” he said. He claimed that “Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury”. The autopen is widely accepted in Washington as an administrative tool, but Trump has said their use under Biden proves the then-president was mentally incapacitated and not in control of the White House. Biden was 82 when he left office, while Trump is 79 and due to leave office in January 2029. Previous presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gerald Ford to Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden have all used the device for routine correspondence, and in some cases for urgent legislation while travelling. Obama famously used the autopen in 2011 to sign an extension of the Patriot Act while abroad, and George W. Bush also relied on it extensively for letters, condolence messages, and routine certifications. For decades, the device has been considered a practical convenience, not a constitutional issue. In 2005, the US Department of Justice issued a legal opinion confirming that a president’s approval, rather than physical signing, is what validates executive actions. Legal and political implications Trump’s declaration challenges long-standing legal precedent. In US administrative law, the validity of a presidential action rests on intent and approval, not the method of signature. Courts have consistently upheld this principle for decades. Legal experts say that without concrete evidence that Biden did not authorise the documents, Trump’s blanket cancellation order is likely to face immediate judicial scrutiny. Federal agencies, still bound by the Administrative Procedure Act, could be caught in uncertainty over which rules remain valid. If courts rule that autopen signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten ones, many of Trump’s cancellations could be struck down. Politically, the move reinforces Trump’s effort to delegitimise the previous administration and consolidate power in the Oval Office. It mirrors his public vow to “take back control from the Deep State” and forms part of a broader strategy to dismantle Biden-era policies on immigration, climate, education, workplace rules, and foreign aid. Democrats have criticised the move as a manufactured legal crisis, while Republicans argue it corrects a “procedural abuse”. Congressional Democrats are expected to challenge the decision through hearings and potential legislation. Impact on foreign relations The cancellations could also affect US relations abroad, creating uncertainty over the validity of executive actions. Biden-era commitments — including climate cooperation, refugee resettlement, student visas, trade facilitation, and security coordination — may now face ambiguity. Diplomatic observers note that foreign governments may seek clarifications about bilateral agreements and cooperative frameworks. Officials in Washington have expressed concern that retroactively voiding executive actions could undermine long-term confidence in US policy continuity, with implications for allies and partners, including countries like Pakistan, where immigration and visa matters are of direct concern. Trump’s focus on the autopen highlights the highly personalised and confrontational nature of current US politics. While the immediate legal effect of his actions remains uncertain, the decision adds to domestic political polarisation and introduces potential disruption in international relations.

      "summary_orig": "A teary-eyed Rashina narrates her ordeal.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star KARACHI: After going underground in Pakistan as an illegal alien for 18 years, a 65-year-old Sri Lankan woman, will now be able to return home to her children in Colombo, thanks to concerted efforts by Edhi Foundation, Saylani Welfare Trust and human rights advocate Zia Ahmed Awan. Speaking at a press conference at the Edhi headquarters at Meethadar on Friday, Rashina could not hold back her tears as she thanked all for coming to her aid. “I’m a poor woman. The government of Pakistan had imposed a 22 lac rupees fine on me for illegally overstaying in Pakistan. I didn’t even have money to pay for my return ticket to Sri Lanka, what to say of the heavy fine,” she said. “But God is great. God sent me help in all these people who made it possible for a destitute widow to reunite with her orphaned children,” she said. Sharing her story, Rashina said that she is a born Muslim from Sri Lanka, who found employment as a telephone operator at a travel agency in Kuwait. It was there that she met Javed Iqbal of Mian Channu, Punjab. “We fell in love and got married. Later, we moved to Saudi Arabia where we lived for some 15 years. We have three children, two daughters, Mumtaz and Aneesha, and a son Mohammed Rafay,” she said. In Saudi Arabia, later, when her husband lost his job, he desperately tried to find another but being unable to do so he was deported to Pakistan while Rashina was deported to Sri Lanka with their children. “Leaving my children in the care with my family in Colombo, I came to Pakistan on a visit visa to meet my husband in Mian Channu. But his family would not accept me. We left Punjab to come to Karachi where we found a small rented place. I know I should have returned to Sri Lanka when my visa expired but by then my husband had become seriously ill. His liver was failing. Then he passed away. That was in 2007. I have tried to return home to my children since then but I couldn’t without first paying a 22 lac rupees fine imposed on me for overstaying my welcome,” she informed. Rashina set to reunite with family in Colombo following legal aid and charity support “Having no place to go I would turn up at Saylani Welfare Trust for meals. There I met a volunteer, Anis Abdul Hafeez, who offered me a place to stay with his family in Surjani Town because I had no place to stay. When I fell sick, I reached out to Saylani again, and their chief trustee Arif Lakhani arranged for my heart bypass surgery. My hospital stay and medical bills were also taken care of by Saylani. They also tried to find me legal help. But we were getting nowhere. Not knowing what else to do, I started protesting outside the Karachi Press Club,” she said. Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi said: “That was when some journalists alerted my son Saad Edhi about Rashina’s plight. “I then reached out to our regular legal counsel Advocate Zia Ahmed Awan for help,” Faisal Edhi told Dawn . Advocate Zia Awan said that they reached out to the Ministry of Interior but to no avail. “Hope finally came when we approached the Constitutional Bench of the Sindh High Court which ordered for the Interior Secretary to appear before it. That was when Rashina’s hefty fine was waived and she was ordered to leave Pakistan within 15 days,” the able advocate reported. As Arif Lakhani of Saylani had already got her Sri Lankan passport renewed, it was only a matter of him buying her a one-way air ticket to Colombo. With that arranged, Rashina is now all set to board her flight back home from Karachi on December 2. “You are all welcome to Colombo. You will stay with me there. My children, who are half Pakistani, and I will love to have you,” Rashina told Zia Awan, Faisal Edhi, Arif Lakhani, Anis Abdul Hafeez and even the members of the media who had come to cover her story. Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi and Advocate Awan urged the government to look into waiving off the hefty fines imposed on aliens stuck in this country only because they don’t have money to pay the fines. “When they want to go home we should also not let such hurdles come in their way,” Faisal Edhi said.

      "summary_orig": "• Imran’s allies demand immediate access for family, doctors and lawyers • Warn of dire consequences amid unease among public • Minister accuses Afghan, Indian media of circulating ‘false’ reports about PTI leader ISLAMABAD: Amid a noisy protest in the Senate for a second day by PTI senators, the government on Friday assured the House that former prime minister Imran Khan was in good health with no threat to his life and blamed Afghan and Indian media for circulating “false” reports about Mr Khan’s health. The ruckus by PTI lawmakers, alarmed by social media reports about Mr Khan’s condition, dominated the day’s proceedings. They chanted slogans and hit their desks, demanding that family members, doctors and lawyers be allowed to meet with Mr Khan after what they called a “complete blackout for weeks”. Syed Ali Zafar, the PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate, sought an explanation from the government about the reports. “The tension level of the public has risen so high that there will be an explosion if the matter was not resolved immediately,” Mr Zafar warned. He added that the party’s senators would not participate in proceedings until a minister provided a clear response. “We will not become part of the proceedings till the minister concerned comes and responds,” he said before PTI senators staged a walkout. While the government gave no assurance on allowing visits, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry rejected the social media reports as baseless. Imran Khan “is in good health, facing no threat to his life, and is being provided with all facilities”, Chaudhry said, relaying information from the superintendent of Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where the ex-premier is being held. The minister claimed Afghan media initially spread the “fake stories,” which he said were then amplified by Indian media. The minister’s statement failed to satisfy the opposition. “We will not let the proceedings continue,” one lawmaker said. “You cannot threaten like this,” Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani responded. The proceedings were briefly adjourned when the House was found to be one member short of a quorum. After business resumed, PTI members continued their protest, chanting “release Imran Khan”. Meanwhile, the government laid the money bill — the Income Tax (Third Amendment) Bill, 2025 — before the House, to make recommendations on it to the National Assembly, as required under Article 73 of the Constitution. The chair referred the bill to the Standing Committee for Finance and Revenue for further consideration Later in the session, PTI Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, when called upon to move an item on the agenda, spoke instead on Imran’s health and rejected claims that meetings with the former leader were taking place, saying their leader had been kept behind bars unjustly and on frivolous charges. The session chairman, Shahadat Awan of the PPP, eventually deferred the remaining agenda items after a minister expressed an inability to respond in the noisy environment. He then adjourned the House to meet again on Monday at 4pm. Published in Dawn, November 29th, 2025",
