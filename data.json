      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the nation was united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country, and the government would take all measures to crush violence perpetrated from across the border. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a similar warning in the National Assembly about going after terrorist facilitators “wherever they are”. The government’s warning came a day after a lieutenant colonel and a major, among 11 security personnel , were martyred in an exchange of fire with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan terrorist group in the Orakzai district. In his opening remarks during today’s federal cabinet meeting, PM Shehbaz paid tribute to army officers and soldiers involved in conducting operations against terrorists. He said facilitators were protecting terrorists who were coming from across the border. The premier stressed that the situation had reached a critical point and terrorists would not be spared. PM Shehbaz added that the government’s achievements on the economic and diplomatic fronts would come to naught if terrorism was not eliminated. Meanwhile, Asif thundered that “enough is enough” and the facilitators of terrorism would have to pay, whether they were present on Pakistani or Afghan soil. Asif reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to defend its territory and defeat terrorism through unity, determination. He said that the issue of terrorism required a united approach beyond political or regional divisions. “Our focus should be on how to eliminate this menace of terrorism once and for all,’’ Asif added. Expressing grief over the martyrdom of two officers and nine soldiers, Asif said their sacrifices called for national unity and collective resolve. Recalling his visit to Afghanistan three years ago, the defence minister said he had raised the issue of cross-border terrorism directly with Afghan authorities. “We candidly told them that their soil was being used for terrorist activities in Pakistan,’’ he said. The minister said Pakistan had urged Afghanistan to control the militants and dismantle their sanctuaries. ‘‘We asked them to shut down the safe havens and stop providing shelter or support to these groups.’’ The defence minister added that Afghan officials had demanded financial assistance, claiming that with such aid, they could relocate these groups to western provinces away from Pakistan’s border. However, he said Pakistan had sought a firm guarantee that these militants would not return, a condition the Afghan authorities were unwilling to accept. ‘‘Due to the absence of that assurance, the proposal could not be finalized,’’ he added. Asif also proposed urgent diplomatic action to curb cross-border terrorism, suggesting that a delegation be sent to Kabul within the next day or two to press Afghan authorities to dismantle safe havens being used against Pakistan.",

      "summary_orig": "Hamas and Israel signed an agreement on Thursday to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the conflict in Gaza. Officials on both sides confirmed they had signed the deal following indirect talks in the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The deal’s announcement had been greeted with celebrations among Palestinians and Israelis alike. The deal includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement is ratified by his government, which would convene after a security cabinet meeting today. An Israeli government spokeswoman, confirming the deal had been signed, said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. After that 24-hour period, the captives held in Gaza will be freed within 72 hours, she said. A source briefed on details of the agreement said earlier that Israeli troops would begin pulling back within 24 hours of the deal being signed. An Israeli official said all 20 Israeli captives still believed to be alive in Gaza after being seized by Hamas would be released. The prisoners released in exchange will not include Marwan Barghouti, one of the most prominent Palestinian prisoners, the spokeswoman said. Trump said today that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons. “I’m not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. But … there will be disarming,” Trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting, adding that there would also be “pullbacks” by Israeli forces. He said he had no view regarding the possibility of a two-state solution and he would follow whatever was ultimately agreed on. “I don’t have a view. I’m going to go with what they agreed to,” he told reporters. On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We’re going to create something where people can live … We’re going to create better conditions for people.“ He said that the Gaza captives should be released on Monday or Tuesday and that he hopes to attend a signing ceremony in Egypt. Trump said he believed it will lead to “lasting peace”. “We are getting the hostages back on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, and that’ll be a day of joy,” Trump said. Trump said under the plan Gaza is going to be “slowly redone”, a reference to plans to rebuild the Palestinian enclave. He did not provide details. While questions remain about what happens in the region in the long term, Trump said he hoped it would lead to “an everlasting peace”. Key developments US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”; says he thinks captives will probably be released on Monday Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, Trump had said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal. Qatar had said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”. Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP . The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said. The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added. The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.” Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!” He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”. “The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview. “This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”. In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.” “Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”. Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”. In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt. “I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza. Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier. An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday. ‘Optimism prevails’ As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air. “We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza. Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce. In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday. Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible. The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning. Protests, prisoners Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return. One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for. High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media. Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”. Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration. Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen. There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007. Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries. It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza. Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide.

      "summary_orig": "Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who was aboard the Gaza-bound Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) and imprisoned by Israel, criticised Muslim governments across the globe for not putting enough pressure on Israel or taking any action to prevent the ongoing genocide. Khan led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel GSF, which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. Khan was detained in Israel for five days before being deported to Jordan. Appearing on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, the ex-senator slammed the federal government, as well as other Muslim governments, for failing to put pressure on Israel to stop its onslaught in the Gaza Strip. Khan also outlined his experience in Israeli captivity during the interview. “What I want to ask is that if Sweden’s Greta [Thunberg] can lead the flotilla, then where are the Muslim countries?” he asked. “Why didn’t the people stand up? I am ashamed that 2 billion Muslims could not do anything. “There were parliamentarians in jail with me. Where were Pakistan’s parliamentarians?” Speaking about Pakistan’s role in the peace plan, specifically the meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Khan highlighted that the 20-point plan unveiled by United States President Donald Trump was a “project of slavery”. “Since they (Israel) could not capture Gaza by force, they tried to capture it through negotiations. That 20-point plan was a slap in Hamas’ face,” he emphasised. He highlighted that the Palestinian Authority’s involvement was also questionable, as they talked about Gaza “minus Hamas” at the UN General Assembly. “The world order had failed; thus, civilians undertook the mission,” Khan said.\nWhen asked about whether the Gaza peace plan would be successful, the ex-senator replied in the affirmative, adding that the people of Europe and their pressure on Israel would be a contributing factor and that they would be able to bring about a ceasefire. “Most of the people in this flotilla, 80 per cent, were Europeans and non-Muslims,” Khan explained. When asked about why Europeans were so fervently campaigning for Palestine, the ex-senator explained that they are complicit in decades of oppression by a colonising force. “On this flotilla, the Westerners decided that they would bring as many Jews on board as possible,” Khan said. “The goal was to show that Zionism is an enemy of humanity and exploits Judaism. The vast majority of Jews do not support Zionists.\n“They would use the f-word when talking about Israel,” he added. The ex-senator also hailed Swedish activist Greta Thunberg as a “hero of humanity” for standing up for the Palestinians. “Greta … a young girl left the world shaken,” he added. “I will invite her to Pakistan.” The senator also floated the idea of a new flotilla mission with participants from across the world, but under the leadership of international Islamic civil society members. “We will make sure that we fly Pakistani flags from the boats,” he vowed. “If the peace plan fails, if a humanitarian corridor is not opened, if the genocide is not stopped and if the culprits of this genocide are not brought to justice, then we will launch our own flotilla ourselves. Behind bars at Ktzi’ot Prison Programme host Hamid Mir pointed out the ex-senator’s loss of weight, to which he replied that it was due to a mix of the journey through the Mediterranean and a three-day hunger strike in jail. “It was a 20-day journey through the Mediterranean to Ashdod Port. We would eat once every 24 hours during the trip, and only ate salan (curry) twice,” Khan said. “There was bread and dates, that was all the food we ate. “In the Israeli jail, we staged a three-day hunger strike. That contributed to my weight loss,” he added, calling the jail a “concentration camp” with a “torture cell”. When asked about his faith in accomplishing the mission, Khan said he did not believe it, but was hopeful that “God would provide a path”. The ex-senator added that he had “exposed Israel’s genocidal face to the world” during the mission. “Malaysia sent the biggest delegation on the flotilla,” the ex-senator said, extending gratitude to Kuala Lumpur for its support. “I went straight to Tunis from Kuala Lumpur; I could not come back to Pakistan because I had several cases against me. I was afraid I’d be stopped at the airport (in Pakistan).” Khan said that he was part of the Palestine Action Coalition and was representing the Pak-Palestine Forum. When asked about the raid, Khan said that the participants had been given standard operating procedures in case of boarding or an Israeli attack. “When we left Crete, we knew that we were in danger of a drone attack,” he explained. He added that there were 50 boats in the flotilla when they left Crete. “This was a journey of four days and nights, so we expected interception and drone attacks. We were instructed to throw our phones and belongings into the sea so that the Israelis couldn’t get them,” the ex-senator said. “When I saw the Israeli navy ships up close, they were paper tigers,” he said. “Their entire navy responded and it took them 12 hours to intercept us all. “My boat, the ‘Allakatalla’ … was the second-last to be intercepted. The last boat was 28 kilometres [from Gaza] when it was intercepted,” he said. “One of the [Israeli] ships was bigger than this building and sailing behind a 12-metre boat; the wake it was creating nearly caused up to capsize.” He added that when the boat was boarded by Israeli commandos, the participants had been ordered to remain nonviolent and not resist at all. Khan said the Israelis shone bright lights at the flotilla and a team of 12 S-13 commandos boarded the vessel. “When they were jumping onto our boat, two of them fell over so badly that we were afraid that they would shoot us because they were scared,” Khan remarked. “Their training was awful, no professionalism. If we had 100 boats and we were not exhausted by the trip, they could not have intercepted us. “The only thing they (the Israeli military) can do is kill babies; they are unable to deal with any resistance.” Recalling his time in Israeli jail, the ex-senator said that Israeli officials expressed disdain for Palestine and ripped the Palestinian flag hoisted on the boat. He added that they forcefully removed the Pakistani flag. “We were ordered not to make eye contact with them (the Israelis). I quietly lifted the flag and put it inside the boat,” he recalled. “We were given instructions like ’hands up, lie face down on the ground. They would kick anyone for the smallest thing. “They assigned two army personnel to each of us. When they asked me where I’m from, I replied that I’m from Pakistan, to which they hurled abuse at me. They were provoking me so that I’d hit them and give them an excuse,” Khan added. “They kept probing us throughout and went through our documents before putting us in a bus to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev Desert, which is infamous for its brutality. We could not see anything from inside the van; there were walls all around.” When asked about what happened in the prison, Khan said that they were forced to remove their clothes and wear “jail clothes”. He added that they were led to their cells “like detainees at Guantanamo Bay”. “There were two big cell blocks; 10 rooms on either side in one of the blocks, with a 30-foot walkway in between,” the ex-senator described. “We were locked in cell number 911. We were called ‘troublemakers’; suddenly, people with guns and dogs entered our cells and forced us into a corner. “They then bound our hands and feet and blindfolded us, before taking us to isolation and then putting us in an open cage outdoors. Our hands were so tightly bound that we could not feel them after two hours. We were not allowed to offer our Maghrib prayers by the guards. We prayed anyway without wudu or prostration.” When asked about his cellmates, he replied that one was an American policeman, a Swiss senator and people from Europe. There were also two Tunisians and two Egyptians. The former senator arrived in Islamabad from Jordan earlier today wearing a keffiyeh and was accorded a hero’s welcome, with people showering him with petals and adorning garlands on the former lawmaker. @dawn.today Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan landed in Islamabad to cheers and applause on Thursday. Khan was part of the Global Sumud Flotilla's mission to Gaza to distribute humanitarian aid. His vessel was intercepted in the late hours of October 1 and he was taken in captivity along with other participants of the GSF. After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com The Pakistan embassy in Jordan, where he was deported to earlier, said late on Wednesday that Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan. In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan. “In accordance with the instructions of the honourable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said. The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post. Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi. According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home. “He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Khan was scheduled to reach Pakistan today. On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said. “Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said. Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted. He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.",

I was afraid I’d be stopped at the airport (in Pakistan).” Khan said that he was part of the Palestine Action Coalition and was representing the Pak-Palestine Forum. When asked about the raid, Khan said that the participants had been given standard operating procedures in case of boarding or an Israeli attack. “When we left Crete, we knew that we were in danger of a drone attack,” he explained. He added that there were 50 boats in the flotilla when they left Crete. “This was a journey of four days and nights, so we expected interception and drone attacks. We were instructed to throw our phones and belongings into the sea so that the Israelis couldn’t get them,” the ex-senator said. “When I saw the Israeli navy ships up close, they were paper tigers,” he said. “Their entire navy responded and it took them 12 hours to intercept us all. “My boat, the ‘Allakatalla’ … was the second-last to be intercepted. The last boat was 28 kilometres [from Gaza] when it was intercepted,” he said. “One of the [Israeli] ships was bigger than this building and sailing behind a 12-metre boat; the wake it was creating nearly caused up to capsize.” He added that when the boat was boarded by Israeli commandos, the participants had been ordered to remain nonviolent and not resist at all. Khan said the Israelis shone bright lights at the flotilla and a team of 12 S-13 commandos boarded the vessel. “When they were jumping onto our boat, two of them fell over so badly that we were afraid that they would shoot us because they were scared,” Khan remarked. “Their training was awful, no professionalism. If we had 100 boats and we were not exhausted by the trip, they could not have intercepted us. “The only thing they (the Israeli military) can do is kill babies; they are unable to deal with any resistance.” Recalling his time in Israeli jail, the ex-senator said that Israeli officials expressed disdain for Palestine and ripped the Palestinian flag hoisted on the boat. He added that they forcefully removed the Pakistani flag. “We were ordered not to make eye contact with them (the Israelis). I quietly lifted the flag and put it inside the boat,” he recalled. “We were given instructions like ’hands up, lie face down on the ground. They would kick anyone for the smallest thing. “They assigned two army personnel to each of us. When they asked me where I’m from, I replied that I’m from Pakistan, to which they hurled abuse at me. They were provoking me so that I’d hit them and give them an excuse,” Khan added. “They kept probing us throughout and went through our documents before putting us in a bus to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev Desert, which is infamous for its brutality. We could not see anything from inside the van; there were walls all around.” When asked about what happened in the prison, Khan said that they were forced to remove their clothes and wear “jail clothes”. He added that they were led to their cells “like detainees at Guantanamo Bay”. “There were two big cell blocks; 10 rooms on either side in one of the blocks, with a 30-foot walkway in between,” the ex-senator described. “We were locked in cell number 911. We were called ‘troublemakers’; suddenly, people with guns and dogs entered our cells and forced us into a corner. “They then bound our hands and feet and blindfolded us, before taking us to isolation and then putting us in an open cage outdoors. Our hands were so tightly bound that we could not feel them after two hours. We were not allowed to offer our Maghrib prayers by the guards. We prayed anyway without wudu or prostration.” When asked about his cellmates, he replied that one was an American policeman, a Swiss senator and people from Europe. There were also two Tunisians and two Egyptians. The former senator arrived in Islamabad from Jordan earlier today wearing a keffiyeh and was accorded a hero’s welcome, with people showering him with petals and adorning garlands on the former lawmaker. @dawn.today Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan landed in Islamabad to cheers and applause on Thursday. Khan was part of the Global Sumud Flotilla's mission to Gaza to distribute humanitarian aid. His vessel was intercepted in the late hours of October 1 and he was taken in captivity along with other participants of the GSF. After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com The Pakistan embassy in Jordan, where he was deported to earlier, said late on Wednesday that Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan. In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan. “In accordance with the instructions of the honourable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said. The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post. Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi. According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home. “He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Khan was scheduled to reach Pakistan today. On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said. “Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said. Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted. He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.",

      "title_orig": "Explainer: Does the Gaza deal mean the two-year-old conflict is over?",
      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump says the deal agreed between Israel and Hamas marks the first steps toward a “strong, durable, and everlasting peace” that will end the two-year-old Gaza conflict. Yet the agreement signed after indirect talks in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, a favoured location for Middle East peace conferences over the decades with a patchy record of success, is only an initial phase involving a ceasefire, a handover of captives held in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners inside Israel and a partial withdrawal of Israel from the enclave. Plenty of pitfalls remain after negotiators left for later discussions about some of the thornier issues on which previous initiatives have foundered, such as the full extent of an Israeli withdrawal, the disarmament of Hamas, how to guarantee that fighting will not resume after this phase — and who could provide such a guarantee. Have the guns fallen silent? Not yet. Trump demanded Israel halt its bombing when Hamas first indicated partial acceptance for his 20-point plan on Friday. That has not happened. Scores of Palestinians have been killed since then in airstrikes and shelling, particularly in and around Gaza City, the focus of a recent Israeli offensive. However, the bombardment has been more sporadic since Trump declared a deal had been secured a day ago, prompting celebrations in Israel, where families of captives were jubilant in Tel Aviv’s so-called hostages square, and in Gaza, where people gathered among the ruins even as blasts could be heard. How does this differ from ceasefires that collapsed? While this is a partial deal, a notable difference from previous ceasefire arrangements is that there is no deadline for reaching a full deal. It does not set a deadline of a few weeks, after which hostilities could resume if talks falter. The jury is still out on whether that makes this deal more durable. There are those among Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s religious nationalist coalition who are already talking of more fighting. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a staunch opponent of any concession to Palestinians, has called for Hamas to be destroyed after the captives are returned. But on this occasion, Trump has been far more vocal in his determination to hold feet to the fire on both sides, leaving less room for Israel to relaunch its offensive or Hamas to delay, even if past experience counsels caution over too much optimism. Trump announced his plan standing next to Netanyahu in Washington last week with what seemed a “take-it-or-leave-it” offer for Hamas. Yet when Hamas gave only a partial acceptance, Trump immediately demanded Israel stop bombing. And as the days ticked by in the Sharm el-Sheikh talks, he warned Hamas “all hell, like no one has ever seen before, will break out” if it did not sign up. By stamping his authority, Trump may have gone some way to answering the key question of who will guarantee this deal does not collapse at the next hurdle. So what happens next? The timeline is emerging but still seems fluid. Netanyahu’s office said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement is ratified by his government, which would convene after a security cabinet meeting today. An Israeli government spokeswoman said a ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. After that 24-hour period, the captives held in Gaza will be freed within 72 hours, she said.\nA source briefed on details of the agreement said earlier that Israeli troops would begin pulling back within 24 hours of the deal being signed. Humanitarian aid to Palestinians should then start to flow. Calling for full access for humanitarian workers in Gaza, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the United Nations was ready to help and “prepared to move now”. Trump’s plan also calls for an international stabilisation force, which could start taking shape after a meeting of European ministers and top officials from Arab states in Paris today. They were also due to discuss issues such as future governance of Gaza, aid, reconstruction and demilitarisation. Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s office said Trump was expected to be in Jerusalem on Sunday. What are the political calculations facing Hamas and Israel? Both Israel and Hamas have shown a readiness to respond positively to pressure from Trump and others, but each side faces their own political calculations. For Netanyahu, agreeing to the plan seems based on a calculation he can stay on the right side of the US, Israel’s vital ally, and win over an Israeli public desperate to see an end to the conflict, while conceding as little as possible to avoid alienating his religious nationalist coalition partners. The 20-point plan, for example, offers a possible pathway, albeit highly conditional, to a Palestinian state although Netanyahu has said that will never happen. Hamas has dropped its opposition to any deal that was only partial because of the risk of fighting resuming once captives were handed over. It has also signed up to a deal calling for demilitarisation, which it had repeatedly rejected. Under pressure from Arab states and Turkiye, alongside Trump, Hamas may have had little choice but to accept. But it may be calculating that Trump’s determination is the best guarantee that the fighting will not resume for now, while the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh have put the group at the negotiating table to shape the future for Palestinians even though the deal seeks to sideline it.",

Plenty of pitfalls remain after negotiators left for later discussions about some of the thornier issues on which previous initiatives have foundered, such as the full extent of an Israeli withdrawal, the disarmament of Hamas, how to guarantee that fighting will not resume after this phase — and who could provide such a guarantee. Have the guns fallen silent? Not yet. Trump demanded Israel halt its bombing when Hamas first indicated partial acceptance for his 20-point plan on Friday. That has not happened. Scores of Palestinians have been killed since then in airstrikes and shelling, particularly in and around Gaza City, the focus of a recent Israeli offensive. However, the bombardment has been more sporadic since Trump declared a deal had been secured a day ago, prompting celebrations in Israel, where families of captives were jubilant in Tel Aviv’s so-called hostages square, and in Gaza, where people gathered among the ruins even as blasts could be heard. How does this differ from ceasefires that collapsed? While this is a partial deal, a notable difference from previous ceasefire arrangements is that there is no deadline for reaching a full deal. It does not set a deadline of a few weeks, after which hostilities could resume if talks falter. The jury is still out on whether that makes this deal more durable. There are those among Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s religious nationalist coalition who are already talking of more fighting. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a staunch opponent of any concession to Palestinians, has called for Hamas to be destroyed after the captives are returned. But on this occasion, Trump has been far more vocal in his determination to hold feet to the fire on both sides, leaving less room for Israel to relaunch its offensive or Hamas to delay, even if past experience counsels caution over too much optimism. Trump announced his plan standing next to Netanyahu in Washington last week with what seemed a “take-it-or-leave-it” offer for Hamas. Yet when Hamas gave only a partial acceptance, Trump immediately demanded Israel stop bombing. And as the days ticked by in the Sharm el-Sheikh talks, he warned Hamas “all hell, like no one has ever seen before, will break out” if it did not sign up. By stamping his authority, Trump may have gone some way to answering the key question of who will guarantee this deal does not collapse at the next hurdle. So what happens next? The timeline is emerging but still seems fluid. Netanyahu’s office said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement is ratified by his government, which would convene after a security cabinet meeting today. An Israeli government spokeswoman said a ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. After that 24-hour period, the captives held in Gaza will be freed within 72 hours, she said.\nA source briefed on details of the agreement said earlier that Israeli troops would begin pulling back within 24 hours of the deal being signed. Humanitarian aid to Palestinians should then start to flow. Calling for full access for humanitarian workers in Gaza, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the United Nations was ready to help and “prepared to move now”. Trump’s plan also calls for an international stabilisation force, which could start taking shape after a meeting of European ministers and top officials from Arab states in Paris today. They were also due to discuss issues such as future governance of Gaza, aid, reconstruction and demilitarisation. Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s office said Trump was expected to be in Jerusalem on Sunday. What are the political calculations facing Hamas and Israel? Both Israel and Hamas have shown a readiness to respond positively to pressure from Trump and others, but each side faces their own political calculations. For Netanyahu, agreeing to the plan seems based on a calculation he can stay on the right side of the US, Israel’s vital ally, and win over an Israeli public desperate to see an end to the conflict, while conceding as little as possible to avoid alienating his religious nationalist coalition partners. The 20-point plan, for example, offers a possible pathway, albeit highly conditional, to a Palestinian state although Netanyahu has said that will never happen. Hamas has dropped its opposition to any deal that was only partial because of the risk of fighting resuming once captives were handed over. It has also signed up to a deal calling for demilitarisation, which it had repeatedly rejected. Under pressure from Arab states and Turkiye, alongside Trump, Hamas may have had little choice but to accept. But it may be calculating that Trump’s determination is the best guarantee that the fighting will not resume for now, while the talks in Sharm el-Sheikh have put the group at the negotiating table to shape the future for Palestinians even though the deal seeks to sideline it.",

      "summary_orig": "Minister for Infor­mation Attaullah Tarar on Thursday claimed that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) Sohail Afridi has been nominated as the new chief minister for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to “support, promote, and enable” terrorism in the province. Yesterday, PTI’s Ali Amin Gandapur said he has resigned from his role as the KP CM while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Afridi to assume the role of provincial chief executive. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today along with Ikhtiar Wali Khan, the coordinator to prime minister on information for KP affairs, Tarar maintained PTI “enables terrorists”. “These handful of terrorists are enabled by a person sitting in jail who is the chief sponsor of terrorism,” the information minister claimed, saying that PTI founder’s support for terrorists is evident from old interviews. Tarar said the contention with Ali Amin Gandapur was that he does not do what he’s told, i.e., “enable and support terrorists and prevent actions against them”. Referring to Afridi as a “fugitive” and “criminal-minded”, the information minister further said he has been brought in to support and give a free hand to terrorists in KP. “Let me tell this with clarity to the KP govt and PTI,” he said. “Pakistan’s security policy is made in Islamabad and will continue to be so. It will not be made in Kabul. We will not allow terrorists to take full control.” Tarar alleged that PTI and its founder caused great damage to the country when they “brought in and settled terrorists” in the country, adding that PTI has been in governance for the past 12 years in KP and terrorism has again peaked. The information minister also referred to the verdict in the London high court earlier today , which ruled against YouTuber and former Pakistan Army officer retired Major Adil Farooq Raja in a high-profile defamation case filed by retired Brigadier Rashid Nasir, a former Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officer, saying that the verdict was a “win for Pakistan”. Meanwhile, Ikhtiar Wali said KP is “Pakistan’s most sensitive province”, besieged by terrorism from one side and bad governance from the other. ‘Flawed policies, mistaken priorities’ Shortly before the press conference, a post on Imran Khan’s official X account said that the complete eradication of terrorism in Pakistan, including KP, is “impossible without dialogue among four key stakeholders”, namely the KP and Afghan governments, the people of the tribal areas, as well as the Afghan people. “The flawed policies and mistaken priorities of the mafia presently imposed on the nation have led Pakistan, especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, into an alarming and unprecedented wave of terrorism,” the PTI founder said. “Even though two months still remain, this year Pakistan has witnessed a record number of terrorist incidents, resulting in an enormous loss of life on a scale difficult to find precedent for.” Yesterday, eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation in KP’s Orakzai district, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations. Referring to the incident, Imran in his tweet said that he was “deeply saddened by the loss of precious lives”.",

      "summary_orig": "Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah welcomed a high-level Saudi business delegation on Thursday and highlighted 12 priority sectors for investment in the province. The high-level business delegation from Saudi Arabia, led by Saudi-Pakistan Joint Business Council Chairman Prince Mansour bin Mohammad Al Saud, arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday to discuss trade, investment and collaboration. The development followed Pakistan forming an 18-member committee to oversee bilateral economic engagements and negotiations with the kingdom. Last month, the two countries also signed a mutual defence agreement, pledging a joint response to any act of aggression. A press release issued today from the CM Secretariat said the delegation was welcomed at CM House by Shah and provincial ministers. It added that the delegation included over 30 prominent businessmen and investors associated with the energy, infrastructure, agriculture, livestock, mining, construction, logistics and investment sectors. Representatives of the Pakistan Business Council, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) and the Saudi Embassy also attended the meeting. On the occasion, two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, marking significant progress in K-Electric’s ownership and future collaboration framework. The first MoU was signed for the sale and purchase of shares in KES Power Ltd. The second MoU was signed between K-Electric Limited and Trident Energy Ltd to explore strategic cooperation and investment opportunities in Pakistan’s power sector. “These agreements reflect growing international investor confidence in Pakistan’s energy market and a renewed commitment to enhancing power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure in the country,’’ a press release from the CM Secretariat said. “Sindh CM highlights 12 priority investment sectors of Sindh. Saudi companies invited to invest in agriculture, energy, infrastructure, logistics and industrial projects,” the press release said. It said the chief minister acknowledged the historical and brotherly relations between the two countries. “Sindh is ready to become the gateway for Pakistan’s economic development. We have digitised land records and simplified investment procedures. Investor-friendly and reform-oriented environment is Sindh government’s priority.” ‘‘Our partnership with Saudi Arabia is very important for the economic future of the region. Sindh government is fully aligned with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030,’’ the press release quoted the chief minister as saying. He pointed out that the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway presented investment opportunities and invited the delegation to participate in Karachi’s Blue and Yellow Line transit systems. Joint ventures in the fisheries and livestock sectors were also offered to the Saudi delegation, along with an invitation to participate in the establishment of special economic zones. The chief minister and the Saudi delegation agreed to establish joint working groups, with Shah saying that different sectoral working groups were necessary to ensure continuity of cooperation. ‘‘Sindh government is working in full coordination with federal institutions. The Sindh government has close links with the Federal Ministry of Investment, Special Investment Facilitation Council and Trade Development Authority of Pakistan so that foreign investors will be provided with complete facilities from feasibility to practical implementation,’’ CM Shah said. The press release added that promoting cooperation between the public and private sectors was also discussed. Prince Mansoor thanked CM Shah for hosting him and said he had come with the delegation to establish a “new partnership’’ between the two countries. He said sub-committees would be established for each sector and investment would be initiated to promote funding inflows. Pointing out Karachi’s status as a port city, the Saudi prince said there were “great investment opportunities here’’ while CM Shah said the Sindh government had opened its doors for investment and all possible cooperation would be extended to Saudi investors. Addressing the delegation, CM Shah said bilateral relations had gained a new dimension with the Saudi-Pakistan Joint Business Council, adding that the country’s relations with Sindh would also further strengthen. He invited Saudi investors to explore long-term partnerships in Sindh under public-private partnerships, government-to-business and business-to-business models, emphasising collaboration for innovation, technology transfer and industrial growth. On the occasion, two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, marking significant progress in K-Electric’s ownership and future collaboration framework. The first MoU was signed for the sale and purchase of shares in KES Power Ltd. The second MoU was signed between K-Electric Limited and Trident Energy Ltd to explore strategic cooperation and investment opportunities in Pakistan’s power sector. “These agreements reflect growing international investor confidence in Pakistan’s energy market and a renewed commitment to enhancing power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure in the country,’’ a press release from the CM Secratariat said. The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in mutual economic interests, strategic military cooperation, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with the kingdom being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad. In February, Riyadh signed a $1.2 billion deferred oil facility, releasing $100 million monthly until February 2026. Islamabad is also seeking a rollover of $5bn Saudi loans — $2bn maturing in December 2025 and $3bn in June 2026 — at a concessional four per cent interest rate. Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Riyadh was “central to Pakistan’s economy” as he met Saudi Crown Prince Moha­m­med Bin Salman on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative in Riyadh. The government is seeking large investments in state-owned enterprises and the development of a petrochemicals plant, according to a Reuters report. Riyadh has also shown interest in mining in the past, including in buying part of the Pakistani government stake in the multibillion-dollar Reko Diq copper mine being developed in Balochistan.",

      "summary_en": "Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah welcomed a high-level Saudi business delegation on Thursday and highlighted 12 priority sectors for investment in the province. The high-level business delegation from Saudi Arabia, led by Saudi-Pakistan Joint Business Council Chairman Prince Mansour bin Mohammad Al Saud, arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday to discuss trade, investment and collaboration. The development followed Pakistan forming an 18-member committee to oversee bilateral economic engagements and negotiations with the kingdom. Last month, the two countries also signed a mutual defence agreement, pledging a joint response to any act of aggression. A press release issued today from the CM Secretariat said the delegation was welcomed at CM House by Shah and provincial ministers. It added that the delegation included over 30 prominent businessmen and investors associated with the energy, infrastructure, agriculture, livestock, mining, construction, logistics and investment sectors. Representatives of the Pakistan Business Council, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) and the Saudi Embassy also attended the meeting. On the occasion, two memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, marking significant progress in K-Electric’s ownership and future collaboration framework.

Saudi companies invited to invest in agriculture, energy, infrastructure, logistics and industrial projects,” the press release said. It said the chief minister acknowledged the historical and brotherly relations between the two countries. “Sindh is ready to become the gateway for Pakistan’s economic development. We have digitised land records and simplified investment procedures. Investor-friendly and reform-oriented environment is Sindh government’s priority.” ‘‘Our partnership with Saudi Arabia is very important for the economic future of the region. Sindh government is fully aligned with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030,’’ the press release quoted the chief minister as saying. He pointed out that the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway presented investment opportunities and invited the delegation to participate in Karachi’s Blue and Yellow Line transit systems. Joint ventures in the fisheries and livestock sectors were also offered to the Saudi delegation, along with an invitation to participate in the establishment of special economic zones. The chief minister and the Saudi delegation agreed to establish joint working groups, with Shah saying that different sectoral working groups were necessary to ensure continuity of cooperation. ‘‘Sindh government is working in full coordination with federal institutions. The Sindh government has close links with the Federal Ministry of Investment, Special Investment Facilitation Council and Trade Development Authority of Pakistan so that foreign investors will be provided with complete facilities from feasibility to practical implementation,’’ CM Shah said. The press release added that promoting cooperation between the public and private sectors was also discussed.

The six-day trip by Amir Khan Muttaqi highlights the Taliban’s efforts to spur engagement with regional powers to secure eventual diplomatic recognition. He is set to meet Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and other officials to discuss a range of political, economic and trade matters. “We look forward to engaging discussions with him on bilateral relations and regional issues,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X welcoming the minister. Muttaqi is also expected to speak with Indian business representatives, visit the ancient monument to love, the Taj Mahal, and a historic Islamic seminary, media said. He arrives in New Delhi after talks in Moscow with diplomats from Afghanistan’s neighbours, who appeared to unite against US President Donald Trump’s stated aim of taking over the Bagram military base near Kabul, the capital. Russia is the only country to have yet recognised the Taliban administration, whose members are under UN sanctions including a travel ban and asset freeze, including Muttaqi, who got a temporary exemption to visit India. Historically, India and Afghanistan have had friendly ties but New Delhi does not recognise the Taliban and shut its embassy in Kabul after the US withdrawal from the war-shattered country in 2021. New Delhi opened a small mission a year later to ease the way for trade, medical support and humanitarian aid, while its senior officials have held two-way talks with Taliban leaders.",

      "summary_orig": "Italy are struggling to qualify automatically for next year’s World Cup finals and the pressure on the team is exacerbated by the tension surrounding next Tuesday’s qualifier with Israel in Udine. Italy was the scene of some of Europe’s biggest pro-Palestinian protests last weekend, as Israeli forces continue their offensive in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered across Italy in anger at Israel’s actions, and calls for the country to be barred from international sport have grown louder. The protests were in response to Israel’s military operation in Gaza, which was sparked by the attack by Hamas fighters on October 7, 2023, on Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip. During Friday’s massive strike action in support of the Palestinians, demonstrators went to the Italian national team’s training centre in Florence to demand the match against Israel be called off. As of Tuesday only around 4,000 tickets had been sold for the game in Udine, a small city in Italy’s far north-east, which was picked specifically to help limit the potential for disorder. Udine was the venue when Italy — who face Estonia in Tallinn on Saturday — last hosted Israel, in the Nations League in September 2024. That match passed off largely without incident, albeit surrounded by a massive security operation which included soldiers on the roof of the stadium. But the threat of much bigger and more disruptive protests led Udine’s mayor Alberto Felice De Toni to ask for the match to be postponed. ‘Very sad’ This week Italy’s coach Gennaro Gattuso said the situation in Gaza was “ very sad ” and lamented a difficult atmosphere for a match which will be key to Italy’s hopes of avoiding missing out on a third straight World Cup. “There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside it… I would have preferred to play a home match in front of an enthusiastic crowd like we did in Bergamo (where Italy beat Estonia 5-0) a month ago,” Gattuso said. His task was already complicated enough without the external political pressure of playing Israel, as direct qualification for the World Cup is seriously in doubt. Only the winner of the five-team group is guaranteed an automatic spot and Italy sit second, level on nine points with Israel and six behind leaders Norway, but with a game in hand on both. However Norway’s far superior goal difference — they have a 16-goal advantage over Italy — means Gattuso’s side can only top the group if they win all four of their remaining matches and Erling Haaland and company slip up before they travel to the San Siro next month. That leaves second place and a spot in the play-offs as the likely route to the World Cup, a tournament in which Italy haven’t played a knockout fixture since winning it in 2006. Italy exited at the qualification play-off stage for the last two World Cups, failing to reach the 2022 edition in Qatar despite being reigning European champions.",

Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks , particularly targeting police personnel. DI Khan Regional Police Officer (RPO) Ashfaq Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that a police checkpoint in DI Khan’s Khutti area was attacked by terrorists from multiple sides. When asked to confirm if the checkpoint in charge — identified as Ahmed Nawaz — was seriously injured during the attack and later succumbed to his injuries, Anwar said, “Yes.” Funeral prayers for the deceased were offered today at the Ijaz Shaheed Police Lines, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported. In attendance at the funeral were: RPO Ashfaq Anwar, District Police Officer Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmad, SPs of CTD, investigation, city, and headquarters, officers of security forces, police officials, and the family members of the martyr, according to APP. The attack comes on the same day a major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in DI Khan, the military’s media wing said. Last week, a soldier was martyred and another was injured when unknown assailants opened fire on them near Bannu. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies. According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. With additional input from APP.",

      "summary_orig": "A major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, the military’s media wing said on Thursday. The development comes a day after the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred in an exchange of fire between the forces and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district. According to the ISPR’s statement issued today, security forces carried out the IBO on Wednesday on the reported presence of “ khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij ” in the Daraban area of DI Khan. Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. During the operation, the ISPR said, seven “Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell” due to effective engagement by security forces’ troops. However, during the intense exchange of fire, 30-year-old Major Sibtain Haider, a resident of the Quetta district, embraced martyrdom. “A brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat .” The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were found in the custody of the slain terrorists, who had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as [the] killing of innocent civilians”. A sanitisation operation was being carried out to “eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area”, the ISPR statement said. It added that the “security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave sons further strengthen our resolve”. President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces’ successful operation in Daraban, DI Khan and paid rich tribute to Major Sibtain Haider for his “valour and sacrifice, saying the nation’s resolve to end terrorism remains unshakable”, a statement posted on the presidency’s X account said. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to martyred Major Sibtain Haider, according to a statement posted by his ministry on X. State-run APP reported that KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also lauded security forces for the successful operation and paid them rich tribute for their “courage and professionalism in eliminating terrorists who pose a threat to peace and stability in the region”. Expressing grief over the martyrdom of Major Sibtain Haider, he extended condolences to his family and prayed for the “elevation of his ranks in Jannah”. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Subsequently, amid rising terror attacks, the government labelled the group as Fitna al Khwarij and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers. Islamabad has also raised concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism.  In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. After Tuesday’s IBO in Orakzai, a statement from the ISPR said the participants at the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference held at General Headquarters expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of “Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al Khwarij and Fitna al Hindustan . Last month, after 19 soldiers were martyred in KP in multiple incidents, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that the  “Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan”.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Violence broke out in the city late on Wednesday night, after police launched a crackdown on the headquarters of Tehreek-i- Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in a bid to arrest its chief, Saad Rizvi. At least three police constables were reportedly injured in clashes with enraged TLP supporters, who attacked law enforcers with stones and iron rods. Police responded with tear-gas shelling, turning Multan Road into a battleground. Videos shared on social media, which could not be immediately verified by Dawn , showed TLP activists running as police fired tear gas. Other clips showed TLP activists holding up spent bullet casings and tear gas shells. The crackdown on TLP’s central office came after the group annou­nced plans for a massive anti-Israel demonstration outside the US emb­as­sy in the federal capital on Friday. In anticipation of the protest, the Islamabad administration has also begun placing shipping containers at Faizabad Interchange — the historic site of several TLP sit-ins. A statement issued by TLP in the early hours of Thursday claimed a number of their workers had been arrested, condemning raids on their supporters’ homes. Police sources said that the group had called a large number of supporters to Lahore, who had taken up position in temporary shelters. These elements attacked police parties as they moved in to raid the TLP main office. Armed with stones, clubs and iron rods, the enraged TLP men managed to push police back. Clashes were on­­going at the time of going to press. Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2025",
