      "summary_orig": "PTI leader Omar Ayub alleged on Friday that Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) chief Sahibzada Mohammad Hamid Raza had been “abducted” from Islamabad late last night. “Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib , my dear friend and colleague, has been abducted from Islamabad late last night whilst en route to surrender in the conviction awarded by an anti-terrorism court [in] Faisalabad,” Ayub posted on social media platform X. He said he “strongly condemn[s] this action”. “Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib is a brave and very loyal ally of PM Imran Khan ( sic ). He must be produced immediately in the relevant court,” the PTI leader added. An earlier post on Raza’s X account said he had been arrested by Islamabad police as he was en route to Faisalabad. “He was travelling from Peshawar to Faisalabad to surrender. Islamabad police arrested him,” the early morning post stated, citing SIC Acting Chairman Sahibzada Hassan Raza. The development comes two days after the Peshawar High Court rejected Raza’s plea seeking transit bail in a case in which he was convicted by an ATC in Faisalabad and subsequently disqualified as a member of the National Assembly by the Election Commission of Pakistan. The conviction was announced on July 31 and Raza, along with other PTI leaders, was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment for involvement in the May 9 riots, when violent demonstrations had broken out in the country following the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested. Later, the ECP had also deprived the PTI of its bat symbol, compelling party members to contest the 2024 elections as independent candidates. Subsequently, the PTI had allied with the SIC in a bid to get reserved seats, which are allocated on a party basis. More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "NEW YORK: Airlines scrambled on Thursday to rejig schedules and fielding a flood of customer queries after the US ordered flight cuts at some of the nation’s busiest airports, the latest travel disruption from the prolonged government shutdown. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Wednesday he would order steep cuts, citing air traffic control safety risks from the government shutdown. The shutdown, now the longest in US history, has forced some 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 security screeners to work without pay, raising fear of travel disruptions during the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. Staffing shortages have al­­rea­­dy caused tens of thousands of flight delays nationwide, with airlines estimating that 3.2 million travellers have been affected. Industry sources said the first round of reductions, which cuts about four per cent of scheduled flights, will take effect as soon as Friday. The cuts will rise to five per cent on Saturday, six on Sun­day, and reach as much as 10pc next week if the shutdown persists. Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it would begin reducing flights from Friday to comply with the directive, but expects to operate the vast majority of its schedule as planned, including all long-haul international services. Holiday travel Unless the government reopens, the drastic plan threatens to throw holiday plans into chaos for millions of Americans travelling for Thanksgiving, marking one of the most visible ripple effects yet from the record-long government shutdown. “They (the airlines might) have some flexibility on prices, but if this shutdown goes on much longer, that should have a negative effect overall,” said David Morrison, a market analyst at Trade Nation, UK. Airlines including United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest were inundated with passenger queries on social media platforms like X, as flyers sought clarity on travel plans. “Please, you and your fellow airlines — for Thanksgiving week — issue all cancellations at least a week in advance,” one X user urged in response to United’s post outlining flight reductions. “Don’t make people wait to find out if they can fly home for the holiday.” The reduction move aims to ease pressure on controllers, with the Federal Aviation Authority short about 3,500 staff and many working mandatory overtime and six-day weeks even before the shutdown. “This is a fluid situation, but we believe the impact is more manageable than headlines imply,” Tom Fitzgerald, an aviation analyst, said.

      "summary_orig": "• The Egyptian proposal envisages ‘safe passage’ for the fighters still in Gaza’s ‘Israeli zone’ • Israeli forces kill teenager in occupied West Bank CAIRO: Hamas fighters holed up in the Israeli-held Rafah area of Gaza would surrender their arms in exchange for passage to other areas of the enclave under a proposal to resolve an issue seen as a risk to the month-old truce, according to sources familiar with the talks. Since the US-brokered ceasefire took effect in Gaza on Oct 10, the Rafah area has been the scene of two attacks on Israeli forces. Hamas has denied responsibility. Egyptian mediators have proposed that, in exchange for safe passage, fighters still in Rafah surrender their arms to Egypt and give “details of tunnels” there so they can be destroyed, an Egyptian security official said. Israel and Hamas have yet to accept mediators’ proposals, the sources said. They confirmed that talks on the issue were underway. The Israeli prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accounts; Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, declined to comment. The attacks in Rafah left three Israeli soldiers dead. Subsequent Israeli strikes killed an unspecified number of Palestinians. ‘Unaware’ of ceasefire The sources said the Hamas fighters in Rafah, which the group’s armed wing has said have been out of contact since March, might be unaware that a ceasefire was in place. The ceasefire is the first part of President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict. Hamas has released the last 20 living Israeli prisoners seized in the Oct 7, 2023, raid in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners; Israeli troops have withdrawn from western areas of Gaza, where Hamas remains in control. Details of the next phase of Trump’s plan, which requires Hamas to disarm and give up control of Gaza, have yet to be agreed. The plan foresees Gaza being governed by a technocratic Palestinian committee with international supervision, and the deployment of an international force. Since the ceasefire, Hamas has handed over the bodies of 22 of 28 deceased prisoners. Hamas has said the devastation in Gaza has made locating the bodies difficult. Israel has released to Gaza the bodies of 285 Palestinians. Israeli forces kill teenager The Palestinian health ministry said on Thursday that Israeli troops shot dead a teenager in the occupied West Bank. The Ramallah-based ministry identified the 15-year-old as Murad Saifin, who had been killed late on Wednesday. The ministry said the incident took place in the town of Al Yamun, west of Jenin. Late on Wednesday the Israeli military said its troops had killed a militant in the area of Al Yamun. In a separate incident, the Palestinian Authority reported the death of an elderly woman from a heart attack when Israeli forces raided her home on Thursday.

Since the US-brokered ceasefire took effect in Gaza on Oct 10, the Rafah area has been the scene of two attacks on Israeli forces. Hamas has denied responsibility. Egyptian mediators have proposed that, in exchange for safe passage, fighters still in Rafah surrender their arms to Egypt and give “details of tunnels” there so they can be destroyed, an Egyptian security official said. Israel and Hamas have yet to accept mediators’ proposals, the sources said. They confirmed that talks on the issue were underway. The Israeli prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accounts; Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, declined to comment. The attacks in Rafah left three Israeli soldiers dead. Subsequent Israeli strikes killed an unspecified number of Palestinians. ‘Unaware’ of ceasefire The sources said the Hamas fighters in Rafah, which the group’s armed wing has said have been out of contact since March, might be unaware that a ceasefire was in place. The ceasefire is the first part of President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict. Hamas has released the last 20 living Israeli prisoners seized in the Oct 7, 2023, raid in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners; Israeli troops have withdrawn from western areas of Gaza, where Hamas remains in control. Details of the next phase of Trump’s plan, which requires Hamas to disarm and give up control of Gaza, have yet to be agreed. The plan foresees Gaza being governed by a technocratic Palestinian committee with international supervision, and the deployment of an international force. Since the ceasefire, Hamas has handed over the bodies of 22 of 28 deceased prisoners. Hamas has said the devastation in Gaza has made locating the bodies difficult. Israel has released to Gaza the bodies of 285 Palestinians. Israeli forces kill teenager The Palestinian health ministry said on Thursday that Israeli troops shot dead a teenager in the occupied West Bank. The Ramallah-based ministry identified the 15-year-old as Murad Saifin, who had been killed late on Wednesday. The ministry said the incident took place in the town of Al Yamun, west of Jenin. Late on Wednesday the Israeli military said its troops had killed a militant in the area of Al Yamun. In a separate incident, the Palestinian Authority reported the death of an elderly woman from a heart attack when Israeli forces raided her home on Thursday. The PA’s media office identified the woman as Haniya Hanoun, and said she was pushed around by soldiers who had come to arrest her grandson in their home near Ramallah.

      "summary_orig": "• Former law officer says nation must brace itself for long struggle against ‘praetorian judges’ • Ruling elite has inflicted unprecedented harm on independence of judiciary, Akram Sheikh argues ISLAMABAD: As speculations swirl around the controversial 27th Con­stitutional Amend­ment , legal experts have questioned the rationale behind such constitutional tweaks, especially after the previous 26th Amen­dment that had effectively brought the superior judiciary under the executive’s control. The “final draft” of this Amendment has hitherto been kept under wraps, but its contours were recently shared by PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari when he said a prime minister-led delegation had sought the PPP’s support for its passage. In a statement, he said the proposal included setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, matters related to the transfer of judges, ending the protection of provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, and amending Article 243, which pertains to the command of the armed forces. While some see it as a continuation of the 26th Amendment, a senior counsel questioned the reason behind such a move at a time when the government had not lost even a single constitutional case in the superior court. “Not a single case pertaining to constitutional interpretations, be it the reserved seat case, judges transfer matter, military courts case, or matters relating to taxes, has ever been lost by the federal government after the passage of the 26th Amen­dment,” remarked the cou­nsel on condition of ano­nymity. Then what is the rationale behind stirring up the controversy at this juncture, he wondered. Except for enhancing the retirement age limit from the existing 65 years, that too of ‘a few friends’, what the proposed constitutional court will be doing when the federal government has not lost a single major case from the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court. The need to establish the Federal Constitutional Court is understandable, had Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah or Justice Munib Akhtar also been included in the CB. But when these judges are not part of the bench, then what is the purpose of establishing this court, he asked. About speculations that the executive magistracy may be restored through the proposed Amendment, the counsel conceded that the judicial magistracy had failed to meet the expectations since it was common knowledge that they never resisted the remand of an accused in important cases. The reverting back to the executive magistracy will effectively be used to control the streets, he said. Regarding the transfer of judges, he said that when the CB through a majority judgement has already empowered the government to transfer any high court to another high court, what more does the government intend to achieve? Inevitable continuation Meanwhile, former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar was of the view that the proposed 27th Amendment was the inevitable continuation of the 26th Amendment. The executive wants to tighten its grip on the judiciary: granting unfettered power to transfer high court judges, a federal constitutional court as the ultimate guardian of the Constitution with its head chairing the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), thus playing a pivotal role in the appointment and ouster of judges and reducing the present Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) to an ineffectual position, he said. The nation must brace itself for a long struggle against praetorian judges, the rollback of the independent judiciary, and the weight of the executive on the scales of justice, he feared. According to former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Muhammad Akram Sheikh, the result of the general election on Feb 8, 2024, stunned the electors, monitoring agencies and the media beyond reproach. The ruling elite then impose ‘PCO’ by giving an oath to willing judges while relieving others and thus nailing down the entire superior court. The regime inflicted unprecedented harm on the most paramount state organ of an independent judiciary, Akram Sheikh regretted, adding that the ruling elite decided to punish the Supreme Court in a manner not ever thought about by the respective military regimes. Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, considered to be one of the architects of the 18th Amendment, feared that in the brittle political situation prevalent in the country, the proposed tweaks would cast a shadow over the federation that may also help regain an extra nationalist narrative. The proposed Amendment that deals with the question of bringing changes to the removal of protection for the share of provinces in the divisible pool through the National Finance Commission (NFC), as well as restoring the devolved ministries back to the federal government, amounts to the rollback of the 18th Amendment. In Jan 2015, Mr Rabbani regretted after a vote on the 21st Amendment, which provided for military courts to try terrorists, stating he was ashamed of voting for the bill, although he did so in line with his party’s discipline.

      "summary_orig": "• Islamabad says demands ‘non-negotiable’ as third round opens in Istanbul • Taliban leader asks Afghan team to only make ‘realistic’ commitments • Flare-up at Chaman-Spin Boldak looms over talks; at least two killed ISLAMABAD: The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks opened in Istanbul on Thursday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested a shaky ceasefire . Mediated by Turkiye and Qatar and held at the Conrad Hotel with restricted media access, the two-day round is focused on finalising a framework for a “monitoring and verification mechanism” agreed in principle last week, and on addressing long-standing disputes linked to militant sanctuaries inside Afghanistan. Pakistan’s delegation is led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik and includes senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials. The Afghan Taliban side is headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and includes senior figures such as Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib. The current dialogue process began after deadly clashes along the border last month — the worst since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul. Pakistan accused the Taliban of harbouring militants from Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), responsible for a series of cross-border attacks. The Taliban denied the accusations and accused Islamabad of airstrikes inside Afghan territory. A ceasefire was brokered in Doha on Oct 19 through Qatari mediation, followed by two rounds of talks in Istanbul. Before formal discussions resumed in Istanbul for the third round, Turkish and Qatari intelligence officials held separate consultations with both sides. The talks later continued in both direct and indirect formats. A Pakistani official familiar with the delegation’s position said Islamabad’s demands remain “non-negotiable”. “Pakistan’s position is clear,” the official said. “Our position is based on ground realities and solid information. We are seeking a verification mechanism to ensure that commitments made by Taliban representatives are kept. This includes the handover of all TTP leadership currently sheltered in Afghanistan.” He added that the Pakistani delegation had proposed neutral, third-party observers to look into the presence of “terrorist groups” in Afghanistan and the action that is taken against them to prevent them from carrying out attacks in Pakistan. “We have credible information that the (Afghan) Taliban regime is relocating TTP fighters within urban civilian populations,” he said. “This is a tactic designed to falsely portray any necessary action by Pakistan against TTP terrorists as an attack on civilians.” According to Afghan sources, the Taliban delegation came to Istanbul with specific instructions from their leader, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada. The Taliban chief reportedly told his negotiators to make only those commitments that could be realistically fulfilled and warned them against yielding to Pakistani demands. Exchange of fire Expectations for the Istanbul round were already modest, given the deep mistrust between the two sides and the little progress made in the previous two rounds. The situation worsened briefly on Thursday afternoon after two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing, threatening to derail the fragile dialogue. Both sides accused the other of initiating the gunfire, though no casualties were reported. The incident, which lasted for a short time, came just hours after the opening session of talks in Istanbul. “Afghan forces opened fire at Tasadaq and Iqbal Posts located along the Chaman border around 5pm, and Pakistani troops immediately retaliated and returned fire,” an official told Dawn . He said the mortars landed in the Vesh Mandi area. However, he said it was a brief exchange of fire and no loss of life or property was reported. An Afghan official in Spin Boldak told Chaman-based journalists that the incident was a result of a misunderstanding arising from celebratory fire at a marriage ceremony. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, however, disputed the account, accusing Pakistani forces of violating the truce. “While the third round of negotiations with the Pakistani side had begun in Istanbul, unfortunately, this afternoon Pakistani forces once again opened fire on Spin Boldak, causing concern among the local population,” he said in a statement. “The Islamic emirate’s forces, out of respect for the negotiation team and to prevent civilian casualties, have so far shown no reaction.” However, Pakistan rejected Mr Mujahid’s claim as “baseless”. “We strongly reject claims circulated by the Afghan side regarding today’s incident at the Pak-Afghan border at Chaman,” the Information Ministry said. “Firing was initiated from the Afghan side, to which our security forces responded immediately in a measured and responsible manner.” It added that the situation was brought under control, and the ceasefire remains intact.

He said the mortars landed in the Vesh Mandi area. However, he said it was a brief exchange of fire and no loss of life or property was reported. An Afghan official in Spin Boldak told Chaman-based journalists that the incident was a result of a misunderstanding arising from celebratory fire at a marriage ceremony. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, however, disputed the account, accusing Pakistani forces of violating the truce. “While the third round of negotiations with the Pakistani side had begun in Istanbul, unfortunately, this afternoon Pakistani forces once again opened fire on Spin Boldak, causing concern among the local population,” he said in a statement. “The Islamic emirate’s forces, out of respect for the negotiation team and to prevent civilian casualties, have so far shown no reaction.” However, Pakistan rejected Mr Mujahid’s claim as “baseless”. “We strongly reject claims circulated by the Afghan side regarding today’s incident at the Pak-Afghan border at Chaman,” the Information Ministry said. “Firing was initiated from the Afghan side, to which our security forces responded immediately in a measured and responsible manner.” It added that the situation was brought under control, and the ceasefire remains intact.

      "summary": "• Islamabad says demands ‘non-negotiable’ as third round opens in Istanbul • Taliban leader asks Afghan team to only make ‘realistic’ commitments • Flare-up at Chaman-Spin Boldak looms over talks; at least two killed ISLAMABAD: The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks opened in Istanbul on Thursday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested a shaky ceasefire . Mediated by Turkiye and Qatar and held at the Conrad Hotel with restricted media access, the two-day round is focused on finalising a framework for a “monitoring and verification mechanism” agreed in principle last week, and on addressing long-standing disputes linked to militant sanctuaries inside Afghanistan. Pakistan’s delegation is led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik and includes senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials. The Afghan Taliban side is headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and includes senior figures such as Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib. The current dialogue process began after deadly clashes along the border last month — the worst since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul. Pakistan accused the Taliban of harbouring militants from Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), responsible for a series of cross-border attacks. The Taliban denied the accusations and accused Islamabad of airstrikes inside Afghan territory. A ceasefire was brokered in Doha on Oct 19 through Qatari mediation, followed by two rounds of talks in Istanbul. Before formal discussions resumed in Istanbul for the third round, Turkish and Qatari intelligence officials held separate consultations with both sides. The talks later continued in both direct and indirect formats. A Pakistani official familiar with the delegation’s position said Islamabad’s demands remain “non-negotiable”. “Pakistan’s position is clear,” the official said. “Our position is based on ground realities and solid information. We are seeking a verification mechanism to ensure that commitments made by Taliban representatives are kept. This includes the handover of all TTP leadership currently sheltered in Afghanistan.” He added that the Pakistani delegation had proposed neutral, third-party observers to look into the presence of “terrorist groups” in Afghanistan and the action that is taken against them to prevent them from carrying out attacks in Pakistan. “We have credible information that the (Afghan) Taliban regime is relocating TTP fighters within urban civilian populations,” he said. “This is a tactic designed to falsely portray any necessary action by Pakistan against TTP terrorists as an attack on civilians.” According to Afghan sources, the Taliban delegation came to Istanbul with specific instructions from their leader, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada. The Taliban chief reportedly told his negotiators to make only those commitments that could be realistically fulfilled and warned them against yielding to Pakistani demands. Exchange of fire Expectations for the Istanbul round were already modest, given the deep mistrust between the two sides and the little progress made in the previous two rounds. The situation worsened briefly on Thursday afternoon after two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing, threatening to derail the fragile dialogue. Both sides accused the other of initiating the gunfire, though no casualties were reported. The incident, which lasted for a short time, came just hours after the opening session of talks in Istanbul. “Afghan forces opened fire at Tasadaq and Iqbal Posts located along the Chaman border around 5pm, and Pakistani troops immediately retaliated and returned fire,” an official told Dawn . He said the mortars landed in the Vesh Mandi area. However, he said it was a brief exchange of fire and no loss of life or property was reported. An Afghan official in Spin Boldak told Chaman-based journalists that the incident was a result of a misunderstanding arising from celebratory fire at a marriage ceremony. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, however, disputed the account, accusing Pakistani forces of violating the truce. “While the third round of negotiations with the Pakistani side had begun in Istanbul, unfortunately, this afternoon Pakistani forces once again opened fire on Spin Boldak, causing concern among the local population,” he said in a statement. “The Islamic emirate’s forces, out of respect for the negotiation team and to prevent civilian casualties, have so far shown no reaction.” However, Pakistan rejected Mr Mujahid’s claim as “baseless”. “We strongly reject claims circulated by the Afghan side regarding today’s incident at the Pak-Afghan border at Chaman,” the Information Ministry said. “Firing was initiated from the Afghan side, to which our security forces responded immediately in a measured and responsible manner.” It added that the situation was brought under control, and the ceasefire remains intact.

The Associated Press published the list after airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says air traffic must be reduced by 4% by 6am ET on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation’s largest airports.

      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said on Thursday that there was no need for a notification to specify the army chief’s five-year term, as it was established in Section 8C [of the Pakistan Army Act]. “I do not think there is a need [for a notification] and the reason is the lawmaking we did, which specifies that [section] 8C, will be read in the same manner as it has always been part of this legislation and hence, it is five years,” said the state minister. Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act outlines the “retirement age and service limits prescribed for a general, under the rules and regulations made under this Act, shall not be applicable to the Chief of the Army Staff, during his tenure of appointment, reappointment or extension, subject to a maximum age of sixty-four (64) years. Throughout such tenure, the Chief of the Army Staff shall continue to serve as general in the Pakistan Army”. In November 2024, the government passed six bills, including three related to the extension of the terms of armed services chiefs, amid deafening protests by the opposition. The three bills were The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill, 2024, The Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill, 2024 and The Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2024. The salient features of the bills stated that the tenure of all three services chiefs (chief of army staff, chief of air staff and chief of naval staff) will be five years, instead of three. The retirement age bar of 64 years (for generals, air chief marshals and admirals) won’t apply to these three functionaries and\nextensions, re-appointments for these posts (if any) will also be for five years.\nHowever, the tenure of chairman joint chiefs of staff remained unchanged, at\nthree years. In an interview with Independent Urdu today, Barrister Malik said no new notification is required for the COAS’ 5-year term and the section has always been a part of legislation. When asked his opinion on whether the government intends to keep the designations of field marshal and army chief separate, Malik pointed out that army chiefs are 4-star generals while the field marshal’s rank is a 5-star position. “When there are ranks, other things are associated with them, and they should be considered as well,” he said. When asked about the possibility of Pakistan becoming a part of the Gaza International Stabilisation Force, the state minister said a definitive answer at this time would be premature. He highlighted that the foreign ministers of eight Muslim countries met in Istanbul and any announcement would be made accordingly. “My comment would be premature,” Barrister Malik said. Field Marshal Asim Munir was appointed the army chief on November 29, 2022. He is the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army. The government promoted the COAS to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India during the war in May this year.",

      "summary_orig": "Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Riffat Mukhtar said on Thursday that the agency is investigating reports of workers being offloaded at airports, during a meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, a statement from the ministry said. Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports on grounds of suspicion, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions follow Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directive to crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. The development took place during a high-level meeting today presided over by the minister, in which he was briefed on such incidents. DG FIA Mukhtar, officials Ministry of the Overseas Pakistanis, and a delegation from the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association were also in attendance. DG FIA Mukhtar informed the meeting participants that incidents of workers being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway. “If any FIA officials are found involved, strict action will be taken against them.” While addressing the participants, Minister Hussain pointed out that workers were offloaded at different airports despite having work visas and protection certificates. “Pakistanis going abroad for employment are highly respected by us, and no one will be allowed to unlawfully stop workers at airports,” the minister said, per the statement. Overseas Pakistanis, he said, send foreign remittances to Pakistan, which drives the national economy. The minister directed the DG FIA to immediately resolve the issue and instructed that no work visa holders be offloaded at airports in the future. Per the statement, no new conditions have been imposed by the FIA for those travelling abroad on work visas, nor has any new requirement been introduced for obtaining an affidavit from a government officer. A new digital system will soon be introduced, through which workers can complete their immigration online before departure. Federal Minister Hussain stated that to prevent such incidents in the future, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and FIA officials were preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs). In December of last year, four Pakis­tani citizens were among those killed in migrant shipwrecks off the coast of Greece, as confirmed by the Foreign Office.

Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports on grounds of suspicion, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions follow Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directive to crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives.

DG FIA Mukhtar, officials Ministry of the Overseas Pakistanis, and a delegation from the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association were also in attendance. DG FIA Mukhtar informed the meeting participants that incidents of workers being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway. “If any FIA officials are found involved, strict action will be taken against them.” While addressing the participants, Minister Hussain pointed out that workers were offloaded at different airports despite having work visas and protection certificates. “Pakistanis going abroad for employment are highly respected by us, and no one will be allowed to unlawfully stop workers at airports,” the minister said, per the statement. Overseas Pakistanis, he said, send foreign remittances to Pakistan, which drives the national economy. The minister directed the DG FIA to immediately resolve the issue and instructed that no work visa holders be offloaded at airports in the future. Per the statement, no new conditions have been imposed by the FIA for those travelling abroad on work visas, nor has any new requirement been introduced for obtaining an affidavit from a government officer. A new digital system will soon be introduced, through which workers can complete their immigration online before departure. Federal Minister Hussain stated that to prevent such incidents in the future, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and FIA officials were preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs). In December of last year, four Pakis­tani citizens were among those killed in migrant shipwrecks off the coast of Greece, as confirmed by the Foreign Office.

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Thursday that he was unable to meet the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) earlier today and was denied permission to meet PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former premier, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, since he was sworn in as the KP CM on October 15. He has been denied access to the PTI founder at least four times since then, despite the IHC’s directives to implement its March order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran. Addressing reporters outside the prison, CM Afridi lamented that he was unable to meet the party founder and the chief justice of the IHC, the latter of whom he had waited 90 minutes to meet before leaving empty-handed. “As you all know, there have been continuous efforts through constitutional and legal means; this is the fifth time,” he said, referring to how frequently he was denied a meeting with the PTI founder. “After waiting for an hour and a half, we couldn’t meet the IHC chief justice, so we came here. I was again denied permission for a meeting [with Imran]. You are seeing this system in place, which was exposed by my leader, Imran Khan.” He said that people with “clouded judgment” levelled allegations that the PTI was trying to incite and protest, but stated that he has “continuously tried to remove the fog clouding their judgment”. “Some people have become more powerful than institutions, because people are telling us they cannot do anything unless they receive orders from the top,” CM Afridi said, adding that he did not know who was issuing the orders. The PTI earlier staged a protest outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) over the multiple denials of CM Afridi’s jail meeting with Imran. The KP CM reached the IHC for “legal proceedings”, after which he would head to the Adiala jail to meet Imran, the PTI said on X. The move comes a day after the PTI parliamentary party unanimously passed a resolution calling for the arrangement of a meeting between Afridi and Imran. The PTI members urged both the federal and the Punjab governments to implement the IHC in letter and spirit. Speaking to reporters outside the court today, CM Afridi said he would “avail all legal and constitutional paths” to secure a meeting with Imran. The PTI leader has the option to file a petition against the Adiala jail administration for contempt of court proceedings — a move he has warned of previously. The chief minister said he came to the IHC to meet Chief Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and to discuss the fixation of some cases for hearing. “Our cases are not being fixed,” he claimed. “I have not been allowed to meet the PTI founder despite court orders,” the KP CM said, asserting that the Constitution guaranteed him the right to protest. “Only the courts can tell who is pressuring them,” he added. On the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment , the PTI leader wondered “whether the government itself has seen its draft or not”. Meanwhile, PTI parliamentarians and leaders also staged a protest outside the IHC. They chanted various slogans, including “One state, two constitutions unacceptable”, “Make the judiciary independent/free the judiciary”, and “Free Imran Khan”. Videos showed PTI leaders gathered at at least two spots, with one group also chanting slogans against the proposed 27th Amendment . Pictures shared by the PTI’s KP chapter showed huge crowds of party workers welcoming the chief minister upon his arrival at the IHC. Meeting denials A day after he took the oath as the chief minister on October 15, Afridi secured protective bail from the Peshawar High Court (PHC) till November 18 and went to Adiala to meet Imran, but failed to do so despite a two-hour wait. CM Afridi had also filed a separate plea in the IHC seeking permission to meet Imran, on which notices were issued to Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum and others. Then, on October 23, after the IHC ordered the jail superintendent to implement the twice-a-week meeting schedule, Afridi headed to Adiala jail but could not meet the imprisoned ex-premier again. The KP CM then visited Rawalpindi on October 28 but was denied access to Imran for the third time , compelling the PTI founder to issue directives that Afridi pick his KP cabinet. Afridi again was not able to meet Imran on October 30, marking the fourth such occurrence, following which he finally named his provincial cabinet .",

      "title_orig": "FO dismisses Indian reports on Hindus’ denial of entry on religious ground",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday rejected “unfounded and misleading” allegations that members of the Hindu community were denied entry into the country on religious grounds, clarifying the action was “purely administrative” and consistent with Islamabad’s sovereign right to regulate entry into its territory. Earlier this week, Pakistan welcomed Sikh pilgrims from India, with over 2,000 pilgrims granted visas to attend a 10-day festival marking the 556th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh faith. However, Indian media claimed yesterday that an Indian national and six family members were reportedly denied entry into Pakistan, with officials allegedly citing their Hindu faith as the reason for refusal. In a statement today, FO said that these claims are “entirely baseless and represent yet another attempt to distort facts and politicise a matter that was purely administrative in nature”. “High Commission for Pakistan, New Delhi, had issued over 2,400 visas to Sikh pilgrims from India to participate in the celebrations marking the birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji from November 4 to 13,” FO’s statement noted. “On November 4, a total of 1,932 pilgrims successfully crossed into Pakistan through the Attari-Wagah border,” the statement highlighted. “It is pertinent to note that approximately 300 visa holders were prevented by the Indian authorities from crossing over. The entire immigration process on the Pakistani side was smooth, orderly, and free of any hindrance.” It added that a very small number of individuals were “found to possess incomplete documentation and were unable to provide satisfactory responses to immigration authorities”. Consequently, the statement noted, “they were requested to return to the Indian side in accordance with standard procedures”. “To suggest that these individuals were denied entry on religious grounds is completely incorrect and mischievous,” according to FO. “Pakistan has always welcomed pilgrims of all faiths to visit its sacred religious sites under a well-established and facilitative framework. The action taken was purely administrative, consistent with Pakistan’s sovereign right to regulate entry into its territory,” said FO, adding that any attempt to give this issue a communal or political colour is not only regrettable but “also reflective of the prejudiced mindset that increasingly dominates the Indian government and media narratives”.",

      "summary_orig": "Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP) President Abdullah Jadoon and Secretary General Awais Jadoon were dismissed from service on Thursday amid an ongoing tiff with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafiz confirmed the development to Dawn . The national flag carrier also issued two dismissal notices to the engineers, copies of which are available with Dawn . Abdullah’s role was stated as an aircraft engineer (PG-VI), while Awais was an aircraft engineer (PG-VIII). The dismissal letters said that notices were issued to the SAEP president for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media, and to the SAEP secretary general, for the unauthorised disclosure of confidential operational information and PIA images. “In order to enquire into the allegations/charges communicated to you via the aforesaid showcause notice, an enquiry was conducted wherein you failed to participate despite providing ample opportunities to appear and defend your case,” the notices said. “After examining the available evidence and statements of prosecution witnesses, the enquiry committee found you guilty of the charges levelled against you,” they added. They further said that both the SAEP officials were provided two opportunities to appear before the chief executive officer, but failed to do so. “Keeping in view your entire disciplinary case, the management has decided to dismiss you from the service of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited,” the notices said, adding that these dismissals would go into effect immediately. The dismissals come amid an ongoing tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP, with the protesting engineers refusing to issue clearance certificates to aircraft — a move that has disrupted flight operations in recent days. The engineers have been protesting for two-and-a-half mont­­hs, seeking pay hikes among other demands, according to SAEP officials. While the PIA has claimed that the engineers are on “strike”, the SAEP maintains that its engineers were on duty but were not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks. Earlier, the PIA spokesperson had highlighted that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he had warned. For his part, Awais Jadoon had earlier said that the two officers were on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances.” He had also clarified that the engineers were not on strike and said that they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying. In response to a question about a meeting with the PIA management, he had said that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them. Meanwhile, the PIA has alleged that the engineer’s protest is aimed at sabotaging the national flag carrier’s privatisation. Flight disruptions The matter came into the spotlight when hund­reds of air travellers were reported to have been stranded at three major airports on Monday night due to the aircraft engineers’ protest, which delayed at least six flights of the national flag carrier. Similar delays have been reported at nearly all major airports in the country during the last two months. On Tuesday, the PIA claimed to have restored flight operations through alternative arrangements. A PIA spokesperson said that the management had used alternative means and worked overnight to restore operations, mitigating the impact of already delayed flights on subsequent operations. Yesterday, too, the PIA said it had managed to “partially restore its flight operations”.",

They further said that both the SAEP officials were provided two opportunities to appear before the chief executive officer, but failed to do so. “Keeping in view your entire disciplinary case, the management has decided to dismiss you from the service of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited,” the notices said, adding that these dismissals would go into effect immediately. The dismissals come amid an ongoing tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP, with the protesting engineers refusing to issue clearance certificates to aircraft — a move that has disrupted flight operations in recent days. The engineers have been protesting for two-and-a-half mont­­hs, seeking pay hikes among other demands, according to SAEP officials. While the PIA has claimed that the engineers are on “strike”, the SAEP maintains that its engineers were on duty but were not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks. Earlier, the PIA spokesperson had highlighted that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he had warned. For his part, Awais Jadoon had earlier said that the two officers were on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances.” He had also clarified that the engineers were not on strike and said that they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying. In response to a question about a meeting with the PIA management, he had said that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them. Meanwhile, the PIA has alleged that the engineer’s protest is aimed at sabotaging the national flag carrier’s privatisation. Flight disruptions The matter came into the spotlight when hund­reds of air travellers were reported to have been stranded at three major airports on Monday night due to the aircraft engineers’ protest, which delayed at least six flights of the national flag carrier. Similar delays have been reported at nearly all major airports in the country during the last two months. On Tuesday, the PIA claimed to have restored flight operations through alternative arrangements. A PIA spokesperson said that the management had used alternative means and worked overnight to restore operations, mitigating the impact of already delayed flights on subsequent operations. Yesterday, too, the PIA said it had managed to “partially restore its flight operations”.",
