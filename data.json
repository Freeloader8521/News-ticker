The single-seat fighter jet went off a runway at the air base in the central city of Chungju at around 4:38 p.m. Tuesday, while preparing to take off for training. No casualties were reported. \"The runway excursion was confirmed to have been caused by damage of the nose gear tire, incurred due to a foreign object,\" the armed service said in a notice to reporters. The Air Force said the pilot detected the issue and tried to stop the aircraft in accordance with relevant procedure but the fighter jet ran off the runway as the tire defect caused difficulties in direction control. All KF-16 aircraft will resume operation starting Thursday as no technical issues of the aircraft were detected, it added.",

The embassy posted a notice titled “Prohibition of Prostitution in Laos” on its website on Sept. 18. “As overseas travel by our citizens increases, there have been media reports of some travelers becoming involved in prostitution,” the statement said. “Reports have also been received that certain visitors to Laos are engaging in illegal activities that harm public morals.” The embassy said soliciting prostitution is a serious offense. “It not only undermines the national image of Korea but also erodes the trust that the Korean community in Laos has built,” the embassy said. “Please be reminded that prostitution is subject to criminal punishment under Laotian law.” According to Article 260 of the Laotian Penal Code, anyone engaged in prostitution or aiding and abetting it faces three months to one year of imprisonment, detention or a fine",

      "summary_orig": "EVERY year of my journalistic career of nearly half a century, I have known only a free and independent press in the United States. My professional start was in the 1970s. Those were years when Americans could see clearly how the press served democracy. With the publication of the Pentagon Papers, first by The New York Times , the American public learned of the failures its government had covered up during a long war in Vietnam that cost so many lives. Then there was Watergate, an investigation spearheaded by The Washington Post. US citizens learned how their president had weaponised the government against his political adversaries, abusing his powers and sabotaging the Constitution. In the decades since those revelations, I took for granted that my country would always enjoy press freedom — and that the First Amendment of our Constitution would guarantee it. We now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between ‘true’ and ‘false’; we cannot even agree on how to determine ‘a fact’ I no longer take any of that for granted. I no longer assume that the constitutional order will hold in the United States. Or that the rule of law will prevail. Or that free expression — not just for the press, but for all Americans – will endure. That is because we have a president who has demonstrated disdain for traditional restraints on his power. Because a majority in Congress remains servile. Because a majority on the Supreme Court has handed this president extraordinary authority and immunity. Because the president appears determined to lay siege to institutional pillars of democracy, with the press as a high-priority target. And it is because those institutions are proving to be more fragile and faint-hearted than I imagined possible. And perhaps most concerning to me is that we now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between what is true and what is false. It is only natural — and, in a democracy, expected — that we will disagree about which policies are best. Yet today we cannot agree on how to determine a fact. All of the elements we have historically relied upon to establish facts — education, expertise, experience and, above all, evidence — have been denigrated, dismissed and denied. How can democracy flourish, or even survive, when we can’t determine the most basic facts. If democracy is in danger, a free press is, too. An independent press cannot survive without a democracy. And there is a corollary to that. A democracy cannot survive without a free press. There has never been a democracy without a media that is free and independent. The playbook of aspiring authoritarians is well-established. High on their to-do list is crushing the press, an institution that can shed light on what political leaders are up to and that might hold them to account. Their repressive practices extend well beyond the press, however: They seek to abolish free expression altogether: The right of musicians, authors, artists, playwrights and screenwriters to express themselves as they wish. The right of the public to listen to, see and read what they feel they should. The right of business executives, academics, activists and political leaders to advocate for the policies they believe in. The right of every one of us to speak freely with family, friends, neighbors and colleagues without fear of surveillance and reprisal. The rights that the press strives to safeguard are no different from the rights most people want for themselves — the freedom to inquire into facts, to share what they’ve learned, to communicate what they believe. Much more is at risk than the freedom to express opinions. The real target of autocrats is truth itself. They aim to extinguish all independent arbiters of fact, whether they happen to be judges, scholars, scientists, statisticians or journalists. In nations tilting toward authoritarianism, heads of state claim sole ownership of the truth. And they rig, suppress or erase data to advance their lies. That is what is happening now in the United States. Facts are under attack while government demands that its fictions be unquestioningly repeated. For decades, the United States was a bastion of free expression of all types, with constitutional protections seemingly secured. That is no longer the case. We were a model for citizens in other nations who yearned for similar liberty. We no longer are. We were a forceful champion for these freedoms elsewhere. Civil rights activists, democracy advocates and independent journalists worldwide often counted on our support when faced with repression. They no longer can expect it. In a famous 1941 speech about four essential human freedoms, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt listed “freedom of speech and expression” as the very first. And he pointedly added the words: “everywhere in the world.” Today, with an aspiring autocrat as president, the United States is failing to embrace the freedoms that Franklin D. Roosevelt considered indispensable for a better world. Independent media was already in peril globally, a casualty of diminished confidence in democracy and the rise of a new generation of authoritarians. Our president has placed the press worldwide — and freedom of expression generally — in even greater jeopardy. What President Donald Trump and his allies contemptuously disregard is why the founders of the United States drafted the First Amendment to the Constitution. James Madison was the principal author. And in describing the role of the press and of free expression, he spoke of the “right of freely examining public characters and measures.” The word “examining” deserves special attention. Here is how the dictionary defines its meaning: “To inspect closely,” “to inquire into carefully/investigate,” “to test by questioning in order to determine progress, fitness, or knowledge.” Apply that to journalists, and it means we are not stenographers. Nor should we be. We go behind the curtain and beneath the surface – to learn who did what and why, who will be affected and how, who influenced those decisions and with what intent. The purpose of journalism, in my view, is to provide the public with the information it needs and deserves to know so that people might govern themselves. Embedded within that mission is a particularly high calling: Holding powerful individuals and institutions to account. Those with power have the capacity to do enormous good. When they do, and when ordinary individuals do, we in the press should make that known. Praiseworthy efforts to improve society should be shared with others. At the same time, some wrongs can be committed at extraordinary scale. Often the fault lies with those who possess disproportionate power, including the means to cover up their misdeeds. Immoral or unlawful conduct can go undetected for years, or decades. Ordinary people can suffer severe harm. Victims are often ignored or muzzled. So, the public has much at stake in the struggle for free expression and an independent press. People must have a right to voice their grievances. The media should be prepared to listen and investigate. When there is grave wrongdoing, often no one but journalists will explore the facts. When there are no journalists to report on corruption, inevitably there is more of it, with ordinary citizens paying the greatest price. When no independent media exists to draw attention, those who possess immense power seize the opportunity to acquire more. Their interests are served, the public’s needs are not. As the US government abandons the cause of freedom worldwide, my hope is that citizens in other countries now will become a model for Americans who took their own freedoms for granted. They can show us how best to struggle against a repressive government. And in the difficult fight to uphold the fundamental democratic principles of free expression and an independent press, they can provide inspiration.

And in describing the role of the press and of free expression, he spoke of the “right of freely examining public characters and measures.” The word “examining” deserves special attention. Here is how the dictionary defines its meaning: “To inspect closely,” “to inquire into carefully/investigate,” “to test by questioning in order to determine progress, fitness, or knowledge.” Apply that to journalists, and it means we are not stenographers. Nor should we be. We go behind the curtain and beneath the surface – to learn who did what and why, who will be affected and how, who influenced those decisions and with what intent. The purpose of journalism, in my view, is to provide the public with the information it needs and deserves to know so that people might govern themselves. Embedded within that mission is a particularly high calling: Holding powerful individuals and institutions to account. Those with power have the capacity to do enormous good. When they do, and when ordinary individuals do, we in the press should make that known. Praiseworthy efforts to improve society should be shared with others. At the same time, some wrongs can be committed at extraordinary scale. Often the fault lies with those who possess disproportionate power, including the means to cover up their misdeeds. Immoral or unlawful conduct can go undetected for years, or decades. Ordinary people can suffer severe harm. Victims are often ignored or muzzled. So, the public has much at stake in the struggle for free expression and an independent press. People must have a right to voice their grievances. The media should be prepared to listen and investigate. When there is grave wrongdoing, often no one but journalists will explore the facts. When there are no journalists to report on corruption, inevitably there is more of it, with ordinary citizens paying the greatest price. When no independent media exists to draw attention, those who possess immense power seize the opportunity to acquire more. Their interests are served, the public’s needs are not. As the US government abandons the cause of freedom worldwide, my hope is that citizens in other countries now will become a model for Americans who took their own freedoms for granted. They can show us how best to struggle against a repressive government. And in the difficult fight to uphold the fundamental democratic principles of free expression and an independent press, they can provide inspiration.

      "title": "Global lessons from a press in peril",
      "summary": "EVERY year of my journalistic career of nearly half a century, I have known only a free and independent press in the United States. My professional start was in the 1970s. Those were years when Americans could see clearly how the press served democracy. With the publication of the Pentagon Papers, first by The New York Times , the American public learned of the failures its government had covered up during a long war in Vietnam that cost so many lives. Then there was Watergate, an investigation spearheaded by The Washington Post. US citizens learned how their president had weaponised the government against his political adversaries, abusing his powers and sabotaging the Constitution. In the decades since those revelations, I took for granted that my country would always enjoy press freedom — and that the First Amendment of our Constitution would guarantee it. We now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between ‘true’ and ‘false’; we cannot even agree on how to determine ‘a fact’ I no longer take any of that for granted. I no longer assume that the constitutional order will hold in the United States. Or that the rule of law will prevail. Or that free expression — not just for the press, but for all Americans – will endure. That is because we have a president who has demonstrated disdain for traditional restraints on his power. Because a majority in Congress remains servile. Because a majority on the Supreme Court has handed this president extraordinary authority and immunity. Because the president appears determined to lay siege to institutional pillars of democracy, with the press as a high-priority target. And it is because those institutions are proving to be more fragile and faint-hearted than I imagined possible. And perhaps most concerning to me is that we now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between what is true and what is false. It is only natural — and, in a democracy, expected — that we will disagree about which policies are best. Yet today we cannot agree on how to determine a fact. All of the elements we have historically relied upon to establish facts — education, expertise, experience and, above all, evidence — have been denigrated, dismissed and denied. How can democracy flourish, or even survive, when we can’t determine the most basic facts. If democracy is in danger, a free press is, too. An independent press cannot survive without a democracy. And there is a corollary to that. A democracy cannot survive without a free press. There has never been a democracy without a media that is free and independent. The playbook of aspiring authoritarians is well-established. High on their to-do list is crushing the press, an institution that can shed light on what political leaders are up to and that might hold them to account. Their repressive practices extend well beyond the press, however: They seek to abolish free expression altogether: The right of musicians, authors, artists, playwrights and screenwriters to express themselves as they wish. The right of the public to listen to, see and read what they feel they should. The right of business executives, academics, activists and political leaders to advocate for the policies they believe in. The right of every one of us to speak freely with family, friends, neighbors and colleagues without fear of surveillance and reprisal. The rights that the press strives to safeguard are no different from the rights most people want for themselves — the freedom to inquire into facts, to share what they’ve learned, to communicate what they believe. Much more is at risk than the freedom to express opinions. The real target of autocrats is truth itself. They aim to extinguish all independent arbiters of fact, whether they happen to be judges, scholars, scientists, statisticians or journalists. In nations tilting toward authoritarianism, heads of state claim sole ownership of the truth. And they rig, suppress or erase data to advance their lies. That is what is happening now in the United States. Facts are under attack while government demands that its fictions be unquestioningly repeated. For decades, the United States was a bastion of free expression of all types, with constitutional protections seemingly secured. That is no longer the case. We were a model for citizens in other nations who yearned for similar liberty. We no longer are. We were a forceful champion for these freedoms elsewhere. Civil rights activists, democracy advocates and independent journalists worldwide often counted on our support when faced with repression. They no longer can expect it. In a famous 1941 speech about four essential human freedoms, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt listed “freedom of speech and expression” as the very first. And he pointedly added the words: “everywhere in the world.” Today, with an aspiring autocrat as president, the United States is failing to embrace the freedoms that Franklin D. Roosevelt considered indispensable for a better world. Independent media was already in peril globally, a casualty of diminished confidence in democracy and the rise of a new generation of authoritarians. Our president has placed the press worldwide — and freedom of expression generally — in even greater jeopardy.

      "summary_orig": "A portion of a busy road in Thailand’s capital caved in early on Wednesday, leaving a hole dozens of metres deep in front of a main hospital and forcing people nearby to evacuate. Just outside a local police station and Vajira Hospital in a residential district of Bangkok, a roughly 50-metre (160-foot) hole pulled down power lines and exposed a burst pipe gushing water, AFP journalists saw. Dozens of police and city officials cordoned off the site, while a pickup truck teetered precariously on the edge of the hole. Suriyachai Rawiwan, director of Bangkok’s disaster prevention department, told AFP at the scene that the collapse was likely linked to recent heavy rain and a leaky pipe. “There was a leak in the water pipe — water from the pipe eroded (earth) under the road so this incident happened,” he said, adding that there were no known casualties. “The water that eroded brought some soil that dropped down to an under-construction subway station, causing the collapse,” Suriyachai added. The tunnel is part of an underground service being built by the state-run Mass Rapid Transit Authority, which said it would investigate the cause of the cave-in. Suriyachai said the local police station facing the collapsed road was evacuated. Senior police officer Sayam Boonsom also said he had ordered the evacuation of nearby apartment blocks. “The location is at a station, and the soil was sucked into the site … it collapsed,” Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt told AFP at the scene. A video posted on social media and verified by AFP shows several people running from a construction area on Samsen Road as the street cracks open and collapses, revealing a water-filled hole. View this post on Instagram Vajira Hospital, a teaching facility for one of Thailand’s top medical universities, said in a Facebook post it was suspending outpatient services, adding that they would “resume as soon as possible”. Noppadech Pitpeng, a 27-year-old hospital staffer who lives in a nearby building, said he was frightened by a rumbling sound on Wednesday morning that woke him up. “The sound was like an electricity pole collapsing and my whole flat shook,” he said, while carrying clothes in a large bucket out of his building.",

      "summary": "A portion of a busy road in Thailand’s capital caved in early on Wednesday, leaving a hole dozens of metres deep in front of a main hospital and forcing people nearby to evacuate. Just outside a local police station and Vajira Hospital in a residential district of Bangkok, a roughly 50-metre (160-foot) hole pulled down power lines and exposed a burst pipe gushing water, AFP journalists saw. Dozens of police and city officials cordoned off the site, while a pickup truck teetered precariously on the edge of the hole. Suriyachai Rawiwan, director of Bangkok’s disaster prevention department, told AFP at the scene that the collapse was likely linked to recent heavy rain and a leaky pipe. “There was a leak in the water pipe — water from the pipe eroded (earth) under the road so this incident happened,” he said, adding that there were no known casualties. “The water that eroded brought some soil that dropped down to an under-construction subway station, causing the collapse,” Suriyachai added. The tunnel is part of an underground service being built by the state-run Mass Rapid Transit Authority, which said it would investigate the cause of the cave-in. Suriyachai said the local police station facing the collapsed road was evacuated.

      "summary_orig": "The Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan has said that terrorists are being “facilitated and given refuge to” in the tribal areas of the province, because of which security forces are compelled to carry out operations. The remarks come days after alleged aerial strikes in KP’s Tirah valley killed at least two dozen residents, including women and children. The incident prompted protests in the region, with local tribesmen, as well as the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , calling for an inquiry into the matter. On the other hand, officials claimed that the explosions that led to the killings were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses. During an interview on the DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’, Wali was questioned about the PTI-led government in KP criticising the security situation in the province, with some suggesting the party was on board with military operations, while others claimed the party opposed the measures. He was asked how he viewed this apparent contradiction. In response, Wali said, “Our brothers, sisters, friends, sons, children, and elders in tribal areas should not give refuge to people targeted in military operations.” “Do not make people who are wanted by the state your guests,” Wali asserted. When asked if he meant locals were sheltering the terrorists, Wali replied: “It certainly cannot be an outsider. How would the terrorists be operating in these areas otherwise?” “Someone has to be giving refuge to them and facilitating them. And when operations are carried out, our citizens also lose their lives.” At this point, Wali was asked to confirm if he was saying that locals of tribal areas were giving refuge to terrorists. To this, Wali did not respond in the affirmative but instead repeated his claim, saying, “There certainly has to be facilitation from some side.” The country, mainly KP and Balochistan, has lately witnessed a rise in terrorist incidents, particularly after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a peace deal with the government and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement personnel. Earlier this month, at least one person was killed in a bomb blast while a cricket match was being played in KP’s Bajaur district on Saturday, according to the police. In May, four children were killed and five others, including a woman, were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of North Waziristan district, prompting locals to protest against frequent strikes. Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice. While earlier this year, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Wednesday that it has received Third Country Operator (TCO) approval for flight operations in the United Kingdom and is expected to return to British skies next month, according to a statement. In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. Having received the TCO certification, the national carrier announced that it would now be allowed to operate direct flights and carry not only passengers but also cargo. “In the first phase, flight operations to Manchester will be resumed, after which Birmingham and London will be included in the B network,” the statement read, adding that the carrier was informed about the approval a day prior. “The same day, the British Department of Transport also issued PIA Security and Cargo ACC3 certificates for five years,” PIA added. “These certificates, issued by international aviation organisations, are a manifestation of complete confidence in PIA’s air operations and safety.” it said. In a post on X, the national carrier expressed gratitude to the prime minister, foreign minister, defence ministry and Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority for their assistance in getting operations resumed. The carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”. The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.",

      "title_orig": "Asia Cup: 4 takeaways from Pakistan’s confidence-boosting win against Sri Lanka",
      "summary_orig": "All of a sudden, Pakistan’s Asia Cup campaign is alive and well. Two days after getting thrashed by arch-rivals India for the second time in the tournament, the national side bounced back with a hard-fought five-wicket victory against Sri Lanka on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. It was a low-scoring encounter and Pakistan were clearly not clinical, especially with the bat, but it sure was a confidence boost for the side reeling after the India drubbings. More importantly, the match-winning performances came from players who were under fire coming into the clash. While Hussain Talat — whose selection was questioned in the Super Four match against India — took the anchor’s role after impressing with the ball, Mohammad Nawaz bounced back from a poor show in the previous game to turn finisher for Pakistan. Abrar Ahmed, who was battered by the Indian openers on Sunday, showed against Sri Lanka that he can’t be kept quiet for long. Shaheen Shah Afridi, meanwhile, spearheaded the Pakistan attack in the truest sense, producing the results with the new ball. Hussain’s redemption Few players had come under the microscope as quickly as Hussain Talat. Drafted in ahead of the India match, his inclusion was questioned after he struggled with both bat and ball in that lopsided defeat. Against Sri Lanka, however, the left-hander produced a display of calm and composure that showed why the management had placed their trust in him. Chasing a tricky target of 134, Pakistan were wobbling at 80 for five in the 12th over. The collapse threatened to undo all the hard work the bowlers had put in earlier. Hussain, though, held his nerve. His unbeaten 32 off 30 balls was not a match-winning knock in terms of brute force, but in the context of the game, it was invaluable. He read the situation perfectly, absorbed pressure when wickets kept tumbling, and then rotated the strike smartly once Nawaz began to find his range. The calmness he exuded rubbed off on Nawaz too, giving Pakistan stability during a phase where another wicket could have been fatal. In many ways, Talat’s innings was a reminder that anchors still have their place in T20 cricket. Hussain Talat (2L) sits on ground as he speaks with his teammate Mohammad Nawaz (2R) during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on September 23. — AFP Nawaz the finisher If Hussain provided calm, Mohammad Nawaz brought the fire. Criticised for a timid knock against India, Nawaz had looked short on confidence in recent games. But Tuesday was a different story. He played with intent from the moment he arrived at the crease, cracking boundaries and, more importantly, clearing the ropes when pressure seemed to be mounting. His unbeaten 38 off just 24 deliveries included three sixes — each one a dagger to Sri Lanka’s hopes of sneaking back into the game. The left-hander targeted the spinners effectively, using his reach and timing to pick gaps at will. What stood out was the clarity of his role: he was there to finish, and he finished in style. For a side that has often been criticised for lacking reliable finishers, Nawaz’s innings was a timely reminder of what he can offer. If Pakistan are to go deeper into the tournament, this version of Nawaz — aggressive, fearless, and decisive — will be indispensable. Mohammad Nawaz plays a shot during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on September 23. — AFP Unplayable Abrar Abrar Ahmed’s previous outing had been a nightmare. India’s openers neutralised him with ease, treating his mystery spin with disdain. But class, as they say, is permanent, and Abrar bounced back superbly against Sri Lanka. Bowling with discipline and guile, he finished with miserly figures of one for eight from his four overs. His variations were subtle, his length immaculate, and his control suffocated the Sri Lankan middle order. With Kamindu Mendis waging a lone battle at one end, Abrar’s spell ensured that partnerships never flourished. It was the kind of performance that not only restored his confidence but also reaffirmed his importance in Pakistan’s T20 setup. On UAE pitches that favour spinners who can maintain pressure, Abrar could yet become a trump card in Pakistan’s campaign. Abrar Ahmed (L) celebrates after taking the wicket of Sri Lanka’s Wanindu Hasaranga during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on September 23. — AFP Good old Shaheen If Abrar squeezed the middle overs, Shaheen Shah Afridi blew the top off Sri Lanka’s innings. Pakistan’s spearhead was at his best with the new ball, producing the trademark swing and venom that has made him one of the most feared fast bowlers in the world. He struck early to remove Kusal Perera and Pathum Nissanka, derailing Sri Lanka’s hopes of a strong start. Later, just as Kamindu Mendis threatened to take the game away, Shaheen returned to deliver a searing yorker that ended the left-hander’s resistance. His three for 28 was the bedrock on which Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to a modest total. For a side that often depends on early breakthroughs to control games, Shaheen’s spell was priceless. It was also a reminder that when Pakistan’s talisman is in rhythm, he can tilt contests almost single-handedly. Shaheen Shah Afridi (C) celebrates with teammates after taking the wicket of Sri Lanka’s Kamindu Mendis during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on September 23. — AFP The victory against Sri Lanka does not erase the scars of the India defeats, but it does inject belief into a side that looked rudderless just 48 hours earlier. Importantly, the players who had been under fire stood up and delivered, giving the management more options and flexibility heading into crunch fixtures. The batting remains fragile — the top order once again failed to provide solidity, and questions over strike rotation linger. But with Nawaz finding form, Hussain proving his worth, Abrar reasserting his quality, and Shaheen firing, Pakistan now have momentum. The Asia Cup is far from over, and sterner challenges lie ahead. Yet, if Pakistan can build on the grit and resilience shown in Abu Dhabi, they may yet turn this campaign into something memorable.",

      "title": "Asia Cup: 4 takeaways from Pakistan’s confidence-boosting win against Sri Lanka",
      "summary": "All of a sudden, Pakistan’s Asia Cup campaign is alive and well. Two days after getting thrashed by arch-rivals India for the second time in the tournament, the national side bounced back with a hard-fought five-wicket victory against Sri Lanka on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi. It was a low-scoring encounter and Pakistan were clearly not clinical, especially with the bat, but it sure was a confidence boost for the side reeling after the India drubbings. More importantly, the match-winning performances came from players who were under fire coming into the clash. While Hussain Talat — whose selection was questioned in the Super Four match against India — took the anchor’s role after impressing with the ball, Mohammad Nawaz bounced back from a poor show in the previous game to turn finisher for Pakistan. Abrar Ahmed, who was battered by the Indian openers on Sunday, showed against Sri Lanka that he can’t be kept quiet for long. Shaheen Shah Afridi, meanwhile, spearheaded the Pakistan attack in the truest sense, producing the results with the new ball. Hussain’s redemption Few players had come under the microscope as quickly as Hussain Talat. Drafted in ahead of the India match, his inclusion was questioned after he struggled with both bat and ball in that lopsided defeat. Against Sri Lanka, however, the left-hander produced a display of calm and composure that showed why the management had placed their trust in him. Chasing a tricky target of 134, Pakistan were wobbling at 80 for five in the 12th over. The collapse threatened to undo all the hard work the bowlers had put in earlier. Hussain, though, held his nerve. His unbeaten 32 off 30 balls was not a match-winning knock in terms of brute force, but in the context of the game, it was invaluable. He read the situation perfectly, absorbed pressure when wickets kept tumbling, and then rotated the strike smartly once Nawaz began to find his range. The calmness he exuded rubbed off on Nawaz too, giving Pakistan stability during a phase where another wicket could have been fatal. In many ways, Talat’s innings was a reminder that anchors still have their place in T20 cricket. Hussain Talat (2L) sits on ground as he speaks with his teammate Mohammad Nawaz (2R) during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on September 23. — AFP Nawaz the finisher If Hussain provided calm, Mohammad Nawaz brought the fire. Criticised for a timid knock against India, Nawaz had looked short on confidence in recent games. But Tuesday was a different story. He played with intent from the moment he arrived at the crease, cracking boundaries and, more importantly, clearing the ropes when pressure seemed to be mounting. His unbeaten 38 off just 24 deliveries included three sixes — each one a dagger to Sri Lanka’s hopes of sneaking back into the game. The left-hander targeted the spinners effectively, using his reach and timing to pick gaps at will. What stood out was the clarity of his role: he was there to finish, and he finished in style. For a side that has often been criticised for lacking reliable finishers, Nawaz’s innings was a timely reminder of what he can offer. If Pakistan are to go deeper into the tournament, this version of Nawaz — aggressive, fearless, and decisive — will be indispensable. Mohammad Nawaz plays a shot during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka at the Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi on September 23. — AFP Unplayable Abrar Abrar Ahmed’s previous outing had been a nightmare. India’s openers neutralised him with ease, treating his mystery spin with disdain. But class, as they say, is permanent, and Abrar bounced back superbly against Sri Lanka. Bowling with discipline and guile, he finished with miserly figures of one for eight from his four overs. His variations were subtle, his length immaculate, and his control suffocated the Sri Lankan middle order. With Kamindu Mendis waging a lone battle at one end, Abrar’s spell ensured that partnerships never flourished. It was the kind of performance that not only restored his confidence but also reaffirmed his importance in Pakistan’s T20 setup. On UAE pitches that favour spinners who can maintain pressure, Abrar could yet become a trump card in Pakistan’s campaign.

Pakistan’s spearhead was at his best with the new ball, producing the trademark swing and venom that has made him one of the most feared fast bowlers in the world. He struck early to remove Kusal Perera and Pathum Nissanka, derailing Sri Lanka’s hopes of a strong start. Later, just as Kamindu Mendis threatened to take the game away, Shaheen returned to deliver a searing yorker that ended the left-hander’s resistance. His three for 28 was the bedrock on which Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to a modest total. For a side that often depends on early breakthroughs to control games, Shaheen’s spell was priceless. It was also a reminder that when Pakistan’s talisman is in rhythm, he can tilt contests almost single-handedly.

      "summary_orig": "After a fiery address at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, where he opposed the growing wave of global recognition for a Palestinian state, US President Donald Trump convened a high-level meeting with leaders of Muslim-majority countries to present Washington’s plan for ending the war in Gaza. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar represented Pakistan at the gathering, alongside leaders from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Türkiye, and Indonesia. The meeting, held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA session, brought together regional heavyweights in an unprecedented show of diplomatic coordination. Ahead of formal consultations, Trump told his guests:\n“We have to get the hostages back … This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world … so it’s an honour to be with you.” Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes in Gaza have killed more than 65,000 people in response to the Hamas attack and the taking of hostages . Trump also emphasised the urgency of ending the conflict: “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started.” Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani responded to Trump’s comments by thanking him for hosting the meeting. “We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” he said. Pakistan’s consistent advocacy Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while talking to Pakistani journalists, welcomed Trump’s commitment, describing it as evidence that the US leader was “indeed a man of peace”. He recalled Washington’s role in preventing a potentially devastating conflict between India and Pakistan back in May, adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.” Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, in an earlier UN engagement, highlighted the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, describing it as a “graveyard for humanity” and urging the international community to move beyond statements to tangible action. Pakistan’s participation reflects a careful balancing act: maintaining constructive engagement with Washington while insisting on Palestinian sovereignty, adherence to international law, and a two-state solution. In doing so, Islamabad aligns with Arab states that reject unilateral solutions undermining Palestinian self-determination. Anatomy of Trump’s proposal According to reports from Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios , President Trump’s plan envisions: An immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages, both alive and\ndeceased Phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Governance excluding Hamas but incorporating the Palestinian\nAuthority Deployment of Arab and Muslim peacekeepers to secure Gaza and\nfacilitate Israel’s withdrawal Internationally supported reconstruction and transition programmes\nfunded by regional contributors These details were reportedly shared with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though Israel did not draft the plan. In interviews with various US channels, Secretary of State Marco Rubio framed the proposal in long-term terms. “The only way to a permanent solution to the challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement,” he said. “One in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.” Describing the New York meeting as “one last shot” in an interview with CBS News , Rubio emphasised its goal: ending the Gaza conflict, securing all remaining hostages, and establishing a humanitarian relief framework. Multiple challenges Trump’s plan attempts to address three simultaneous crises: Israel’s security concerns, Palestinian humanitarian needs, and the geopolitical desire of the US to position itself as the ultimate mediator. However, the plan faces multiple challenges, including legitimacy, as excluding Hamas would risk alienating a significant portion of the Palestinian population. Secondly, the plan could have regional consensus. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that proposals affecting Gaza’s population without their consent constituted “a very different threat to world peace.” Thirdly, the on-the-ground realities pose extraordinary challenges. With more than 65,000 Palestinians reported killed since October 7 — most of them civilians — achieving a swift diplomatic settlement will be exceedingly difficult. Trump’s outreach contrasts with his UNGA speech, where he criticised European recognitions of Palestine as rewarding Hamas for “horrible atrocities” and pressed instead for a “ceasefire-for-prisoners” deal. Meanwhile, 154 countries have recognised Palestine, underscoring the limits of Washington’s unilateral influence. Humanitarian and political implications Beyond ceasefires, Trump’s plan seeks to reshape Gaza’s political landscape — empowering the Palestinian Authority while relying on regional peacekeepers. While this could stabilise governance temporarily, it risks inflaming political tensions if not paired with inclusive, locally sanctioned negotiations. Pakistan’s emphasis on legality, human rights, and the two-state solution ensures that its stance remains morally credible and aligned with international law. This approach also strengthens Islamabad’s credibility among Muslim-majority nations increasingly wary of unilateral Western initiatives. US mediation shows assertiveness but future remains uncertain Trump’s Gaza plan embodies both ambition and risk. Diplomatically, it signals an assertive US effort to mediate a complex conflict, yet long-term prospects remain uncertain. Pakistan’s careful balancing — engaging with Washington, reaffirming Palestinian rights, and urging immediate humanitarian relief —  illustrates the nuanced role smaller, principled actors can play in global crises. As Rubio framed it, the New York meeting was “one last shot” at ending the conflict, securing hostages, and establishing humanitarian relief. For Pakistan, the challenge lies in ensuring that this diplomatic opportunity upholds justice, protects human life, and preserves the possibility of a sovereign, viable Palestine.",

The measures taken for the safety of people will affect tens of millions of people and see multiple factories shut across China’s manufacturing heartland. Chinese tech hub Shenzhen has ordered the evacuation of 400,000 people, with the city’s emergency management authorities warning of “severe wind, rain, waves and floods”. “Except for emergency rescue personnel and those ensuring people’s livelihood, please do not go out casually,” the authorities said in a statement, adding that work and market closures will begin in the afternoon. World’s most powerful tropical cyclone this year affects tens of millions of people, causes closure of factories across China’s manufacturing heartland Other cities in Guangdong province that are implementing the suspension measures include Cha­o­zhou, Zhuhai, Dongguan and Foshan. “The strong winds and heavy rainfall that the typhoon will bring will severely impact our city, posing a critical defence situation,” Foshan’s emergency headquarters said in a statement. Ragasa was generating maximum sustained winds of 230 kilometres (140 miles) per hour at its centre while churning across the South China Sea, according to Hong Kong’s weather service, having earlier hit parts of the Philippines. Hong Kong shuts down Hong Kong shut down ahead of Super Typhoon Ragasa on Tuesday, with authorities urging people to stay at home, while most passenger flights were due to be suspended until Thursday. People piled into supermarkets, leaving little on the shelves, as panic buying set in and residents stocked up on necessities for fear that shops could be closed for two days.

A woman battles gusts of wind as Super Typhoon Ragasa hits Causeway Bay district in Hong Kong on September 24. — AFP Guangdong authorities evacuated over 770,000 people, state broadcaster CCTV said, adding that more than one million people are expected to be relocated across the province on Tuesday. Hong Kong issued the typhoon signal 8, its third highest at 2.20pm, which urges most businesses and transport services to shut down.

      "summary_orig": "NEW DELHI: India’s Army, Navy and the Air Force will conduct a joint exercise named ‘Cold Start’ in the first week of October to test drones and counter-drone systems that officials dubbed as the biggest such drill to be conducted since Operation Sindoor, The Hindu said on Tuesday. It said the exercise was likely to be held in Madhya Pradesh. The drill aimed at assessing the effectiveness and shortcomings of the current air defence capabilities. Confirming the development, a senior official was quoted as saying the exercise would focus on evaluating operational readiness against evolving aerial threats. The Cold Start doctrine was developed by the Indian armed forces involving rapid, integrated offensive operations by combined arms units. It would thus bypass traditional slow troop mobilisation to achieve conventional objectives within a limited timeframe. Drill aimed at assessing shortcomings of current air defence capabilities The doctrine was developed after Operation Parakram exposed India’s slow response to the 2001 Parliament attack, the doctrine aims to provide a swift, decisive, and limited military response to terrorism without triggering a full-scale war. Analysts, however, say it carries a significant risk of escalating conflict to the nuclear level given Pakistan’s possession of tactical nuclear weapons. Industry partners, research and development agencies, academia, and other stakeholders, too, will participate in the ‘Cold Start’ exercise. Speaking at a conference on “Counter UAVs & Air Defence Systems — The Future of Modern Warfare” in Delhi, India’s Chief of Integrated Defence Staff Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit making a pointed reference to Pakistan said, “They too are working to ‘become like India’, so we must always stay a step ahead. “Our counter-drone and GPS jamming systems performed effectively during Operation Sindoor, ensuring no damage from adversary drones. But the adversary has also learned our capabilities. Next time, we have to be ahead and much better,” The Hindu quoted him as saying. He said the vision for the future involves an integrated defence system, inspired by the Sudarshan Chakra concept, to counter drones, UAVs, hypersonic weapons, and other threats. There is a need for systems usable in both peace and wartime, taking into consideration anti-social elements acquiring drone technology, necessitating widespread counter-drone capabilities.

      "summary_orig": "• Eight prosecution witnesses record statements; nine more to appear at next hearing • Imran’s lawyer opposes video link arrangement for PTI chief, will appeal ATC order • Plea in IHC seeks enforcement of conjugal rights for incarcerated ex-PM, spouse RAWALPINDI: The prosecution is likely to conclude its evidence against former prime minister Imran Khan and other PTI leaders next week in the case pertaining to a violent protest outside the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) on May 9, 2023, following the arrest of Mr Khan in a corruption case. During the hearing, ex-PM Imran Khan also marked his attendance from the Adiala jail via video link, but connectivity issues marred the PTI leader’s appearance before the court. On Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi recorded the statements of eight prosecution witnesses, after the defence sought deferment of the proceedings to challenge the order requiring Mr Khan’s appearance through video link. The order was passed in pursuance of a Punjab government notification directing trial proceedings be held via video link, citing security concerns. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah on Sept 19 ruled that the trial would be conducted on the court premises instead of in Adiala jail, with Mr Khan’s attendance to be mar­k­ed through video link. When the hearing resumed on Tuesday, the defence counsel requested an adjo­u­rnment, informing the judge that the legal team intended to file an appeal against the Sept 19 order. The prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum. The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement. The court recorded statements of eight prosecution witnesses, incl­uding three officers of the Fed­eral Investigation Agency’s Cyber Crimes Wing, who testified regarding tweets and other social media posts of the PTI leaders ahead of and during the May 9 protests. Two Islamabad magistrates, Awais Bhatti and Abdullah Khan, also testified that they had recorded statements of PTI local leaders Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Wasiq Qayyum and Omar Tanveer Butt, who affirmed the allegations against Mr Khan and the party leadership. According to Raja Ikram Ame­en Minhas, the head of the prosecution in the GHQ case, the testimony of 41 prosecution witnesses has been completed so far, while the remaining nine witnesses will be produced at the next hearing. He said that the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses would start afterwards. The court adjourned the case till Sept 27. Mr Khan, who has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since 2023, faces multiple cases, including GHQ protest case. He was indicted in December last year and was arrested in this case by the Rawa­lpindi police in January 2024. Conjugal rights Separately, the Islamabad High Court issued notices to the authorities concerned on a petition seeking permission for Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while incarcerated in prison. Justice Arbab Tahir took up the petition filed under Article 199 by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and Imran’s supporter. The court issued a one-page written order, directing the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Punjab government, Punjab’s inspector general of prisons, and the jail superintendent, among others, to submit their replies before the next hearing. During proceedings, the petitioner’s lawyer argued that Section 545A of the Criminal Proc­edure Code supported the protection of family life and provision of facilities for marital relations to prisoners as a basic need. He argued that denial of conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous judicial rulings. It also cites a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh Home Department in compliance with Supreme Court directions, allowing convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. Additionally, the petition relies on a landmark Shariat Court judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement. Published in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• PM Shehbaz, FM Dar join leaders from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia for multilateral meeting • US president calls for immediate end to war, tells Muslim leaders ‘this is the group that can do it’ • Opposes recognition of Palestine statehood in UNGA speech; Rubio says permanent solution only possible through ‘negotiated settlement’ NEW YORK: After an antagonistic speech at the UN General Assembly , where he opposed a growing global push towards the recognition of a Palestinian state, US President Donald Trump met Muslim leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to present his plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza. The meeting , held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA at United Nations Headquarters, brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia. Ahead of the meeting, in a televised interaction with Muslim leaders, Trump said: “We have to get the hostages back… This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world… so it’s an honour to be with you.” “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started,” he said, before the start of formal consultations with world leaders. Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani thanked the president for hosting such an important meeting at such an important time, saying that they were only there to stop the war and bring the prisoners back. “We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” the Qatari leader said. ‘Stop the war immediately’ Earlier, in his speech at the UNGA, Trump said that greater recognition for Palestine would amount to rewarding “horrible atrocities” by Hamas. He called on world powers to focus instead on securing the release of prisoners held in Gaza. Trump said the US wants a ‘ceasefire-for-prisoners’ deal that would see the return of all remaining prisoners, alive and dead. “We have to stop the war in Gaza immediately. We have to immediately negotiate peace,” he said. Reacting to Trump’s address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US leader’s “commitment to establishing peace in the world,” saying it showed he was “indeed a man of peace”. He also recalled that Trump and his team had “played a crucial role in preventing a potentially devastating war between India and Pakistan,” adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.” The remarks came ahead of the multi-lateral meeting with Muslim leaders, where Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also accompanied PM. When asked about the upcoming meeting by reporters, PM Shehbaz refused to comment, saying: “It is not the right time; I will speak about it only after the meeting is over.” The PM Office also released pictures showing PM Shehbaz in a meeting with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. Both the White House and Pakistan’s mission in Washington were expected to hold a briefing after the meeting, but no formal statements were issued until going to press. Plan for peace According to the White House, Trump’s plan envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of regional peacekeeping troops, and an internationally supported transition and reconstruction process for the battered enclave. Quoting diplomatic sources, Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios reported that while the plan had not been drafted by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been made aware of its outlines. It envisages a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), but not for Hamas, which both Washington and Tel Aviv insist must be dismantled. Washington wants Arab and Muslim countries to agree to send military forces to Gaza to enable Israel’s withdrawal and to secure funding for transition and rebuilding programs, Axios reported. Ahead of the multilateral meeting, Sec­retary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News that the only way to a permanent solution to the “challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement”. Describing the possible deal, he said it would be “one in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.” In separate remarks to CBS News , he described the multilateral meeting as “one last shot” at ending the conflict in Gaza, getting all remaining prisoners released, and putting in place a humanitarian relief programme.

When asked about the upcoming meeting by reporters, PM Shehbaz refused to comment, saying: “It is not the right time; I will speak about it only after the meeting is over.” The PM Office also released pictures showing PM Shehbaz in a meeting with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. Both the White House and Pakistan’s mission in Washington were expected to hold a briefing after the meeting, but no formal statements were issued until going to press. Plan for peace According to the White House, Trump’s plan envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of regional peacekeeping troops, and an internationally supported transition and reconstruction process for the battered enclave. Quoting diplomatic sources, Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios reported that while the plan had not been drafted by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been made aware of its outlines. It envisages a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), but not for Hamas, which both Washington and Tel Aviv insist must be dismantled. Washington wants Arab and Muslim countries to agree to send military forces to Gaza to enable Israel’s withdrawal and to secure funding for transition and rebuilding programs, Axios reported. Ahead of the multilateral meeting, Sec­retary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News that the only way to a permanent solution to the “challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement”. Describing the possible deal, he said it would be “one in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.” In separate remarks to CBS News , he described the multilateral meeting as “one last shot” at ending the conflict in Gaza, getting all remaining prisoners released, and putting in place a humanitarian relief programme.

      "summary": "• PM Shehbaz, FM Dar join leaders from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia for multilateral meeting • US president calls for immediate end to war, tells Muslim leaders ‘this is the group that can do it’ • Opposes recognition of Palestine statehood in UNGA speech; Rubio says permanent solution only possible through ‘negotiated settlement’ NEW YORK: After an antagonistic speech at the UN General Assembly , where he opposed a growing global push towards the recognition of a Palestinian state, US President Donald Trump met Muslim leaders, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, to present his plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza. The meeting , held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA at United Nations Headquarters, brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia. Ahead of the meeting, in a televised interaction with Muslim leaders, Trump said: “We have to get the hostages back… This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world… so it’s an honour to be with you.” “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started,” he said, before the start of formal consultations with world leaders. Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani thanked the president for hosting such an important meeting at such an important time, saying that they were only there to stop the war and bring the prisoners back. “We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” the Qatari leader said. ‘Stop the war immediately’ Earlier, in his speech at the UNGA, Trump said that greater recognition for Palestine would amount to rewarding “horrible atrocities” by Hamas. He called on world powers to focus instead on securing the release of prisoners held in Gaza. Trump said the US wants a ‘ceasefire-for-prisoners’ deal that would see the return of all remaining prisoners, alive and dead. “We have to stop the war in Gaza immediately. We have to immediately negotiate peace,” he said. Reacting to Trump’s address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US leader’s “commitment to establishing peace in the world,” saying it showed he was “indeed a man of peace”. He also recalled that Trump and his team had “played a crucial role in preventing a potentially devastating war between India and Pakistan,” adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.” The remarks came ahead of the multi-lateral meeting with Muslim leaders, where Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also accompanied PM.

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Twelve people, including women and chil­dren, were injured wh­en the Quetta-bound Jaf­far Express was targeted in a bomb blast in the Spizend area of Mas­tung on Tuesday. According to railway officials, six bogies of the train coming from Peshawar derailed after the blast and one overturned, injuring the passengers in that carriage. It was the second blast in the same area within 10 hours. Earlier in the morning, an explosion had occurred near the main track linking Balochistan to the rest of the country, just as the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express was preparing to leave Quetta Railway Station. The train was briefly halted but allowed to continue after security clearance, as the track was not damaged. Police officials said an explosive device plan­ted on the track was detonated when the Quetta-bound train was passing through the Spizend area. “Six bogies of the Jaffar Express derailed after the blast and one of them over­t­urned,” a senior Pakistan Railways official told Dawn , adding that five pa­s­s­engers sustained injuries. Security forces and pol­ice rushed to the site soon after the blast and shif­ted the injured to a nearby health facility. The railway officials confirmed 270 passengers were on board at the time of the blast. They said the damaged part of the track would be repaired after security clearance on Wednesday, during which train service would remain suspended. Published in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",
