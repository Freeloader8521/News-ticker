      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: Even though the federal and provincial governments are locked in a blame game over displacement from the restive Tirah valley, officials estimate that around 80-85pc of all residents have been evacuated so far. Inclement weather continues to hold up the evacuation process, which has been temporarily halted. Those who had already left their homes and became stranded due to snow storms have also finally reached Bara after two days of hectic rescue operations. Heavy snowfall and the slow pace of registration at multiple locations along the 110-kilometre road from Tirah to Bara has multiplied the miseries of displaced families, with most spending sleepless nights on the road in severe cold. District administration officials told Dawn that though the exact number of families who arrived in Bara was not yet known, but by Tuesday, they estimated that only around 15pc were yet to be evacuated. Evacuation process still on hold amid inclement weather; authorities increase number of registration centres at Bara to facilitate the displaced They said the final date for evacuation had been extended after heavy snowfall and the remaining families were told to stay back till weather improves, though no exact completion date was given. Officials explained that the relaxation was given in light of weather-related hurdles, as it was imperative to give the Tirah people some ‘space’ prior to the restart of their final evacuation after an improvement in weather condition. Dawn has also learnt that families still stranded in their homes due to the suspension of the evacuation process are facing an acute shortage of edibles, as authorities were not allowing anyone into the valley. In Bara, local tribal elders, former parliamentarians and political party representatives blamed both governments for forcing families to vacate their houses to pave the way for yet another military operation. Demanding an immediate halt to the ongoing ‘inhuman’ treatment’ of displaced families, Hamidullah Jan Afridi, a former MNA, sought transparency in the registration process, and called for honouring all commitments made with the 24-member jirga of Tirah elders prior to the start of displacement. He also demanded stopping of political interference in the registration process and due compensation against all losses the people of Tirah had incurred during their displacement. Hashim Khan Afridi, president of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, insisted the decision about the military operation and ‘forced displacement’ was jointly taken by federal and KP governments after holding a series of consultations with local tribal elders. He also demanded an open audit of all funds released in the name of Tirah IDPs and sharing required data with people of both Tirah and Bara. Registration process The district administration has also increased the number of registration centers in Bara to expedite the process and make it more transparent. Officials said that alongside the Paindi Cheena centre, four new centres had been made operational in Alamgudar, Bar Qambarkhel, Malakdin Khel and Qambarabad localities of Bara. They said that separate desks for female registration were established at all centres, as many displaced families had complained that the women had to be herded into the same centres as men, which they considered against their culture and traditions. Officials said that along with district administration officials, local tribal elders, bank staff and staff of a mobile phone company were deputed at all centres for instant verification and issuance of SIM cards to Tirah families. They said previous polio vaccination records would also be used for verification of genuine IDPs with timely provision of basic necessities. Sources in Bara informed that a majority of newly arrived families from Tirah were staying with relatives in different parts of Bara, with some having second homes while a limited number went to Peshawar suburbs where they own houses. Authorities also started registration of hundreds of Zakhakhel families at Paindi Cheena after reaching understanding with Nadra staff. The Zakhakhel families were earlier denied registration on the pretext they had acquired CNICs from Landi Kotal tehsil and are not actual residents of Tirah. Published in Dawn, January 28th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Achakzai keeps mum, Gohar says parliamentary party to make decision • Dogar ties all decisions to meeting with Imran • Analysts believe PTI founder may decide the matter after Feb 8 protest ISLAMABAD: Days after the appointment of leader of the opposition in both the Senate and the National Assembly , the main opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), is seriously considering rejoining the standing committees of parliament, a move that remains contingent on the consent of its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan. A majority of PTI leaders are said to be keen to regain the chairmanship of standing committees, particularly the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), in order to “resist” what they describe as controversial decisions and policies of the government. As the final decision to rejoin the committees rests with Mr Khan, political analysts believe he is likely to decide on the matter after the PTI’s countrywide protest scheduled for Feb 8. PTI previously held the chairmanship of more than a dozen standing committees in the National Assembly and five in the Senate, besides participating in several others. However, on the directives of its founder, the party withdrew from all standing committees in both houses of parliament in August last year. It has been learnt that a majority of PTI legislators now believe the party should not have exited the standing committees, as doing so allowed the government to function without effective parliamentary scrutiny. They believe Mr Khan’s decision ceded crucial ground to the ruling coalition. Talking to Dawn , a senior PTI leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many key party decisions were pending and linked to a meeting between the jailed PTI founder, party legislators and his sisters. “The government should arrange a meeting between Imran Khan and party legislators so that he can be convinced that we must rejoin the standing committees,” he said. He added that relinquishing the chairmanship of the PAC was not a sagacious decision, as the party had used the forum effectively to expose alleged wrongdoing by the government. The PTI leader said that, besides the PAC, the party should not have vacated three other important committees — finance, law and justice, and human rights. He recalled that when PTI workers and members of the Punjab Assembly were recently maltreated by the police, the matter was taken up by a privilege committee. “On the other hand, PTI parliamentarians are often humiliated and manhandled by the police, but they cannot take such matters to the privilege committees of the Senate and the National Assembly,” he said. All decisions linked to jail meeting PTI Chief Whip Aamir Dogar, while talking to Dawn , agreed that all pending party decisions were linked to a meeting between Imran Khan and party leaders in jail. The newly-appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Mehmood Achakzai, shortly after his maiden speech in the house, declined to comment on the possibility of PTI’s return to the standing committees. However, PTI acting chairman Barrister Gohar Ali said the decision regarding rejoining the standing committees would be taken by the party’s parliamentary committee. According to observers, Mr Khan’s decision to exit the standing committees mirrored his move in 2022, when he opted to quit parliament following the no-confidence vote instead of positioning PTI as a “heavyweight opposition” after his ouster from power. They believe the decision to withdraw from the committees did not create any vacuum in parliament. The absence of three or four PTI lawmakers from a committee did not affect the quorum, which requires the presence of one-fourth of the total members. Moreover, the departure made little practical difference, as members from the treasury benches replaced PTI representatives. In effect, PTI remained the sole loser in the entire episode. Courage to disagree Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who heads the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), said PTI leaders were effectively helpless, even if they favoured a return to the committees, as the authority to decide rested solely with Mr Khan. He noted that most PTI leaders lacked the courage to even disagree with Mr Khan’s position as they wished to remain in his good books. Mr Mehboob was of the opinion that Mr Khan would first assess the outcome of PTI’s Feb 8 countrywide protest and then decide on the issue of standing committees. He said democracy required PTI to return to the committees and play an effective role. However, he added, Mr Khan remained the final authority. “A lack of opposition representation in these important committees negatively impacts the quality of parliamentary proceedings,” he said. Calling the situation ironic, the Pildat chief said PTI’s decision to leave all standing committees, including the PAC, echoed its earlier move to quit the National Assembly and relinquish governments in provinces. Meanwhile, a source in the National Assembly Secretariat said NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had advised PTI on several occasions to return to the committees and that any such move by the party would be welcomed by the secretariat.

      "summary": "• Achakzai keeps mum, Gohar says parliamentary party to make decision • Dogar ties all decisions to meeting with Imran • Analysts believe PTI founder may decide the matter after Feb 8 protest ISLAMABAD: Days after the appointment of leader of the opposition in both the Senate and the National Assembly , the main opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), is seriously considering rejoining the standing committees of parliament, a move that remains contingent on the consent of its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan. A majority of PTI leaders are said to be keen to regain the chairmanship of standing committees, particularly the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), in order to “resist” what they describe as controversial decisions and policies of the government. As the final decision to rejoin the committees rests with Mr Khan, political analysts believe he is likely to decide on the matter after the PTI’s countrywide protest scheduled for Feb 8. PTI previously held the chairmanship of more than a dozen standing committees in the National Assembly and five in the Senate, besides participating in several others. However, on the directives of its founder, the party withdrew from all standing committees in both houses of parliament in August last year. It has been learnt that a majority of PTI legislators now believe the party should not have exited the standing committees, as doing so allowed the government to function without effective parliamentary scrutiny. They believe Mr Khan’s decision ceded crucial ground to the ruling coalition. Talking to Dawn , a senior PTI leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many key party decisions were pending and linked to a meeting between the jailed PTI founder, party legislators and his sisters. “The government should arrange a meeting between Imran Khan and party legislators so that he can be convinced that we must rejoin the standing committees,” he said. He added that relinquishing the chairmanship of the PAC was not a sagacious decision, as the party had used the forum effectively to expose alleged wrongdoing by the government. The PTI leader said that, besides the PAC, the party should not have vacated three other important committees — finance, law and justice, and human rights. He recalled that when PTI workers and members of the Punjab Assembly were recently maltreated by the police, the matter was taken up by a privilege committee. “On the other hand, PTI parliamentarians are often humiliated and manhandled by the police, but they cannot take such matters to the privilege committees of the Senate and the National Assembly,” he said. All decisions linked to jail meeting PTI Chief Whip Aamir Dogar, while talking to Dawn , agreed that all pending party decisions were linked to a meeting between Imran Khan and party leaders in jail. The newly-appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Mehmood Achakzai, shortly after his maiden speech in the house, declined to comment on the possibility of PTI’s return to the standing committees. However, PTI acting chairman Barrister Gohar Ali said the decision regarding rejoining the standing committees would be taken by the party’s parliamentary committee. According to observers, Mr Khan’s decision to exit the standing committees mirrored his move in 2022, when he opted to quit parliament following the no-confidence vote instead of positioning PTI as a “heavyweight opposition” after his ouster from power. They believe the decision to withdraw from the committees did not create any vacuum in parliament. The absence of three or four PTI lawmakers from a committee did not affect the quorum, which requires the presence of one-fourth of the total members. Moreover, the departure made little practical difference, as members from the treasury benches replaced PTI representatives. In effect, PTI remained the sole loser in the entire episode. Courage to disagree Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who heads the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), said PTI leaders were effectively helpless, even if they favoured a return to the committees, as the authority to decide rested solely with Mr Khan. He noted that most PTI leaders lacked the courage to even disagree with Mr Khan’s position as they wished to remain in his good books. Mr Mehboob was of the opinion that Mr Khan would first assess the outcome of PTI’s Feb 8 countrywide protest and then decide on the issue of standing committees. He said democracy required PTI to return to the committees and play an effective role. However, he added, Mr Khan remained the final authority. “A lack of opposition representation in these important committees negatively impacts the quality of parliamentary proceedings,” he said. Calling the situation ironic, the Pildat chief said PTI’s decision to leave all standing committees, including the PAC, echoed its earlier move to quit the National Assembly and relinquish governments in provinces. Meanwhile, a source in the National Assembly Secretariat said NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had advised PTI on several occasions to return to the committees and that any such move by the party would be welcomed by the secretariat.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Australia on Tuesday discussed the possibility of an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) for structured, long-term cooperation in Pakistan’s mining and mineral sector. The IGA between the two sides was proposed by Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik here during his meeting with the new Australian High Commissioner (AHC) to Pakistan, Timothy Kane. It builds on a July 2025 Australian proposal made through former AHC Neil Hawkins for collaboration between Australian universities, mining firms, and Pakistani institutions to provide specialised training programmes in modern mining techniques and services and enhance local expertise and support Pakistan’s mining sector development. An official statement said the new AHC Kane and the petroleum minister discussed avenues for enhanced bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors. The minister welcomed the strong interest of Australian companies in Pakistan’s mining sector and highlighted the country’s immense untapped mineral potential, particularly in the Tethyan Belt. “He proposed the possibility of an IGA between Pakistan and Australia to promote structured and long-term cooperation in the mining sector,” the statement said. Discuss possibility of long-term cooperation agreement to tap country’s vast mineral potential Australia had been operating in Pakistan’s mineral and natural resources sector, almost in all resource-rich regions, including Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, mostly in research and exploration and identified critical reserves in copper, gold, coal, zinc and other precious resources, including oil and gas. Australian BHP Billiton’s joint venture with the Geological Survey of Pakistan had led to the discovery of the multi-billion dollar Reko Diq copper-gold deposits, now being developed for commercial production by Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada. BHP had left Pakistan under its global restructuring almost two decades ago. Mr Malik briefed the new envoy about the government’s efforts to develop and formalise the gemstones sector to unleash its true potential for value addition, exports, and employment generation. The AHC reiterated that Australian companies were already actively involved in the Reko Diq project, and additional Australian firms had shown keen interest in joining the project. He said the Australian companies would be encouraged to participate in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum (PMIF), expressing hope for a strong Australian presence at the event. The diplomat highlighted the growing global importance of copper and gold for the energy transition, adding that Pakistan’s mining sector had attracted significant international attention. He also expressed “optimism for collaboration in the gemstones sector through knowledge exchange, training, and technical assistance”, the statement said. The two sides also discussed the recent visit of the petroleum minister to Australia for the International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC) and the fruitful discussions with leading and junior Australian mining companies on investment and cooperation opportunities in Pakistan’s minerals sector. The two sides agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors for mutual benefit. The presence of mineral deposits in the Reko Diq area was identified by the Geological Survey of Pakistan in the early 1990s in collaboration with BHP Billiton of Australia. Later in 2000, Tethyan Corporation (TCC) of Australia took over the project from BHP and invested $30 million by raising funds through an international listing and drilled over 75,000 meters to prove the reserves. The TCC was subsequently taken over by two of the world’s largest copper and gold mining firms — Antofagasta of Chile and Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada for A$158 million ($130m) at the time. The agreement between Pakistan and the two mining firms signed in the Musharraf era ran into trouble, leading to international arbitration followed by an out-of-court settlement for penalties and project revival. In the process, the Reko Diq project production, due in 2010, was delayed by at least 15 years. It was announced at the time of discovery by GSP and BHP that the Reko Diq mining area had proven estimated reserves of two billion tonnes of copper and 20 million ounces of gold, valued at $65bn at the time. The recent feasibility studies completed by Barrick have also established that the project would have a 45 million tonnes of throughput per annum (Mpta) for the first five years and then 90 Mpta for the following 32 years of the second phase. Based on existing reserves, the Reko Diq project is expected to yield production of 13.1m tonnes of copper and 17.9m ounces of gold over the life of the mine (100pc basis), according to state-run Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL), one of the shareholders. The feasibility study has also confirmed a lucrative 25pc rate of return on investment on one of the biggest copper-gold projects. Under the updated feasibility study, Phase 1 is planned to process 45m tonnes of mill-feed annually (Mtpa) from 2028. Previously, it was estimated to be close to 40m tonnes. By 2034, Phase 2 is planned to double the processing capacity to 90Mtpa. Published in Dawn, January 28th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Tuesday upheld a trial court order restraining singer Meesha Shafi from making statements related to sexual harassment allegations against actor-cum-singer Ali Zafar until the conclusion of the defamation suit filed by the latter against the former. In the written order seen by Dawn , Justice Ahmad Nadeem Arshad observed that the veracity of the allegations cannot be determined without recording evidence and that repeated public statements while the matter was sub judice could amount to a “parallel media trial, which is neither permissible nor desirable in the interest of justice and fair adjudication”. The judge subsequently dismissed the plea filed by Shafi challenging the gag order issued by the trial court on Jan 24, 2019. Zafar had claimed that the allegations levelled against him by Shafi were false and had damaged his reputation. Along with the defamation suit, he had sought an interim injunction to prevent the defendant female singer from issuing further statements on the matter. The trial court had accepted Zafar’s application and passed an order which stated: “The defendant shall not make any statement which is relevant to the controversy of defamation of plaintiff in this case till the decision of this suit.” The written order by the LHC said that during the arguments, Meesha’s counsel had argued that an injunction could not be granted in a defamation suit. He further said that injunctions in defamation cases should only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Meanwhile, Zafar’s counsel had opposed Shafi’s petition, pointing out the irreparable harm to his client’s reputation through public statements made by the petitioner, it noted. In his judgment, Justice Arshad held that there was no “absolute bar” in the law on granting injunctions in defamation cases and that interim protection may be justified in exceptional circumstances to prevent irreparable harm to reputation. He noted that reputation, once damaged, could not be restored through monetary compensation and that the balance of convenience favoured maintaining the injunction. The judge said that for a public figure whose career and livelihood depended upon public perception and trust, the continuous circulation of unproven allegations would cause harm that could not be quantified in terms of money. “The allegations levelled against him (respondent), if found to be untrue, are of such a nature that they directly strike at his dignity, honour and professional credibility,” the judge added. He said the material available on record prima facie showed that the suit raised “serious triable issues requiring evidence, therefore, the respondent cannot be left remedyless, during the pendency of the proceedings”. On the contrary, the judge noted, the petitioner (Shafi) would not suffer any irreparable prejudice by being restrained from making statements pertaining to the controversy till the matter was decided on merit. He said the restraint imposed was temporary in nature and subject to the final outcome of the suit. The judge ruled that the trial court had exercised its discretion properly by imposing a limited restriction rather than a blanket prohibition. The judge also held that the order did not violate freedom of expression, stating that such freedom was subject to reasonable restrictions and must be balanced with the right to dignity. Justice Arshad observed that following the principles of Bonnard v. Perryman (1981), an interim injunction restraining the petitioner from making any statement regarding the subject matter of the alleged defamation until the disposal of the suit was justified. Dismissing Shafi’s petition, the judge also directed the trial court to decide the main defamation suit expeditiously, preferably within 30 days, as the case was currently at the stage of final arguments. In his suit, Zafar said Shafi had posted on Twitter (now X) on April 19, 2018 and levelled baseless allegations of sexual harassment against him, which resulted in tarnishing his image in public. He said the female singer failed to delete the post and issue an apology within 14 days of a legal notice served on her. He had asked the court to issue a decree against Shafi directing her to pay Rs1 billion as damages to him.",

In his suit, Zafar said Shafi had posted on Twitter (now X) on April 19, 2018 and levelled baseless allegations of sexual harassment against him, which resulted in tarnishing his image in public. He said the female singer failed to delete the post and issue an apology within 14 days of a legal notice served on her. He had asked the court to issue a decree against Shafi directing her to pay Rs1 billion as damages to him.",

      "title_orig": "PTI says Imran suffering from ailment that could permanently damage his eyesight if not treated promptly",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI on Tuesday again raised concerns about the health of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, saying it had learned through credible reports that the ex-premier was suffering from an ailment that could cause permanent damage to his eyesight if not treated promptly. In a statement released on the social media platform X, the party demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and associates. It also demanded that he be allowed medical treatment at a hospital of his own choice. The statement said the party had learnt through credible media reports that Imran had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, “resulting in a dangerous blockage in the retinal vein”. “According to medical experts who reportedly checked him in jail, this is an extremely sensitive and serious medical condition which, if not treated promptly and properly, carries a high risk of permanent damage to his eyesight,” the party said. “Despite this, the jail administration is stubbornly insisting that the treatment be carried out inside the jail, while the attending specialist doctor has clearly stated that such treatment is not possible in jail and that it requires an operation theatre and specialized medical facilities,” the party said, adding that this “reckless attitude” put Imran’s vision and his overall health in grave danger. It said that Imran was last granted access to his personal physician in October 2024, who had not been allowed to examine him since then, despite order issued by the Islamabad High Court. “This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights. Moreover, a petition regarding Imran Khan’s regular medical check-ups has been pending since August 2025, which is being deliberately ignored. The government’s conduct clearly demonstrates that, in its obsession with political vendetta, it is willing to gamble with the life and health of a prisoner,” the party said. It demanded that Imran be immediately allowed an unrestricted meeting with his family and close associates so that the “public may be reassured about his condition”. “We also demand that he be allowed without delay to Shaukat Khanum Hospital or to any other reputable hospital of his own choice, where he can receive proper treatment under the supervision of qualified specialists with full medical facilities. We strongly appeal to the judiciary to treat this as a matter of health and human life, not politics, and to ensure that no negligence or delay is allowed in his medical care,” it said. The statement said that if there was permanent damage to Imran’s eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be responsible as they were “obstructing his treatment despite clear medical advice and court orders”. Shaukat Khanum Hospital, which was established by Imran, also issued a statement, saying it was “gravely concerned” about the ex-premier’s health. “While we have every confidence in the abilities and professionalism of the physicians currently looking after him, we nevertheless request that a team of physicians from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be given immediate access to Khan sahib and be allowed to participate in his care so as to reassure all those who are concerned for his welfare,” the statement said. Imran’s sisters question reports about his ailment For their part, Imran’s sisters raised doubts about the reports of his ailment. The three, among other PTI supporters and workers, had gathered near Adiala jail — where Imran is incarcerated — on Tuesday. Speaking at the spot, one of Imran’s sisters, Noreen Khanum, was asked to comment on the restriction on meetings with Imran. In response, Noreen said, “We come here to [protest] against the cruelty being meted out to Imran.” She also addressed the reports of Imran having an eye ailment, saying: “If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment.” Without naming anyone, she alleged that “they [float rumours] as a tester, they lie to worry and disappoint the people and this is why I don’t believe this.” She asserted that Imran was healthy and fit, further warning that “if they are planning to do something, then damaging Imran’s eyes will mean that even their eye will not be spared”. Imran’s other sister, Aleema Khanum, said no one from the jail administration was sharing any details about him with his family and lawyers. “So who has leaked this news? Which institution has leaked this? Because can you believe that this can be leaked without the involvement of any agency?” she said, adding, “We have just one demand: release Imran Khan.” She also said that Imran had been imprisoned for the past two-and-a-half years because he was adamant that he “will not secure his release through a deal”. The ex-premier’s third sister, Uzma Khanum, said that she had last met her brother on December 2, 2025 for just 20 minutes. “During that conversation, he said nothing about his eyesight,” she said. However, Uzma continued, in a meeting held two months earlier, Imran had told her that he had an infection in his right eye, but only eye drops were given to him. Presently, “we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him”, she said. Aleema spoke to the media again at night, saying that the last time Imran met someone was two months ago when his lawyer, Salman Safdar, was allowed to meet him for eight minutes. Later, the PTI claimed in a post on X that Aleema was stopped by police when she was returning from the Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also alleged in a statement that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” when they were returning from the Adiala jail. The statement said that Imran’s sisters were not just barred from meeting him, but also “wrongfully confined” while they were returning. “This act is another clear example of the brutal and illegitimate use of state power, the objective behind which is to scare citizens and intensify political revenge,” the statement said. The TTAP demanded that Imran and his family be allowed to meet, the fundamental right of peaceful assembly and free movement be respected, and legal action be taken against those responsible for the wrongful confinement of Imran’s sisters. PTI MNAs file fresh plea for meeting Imran Separately, PTI MNA arrives at the IHC to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, along with MNAs Ali Muhammad Khan, Shehryar Afridi, Salman Akram Raja, Aamir Dogar, Ali Asghar Khan and Shahzada Gustasp, among others, appeared at the IHC court premises and completed the biometric verification to submit their application. Speaking to the media outside the IHC, Gohar said that Tuesdays were the designated day for meetings with Imran. He said that the party leadership had approached the IHC chief justice multiple times but had not been granted a meeting. He added that a letter signed by PTI MNAs was being submitted to the IHC chief justice, requesting that meetings with the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi be scheduled in accordance with the law and court orders. The PTI chairman also expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi stressing that meeting a prisoner was a fundamental legal right and should not be politicised. Gohar reiterated that PTI’s mandate had been “robbed” and reiterated the opposition’s nationwide protest call for February 8, including a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike, calling on shopkeepers and transporters to participate. PTI Secretary General Raja said that the youth’s right to vote had been snatched. He called for a peaceful protest and expressed concern over reports that Imran was suffering from an eye problem. He added that the party would raise these concerns with the IHC chief justice. Separately, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka extended interim bail to Imran in five additional cases related to May 9 and to Bushra Bibi in a fake receipts case related to the Toshakhana. The PTI founder could not be presented before the court, either physically or via video link, due to which arguments could not be concluded. The court ordered that he be presented at the next hearing and extended interim bail until February 6.",

Shaukat Khanum Hospital, which was established by Imran, also issued a statement, saying it was “gravely concerned” about the ex-premier’s health. “While we have every confidence in the abilities and professionalism of the physicians currently looking after him, we nevertheless request that a team of physicians from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be given immediate access to Khan sahib and be allowed to participate in his care so as to reassure all those who are concerned for his welfare,” the statement said. Imran’s sisters question reports about his ailment For their part, Imran’s sisters raised doubts about the reports of his ailment. The three, among other PTI supporters and workers, had gathered near Adiala jail — where Imran is incarcerated — on Tuesday. Speaking at the spot, one of Imran’s sisters, Noreen Khanum, was asked to comment on the restriction on meetings with Imran. In response, Noreen said, “We come here to [protest] against the cruelty being meted out to Imran.” She also addressed the reports of Imran having an eye ailment, saying: “If this is true, we should have been informed so that we could have taken him to the hospital for treatment.” Without naming anyone, she alleged that “they [float rumours] as a tester, they lie to worry and disappoint the people and this is why I don’t believe this.” She asserted that Imran was healthy and fit, further warning that “if they are planning to do something, then damaging Imran’s eyes will mean that even their eye will not be spared”. Imran’s other sister, Aleema Khanum, said no one from the jail administration was sharing any details about him with his family and lawyers. “So who has leaked this news? Which institution has leaked this? Because can you believe that this can be leaked without the involvement of any agency?” she said, adding, “We have just one demand: release Imran Khan.” She also said that Imran had been imprisoned for the past two-and-a-half years because he was adamant that he “will not secure his release through a deal”. The ex-premier’s third sister, Uzma Khanum, said that she had last met her brother on December 2, 2025 for just 20 minutes. “During that conversation, he said nothing about his eyesight,” she said. However, Uzma continued, in a meeting held two months earlier, Imran had told her that he had an infection in his right eye, but only eye drops were given to him. Presently, “we don’t know anything about the condition of his eye as we are not allowed to meet him”, she said. Aleema spoke to the media again at night, saying that the last time Imran met someone was two months ago when his lawyer, Salman Safdar, was allowed to meet him for eight minutes. Later, the PTI claimed in a post on X that Aleema was stopped by police when she was returning from the Adiala jail. The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also alleged in a statement that Imran’s sisters were “wrongfully confined” when they were returning from the Adiala jail. The statement said that Imran’s sisters were not just barred from meeting him, but also “wrongfully confined” while they were returning. “This act is another clear example of the brutal and illegitimate use of state power, the objective behind which is to scare citizens and intensify political revenge,” the statement said. The TTAP demanded that Imran and his family be allowed to meet, the fundamental right of peaceful assembly and free movement be respected, and legal action be taken against those responsible for the wrongful confinement of Imran’s sisters. PTI MNAs file fresh plea for meeting Imran Separately, PTI MNA arrives at the IHC to file a fresh petition seeking permission to meet Imran. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, along with MNAs Ali Muhammad Khan, Shehryar Afridi, Salman Akram Raja, Aamir Dogar, Ali Asghar Khan and Shahzada Gustasp, among others, appeared at the IHC court premises and completed the biometric verification to submit their application. Speaking to the media outside the IHC, Gohar said that Tuesdays were the designated day for meetings with Imran. He said that the party leadership had approached the IHC chief justice multiple times but had not been granted a meeting. He added that a letter signed by PTI MNAs was being submitted to the IHC chief justice, requesting that meetings with the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi be scheduled in accordance with the law and court orders. The PTI chairman also expressed concern over the health of both Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi stressing that meeting a prisoner was a fundamental legal right and should not be politicised. Gohar reiterated that PTI’s mandate had been “robbed” and reiterated the opposition’s nationwide protest call for February 8, including a wheel-jam and shutter-down strike, calling on shopkeepers and transporters to participate. PTI Secretary General Raja said that the youth’s right to vote had been snatched. He called for a peaceful protest and expressed concern over reports that Imran was suffering from an eye problem. He added that the party would raise these concerns with the IHC chief justice. Separately, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka extended interim bail to Imran in five additional cases related to May 9 and to Bushra Bibi in a fake receipts case related to the Toshakhana. The PTI founder could not be presented before the court, either physically or via video link, due to which arguments could not be concluded. The court ordered that he be presented at the next hearing and extended interim bail until February 6.",
      "title": "PTI says Imran suffering from ailment that could permanently damage his eyesight if not treated promptly",
      "summary": "The PTI on Tuesday again raised concerns about the health of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, saying it had learned through credible reports that the ex-premier was suffering from an ailment that could cause permanent damage to his eyesight if not treated promptly. In a statement released on the social media platform X, the party demanded that Imran be allowed an “unrestricted meeting” with his family and associates. It also demanded that he be allowed medical treatment at a hospital of his own choice. The statement said the party had learnt through credible media reports that Imran had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion in his right eye, “resulting in a dangerous blockage in the retinal vein”. “According to medical experts who reportedly checked him in jail, this is an extremely sensitive and serious medical condition which, if not treated promptly and properly, carries a high risk of permanent damage to his eyesight,” the party said. “Despite this, the jail administration is stubbornly insisting that the treatment be carried out inside the jail, while the attending specialist doctor has clearly stated that such treatment is not possible in jail and that it requires an operation theatre and specialized medical facilities,” the party said, adding that this “reckless attitude” put Imran’s vision and his overall health in grave danger. It said that Imran was last granted access to his personal physician in October 2024, who had not been allowed to examine him since then, despite order issued by the Islamabad High Court. “This is a blatant violation of court orders and a gross breach of fundamental human rights. Moreover, a petition regarding Imran Khan’s regular medical check-ups has been pending since August 2025, which is being deliberately ignored. The government’s conduct clearly demonstrates that, in its obsession with political vendetta, it is willing to gamble with the life and health of a prisoner,” the party said. It demanded that Imran be immediately allowed an unrestricted meeting with his family and close associates so that the “public may be reassured about his condition”. “We also demand that he be allowed without delay to Shaukat Khanum Hospital or to any other reputable hospital of his own choice, where he can receive proper treatment under the supervision of qualified specialists with full medical facilities. We strongly appeal to the judiciary to treat this as a matter of health and human life, not politics, and to ensure that no negligence or delay is allowed in his medical care,” it said. The statement said that if there was permanent damage to Imran’s eyesight, the government and the Adiala jail administration would be responsible as they were “obstructing his treatment despite clear medical advice and court orders”.

      "title_orig": "No question of military operation in Tirah: defence minister",
      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said that there was no question of a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah, insisting that migration was a routine practice in the valley. Asif made these remarks during a press conference in Islamabad, where he was flanked by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Information and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan. The press conference came two days after the federal and provincial governments traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of planned military action against terrorists. The evacuations, which were carried out in line with a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders — including local elders, the provincial government and the military — seem to have become a bone of contention after the displaced populace found themselves stranded in cold weather under open skies, with mismanagement by the authorities only adding to their troubles. At the outset of the press conference, the defence minister said members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had been residing in Tirah with their families. “They are around 400-500 in number,” he said. The defence minister further stated that the provincial government had approved a package of Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah, who were to migrate. “The armed forces deployed in that area have nothing to do with it. This is an arrangement between the jirga and the provincial government, and as a result of that, this notification was issued,” he added, holding up a notification that he said was issued by the KP government. On Sunday, the information ministry had also referred to the same notification by the KP Relief, Rehabilitation and Resettlement department for the release of funds, reportedly Rs4 billion, for the anticipated temporary and voluntary movement of the population from certain localities of Tirah (Bagh). These funds were seemingly required for relief-related arrangements for those leaving Tirah. The ministry also asserted that the armed forces or the federal government had not issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Tirah. During the press conference, Asif said that a military operation in the area had been carried out years ago. “And it was strategically decided then that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) are way more effective than operations; the collateral damage is way less. So, the armed forces have not carried out an operation in years in favour of IBOs,” he said. The minister added, “This is why this practice has been ongoing there for many years, and that is why there is no question of any operation there.” Moreover, the minister continued, migration in the valley was a routine practice. He also criticised the KP government’s performance, highlighting a lack of hospitals, schools and police stations in the valley. The minister claimed that there was a “complete absence of civilian law enforcement agencies” in Tirah. “There is no police station there,” he added. Asif further stated that hemp was being harvested in Tirah over 12,000 acres. Hemp harvested over each acre gave a profit of around Rs3-3.5 million, he said, adding that “this is a major factor” in this matter. He said that hemp had several uses, including in medicines, construction material and bricks. “Hemp is harvested there and dividends earned from it either go to the people associated with politics or the TTP. We have initiated measures to stop this, so that [Tirah’s] people benefit from this harvest, and schools and hospitals are constructed there,” Asif added. He went on to allege that the interests of the provincial government aligned with those of the TTP in Tirah, “as they are together exploiting this source (hemp)”. The minister recalled that the jirga in Tirah had held meetings on December 11, 21 and 31 last year on the matter. “It has been meeting the civilian government. You don’t see the military anywhere in this [matter]. And this jirga was constituted many years ago […] And all 24 members of the jirga are onboard. All the things that I have listed that are required there [Tirah], it is their ( jirga ) demand. Now, in the presence of the jirga and this notification, where do you see the military’s [involvement] in this?” Asif said. He alleged that the KP government wanted to deflect the blame for its “failures” to the military or an operation that did not even exist. Then, ostensibly referring to the movement of people in Tirah, he maintained that this “tradition has been in place for decades” due to the climate and topography of the area. It was even mentioned in a gazette from the British era, he added. “This transition takes place every year.” “This is nothing unusual, but the PTI government has tried to make it [appear] unusual,” he said. Moreover, the KP government had claimed spending Rs2-4bn on setting up camps for the evacuated residents, he said, alleging that those camps did not protect from the cold. He again asserted that the military presence or an operation in Tirah was an “assumption”. “No operation has been carried out there for years,” he maintained. He added that if the KP government wanted to work for the betterment of the people of Tirah, the federal government would provide it with the wherewithal needed for that purpose. Meanwhile, Information Minister Tarar said it was stated in the official gazetteer in the 1880s that the Afridi and Akakhel tribes of Khyber descended and migrated to other areas in winters and returned to Tirah in summers. “This is an established fact,” he insisted. For his part, PM’s aide Wali said it needed to be uncovered how much money from the Rs4bn package approved by the provincial government had reached the people who had been “forced to relocate”. “Because the PTI has been in power [in KP] for 13 years. They create such programmes and use these funds for campaigns such as street movements,” he alleged. Wali further highlighted that the KP government’s notification said that the movement of people from Tirah would be “voluntary”. “This proves my points that a project was created to mint money,” he argued, adding that the armed forces had nothing to do with the movement of people in Tirah. The PM’s aide said that to his understanding, the people of Tirah would be used to ensure the success of the opposition’s protest on February 8. Following that, a journalist sought confirmation of the number of people who had left Tirah, saying that international media had reported that 65 per cent had vacated their houses. To that, Asif said, “People escape the snowfall in the area and relocate. And more or less 65pc of the people migrate […] There is historical evidence of this. And this will continue to happen in the future as well”. He said that this matter had been “politicised”, asserting that an impression had been created as if “forced relocation” had been taking place in Tirah. “And it is being linked to us. Even if forced [relocation] is taking place, it is between the provincial government and the population. We or the military have nothing to do with it. “The military has been carrying out IBOs there and will continue to do so. As I said, there are around 500 TTP members there […] The military conducts IBOs and weeds them out,” he said. When asked about KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s claim that he had not been involved in talks with tribal elders from Tirah, Asif said: “This is his and his government’s problem. The talks were held with his government, and if he was not in the loop, that is not my problem or the problem of the federal government.” He also alleged that some TTP militants had been paying extortion money to some individuals in the KP government. In response to another question, he clarified that no operation was being carried out in Tirah. The minister was also asked whether the option of reversing the decision to merge erstwhile tribal areas with KP was being considered in a potential “next amendment”. Asif said no such proposal was being considered. Asked who formed the jirga that held talks regarding the evacuation of people from Tirah, Asif insisted that it was the provincial government. A journalist also pointed out to the government representatives that migration from Tirah had been taking place in late October or early November. “What migration is this that a man, along with his five children, goes towards his death?” he questioned. At that, Information Minister Tarar reasoned that it was due to the shift in weather patterns due to climate change. “Previously, there was no snowfall at the end of January. It used to start in November,” he said. ‘Injustice is being done’ Separately, KP CM Afridi also issued a video statement on the situation in Tirah, condemning a planned “military operation” in the valley and warning that “decisions taken behind closed doors have once again pushed the region toward instability, displacement and distrust”. The KP CM’s statement in Pashto was a repeat of his earlier rebuke of the Centre on the matter, in which he said that “people are being forcibly displaced due to a military operation, the decision for which was taken behind closed doors”. In his latest video statement, he said that “harsh conditions have once again been imposed on Tirah Valley”. The CM further recalled that after PTI founder Imran Khan was removed from power in 2022, “warnings were issued in Khyber, Hazara, Malakand, Dera Ismail Khan and Waziristan about terrorism and instability again being imposed on the Pashtun belt”. “Peace jirgas and public mobilisation campaigns were organised to alert the people that their future was being traded without their consent,” he added. He criticised the then-Pakistan Democratic Movement government for dismissing those warnings as “propaganda”, claiming that people came out in large numbers and rejected the “decisions taken behind closed doors”. Afridi said that presently, there was peace in the districts where the decisions were rejected, while terrorism had reared its head in areas where the warnings were ignored. “Decisions taken behind closed doors not just toppled a democratic government but also triggered the return of terrorism and economic collapse, forcing investors and young people to search for opportunities abroad,” he lamented. Referring specifically to Tirah, he said he had raised his voice against “imposing decisions” that were taken without the public consent and questioned the logic of launching another operation when “22 major and more than 14,000 IBOs had failed to eliminate terrorism”. The KP CM recalled that a jirga held at the KP Assembly had finalised a 15-point agenda. He said the jirga also unanimously agreed that a military operation was not a solution and that sustainable peace could only be achieved through dialogue and consensus. Despite that, he said, another “operation was being imposed”. The CM also claimed that the 24-member committee that was said to have held talks on a military operation in Tirah was headed by the corps commander and frontier corps inspector general. “Elders of the Afridi [tribe] were told to vacate their houses on the pretext of militants operating from residential areas. Despite people’s objections, they were forced to leave their homes during the harsh winter and amid snowfall. “And the world is now witnessing elderly people, women, and children being displaced in freezing conditions while the operation, too, cannot be carried out due to snowfall,” he said. In light of this, he raised questioned the purpose and wisdom behind the decision to conduct a military operation. The CM said that the operation was being launched to malign him and destablise his government. “But, the people continue to show me respect and support.” He also condemned the information ministry’s statement on the situation in Tirah, according to which the valley’s residents were leaving their homes voluntarily. The CM termed the statement “dangerous and an attempt to create conflict between the province and federal government and institutions”. It was also an attempt to “erode public trust in the leadership and state institutions”, he said. Afridi reiterated his announcement of holding a grand jirga of all tribes residing in Khyber on the coming Sunday at 2pm at Jamrud Football Stadium. He said displaced people will be asked at the meeting whether they had left their homes voluntarily or were forced to do so. “Then, the world will see that injustice is being done,” the CM remarked. He said that the people of KP were “not subjects to be experimented upon and their blood is not cheap”. Their dignity must be respected, he stressed. Afridi said his government had released Rs4bn for the displaced families, adding that previous military operations had resulted in the destruction of houses while promises of compensation to those affected also remained unfulfilled. The KP government was resolute that it would not abandon its people “in the face of decisions taken in secrecy”, he emphasised, reaffirming that he stood with the Pashtun people and would defend their rights till his last breath.",

      "summary_en": "PESHAWAR: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said that there was no question of a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tirah, insisting that migration was a routine practice in the valley. Asif made these remarks during a press conference in Islamabad, where he was flanked by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Information and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan. The press conference came two days after the federal and provincial governments traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of planned military action against terrorists. The evacuations, which were carried out in line with a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders — including local elders, the provincial government and the military — seem to have become a bone of contention after the displaced populace found themselves stranded in cold weather under open skies, with mismanagement by the authorities only adding to their troubles. At the outset of the press conference, the defence minister said members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had been residing in Tirah with their families. “They are around 400-500 in number,” he said. The defence minister further stated that the provincial government had approved a package of Rs4 billion for the people of Tirah, who were to migrate. “The armed forces deployed in that area have nothing to do with it. This is an arrangement between the jirga and the provincial government, and as a result of that, this notification was issued,” he added, holding up a notification that he said was issued by the KP government. On Sunday, the information ministry had also referred to the same notification by the KP Relief, Rehabilitation and Resettlement department for the release of funds, reportedly Rs4 billion, for the anticipated temporary and voluntary movement of the population from certain localities of Tirah (Bagh). These funds were seemingly required for relief-related arrangements for those leaving Tirah. The ministry also asserted that the armed forces or the federal government had not issued any orders for the “depopulation” of Tirah. During the press conference, Asif said that a military operation in the area had been carried out years ago. “And it was strategically decided then that intelligence-based operations (IBOs) are way more effective than operations; the collateral damage is way less. So, the armed forces have not carried out an operation in years in favour of IBOs,” he said. The minister added, “This is why this practice has been ongoing there for many years, and that is why there is no question of any operation there.” Moreover, the minister continued, migration in the valley was a routine practice. He also criticised the KP government’s performance, highlighting a lack of hospitals, schools and police stations in the valley. The minister claimed that there was a “complete absence of civilian law enforcement agencies” in Tirah. “There is no police station there,” he added. Asif further stated that hemp was being harvested in Tirah over 12,000 acres. Hemp harvested over each acre gave a profit of around Rs3-3.5 million, he said, adding that “this is a major factor” in this matter. He said that hemp had several uses, including in medicines, construction material and bricks. “Hemp is harvested there and dividends earned from it either go to the people associated with politics or the TTP. We have initiated measures to stop this, so that [Tirah’s] people benefit from this harvest, and schools and hospitals are constructed there,” Asif added. He went on to allege that the interests of the provincial government aligned with those of the TTP in Tirah, “as they are together exploiting this source (hemp)”. The minister recalled that the jirga in Tirah had held meetings on December 11, 21 and 31 last year on the matter. “It has been meeting the civilian government. You don’t see the military anywhere in this [matter]. And this jirga was constituted many years ago […] And all 24 members of the jirga are onboard. All the things that I have listed that are required there [Tirah], it is their ( jirga ) demand. Now, in the presence of the jirga and this notification, where do you see the military’s [involvement] in this?” Asif said. He alleged that the KP government wanted to deflect the blame for its “failures” to the military or an operation that did not even exist. Then, ostensibly referring to the movement of people in Tirah, he maintained that this “tradition has been in place for decades” due to the climate and topography of the area. It was even mentioned in a gazette from the British era, he added. “This transition takes place every year.” “This is nothing unusual, but the PTI government has tried to make it [appear] unusual,” he said. Moreover, the KP government had claimed spending Rs2-4bn on setting up camps for the evacuated residents, he said, alleging that those camps did not protect from the cold. He again asserted that the military presence or an operation in Tirah was an “assumption”. “No operation has been carried out there for years,” he maintained. He added that if the KP government wanted to work for the betterment of the people of Tirah, the federal government would provide it with the wherewithal needed for that purpose. Meanwhile, Information Minister Tarar said it was stated in the official gazetteer in the 1880s that the Afridi and Akakhel tribes of Khyber descended and migrated to other areas in winters and returned to Tirah in summers. “This is an established fact,” he insisted. For his part, PM’s aide Wali said it needed to be uncovered how much money from the Rs4bn package approved by the provincial government had reached the people who had been “forced to relocate”. “Because the PTI has been in power [in KP] for 13 years. They create such programmes and use these funds for campaigns such as street movements,” he alleged. Wali further highlighted that the KP government’s notification said that the movement of people from Tirah would be “voluntary”. “This proves my points that a project was created to mint money,” he argued, adding that the armed forces had nothing to do with the movement of people in Tirah. The PM’s aide said that to his understanding, the people of Tirah would be used to ensure the success of the opposition’s protest on February 8. Following that, a journalist sought confirmation of the number of people who had left Tirah, saying that international media had reported that 65 per cent had vacated their houses. To that, Asif said, “People escape the snowfall in the area and relocate. And more or less 65pc of the people migrate […] There is historical evidence of this. And this will continue to happen in the future as well”. He said that this matter had been “politicised”, asserting that an impression had been created as if “forced relocation” had been taking place in Tirah. “And it is being linked to us. Even if forced [relocation] is taking place, it is between the provincial government and the population. We or the military have nothing to do with it. “The military has been carrying out IBOs there and will continue to do so. As I said, there are around 500 TTP members there […] The military conducts IBOs and weeds them out,” he said. When asked about KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s claim that he had not been involved in talks with tribal elders from Tirah, Asif said: “This is his and his government’s problem. The talks were held with his government, and if he was not in the loop, that is not my problem or the problem of the federal government.” He also alleged that some TTP militants had been paying extortion money to some individuals in the KP government. In response to another question, he clarified that no operation was being carried out in Tirah. The minister was also asked whether the option of reversing the decision to merge erstwhile tribal areas with KP was being considered in a potential “next amendment”. Asif said no such proposal was being considered. Asked who formed the jirga that held talks regarding the evacuation of people from Tirah, Asif insisted that it was the provincial government. A journalist also pointed out to the government representatives that migration from Tirah had been taking place in late October or early November. “What migration is this that a man, along with his five children, goes towards his death?” he questioned. At that, Information Minister Tarar reasoned that it was due to the shift in weather patterns due to climate change. “Previously, there was no snowfall at the end of January. It used to start in November,” he said. ‘Injustice is being done’ Separately, KP CM Afridi also issued a video statement on the situation in Tirah, condemning a planned “military operation” in the valley and warning that “decisions taken behind closed doors have once again pushed the region toward instability, displacement and distrust”. The KP CM’s statement in Pashto was a repeat of his earlier rebuke of the Centre on the matter, in which he said that “people are being forcibly displaced due to a military operation, the decision for which was taken behind closed doors”. In his latest video statement, he said that “harsh conditions have once again been imposed on Tirah Valley”. The CM further recalled that after PTI founder Imran Khan was removed from power in 2022, “warnings were issued in Khyber, Hazara, Malakand, Dera Ismail Khan and Waziristan about terrorism and instability again being imposed on the Pashtun belt”. “Peace jirgas and public mobilisation campaigns were organised to alert the people that their future was being traded without their consent,” he added.

      "title_orig": "Atomic scientists set ‘Doomsday Clock’ closer to midnight than ever",
      "summary_orig": "Atomic scientists set their “Doomsday Clock” on Tuesday closer than ever to midnight, citing aggressive behaviour by nuclear powers Russia, China and the United States, fraying nuclear arms control, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and artificial intelligence (AI) worries among factors driving risks for global disaster. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the clock to 85 seconds before midnight, the theoretical point of annihilation. That is four seconds closer than it was set last year. The Chicago-based nonprofit created the clock in 1947 during the Cold War tensions that followed World War Two to warn the public about how close humankind was to destroying the world. The scientists voiced concern about threats of unregulated integration of AI into military systems and its potential misuse in aiding the creation of biological threats, as well as its role in spreading disinformation globally. They also noted continuing challenges posed by climate change. “Of course, the Doomsday Clock is about global risks, and what we have seen is a global failure in leadership,” nuclear policy expert Alexandra Bell, the Bulletin’s president and CEO, told Reuters . “No matter the government, a shift towards neo-imperialism and an Orwellian approach to governance will only serve to push the clock toward midnight.” It was the third time in the past four years that the scientists moved the clock closer to midnight. “In terms of nuclear risks, nothing in 2025 trended in the right direction,” Bell said. “Longstanding diplomatic frameworks are under duress or collapsing, the threat of explosive nuclear testing has returned, proliferation concerns are growing, and there were three military operations taking place under the shadow of nuclear weapons and the associated escalatory threat. The risk of nuclear use is unsustainably and unacceptably high.” Bell pointed to Russia’s continued war in Ukraine, the US and Israeli bombing of Iran and border clashes between India and Pakistan. Bell also cited continuing tensions in Asia, including on the Korean Peninsula and China’s threats toward Taiwan, as well as rising tensions in the Western Hemisphere since US President Donald Trump returned to office 12 months ago. The last remaining nuclear arms pact between the United States and Russia, the New START treaty, expires on February 5. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that the two countries agree to observe for another year the limits set under the pact, which caps each side’s number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550. Trump has not formally responded. Western security analysts are divided about the wisdom of accepting Putin’s offer. Trump in October ordered the US military to restart the process for testing nuclear weapons after a halt of more than three decades. No nuclear power, other than North Korea, most recently in 2017, has conducted explosive nuclear testing in more than a quarter-century. No country would benefit more from a full-scale return to such testing than China, given its continued push to expand its nuclear arsenal, according to Bell, a former senior official at the US State Department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability. ‘Aggressive and nationalistic’ Trump has upended the world order. He sent US forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, threatened other Latin American countries, vowed to restore US dominance in the Western Hemisphere, talked about annexing Greenland and imperilled transatlantic security cooperation. Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and there is no end in sight. Among the weapons Russia has used is the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile. Russia released a video in December of what it said was the deployment of the Oreshnik in Belarus, a move meant to boost the Russian ability to strike targets across Europe. “Russia, China, the United States and other major countries have become increasingly aggressive and nationalistic,” Bell said. Their “winner-takes-all great power competition” undermines the international cooperation needed to reduce risks of nuclear war, climate change, misuse of biotechnology, potential AI-related hazards and other apocalyptic dangers, Bell said. Bell also cited Trump’s domestic actions against science, academia, the civil service and news organisations. Maria Ressa, a 2021 Nobel Peace Prize recipient for her journalistic efforts exposing abuses of power in the Philippines, including how social media platforms were used to spread disinformation, participated in the announcement. “We are living through an information Armageddon — the crisis beneath all crises - driven by extractive and predatory technology that spreads lies faster than facts and profits from our division,” Ressa said in a statement. The Bulletin was founded in 1945 by scientists, including Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer.",

No country would benefit more from a full-scale return to such testing than China, given its continued push to expand its nuclear arsenal, according to Bell, a former senior official at the US State Department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability. ‘Aggressive and nationalistic’ Trump has upended the world order. He sent US forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, threatened other Latin American countries, vowed to restore US dominance in the Western Hemisphere, talked about annexing Greenland and imperilled transatlantic security cooperation. Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and there is no end in sight. Among the weapons Russia has used is the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile. Russia released a video in December of what it said was the deployment of the Oreshnik in Belarus, a move meant to boost the Russian ability to strike targets across Europe. “Russia, China, the United States and other major countries have become increasingly aggressive and nationalistic,” Bell said. Their “winner-takes-all great power competition” undermines the international cooperation needed to reduce risks of nuclear war, climate change, misuse of biotechnology, potential AI-related hazards and other apocalyptic dangers, Bell said. Bell also cited Trump’s domestic actions against science, academia, the civil service and news organisations. Maria Ressa, a 2021 Nobel Peace Prize recipient for her journalistic efforts exposing abuses of power in the Philippines, including how social media platforms were used to spread disinformation, participated in the announcement. “We are living through an information Armageddon — the crisis beneath all crises - driven by extractive and predatory technology that spreads lies faster than facts and profits from our division,” Ressa said in a statement. The Bulletin was founded in 1945 by scientists, including Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer.",
      "title": "Atomic scientists set ‘Doomsday Clock’ closer to midnight than ever",
      "summary": "Atomic scientists set their “Doomsday Clock” on Tuesday closer than ever to midnight, citing aggressive behaviour by nuclear powers Russia, China and the United States, fraying nuclear arms control, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and artificial intelligence (AI) worries among factors driving risks for global disaster. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the clock to 85 seconds before midnight, the theoretical point of annihilation. That is four seconds closer than it was set last year. The Chicago-based nonprofit created the clock in 1947 during the Cold War tensions that followed World War Two to warn the public about how close humankind was to destroying the world. The scientists voiced concern about threats of unregulated integration of AI into military systems and its potential misuse in aiding the creation of biological threats, as well as its role in spreading disinformation globally. They also noted continuing challenges posed by climate change. “Of course, the Doomsday Clock is about global risks, and what we have seen is a global failure in leadership,” nuclear policy expert Alexandra Bell, the Bulletin’s president and CEO, told Reuters . “No matter the government, a shift towards neo-imperialism and an Orwellian approach to governance will only serve to push the clock toward midnight.” It was the third time in the past four years that the scientists moved the clock closer to midnight. “In terms of nuclear risks, nothing in 2025 trended in the right direction,” Bell said. “Longstanding diplomatic frameworks are under duress or collapsing, the threat of explosive nuclear testing has returned, proliferation concerns are growing, and there were three military operations taking place under the shadow of nuclear weapons and the associated escalatory threat. The risk of nuclear use is unsustainably and unacceptably high.” Bell pointed to Russia’s continued war in Ukraine, the US and Israeli bombing of Iran and border clashes between India and Pakistan. Bell also cited continuing tensions in Asia, including on the Korean Peninsula and China’s threats toward Taiwan, as well as rising tensions in the Western Hemisphere since US President Donald Trump returned to office 12 months ago. The last remaining nuclear arms pact between the United States and Russia, the New START treaty, expires on February 5. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that the two countries agree to observe for another year the limits set under the pact, which caps each side’s number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550. Trump has not formally responded. Western security analysts are divided about the wisdom of accepting Putin’s offer. Trump in October ordered the US military to restart the process for testing nuclear weapons after a halt of more than three decades. No nuclear power, other than North Korea, most recently in 2017, has conducted explosive nuclear testing in more than a quarter-century. No country would benefit more from a full-scale return to such testing than China, given its continued push to expand its nuclear arsenal, according to Bell, a former senior official at the US State Department’s Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability. ‘Aggressive and nationalistic’ Trump has upended the world order.

      "summary_orig": "A US naval strike force led by an aircraft carrier was in Middle Eastern waters on Tuesday as Iran vowed to hit back against any strike and President Donald Trump said he believed the Islamic republic still wanted talks. Washington has not ruled out new military intervention against Tehran over its crackdown on protests, which saw over 3,000 killed within days, according to Iranian media. A strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln has now arrived in Middle Eastern waters, US Central Command said, without revealing its precise location. Since Iran earlier this month launched the crackdown on protests accompanied by a blanket internet blackout , Trump has given mixed signals on intervention. “We have a big armada next to Iran. Bigger than Venezuela,” Trump told the Axios news site, weeks after US military action resulted in the capture of the Latin American nation’s president Nicolas Maduro. But he added: “They want to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions. They want to talk.” Axios said Trump declined to discuss the options presented to him by his national security team, or which one he prefers. Analysts say options include strikes on military facilities or targeted hits against the leadership under Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in a full-scale bid to bring down the system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 revolution that ousted the shah. ‘Weakest point’ The New York Times , meanwhile, reported that Trump has received multiple US intelligence reports “indicating that the Iranian government’s position is weakening” and signalling its hold on power “is at its weakest point” since the shah’s fall. US Senator Lindsey Graham told the paper he had spoken with Trump in recent days about Iran and that “the goal is to end the regime”. “They may stop killing them today, but if they’re in charge next month, they’ll kill them then,” he added. Iranian officials have over the last days appeared wary of pouring oil on the fire. Tehran has in the past said a channel of communication is open between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US envoy Steve Witkoff, despite the lack of diplomatic relations between the two foes. But the Hamshahri conservative newspaper on Tuesday quoted Revolutionary Guards spokesman Mohammad Ali Naini as saying that “if their aircraft carrier made a mistake and entered Iranian territorial waters, it would be targeted”. The conservative Javan newspaper said Iran was “ready for a major response” and would seize the strategic Strait of Hormuz , a key transit hub for energy supplies. Meanwhile, an anti-US billboard has appeared in Tehran that appears to show an American aircraft carrier being destroyed. ‘Mass arrests, intimidation’ Rights groups have described the crackdown as the deadliest ever against protests in Iran and warn compiling tolls has been complicated by an almost three-week internet blackout that they say is aimed at masking the extent of the repression. A statement by Iran’s foundation for veterans and martyrs, cited by state television, has said 3,117 people were killed during protests which first erupted in late December. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has claimed that thousands of people have been arrested. “Security agencies continue to pursue an approach centred on mass arrests, intimidation, and control of the narrative,” HRANA said. Activists have accused authorities of raiding hospitals to find injured protesters and then arresting them. The health ministry has said all people should present themselves at hospital without worry and not treat themselves at home.",

      "title_orig": "Sindh govt denies MQM claims of withdrawing official security",
      "summary_orig": "The Sindh government on Tuesday denied claims made by factions of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) that the provincial administration has withdrawn personnel deployed for the latter’s security. The MQM-Pakistan (MQM-P) and the PPP have been engaged in a war of words since the Gul Plaza inferno, trading blame over improper governance during the tenure of their respective party mayors. Speaking to Geo News earlier today, MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal replied in the affirmative when asked whether he was among the MQM leaders whose security protocol had reportedly been withdrawn by the Sindh government. The MQM-P leader, who also serves as the federal health minister, insisted that the action was “in response” to his party’s criticism of the Sindh government and to “scare them”. Instead, Kamal argued, the provincial government’s alleged action supported the MQM-P’s stance that Karachi be “taken in the Centre’s control”. “Karachi should not be in control of an incompetent provincial government like Sindh’s,” he said, adding the Sindh government could not “suppress our voices” by taking these measures. He went on to say that the provision of security did not matter to them. However, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon and Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar rejected the MQM-P’s claims, with the latter stating that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked. The MQM-Haqiqi (MQM-H) had also said the Sindh government has withdrawn security from party chairman Afaq Ahmed. In a statement, MQM-H Vice Chairman Shaukat Farooqi condemned the alleged move, saying it indicated that the PPP was afraid of Ahmed. ‘Sindh govt stepping back from responsibility’ Addressing a press conference in Karachi after the Sindh government’s denial, MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar said, “You withdrew security. Even if some individuals’ security was restored, then also restore whatever little security you had given as a formality to our MNAs and MPAs.” Stressing that it was the Sindh government’s responsibility to provide security, Sattar said, “If you would not provide, then we will ask the Islamabad police and the prime minister to send their police. “And then gradually make this a federal territory,” he added, reiterating his party’s demand. The MQM-P leader contended that by revoking the security of “all” its MNAs and MPAs, including party convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, the Sindh government was distancing itself from its duties. He stressed that it was the Sindh Police that had alerted them about a threat to their lives, and the same provincial government was stepping back from the responsibility to guarantee their security. “Then this means someone will have to take responsibility. Should we then ask Islamabad Police to provide us security?” Sattar said. ‘Those entitled have security’ In a statement, the Sindh home minister clarified that security has not been withdrawn from any MQM leaders. He stated that Kamal, the federal health minister, and Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui were currently in Islamabad, adding that no security granted to any political figure has been revoked. Lanjar added that security arrangements for political leaders, including those from the MQM, will continue unchanged. Speaking to reporters later in the day, the Sindh senior minister also dismissed the MQM-P’s claims. “The home minister has categorically told the media that no security has been withdrawn from MQM,” Memon asserted, saying that the party was engaged in “propaganda” and a “campaign”. The minister clarified that even Sindh Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi still has the security allotted to him. “Whoever is entitled to it, they all have security,” Memon said, adding that those not entitled, needed to submit a request to the government along with their reasons. “Federal ministers in Islamabad roam around with a single police official. Here, they have been allotted 10 police personnel each. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui has 10 police officers; Mustafa Kamal may have more than that.” He also noted that MQM-P leaders who were federal ministers — namely Kamal and Siddiqui — were in Islamabad as per his reports. “So, did you have to take the security along with you?” he asked rhetorically. Earlier in the day, Sindh government spokesperson MPA Sadia Javed told Geo News that she was unaware of any such move to withdraw security, adding that it might have been done due to “shortage of police”. Replying to a question on the disruption of proceedings in the Sindh Assembly, which witnessed a protest on Monday and slogans on Tuesday as well, Memon said protesting was the right of everyone in a democracy. “Opposition can protest, if they want,” he told reporters. Memon raised multiple questions, asking why the MQM-P did not protest after the May 12, 2007 mayhem , the Bolton market blaze and the Baldia factory tragedy . The Sindh senior minister stated: We are not saying them [MQM-P] not to [protest] .. it. We are democratic people. Everything that comes under democracy is allowed. “However, if they opt for undemocratic practices, the government will not sit idle,” he added, calling for the protests to be “peaceful”. “We will support them. However, if they opt for old tactics of … [forcefully] closing shops, … shooting in the city, this time our mood is different,” he said, adding that the government would prioritise the public’s safety if the MQM-P attempted to stage a strike or engage in arson or vandalism. “When this incident (Gul Plaza fire) occurred, everyone was teary-eyed … but the attitude of certain parties … the bodies were not even recovered and calls were made to roll back the 18th Amendment and hand over Karachi to the Centre,” Memon said. In the wake of the Gul Plaza inferno, which has claimed at least 73 lives , the MQM-P demanded that Karachi be made a “federal territory” by making it the country’s “financial capital”. It also assailed the 18th Amendment, which devolved certain ministries to the provinces from the Centre, and claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage” of it. In response, the PPP has assailed the MQM-P for “ politicising ” the Gul Plaza fire. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah detailed the shopping centre’s history, noting former mayors had approved leases to regularise building violations.",

The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno , which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need to empower local governments (LGs) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) even demanding that Karachi be made a “federal territory”. “The solution to Karachi’s issues is not provincial or federal control. According to the Constitution, the solution is Karachi city government,” the JI chief said while addressing a press conference in the metropolis. Rehman made the case for better local governance by citing Istanbul as an example: “Istanbul’s local governance has its master plan, fire brigade, construction, transportation, water, sewage, education and employment under its jurisdiction.” “This is real governance, not KDA (Karachi Development Authority) or SBCA (Sindh Building Control Authority),” he said, adding that “development cannot result from this”. “This is why a city government is the only solution here — a government that is empowered and represented by an elected official,” he said, alleging that the mayorship was “stolen from JI”. In June 2023, Murtaza Wahab was elected as the first PPP mayor of Karachi, after much controversy, recriminations and protests. During his presser, the JI chief also announced a march on February 1, titled “ Jeenay dou Karachi ko ” (let Karachi live) — on Sharea Faisal, expressing optimism that “it will give young people hope”. “At the march, we will outline our plans,” he said, stressing that “we must free the city from mafia and feudal lords”. He said that the “JI stood with young people of the country — Generation Z”. The JI chief reiterated that the “people’s mandate should be respected, and the city governance plan should be implemented”. He also demanded that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah step down and take accountability for his government’s “incompetence”. Growing calls for local government Last week, the National Assembly echoed with calls for strengthening LGs as lawmakers stressed the need for reforms in the wake of the Gul Plaza fire. The deadly inferno , which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished , has claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins. Only 23 of the deceased have been identified so far . While the first information report (FIR) of the incident has said the blaze was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”, no identified individuals have been nominated so far. The Karachi police on Monday formed a special team make “ all-out efforts ” to arrest suspects. In the NA, MQM-P leader Dr Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units” and for powers to be “handed over” to the mayor, town chairman, and union council chairman. Besides members of the MQM-P, PML-N’s Khawaja Asif has also favoured strengthening LGs for better city administration. Speaking on the floor of the NA last week, Asif called for providing people “representation in their own neighbourhoods”. Days later, he also lamented that LGs continued to be neglected by political parties, ultimately weakening civilian rule.",
