The hearing took place at the Seoul Central District Court behind closed doors, with Yoon, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun and Yeo In-hyung, former head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command, in attendance. Yoon and the two others have been indicted on charges of aiding the enemy in connection to the alleged drone dispatch to North Korea's capital in October 2024. Special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team believes the alleged dispatch was aimed at inciting the North's retaliation, which could then be used as a pretext for Yoon's martial law declaration two months later. The team charged Yoon with \"benefiting the enemy in general,\" based on its judgment that the drone dispatch led to the leak of military secrets to the North when they allegedly crashed near Pyongyang. The court's bench said it would decide every session whether to proceed with the trial behind closed doors, citing state secrets",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari on Monday refuted claims by PTI leaders that different and unrelated videos were submitted for a forensic report about the May 9, 2023 riots. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident. “There are two separate videos [of KP CM] and they should not be confused. One of the videos must be from Zaman Park. However, the other one showing [him] vandalising and lighting fire has been deleted [from the social media account],” she said while addressing a press conference in Lahore. “When KP chief minister realised that an effort to rebellion which he termed as revolution failed, he deleted the videos [of May 9, 2023] from social media. However, the videos remained in the record,” said Bokhari. She further claimed their destination was the Corps Commander House, located very close to the Radio Pakistan building. However, they were denied entry there, so they entered the state media building, vandalised it, set fire, and destroyed the records there. In response to the conviction of identified suspects in May 9 cases, she said those involved in cases in Punjab have been convicted and they were serving their sentences in prison. “We don‘t have any political revenge against anyone,” she said, adding the cases on PML-N leadership in PTI’s tenure were politically motivated. Speaking on the PTI’s call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, the information minister said they planned a “new programme of anarchy to subjugate the state and make the law subservient to them, which cannot be made possible”. The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted. At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage. Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.",

      "summary_orig": "While Iran has grappled with widespread deadly protests for the past two weeks, Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, has once again emerged as an anti-government figurehead. The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, before turning against the authorities in Iran, who have governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. However, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States. Pahlavi has urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement. He has also hinted at his plans to return to Iran at a time that he believed was “very near”. He has even requested US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to get involved if force is used on protesters, to “be ready to intervene to help the people of Iran”. So what links does Pahlavi have to Iran’s history, and what are the stakes for him in establishing a role in the ongoing crisis? Born in Tehran on Oct 31, 1960, as the heir to the late Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza and Empress Farah Pahlavi, Reza Pahlavi was officially named crown prince at the age of seven. He has lived in exile since his father was ousted by the 1979 revolution , a year before he died. Iran’s ousted late shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. — photo courtesy Pahlavi Centenary As per his website , Pahlavi left Iran for jet fighter training in the United States Air Force in 1978. “During this same period, the building unrest in Iran led to the royal family’s departure in January 1979,” his website says about his father’s ouster. Pahlavi completed his higher education with a degree in political science from the University of Southern California. He volunteered to serve Iran’s military as a fighter pilot during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, but was declined by the Islamic regime. Pahlavi married Yasmine Etemad-Amini on June 12, 1986. They have three daughters (all of whom he has named as his heirs successively): Noor Pahlavi (born April 3, 1992), Iman Pahlavi (born Sept 12, 1993), and Farah Pahlavi (born Jan 17, 2004). The late shah’s heir has also authored three books: Gozashteh va Ayandeh (Kayhan Publishing, 2000); Winds of Change: The Future of Democracy in Iran (Regnery, 2002); and Iran: L’Heure du Choix [ Iran: The Deciding Hour ] (Denoël, 2009). Ties outside Iran Pahlavi’s website highlights that he remains in touch with “opposition groups, both inside and outside” Iran, and advocates for the establishment of a secular democracy in the country. “He calls for regime change through non-violent civil disobedience, and for a free and open referendum on a new government of Iran,” the website reads. While Iran and Israel are arch-enemies under the current regime, they both enjoyed warmer ties under Pahlavi’s father. In October last year, Israeli-funded online campaigns in the Persian language used fake social media personas and AI to boost Pahlavi’s image and destabilise the Iranian regime, parallel investigations by Israeli newspapers and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab found. During the 12-day Iran-Israel war last year, Pahlavi urged Khamenei to step down “for the sake of the Iranian people”. In a similar fashion, during the ongoing protests, the late shah’s son called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag , which protesters briefly succeeded in doing so in London.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Six cops were martyred in a blast in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank district on Monday when an improvised explosive device (IED) targeted their armoured vehicle, the local police said. “Six policemen were martyred in the IED blast,” said a statement from the Tank police spokesperson, adding that their armoured personnel carrier (APC) was targeted within the jurisdiction of the Gomal police station. “The blast occurred while the APC was on its way to Tank from the Gomal police station,” the statement added. The martyred included an additional station house officer (SHO), the police spokesperson said. The bodies were taken to the Tank District Headquarters Hospital by Rescue 1122. Police have sealed off the area and a “massive” security operation was underway, state-run APP reported. PM Shehbaz orders probe Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered an “immediate investigation” into the incident and directed that those responsible be brought to justice at the earliest, according to state-run Radio Pakistan . The premier reaffirmed the government’s commitment to completely eradicate terrorism from the country. President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed his deep grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the “terrorist attack”, a statement from his office said. He paid tribute to the cops’ “bravery and their passion to serve the country”. The president prayed for the martyrs’ elevated ranks and for patience for their families. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought an immediate report from the top police officials on the incident, a statement from his office said. He expressed his deep grief and anger, conveying his condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs. “The brave men of KP police embraced martyrdom to protect the lives and property of the people,” Kundi was quoted as saying, adding that he was proud of the martyrs. “These actions by Indian-backed Fitna al Khwarij cannot dampen our morale,” the governor asserted. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The KP governor urged the PTI-run provincial government to “take practical steps to ensure peace in the province”. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also strongly condemned the attack and hailed the sacrifices of “five policemen”. “The courageous men of the police sacrificed their today for the nation’s peaceful tomorrow,” Naqvi was quoted as saying by his ministry. “The great sacrifices of the martyrs will always be remembered,” he added. Recent attacks on LEAs Law enforcement personnel have increasingly come under attack in KP in recent weeks. On January 10, a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another CTD official was gunned down in Bannu. The day before, a policeman was martyred after gunmen attacked him in the Bajaur tribal district, while another died in Khyber when gunmen ambushed a car. Three cops were injured in Bannu on January 8 as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists”. Also in Bannu, a former tehsil nazim was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on January 6. Last month in December, five policemen were martyred when a police vehicle was ambushed in KP’s Karak district. Eight terrorists were killed in an operation launched to hunt down the attackers. On December 1, a head constable lost his life and five cops were injured in Lakki Marwat when a suicide bo­mber targeted a police vehicle. The same day, a police constable was gunned down by terrorists in Bannu.",

      "title_orig": "Trump weighing tough response to Iran crackdown on protesters; Tehran says ready for war but also dialogue",
      "summary_orig": "Iran is fully prepared for conflict but also ready for negotiations, its foreign minister said on Monday, as US President Donald Trump said the Iranian leadership was seeking talks after he threatened to intervene militarily over a crackdown on protests and that he was weighing a range of strong responses. The escalating protests in Iran, which began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, now pose one of the biggest challenges to the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Trump has warned Iran’s leaders that the United States would attack if security forces open fire on protesters, while Iranian authorities have accused the US and Israel of fomenting unrest. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Trump said the US may meet Iranian officials and was in contact with the opposition, as he weighed a range of strong responses, including military options, to the protests . He said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the US bombed in a 12-day war in June. “The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.” However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“. Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a US official told Reuters on Sunday. The Wall Street Journal has reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources. “The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options,” Trump told reporters. Following his statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on Monday that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“. “We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he said. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf earlier warned Washington against “a miscalculation.” “Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards. Near paralysis In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis. The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse. There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown. One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy. The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States. State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel. Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests. After three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday.

Trump says he will talk to Musk about restoring internet in Iran​ Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days. “He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.

Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’ The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic. “Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media. Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag. “The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said. In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah. The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations. The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.",

      "summary_en": "Iran is fully prepared for conflict but also ready for negotiations, its foreign minister said on Monday, as US President Donald Trump said the Iranian leadership was seeking talks after he threatened to intervene militarily over a crackdown on protests and that he was weighing a range of strong responses. The escalating protests in Iran, which began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, now pose one of the biggest challenges to the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Trump has warned Iran’s leaders that the United States would attack if security forces open fire on protesters, while Iranian authorities have accused the US and Israel of fomenting unrest. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Trump said the US may meet Iranian officials and was in contact with the opposition, as he weighed a range of strong responses, including military options, to the protests . He said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the US bombed in a 12-day war in June. “The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.” However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“. Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a US official told Reuters on Sunday. The Wall Street Journal has reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources. “The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options,” Trump told reporters. Following his statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on Monday that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“. “We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he said. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf earlier warned Washington against “a miscalculation.” “Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards. Near paralysis In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis. The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse. There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown. One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy. The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States. State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel. Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests. After three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday.

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Monday that the Sindh government had not upheld the honour of the ajrak and topi and criticised its treatment of its “guests”. The chief minister is currently on a visit to Karachi, where he staged a rally at the Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday. In an address to the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi on Monday, Afridi thanked all the SHCBA members for their warm welcome and generous hospitality, adding that people from all over Pakistan — including Pashtuns, Kashmiris, Balochis — of every school of thought were present there. In contrast to this welcome from the public, however, he decried the provincial government’s treatment of him and his guests in Karachi, saying that they had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi . “I think every Sindhi will fully condemn this,” he said amid an outcry of support from the crowd. The KP CM also criticised the fact that the constitution and law were being “toyed with,” saying that it was not only damaging institutions but the whole of Pakistan. “On one hand, they are selling our national assets — they auctioned PIA on OLX,” he said, referring to the recent auction of the national airline. “But here they have sold justice.” Afridi added that the general public at least had hope that the judiciary would provide them justice and stand with them. He said that, although three judges in Islamabad had issued an order that he be allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, “the jail superintendent picks up this order and throws it away”. “We are accused of protest politics,” he added. “But our Constitution allows us to do this, so we will do protest politics.” He further claimed that the judiciary was not cooperating with the party, adding that he had called the chief justice repeatedly but received no answer. “We are being put against the wall, so the only way left is for us to protest,” he said. The chief minister affirmed that he would always stand beside those who turned out in support of the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, saying, “We have to fight for our rights ourselves … we will not get freedom on a plate. “If we do not raise our voice, then more pressure will be put on us.” Afridi further said that the passport of one province’s chief minister had been blocked, saying that the people of the province were being discriminated against. However, he added that his leader, Imran, had always supported peaceful struggle. Regarding the economy, the KP CM said that it was facing a very bad situation, with people “fleeing” Pakistan while unemployment had risen to 7.1 per cent. “These people are building their properties abroad,” he said, adding, “These people are bound to answer to us and one day it will definitely happen”. The chief minister told the crowd that he had come to Karachi as his [Imran] leader had directed him to call for a street movement and that he hoped for “full support” from them. Expressing his thanks, he said, “I hope the rule of law will come to Pakistan one day.” ‘No Section 144 can stop us’: Salman Akram Raja Addressing the ceremony, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said, “We talk about the constitution, we talk about the law, this is our job. No section 144 can stop us”. “Today, our rights are being attacked again and again,” said the PTI general secretary. He stressed that the “living Constitution and law” must be restored. Raja also said that Karachi’s vote had been robbed “in an attempt to take away the rights of the people”. The PTI leader said that whenever the Constitution had been attacked, the SHC had been the first to raise its voice. “The Pakistani nation is alive, due to which the chief minister of KP has been elected,” he said. “If the vote is stolen in front of you, if the judiciary is attacked, how can we remain silent? We are an alive and proud people, we have to fight for our rights.” He added, “This country was not made for the elite. This country is a country of farmers, no matter which province they are from“. “We stand like a lead wall against oppression.” SHCBA President Jamali says lawyers will participate ‘fully’ in KP convention President of the High Court Bar Muhammad Haseeb Jamali, addressing the event, called Sindh a land of peace. “Along with peace, this land also belongs to those who have raised their voice against oppression,” he said. The president stressed that the bar would talk about its rights as it was independent and did not belong to any party. He added that every citizen of this country held equal opportunities under the law. Jamali further said that lawyers of the bar had protested the 26th Amendment, the 27th Amendment and the issue of Karoonjhar as they happened. “We are not part of any revenge politics, nor do we support it.” “Hold a convention in KP — we will participate in it fully,” he said. “This Pakistan is dear to all of us. Lawyers built the country; lawyers will save it,” he added. ‘Only want supremacy of Constitution’: Amir Nawaz Warraich Sindh Bar Council Member and head of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) Amir Nawaz Warraich, also addressed the ceremony, welcoming all those present. He said that when any bad time came about, the bar association raised its voice against it. “Whenever there is talk of supremacy of law and putting a curb on the Constitution, we raise our voice,” he said. “We do not support any party but only want the supremacy of the Constitution.” Warraich added that the KBA would continue to protest against the recently passed Constitutional Amendment until the Constitution was restored to its rightful form. Visit to Mazar-i-Quaid Earlier during the day, the KP chief minister paid a visit to the Quaid‘s Mazar, where he had also criticised the Sindh government’s treatment of the PTI delegation.* Speaking to the media, he called Sindhis a “proud nation” and said that the imposition of “such people” on a proud nation was a cruelty. “Punjab’s false government also did this; Sindh’s false government also did this,” he said. However, he said that the people of Pakistan were respectable and proud, and always treated the guests from any province with respect. “This is not even one per cent of Pakistan that does such actions,” he said. “The remaining 99pc of the Pakistani nation is extremely proud, brave, courageous and hospitable.” Salman Akram Raja also spoke to reporters at the mausoleum, saying that after “three excellent days” in Karachi, they had seen the public’s “love for democracy, for Imran Khan and for human rights” as well as the force of the state, including its refusal to allow them to hold a rally even after gaining permission. “This is all a part of Pakistan,” he said. “We are fighting for a beautiful Pakistan, for the realisation of the Quaid’s dream for Pakistan under Imran Khan’s leadership. “Today, we have come to renew our pledge that we will create that Pakistan.”",

However, he said that the people of Pakistan were respectable and proud, and always treated the guests from any province with respect. “This is not even one per cent of Pakistan that does such actions,” he said. “The remaining 99pc of the Pakistani nation is extremely proud, brave, courageous and hospitable.” Salman Akram Raja also spoke to reporters at the mausoleum, saying that after “three excellent days” in Karachi, they had seen the public’s “love for democracy, for Imran Khan and for human rights” as well as the force of the state, including its refusal to allow them to hold a rally even after gaining permission. “This is all a part of Pakistan,” he said. “We are fighting for a beautiful Pakistan, for the realisation of the Quaid’s dream for Pakistan under Imran Khan’s leadership. “Today, we have come to renew our pledge that we will create that Pakistan.”",

      "summary_orig": "For Komeil Soheili, an Iranian filmmaker, the latest protests in the Islamic Republic did not come as a surprise. “People are exhausted after the 12-day war with Israel,” he said over the phone. “It’s the uncertainty. You can’t even plan for the near future because things keep changing.” Iran is buckling under mounting economic pressure. Inflation has exceeded 36 per cent since March . The rial has lost roughly half its value, trading at around 1,390,000 to the US dollar . Sanctions linked to Iran’s nuclear programme have returned, utilities remain strained, and global financial bodies are forecasting a recession in 2026 . Unrest, at the worst possible time Iran’s most significant protests since 2022 erupted around two weeks ago among traders and shopkeepers in downtown Tehran, triggered by the rapid collapse of the rial, which has driven up prices and left traders unable to restock goods. Isolated market shutdowns in Tehran’s commercial districts quickly escalated into street demonstrations, drawing in wider sections of the public and prompting security deployments. Like falling dominoes, the unrest spread to other cities, claiming dozens of lives, according to rights groups . Last week, major Iranian cities were gripped overnight by new mass rallies denouncing the Islamic Republic, as activists expressed fear that authorities were intensifying their suppression of the demonstrations under the cover of an internet blackout. The crackdown follows what was initially a relatively soft response, with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian calling for a kind and responsible” approach, acknowledging public frustration. The government had also announced cash handouts to ease economic woes. The regime appears to have shifted its tone since, accusing the US and Israel of orchestrating the protests. “The enemy has infiltrated trained terrorists into the country. Rioters and saboteurs are not the protesting people. We listen to the protesters and have made our utmost efforts to solve their problems,” Pezes­hkian said. The US, meanwhile, has offered to “help” the Iranian people, and the Trump administration also reportedly discussed the possibility of strikes targeting Iran. Posting on social media on Saturday, US President Trump said: “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!” In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of US intervention in Iran, according to Reuters . Meanwhile, addressing parliament on Sunday, Iran’s speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf warned the US against any miscalculation. If the US attacked, “both the occupied territory and centres of the US military and shipping will be our legitimate targets,” he told lawmakers. The warning came hours before Trump disclosed that Iran’s leadership had called seeking “to negotiate”. “The leaders of Iran called yesterday,“ Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that “a meeting is being set up … They want to negotiate.” However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“. The timing could have hardly been worse. US jets had just flown into Venezuela and captured President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. Maduro was taken to New York, and footage posted online showed him blindfolded in a grey tracksuit — an unsettling image, regardless of one’s politics. A cat-and-mouse relationship Miles away, in Tehran, Venezuela’s anti-American ally felt the pressure. Could Trump pull a Venezuela on Iran, its longest adversary? “We know that Donald Trump is not a reliable president, and he doesn’t care about international law,” said Soheili. Iran and the US have long shared a cat-and-mouse relationship. Washington has consistently viewed Iran’s nuclear programme and its network of regional proxies with suspicion. In 2020, an American strike killed Iran’s most revered military commander and foreign policy architect, Gen Qasem Soleimani. In June 2025, US jets struck key Iranian nuclear sites as Iran, shaken but defiant, fought a brief war with Israel. Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which allows non-nuclear states to pursue civilian nuclear energy under international inspections. Tehran insists its programme remains peaceful, a claim disputed by the United States and its allies, who argue that Iran’s enrichment levels exceed civilian requirements. Iran, for its part, has repeatedly accused Washington of selectively enforcing the treaty while ignoring violations by its partners, including Israel. Following the Iran-Israel war, sweeping UN sanctions lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed , while Tehran suspended nuclear inspections, effectively freezing its remaining commitments under the agreement. Trump’s oil gambit Iran, no stranger to the consequences of foreign intervention, was quick to condemn Washington’s actions in Venezuela as a “ clear violation ” of sovereignty and international law. “In past decades, interventions were justified under slogans such as democracy and human rights,” Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said on Monday. “Today, they openly say the issue is Venezuela’s oil .” After Maduro’s capture, Trump promised that American companies would gain access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. “We’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground,” he told reporters. After vowing to “run” Venezuela, Trump later softened his tone , saying the United States would not deploy troops if the country “does what we want.” Venezuela holds the world’s largest proven oil reserves, accounting for roughly 17pc of the global total, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That is another point of comparison with Iran. As the United Nations and states around the world debate the legality of Trump’s move, one thing is clear: the US president has moved on from peacemaker to interventionist. And that shift is making Tehran uneasy. Iran on edge Inside the country, the debate has already begun. Pro-Iran outlets have quietly explored the implications. “Following the US military attack on Venezuela and … Donald Trump’s threatening remarks … a serious question has emerged: could Tehran be the next target of Washington’s adventurism …,” wrote Nournews , an Iran-based digital news outlet. Tehran-based foreign policy expert Mohammad Khatibi agrees that there is cause for concern. “Yes, in light of what has occurred in Venezuela, there is clear reason for concern. Threats of intervention and open advocacy for regime change raise serious questions under international law and established norms,” he told Dawn . That said, he cautioned against drawing direct parallels. “From a geopolitical perspective, Iran is a central regional power in the Middle East with deep strategic depth, strong state institutions, and significant influence across multiple regional theatres,” he added. Khatibi asserted that any attempt to replicate the Venezuelan model in Iran would therefore carry far greater risks of regional escalation and international confrontation. Iran’s leverage in the Middle East has rested not only on its military capabilities but also on its network of allies and proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. An attack on Iran could create ripples through the region. Apples and oranges? Syed M. Ali, a security studies lecturer at Johns Hopkins University, cautioned against overstating the comparison. “It is somewhat like comparing apples and oranges,” he said. “While the Venezuelan action will be tough for the US to justify internationally, this intervention is motivated by Trump’s desire to reassert hemispheric hegemony, which resonates with the historical Monroe Doctrine (a policy opposing European colonialism in the Americas, asserting that any foreign interference in the Western Hemisphere would be seen as a threat to US interests).” Iran’s regional position, he added, makes any direct intervention far more complicated. And with the events happening in Gaza, the public perception not just in the Muslim world but also in the West has moved against the nexus between the US deep state and Israel, which act in tandem. “After Iraq and Afghanistan, there has been little appetite for that kind of operation. Iran is not as isolated as it once was. There has been a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia. These are the reasons why I say Trump’s statement is more rhetorical — intended to increase pressure for change within Iran.” While comparisons with Venezuela fuel anxiety, Tehran’s regional influence makes any direct foreign intervention unlikely — at least for now. In turbulent times, hope often becomes a strategy. Amid internal frustrations, a faltering economy, and the shadow of international pressure, ordinary Iranians are left clinging to the hope that cautious diplomacy, rather than confrontation, will chart the path forward.",

      "summary_orig": "Virat Kohli has tweaked his approach to counter-attack early in his innings and put bowlers under pressure to flip the momentum for India, the batting stalwart said after his match-winning knock in Sunday’s one-day international against New Zealand. The number three batter crafted 93 off 91 balls as India chased down a target of 301 with one over to spare en route to a four-wicket victory in the opener in Vadodara. After opener Rohit Sharma fell for 26 in the ninth over, Kohli refused to retreat into a defensive shell. Instead, he took the initiative in a match-defining 118-run stand with skipper Shubman Gill (56), using controlled aggression to force New Zealand’s attack onto the back foot. “Well, the basic idea is I bat at No.3,” Kohli said after winning the player of the match award. “So if the situation is a bit tricky, I back myself to counterattack now rather than just trying to play the situation in because some ball has your name on it.” Batting great Kohli is active internationally only in the 50-overs format. View this post on Instagram His masterclass on Sunday was the 37-year-old’s fifth consecutive 50-plus score in ODIs. In his 17th year in international cricket, he continues to reinvent himself and said he now aims to make the most of the first 20 deliveries after coming in at first drop. “There’s no point waiting around for too long. But at the same time, you don’t play outrageous shots. You still stick to your strengths, but you back yourself enough to put the opposition on the back foot,” he said. “I just felt like if I push hard now in the first 20 balls, then we can probably string in a partnership straight after a wicket like Rohit’s where the opposition is going to go on the back foot. “That actually ended up being the difference in the game.” India take on New Zealand in the second ODI of the three-match series in Indore on Sunday.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump urged Cuba on Sunday to “make a deal” soon, pledging to cut off all oil and money flowing to the communist-run island after the toppling of Havana’s key ally, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The threatening social media post drew an angry retort from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who said “no one” would tell his country what to do. Washington has imposed economy-crippling sanctions on its island neighbour for decades, but Trump has ramped up the pressure in recent days. US special forces seized Maduro and his wife this month in a lightning raid that left dozens of the ousted Venezuelan president’s security personnel dead — many of whom were Cuban. Though Maduro’s allies have become interim leaders, Trump has claimed the United States now actually controls Venezuela through a US naval blockade of its vital oil sector. “THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. “I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.” He said, “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!” “Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week’s U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years.” Trump provided almost no details about what potential deal he referred to, or what such an arrangement would achieve. Asked about it later on Sunday, Trump told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he wanted people forced out of Cuba or who “left under duress” to be taken care of. “Most importantly, right now, we’re going to take care of the people that came from Cuba, that are American citizens, or in our country,” Trump said, without clarifying how this would be achieved under a deal with Havana. ‘Ready to fall’ A week ago, Trump stated that “Cuba is ready to fall,” noting that the island’s economic crisis was worsening and it would be difficult for Havana to “hold out” without receiving heavily subsidised Venezuelan oil. Earlier on Sunday, the president reposted a message that jokingly suggested US Secretary of State Marco Rubio — a child of Cuban immigrants who concurrently holds the posts of national security advisor, acting head of the US archives, and acting international aid administrator — could also become the president of Cuba. Trump shared that post with the comment: “Sounds good to me!” Cuba’s president rebuffed Trump’s threatening language, saying the Caribbean island’s residents were “ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.” “Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do,” Diaz-Canel wrote on X. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez also weighed in to stress that Cuba is within its rights to import fuel from any willing exporter, “without interference or subordination to the unilateral coercive measures of the United States.” ‘Talk, talk, talk’ A Cold War-era US trade embargo has cinched Cuba’s economy beginning in 1962, and since 2000 Havana has increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, the firebrand leftist Hugo Chavez. On Sunday in the streets of Havana, retiree Mercedes Simon seemed to dismiss the US leader’s latest bluster. “Trump is not going to touch Cuba,” the 65-year-old told AFP . “All the presidents talk, talk, talk” about Cuba, for decades, “but they don’t act.” Marcos Sanchez, a 21-year-old working in the restaurant business, said the two countries should find common ground, “without resorting to violence.” Trump’s provocative language on Cuba comes as the emboldened American leader has hinted he has other countries in his sights after capturing Maduro. Trump, who had openly sought last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has recently threatened Colombia, Mexico, Iran and Greenland. Some Republican US lawmakers on Sunday lauded Trump for his aggressive comments on Cuba, including Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart from Florida. “The tyranny in Cuba will not survive the second term of President Trump,” Diaz-Balart posted in Spanish on X, “and Cuba will finally be free after decades of misery, tragedy, and pain.”",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: During ongoing operations against militants in Bannu, the Counter-Terrorism Department’s Bannu region, in coordination with local police, carried out a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO), killing two terrorists. According to police, the operation was conducted within the jurisdiction of Mirakhel Police Station on Jhandokhel Road near Shagi Machankhel. Acting on credible intelligence, CTD Bannu’s Special Weapons and Tactics teams, along with Bannu Police, cordoned off the area and launched the operation. During the action, the terrorists opened fire, prompting effective retaliatory fire by the police and CTD personnel. Following an exchange of fire, two terrorists were found dead during a search operation. They were identified as Suhail Khan alias Sangri and Ismail alias Usman. Police stated that both terrorists were involved in attacks on Sheikh Landik and Fateh Khel police check posts, in which eight police constables were injured. They were also involved in attacks on security forces’ convoys and an IED attack on the under-construction Rescue 1122 building. Weapons and ammunition recovered from the slain terrorists included two Kalashnikov rifles, one pistol, multiple rounds of ammunition, a motorcycle, two mobile phones, two national identity cards, and a card belonging to the proscribed TTP. Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, along with the Additional IG CTD, commended the Bannu Police and CTD SWAT teams for the successful operation. The IGP KP stated that intelligence-based targeted operations will continue uninterrupted across the province until terrorism is completely eliminated. In a separate incident, militants launched an attack on the Nala Kasho police checkpost, using light and heavy weapons. However, the attack was foiled after retaliatory action by police personnel. As soon as information about the attack was received, police contingents from Domel and Town Police Station, along with other security forces, immediately reached the site of the incident. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during 2025, according to the “Pakistan Security Report 2025” report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.",

      "summary_orig": "• Punjab forensic report calls videos genuine, profile photos matched • PTI leaders say clips unrelated to case; Azma terms evidence ‘irrefutable’ PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident. The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted. At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage. The authorities had provided the video clips and the pictures of CM Afridi, former provincial ministers Taimur Saleem Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, and two other PTI leaders, Irfan Saleem and Amir Khan Chamkani, for analysis. None of them had been nominated in the case. In the report, the PFSA gave its opinion on two points: whether the videos in the USB were genuine and whether the persons whose profile pictures had been shared appeared in the clips. It said the five individuals, including the CM, were seen in the clips, but did not clarify if the videos were related to the Radio Pakistan attack or any other event. It, however, said the clips were not edited except for the merger of multiple video clips of different camera views. A legal expert, privy to the case, said the investigating officer, after this ‘evidence’ could nominate more accused through a supplementary report to the ATC. However, the court can also take cognisance of the matter. Similarly, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) could also submit an application for the inclusion of the accused persons in light of the forensic report. ‘Unrelated clips’ Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad. PTI leader Taimur Jhagra said it was interesting that this campaign was against the CM and other individuals never nominated in this case. “The posts with screenshots are very interesting because they have nothing to do with Radio Pakistan. I believe the Punjab lab is simply commenting on whether it thinks the videos are genuine or not. My first video screenshot is of a video that is not even shot in Peshawar… The video is of my condemnation of Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, while in Islamabad,” he mentioned. The ATC has fixed Jan 26 for the next hearing in the trial. The ATC is conducting the trial, with 75 accused, including some present and former lawmakers, being indicted on June 3, 2025, on multiple counts. The FIR was registered at the East Cantonment police station on May 10, 2023. ‘Irrefutable evidence’ Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan and toll plazas by the PTI in Peshawar were part of a well-planned conspiracy, and “irrefutable evidence” has surfaced in the forensic report. Ms Bokhari said the report included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence. She stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting would be brought to justice.

      "summary_orig": "• PM-appointed panel calls for measures to improve ease of doing business • Seeks tariff overhaul to lift exports beyond $60bn in three years • Highlights cross-cutting barriers across 20 export products • Notes ‘policy unpredictability’ undermines investor, buyer confidence ISLAMABAD: A body constituted by the prime minister and led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal has called for urgent reforms to improve the ease of doing business and for a serious restructuring and rationalisation of tariffs — both energy prices and trade duties — to more than double exports to over $60 billion within three years. The committee was formed to devise a strategy for avoiding another IMF programme once the current $8.4bn arrangement expires at the end of 2027, amid mounting pressure from persistently weak economic indicators. According to synopses compiled after week-long consultations with public and private sector stakeholders from Jan 5 to 9, the panel concluded that the current state of affairs was not capable of driving a fast-growing population of 250 million towards sustained prosperity because of cross-cutting constra­ints affecting “all 20 priority export products and six export drivers”. Ironically, most of these constraints are generally well known, but the government’s inability, despite special interventions here and there, including through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), to create a conducive working environment in a fair, equitable, rule-based and transparent manner, has hampered sustainable growth path beyond stabilisation under a restrictive programme volunteered to the IMF. The plan proposed easing electricity and gas prices through debt refinancing and rationalising price build-ups. It was found that “export competitiveness is undermined by high and volatile energy costs, with electricity and gas tariffs remaining above regional benchmarks and subject to frequent changes”. It warned that volatility was inflating production costs across manufacturing, agro-processing, minerals, fisheries, and services, eroding margins and diverting orders to competing countries. The Planning Commission also pointed out that the cost of doing business in Pakistan remained “structurally high due to fragmented and distortionary taxation, inverted input tariffs, advance income tax deductions, delayed sales tax refunds and persistent working capital lockups”. It said these issues disproportionately affected exporters and were particularly binding for small and medium enterprises across manufacturing and agri-based value chains. The panel said that policy unpredictability was also weakening investment and buyer confidence. “Frequent changes in tax policy, energy pricing, tariff structures, export incentives and regulatory regimes, often announced late in the business cycle, constrain forward planning, capacity expansion and scaling, particularly around annual export order booking cycles,” it said. The synopses also highlighted institutional fragmentation and regulatory burdens. They said inconsistent definitions of SMEs across the State Bank of Pakistan, SMEDA, the Federal Board of Revenue and provincial authorities restricted access to finance, incentives and support schemes. Overlapping mandates, discretionary enforcement, excessive audits and weak inter-agency coordination increased compliance costs and uncertainty, the panel said. Moreover, exporters also faced weak domestic quality, testing and compliance infrastructure, increasing reliance on overseas laboratories for certification and testing, it said, adding: “This raises costs, lengthens lead times and elevates rejection risks in regulated export markets, constraining movement into higher value products and destinations.” Limited access to affordable finance was also highlighted as a constraint on upgrading and value addition. The panel said export credit, insurance, guarantees, and long-term financing instruments remained underdeveloped, while high interest rates, collateral requirements, and liquidity constraints curtailed SME investment in technology, compliance, and scaling. The committee also questioned the implementation of export facilitation and input schemes, including the Export Facilitation Scheme, saying procedural delays, higher input costs and working-capital pressures were limiting effective sourcing of raw materials and intermediate inputs. In addition, it cited logistics and trade facilitation bottlenecks, including high inland freight costs, underutilised rail, port congestion, slow customs clearance, inadequate cold-chain infrastructure and weak courier and postal systems for SMEs. It noted that at Port Qasim, the absence of dedicated export terminals, limited handling infrastructure, inadequate covered storage and constrained evacuation arrangements increased dwell time, handling costs and shipment uncertainty. It also pointed to skills gaps, low value addition and weak branding as barriers to moving into higher-value segments. Based on consultations, the Planning Commission is now collecting additional information through a private-sector survey to refine inputs and develop a data-driven, sector-specific technical roadmap to enhance exports under the Uraan Pakistan strategic plan. “Pakistan’s development, economic sovereignty and even national security now hinge on one thing: how fast we can grow our exports and move to an export-led growth model,” Mr Iqbal said at the conclusion of the consultations. He added that “the only way to break free from foreign crutches and avoid the next IMF programme is to rapidly increase our exports and build strong foreign exchange reserves”. The 20 products covered during these engagements included copper, gems and jewellery, software and IT services, fish and fish preparations, rice, fruits and vegetables, meat and meat preparations, guar gum and its products, handicrafts, textile and apparel, sports goods, leather and leather products, surgical instruments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cement, carpets and rugs, engineering goods, footwear, plastic material and cutlery. Pakistan currently exports about $30-35bn worth of goods, against Planning Commission estimates of an untapped annual potential of over $60bn. The findings and recommendations will be consolidated into product-wise diagnostics and a targeted facilitation framework for submission to the prime minister. Their implementation would be subject to clearance under the tight requirements of the IMF conditions. Published in Dawn, January 12th, 2026",

      "title_orig": "CM Afridi briefly addresses crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid; PTI claims hurdles, shelling at workers",
      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday briefly addressed hundreds gathered near Mazar-i-Quaid for the party’s rally, while the PTI claimed it faced hurdles in reaching the venue and its supporters were met with shelling by the police. The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue , saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid. During the day, PTI supporters gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the police employed shelling. Disturbances were also reported near Numaish Chowrangi as police dispersed crowds, while media vehicles were also vandalised. “I am deeply grateful to all Pakistanis and the people of Sindh for honouring us with enormous respect and esteem,” CM Afridi said while addressing a huge crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid late on Sunday night. “We can never forget the respect we received from the people of Sindh. But you all must not forgive the Sindh government for the disrespect they have shown towards the Sindhi cap and Ajrak,” the PTI leader added. “We will not allow anyone to steal our mandate, to snatch our rights, or to further keep our leader Imran Khan sahib in prison wrongfully,” Afridi said. The KP CM said: “Those who used to say ‘we will end PTI’ and who were thinking that Imran Khan’s politics will be eradicated, they should come here and see these youngsters here. “They should consider that these people have come for only a jalsa , then what will happen the day my leader (Imran Khan) issues a formal call for a street movement,” he added. “You must stand prepared against this oppression and fascism. Whenever my leader issues a call, we will act as per his wishes,” the PTI leader said. Afridi reiterated his claims of the Sindh government “leaving us stranded on deserted roads in the dark of the night” while returning from Hyderabad to Karachi. However, a provincial minister refuted the claims, saying that a police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”. “Shelling was also done at our sisters, children, workers here […] all routes were blocked, police baton-charged [supporters],” CM Afridi claimed in his brief address. The chief minister further alleged that “they (authorities) also damaged the media’s vehicles”. Afridi said the Sindh government “repeated” what its Punjab counterpart had done when he visited Lahore last month, calling both governments “fake”. The gathering was a part of the KP CM’s four-day visit to Sindh, who is leading his party’s street mobilisation movement. “God willing, our next stop will be Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and we will continue the same momentum in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” CM Afridi announced. The KP CM also raised slogans of “every chowk is D-Chowk”. ‘Delays due to obstructions, public welcomes’ Earlier at 7:44pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said CM Afridi’s convoy was facing delays “due to obstructions at various places, and the public’s affection, welcomes and responses at numerous places”. At around 9pm, Sheikh said the KP CM would reach the venue in five minutes, and lashed out at the Sindh police and government for their actions. At around 10:30pm, he shared footage of the caravan at Numaish Chowrangi, where Afridi also addressed the crowd. The PTI also shared visuals of the welcome accorded to the party caravan by their supporters in Baldia Town and Ittehad Town‘s Khyber Chowk. At around 6:40pm, the PTI said the Sindh police had “attempted to prevent” CM Afridi’s convoy from moving forward, but the party leaders “had the path reopened with the help of party workers”. The video showed party leaders, including Shafiullah Jan, speaking to the police before the convoy’s vehicles were allowed to move ahead. The PTI also shared videos of hundreds gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah by the evening, with supporters chanting “ Jiye Imran ” and “ Tera yaar, mera yaar, Qaidi No. 804 ”. In a video recorded while on his way to the venue, Afridi said his convoy would reach Mazar-i-Quaid after going through Baldia Town, Keamari, Banaras Chowk, Golimar and Gurumandir so PTI supporters could join the caravan. Former MNA Faheem Khan said , “Ten of our vehicles were intercepted. But no worries; I am reaching the rally venue with another vehicle equipped with a sound system.” In a statement on X, the PTI hailed the public for its “historic display of public power and expression of love for Imran Khan”. “Despite all the fascism, violence, arrests and obstructions by the Sindh government through its police, thousands of people have gathered inside and around Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah and on the surrounding streets at the moment,” it said. “This is the scene that serves as a clear message to those with fascist mindsets that public power cannot be stopped by walls and batons,” the PTI asserted. “This gathering is a renewal of the pledge that we are ready to give every sacrifice for Imran Khan, Pakistan, true freedom, supremacy of the Constitution and law, independence of the judiciary, and our basic rights.” Shelling, roadblocks at venue: PTI Shortly after 4pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared a video on X wherein a woman said police have resorted to shelling at party supporters at “Mazar-i-Quaid’s garden”. Video footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed multiple police vans at Bagh-i-Jinnah and cops employing shelling, with people gathered there retaliating by pelting stones. Pictures from Numaish Chowrangi showed cops with batons detaining multiple individuals as PTI supporters gathered to make their way to Bagh-i-Jinnah.

People push aside containers that had been placed to block a route in Karachi. — Shakil Adil/ White Star The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — an ally of the PTI under an opposition alliance — also said its leader Allama Sadiq Jafri and others had reached “Jinnah Ground”, possibly referring to Bagh-i-Jinnah. PTI spokesperson Mohammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn that police had blocked roads and were not allowing party workers to enter Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the government had previously allowed the party to hold the rally. He reiterated his allegation that police had blocked roads in various areas and were preventing PTI workers from reaching the new venue of Mazar-i-Quaid’s VIP gate as well. Bozdar said CM Afridi would pay his respects at the mausoleum and later on, he would address party workers from a truck, the arrangements for which had been completed. ‘Attack’ on mediapersons Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of an “attack“ on Aaj News ’ vehicle near Gurumandir Chowrangi. He also directed the East district senior superintendent of police (SSP) to immediately provide details on “police action”. “Miscreant elements will be dealt with firmly. We will not let anyone sabotage law and order,” Lanjar asserted. The minister said the perpetrators would be arrested by tracing them using the modern monitoring system. A vehicle of Aaj News with a badly damaged windshield. — Shakil Adil/ White Star In a statement, PTI’s Bozdar also condemned the attack on mediapersons and said action should be taken if someone had “attacked the media”. “The PTI’s workers are peaceful. No one is allowed to take the law into their hands,” he stated. “The media is the public’s voice; attacks on media will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he added. The board members of Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the “attack of a charged crowd on media; violence against journalists, cameramen and staff; and damage caused to DSNGs”. “How can this group declare themselves pro-democratic after attacking the media?” said a joint statement by KUJ President Ejaz Ahmad and others. “What message did they try to convey by targeting the media?” The KUJ demanded that the Sindh government trace the perpetrators through CCTV footage and bring them to justice. The Crime Reporters Association (CRA) also strongly condemned the vandalism incidents, adding that there was a “clash between political workers and police” during coverage at Bagh-i-Jinnah. “Media representatives busy in fulfilling their duties got caught in the middle of this chaos and were targeted, while the vehicles (DSNGs) and equipment of many media houses were damaged,” the CRA stated. Sindh government spokesperson Sadia Javed, in a statement, said there were “attacks on multiple news channels’ vehicles and pelting”. The vehicles of GNN and Aaj News were among those damaged, while a worker of Channel 5 was reportedly assaulted. In his statement, PPP Karachi General Secretary Rauf Ahmed Nagori alleged that PTI workers “vandalised citizen vehicles during their protest”. PTI changes rally venue The PTI had initially planned to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah, and the PPP-led Sindh government had even issued a no-objection certificate for it despite objections from the PML-N. But the party blamed the Sindh administration for “wasting their time” and announced that the public meeting would now be held in front of the Quaid’s mausoleum. Mazar-i-Quaid and Bagh-i-JInnah situated opposite it. — screengrab via Google Maps In a video statement, Sheikh criticised the Sindh government for allegedly blocking the rally. He recalled that Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had welcomed the KP CM at the Karachi airport and presented a Sindh cap and Ajrak to him. “Was that a pretence?” he questioned, slamming the Sindh government for its “shamelessness”. On the party’s decision to hold a gathering outside one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid, he said, “Holding a rally at a public gate does not block any route.” Sheikh alleged the NOC for the rally had been deliberately delayed, further questioning that when the Sindh government had granted permission for the rally, “why was our vendor beaten and made to flee?” He decried that the PPP was no longer late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s party. “Police brutality and blocking of roads cannot dampen the morale of the people,” PTI Karachi President Raja Azhar said in a statement, adding that the rally would prove to be the “public’s referendum against cruelty”. Similarly, party member Faheem Khan urged people to participate in the rally and termed the alleged blocking of roads “an attack on the rights of the people”. Late on Saturday, Sheikh said that while the PTI had announced Mazar-i-Quaid as the venue as the NOC had not been issued by then, the party had again decided to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah after getting the permission. PTI alleges arrests at Bagh-i-Jinnah Separately, the PTI alleged that authorities had raided Bagh-i-Jinnah, subjected its workers to violence and also arrested several of them. Party spokesperson Bozdar, while speaking to Dawn , alleged that when workers reached Bagh-i-Jinnah around 2am on Sunday for rally arrangements and preparations, around 15 to 20 police mobiles reached the spot and law enforcement personnel resorted to baton-charge. They detained over a dozen PTI workers, he claimed. At around 2:30am, PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui posted on X that the Sindh government wasted their time as the deputy commissioner East had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) on Saturday evening at 6:30pm. “The public power witnessed in Karachi yesterday has frightened them; they can’t decide what to do now. The people of Karachi will be at the Mazar-i-Quaid public gate at 2pm with our guest, the chief minister of KP, Sohail Afridi. We will hold a public meeting at the VIP gate at 2pm,” she stated. But the Sindh home minister warned of strict action if any public meeting was held on the road. “No one is allowed to challenge the writ of the government,” Lanjar said in a statement. In one of her posts at around 4:30am, Siddiqui said that containers had been parked around Jinnah Ground and police personnel were present at the site in large numbers. In another post, she alleged police had “attacked” Bagh-i-Jinnah, arrested several PTI workers, and their belongings had been confiscated. Similarly, Sheikh said in a post on X at around 2:30am that “this fascism against peaceful workers was unfortunate. The PPP and Sindh government, which harp about democracy, should feel ashamed“. In other posts, he decried the alleged police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah and claimed PTI workers had been subjected to violence. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media at Karachi Press Club today, decried the “barbarity” that PTI members had been subjected to. “Cars were smashed, and two dozen members have been detained unlawfully. A lawyer of ours was detained this morning at Bagh-i-Jinnah. It is cordoned off by police right now,” he said, adding that the PTI had the NOC for the rally. “So the rally will happen,” he asserted. In response to a Dawn query, police sources denied detaining any PTI workers this morning and said they just removed them from Mazar-i-Quaid. The sources said police took action to disperse the party workers, alleging that they had blocked a main road. The sources also said that while there would be no restriction on the movement of KP CM Afridi, PTI workers would not be allowed at Mazar-i-Quaid. KP CM claims routes blocked from Hyderabad to Karachi Earlier on Sunday, CM Afridi claimed in a post on X that “upon my return from Hyderabad, all routes for me and my entire team have been blocked. For the past four hours, I’ve been switching between different routes. At 4:23am, we’ve now set off toward Karachi on a deserted road“. “The Sindh government is not only playing with my life but also with the lives of my team members,” he said, warning that the precedent of such treatment being meted out to the CM of one province in other provinces would “prove highly detrimental in the near future”. “Pakistan belongs to all of us. Do not spread hatred here to such an extent that it becomes impossible to return from that point. Fake democratic forces are not leaving any stone unturned in this. This is extremely shameful,” he said. However, Hyderabad SSP Adeel Chandio told Dawn that “no obstruction was created in the convoy and rally of KP CM in Hyderabad until he left the city”. “And he left the city safely,” he added. Later, in a video message shared on PTI’s X account, the CM said: “We reached Karachi around 7:15pm […] We will definitely hold a rally today. It took us seven and a half hours to reach Karachi from Hyderabad. “They had blocked the route at different places and we were compelled to travel on a deserted route. This was tantamount to putting my and my team’s lives at risk, as anything could have happened there.” He urged Karachiites to come out for the rally today, adding that “they (the Sindh government) are afraid of the rally, but it will be held”. Raja also posted on X that he had reached Karachi from Hyderabad after “seven hours, driving through jungles in the CM KPK’s vehicle”. “Motorway closed. The fascist state lost its nerve after seeing the massive response of the people, given two days of freedom and human dignity,” he said. PTI not abiding by assurances, claims Sharjeel Inam From the Sindh government, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon maintained that his provincial government had warmly welcomed Afridi and provided him with complete security. “The post of chief minister is a constitutional post and constitutional posts have been fully respected,” he said in a statement, maintaining that the PTI was in constant touch with the Sindh government. He then accused the opposition party of “not abiding by the assurances” it had given, but did not specify any guarantees. “It was clearly said on the very first day that they are allowed to hold a rally. It is inappropriate to make allegations against the Sindh government despite this,” he said, maintaining that no one had stopped the PTI from holding a rally in the ground. However, the manner in which rallies and processions were being taken out on the roads was causing severe traffic disruption and common citizens were facing difficulties, he said. “Karachi is a metropolitan city; traffic problems arise here even when a few hundred people gather,” he said. “We want the KP chief minister to complete his visit in a peaceful manner.” He said that PTI workers should not take the law into their own hands and should follow the guidelines given by the government. The movement of common people should not be affected and violation of laws should be avoided, he added. Memon said a security alert had also been issued regarding the rally, and a security plan had been devised. “Unfortunately, the security plan is not being followed,” he claimed, further maintaining that complete security had been provided by Sindh police in connection with the rally. “In view of security concerns, the instructions of the Sindh government should be followed, and only routes allocated by the government should be used,” he said. Memon claimed that the route designated for the PTI in Hyderabad had not been followed and they took a route of their own choice. “It is not correct to say that the convoy of the chief minister of KP was stopped on its return from Hyderabad,” he said. “The place where the convoy faced difficulty is the National Highway Authority bridge, where traffic congestions are frequent.” More to follow Additional input by Mohammad Hussain Khan",

      "summary_en": "KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday briefly addressed hundreds gathered near Mazar-i-Quaid for the party’s rally, while the PTI claimed it faced hurdles in reaching the venue and its supporters were met with shelling by the police. The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue , saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid. During the day, PTI supporters gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the police employed shelling. Disturbances were also reported near Numaish Chowrangi as police dispersed crowds, while media vehicles were also vandalised. “I am deeply grateful to all Pakistanis and the people of Sindh for honouring us with enormous respect and esteem,” CM Afridi said while addressing a huge crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid late on Sunday night. “We can never forget the respect we received from the people of Sindh. But you all must not forgive the Sindh government for the disrespect they have shown towards the Sindhi cap and Ajrak,” the PTI leader added. “We will not allow anyone to steal our mandate, to snatch our rights, or to further keep our leader Imran Khan sahib in prison wrongfully,” Afridi said. The KP CM said: “Those who used to say ‘we will end PTI’ and who were thinking that Imran Khan’s politics will be eradicated, they should come here and see these youngsters here. “They should consider that these people have come for only a jalsa , then what will happen the day my leader (Imran Khan) issues a formal call for a street movement,” he added. “You must stand prepared against this oppression and fascism. Whenever my leader issues a call, we will act as per his wishes,” the PTI leader said. Afridi reiterated his claims of the Sindh government “leaving us stranded on deserted roads in the dark of the night” while returning from Hyderabad to Karachi. However, a provincial minister refuted the claims, saying that a police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”. “Shelling was also done at our sisters, children, workers here […] all routes were blocked, police baton-charged [supporters],” CM Afridi claimed in his brief address. The chief minister further alleged that “they (authorities) also damaged the media’s vehicles”. Afridi said the Sindh government “repeated” what its Punjab counterpart had done when he visited Lahore last month, calling both governments “fake”. The gathering was a part of the KP CM’s four-day visit to Sindh, who is leading his party’s street mobilisation movement. “God willing, our next stop will be Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and we will continue the same momentum in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” CM Afridi announced. The KP CM also raised slogans of “every chowk is D-Chowk”. ‘Delays due to obstructions, public welcomes’ Earlier at 7:44pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said CM Afridi’s convoy was facing delays “due to obstructions at various places, and the public’s affection, welcomes and responses at numerous places”. At around 9pm, Sheikh said the KP CM would reach the venue in five minutes, and lashed out at the Sindh police and government for their actions. At around 10:30pm, he shared footage of the caravan at Numaish Chowrangi, where Afridi also addressed the crowd. The PTI also shared visuals of the welcome accorded to the party caravan by their supporters in Baldia Town and Ittehad Town‘s Khyber Chowk. At around 6:40pm, the PTI said the Sindh police had “attempted to prevent” CM Afridi’s convoy from moving forward, but the party leaders “had the path reopened with the help of party workers”. The video showed party leaders, including Shafiullah Jan, speaking to the police before the convoy’s vehicles were allowed to move ahead. The PTI also shared videos of hundreds gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah by the evening, with supporters chanting “ Jiye Imran ” and “ Tera yaar, mera yaar, Qaidi No. 804 ”. In a video recorded while on his way to the venue, Afridi said his convoy would reach Mazar-i-Quaid after going through Baldia Town, Keamari, Banaras Chowk, Golimar and Gurumandir so PTI supporters could join the caravan. Former MNA Faheem Khan said , “Ten of our vehicles were intercepted. But no worries; I am reaching the rally venue with another vehicle equipped with a sound system.” In a statement on X, the PTI hailed the public for its “historic display of public power and expression of love for Imran Khan”. “Despite all the fascism, violence, arrests and obstructions by the Sindh government through its police, thousands of people have gathered inside and around Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah and on the surrounding streets at the moment,” it said. “This is the scene that serves as a clear message to those with fascist mindsets that public power cannot be stopped by walls and batons,” the PTI asserted. “This gathering is a renewal of the pledge that we are ready to give every sacrifice for Imran Khan, Pakistan, true freedom, supremacy of the Constitution and law, independence of the judiciary, and our basic rights.” Shelling, roadblocks at venue: PTI Shortly after 4pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared a video on X wherein a woman said police have resorted to shelling at party supporters at “Mazar-i-Quaid’s garden”. Video footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed multiple police vans at Bagh-i-Jinnah and cops employing shelling, with people gathered there retaliating by pelting stones. Pictures from Numaish Chowrangi showed cops with batons detaining multiple individuals as PTI supporters gathered to make their way to Bagh-i-Jinnah.

People push aside containers that had been placed to block a route in Karachi. — Shakil Adil/ White Star The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — an ally of the PTI under an opposition alliance — also said its leader Allama Sadiq Jafri and others had reached “Jinnah Ground”, possibly referring to Bagh-i-Jinnah. PTI spokesperson Mohammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn that police had blocked roads and were not allowing party workers to enter Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the government had previously allowed the party to hold the rally. He reiterated his allegation that police had blocked roads in various areas and were preventing PTI workers from reaching the new venue of Mazar-i-Quaid’s VIP gate as well. Bozdar said CM Afridi would pay his respects at the mausoleum and later on, he would address party workers from a truck, the arrangements for which had been completed. ‘Attack’ on mediapersons Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of an “attack“ on Aaj News ’ vehicle near Gurumandir Chowrangi. He also directed the East district senior superintendent of police (SSP) to immediately provide details on “police action”. “Miscreant elements will be dealt with firmly. We will not let anyone sabotage law and order,” Lanjar asserted. The minister said the perpetrators would be arrested by tracing them using the modern monitoring system. A vehicle of Aaj News with a badly damaged windshield. — Shakil Adil/ White Star In a statement, PTI’s Bozdar also condemned the attack on mediapersons and said action should be taken if someone had “attacked the media”. “The PTI’s workers are peaceful. No one is allowed to take the law into their hands,” he stated. “The media is the public’s voice; attacks on media will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he added. The board members of Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the “attack of a charged crowd on media; violence against journalists, cameramen and staff; and damage caused to DSNGs”. “How can this group declare themselves pro-democratic after attacking the media?” said a joint statement by KUJ President Ejaz Ahmad and others. “What message did they try to convey by targeting the media?” The KUJ demanded that the Sindh government trace the perpetrators through CCTV footage and bring them to justice. The Crime Reporters Association (CRA) also strongly condemned the vandalism incidents, adding that there was a “clash between political workers and police” during coverage at Bagh-i-Jinnah. “Media representatives busy in fulfilling their duties got caught in the middle of this chaos and were targeted, while the vehicles (DSNGs) and equipment of many media houses were damaged,” the CRA stated. Sindh government spokesperson Sadia Javed, in a statement, said there were “attacks on multiple news channels’ vehicles and pelting”. The vehicles of GNN and Aaj News were among those damaged, while a worker of Channel 5 was reportedly assaulted. In his statement, PPP Karachi General Secretary Rauf Ahmed Nagori alleged that PTI workers “vandalised citizen vehicles during their protest”. PTI changes rally venue The PTI had initially planned to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah, and the PPP-led Sindh government had even issued a no-objection certificate for it despite objections from the PML-N. But the party blamed the Sindh administration for “wasting their time” and announced that the public meeting would now be held in front of the Quaid’s mausoleum.

Mazar-i-Quaid and Bagh-i-JInnah situated opposite it. — screengrab via Google Maps In a video statement, Sheikh criticised the Sindh government for allegedly blocking the rally. He recalled that Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had welcomed the KP CM at the Karachi airport and presented a Sindh cap and Ajrak to him. “Was that a pretence?” he questioned, slamming the Sindh government for its “shamelessness”. On the party’s decision to hold a gathering outside one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid, he said, “Holding a rally at a public gate does not block any route.” Sheikh alleged the NOC for the rally had been deliberately delayed, further questioning that when the Sindh government had granted permission for the rally, “why was our vendor beaten and made to flee?” He decried that the PPP was no longer late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s party. “Police brutality and blocking of roads cannot dampen the morale of the people,” PTI Karachi President Raja Azhar said in a statement, adding that the rally would prove to be the “public’s referendum against cruelty”. Similarly, party member Faheem Khan urged people to participate in the rally and termed the alleged blocking of roads “an attack on the rights of the people”. Late on Saturday, Sheikh said that while the PTI had announced Mazar-i-Quaid as the venue as the NOC had not been issued by then, the party had again decided to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah after getting the permission. PTI alleges arrests at Bagh-i-Jinnah Separately, the PTI alleged that authorities had raided Bagh-i-Jinnah, subjected its workers to violence and also arrested several of them. Party spokesperson Bozdar, while speaking to Dawn , alleged that when workers reached Bagh-i-Jinnah around 2am on Sunday for rally arrangements and preparations, around 15 to 20 police mobiles reached the spot and law enforcement personnel resorted to baton-charge. They detained over a dozen PTI workers, he claimed. At around 2:30am, PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui posted on X that the Sindh government wasted their time as the deputy commissioner East had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) on Saturday evening at 6:30pm. “The public power witnessed in Karachi yesterday has frightened them; they can’t decide what to do now. The people of Karachi will be at the Mazar-i-Quaid public gate at 2pm with our guest, the chief minister of KP, Sohail Afridi. We will hold a public meeting at the VIP gate at 2pm,” she stated. But the Sindh home minister warned of strict action if any public meeting was held on the road. “No one is allowed to challenge the writ of the government,” Lanjar said in a statement. In one of her posts at around 4:30am, Siddiqui said that containers had been parked around Jinnah Ground and police personnel were present at the site in large numbers. In another post, she alleged police had “attacked” Bagh-i-Jinnah, arrested several PTI workers, and their belongings had been confiscated. Similarly, Sheikh said in a post on X at around 2:30am that “this fascism against peaceful workers was unfortunate. The PPP and Sindh government, which harp about democracy, should feel ashamed“. In other posts, he decried the alleged police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah and claimed PTI workers had been subjected to violence. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media at Karachi Press Club today, decried the “barbarity” that PTI members had been subjected to. “Cars were smashed, and two dozen members have been detained unlawfully. A lawyer of ours was detained this morning at Bagh-i-Jinnah. It is cordoned off by police right now,” he said, adding that the PTI had the NOC for the rally. “So the rally will happen,” he asserted. In response to a Dawn query, police sources denied detaining any PTI workers this morning and said they just removed them from Mazar-i-Quaid. The sources said police took action to disperse the party workers, alleging that they had blocked a main road. The sources also said that while there would be no restriction on the movement of KP CM Afridi, PTI workers would not be allowed at Mazar-i-Quaid. KP CM claims routes blocked from Hyderabad to Karachi Earlier on Sunday, CM Afridi claimed in a post on X that “upon my return from Hyderabad, all routes for me and my entire team have been blocked. For the past four hours, I’ve been switching between different routes. At 4:23am, we’ve now set off toward Karachi on a deserted road“. “The Sindh government is not only playing with my life but also with the lives of my team members,” he said, warning that the precedent of such treatment being meted out to the CM of one province in other provinces would “prove highly detrimental in the near future”. “Pakistan belongs to all of us. Do not spread hatred here to such an extent that it becomes impossible to return from that point. Fake democratic forces are not leaving any stone unturned in this. This is extremely shameful,” he said. However, Hyderabad SSP Adeel Chandio told Dawn that “no obstruction was created in the convoy and rally of KP CM in Hyderabad until he left the city”. “And he left the city safely,” he added. Later, in a video message shared on PTI’s X account, the CM said: “We reached Karachi around 7:15pm […] We will definitely hold a rally today. It took us seven and a half hours to reach Karachi from Hyderabad. “They had blocked the route at different places and we were compelled to travel on a deserted route. This was tantamount to putting my and my team’s lives at risk, as anything could have happened there.” He urged Karachiites to come out for the rally today, adding that “they (the Sindh government) are afraid of the rally, but it will be held”. Raja also posted on X that he had reached Karachi from Hyderabad after “seven hours, driving through jungles in the CM KPK’s vehicle”. “Motorway closed. The fascist state lost its nerve after seeing the massive response of the people, given two days of freedom and human dignity,” he said. PTI not abiding by assurances, claims Sharjeel Inam From the Sindh government, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon maintained that his provincial government had warmly welcomed Afridi and provided him with complete security. “The post of chief minister is a constitutional post and constitutional posts have been fully respected,” he said in a statement, maintaining that the PTI was in constant touch with the Sindh government. He then accused the opposition party of “not abiding by the assurances” it had given, but did not specify any guarantees. “It was clearly said on the very first day that they are allowed to hold a rally. It is inappropriate to make allegations against the Sindh government despite this,” he said, maintaining that no one had stopped the PTI from holding a rally in the ground. However, the manner in which rallies and processions were being taken out on the roads was causing severe traffic disruption and common citizens were facing difficulties, he said. “Karachi is a metropolitan city; traffic problems arise here even when a few hundred people gather,” he said. “We want the KP chief minister to complete his visit in a peaceful manner.” He said that PTI workers should not take the law into their own hands and should follow the guidelines given by the government. The movement of common people should not be affected and violation of laws should be avoided, he added. Memon said a security alert had also been issued regarding the rally, and a security plan had been devised. “Unfortunately, the security plan is not being followed,” he claimed, further maintaining that complete security had been provided by Sindh police in connection with the rally. “In view of security concerns, the instructions of the Sindh government should be followed, and only routes allocated by the government should be used,” he said. Memon claimed that the route designated for the PTI in Hyderabad had not been followed and they took a route of their own choice. “It is not correct to say that the convoy of the chief minister of KP was stopped on its return from Hyderabad,” he said. “The place where the convoy faced difficulty is the National Highway Authority bridge, where traffic congestions are frequent.” More to follow Additional input by Mohammad Hussain Khan",

      "summary_orig": "Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah on Sunday tendered an apology to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi for any “unpleasant incident” that he may have faced during his ongoing visit to Sindh. His statements came after the PTI claimed its convoy was facing hurdles while on its way to Mazar-i-Quaid for a rally, and CM Afridi said he had to use risky routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad. “I personally apologise if something [unpleasant] happened somewhere, as this should not happen,” Shah said during Geo News ’ programme ‘Naya Pakistan’. ’’He is the chief minister of a province and whatever we did, the welcome and all, was in respect of the people of KP as he had their mandate,“ the PPP leader added. Asked about the apparent change in the Sindh government’s attitude , Shah highlighted that the guests were “welcomed and taken care of”. He noted that the PTI sought permission to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah from the Sindh government “even though it falls under the federal government’s jurisdiction”. He acknowledged that the PTI “adopted the proper procedure” to seek a no-objection certificate (NOC), which he said also caused delays. Then, the minister said, the issues arose when the NOC got delayed by about 1-1.5 hours, and the PTI announced that they would “hold the rally on a road”. Shah added that the Sindh government had even offered the PTI to connect them to their vendors if the preparations were lacking. The minister then pointed out CM Afridi’s “certain” statements, including one about President Asif Ali Zardari’s politics. “There are no differences. Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari sahib and President Asif Ali Zardari sahib are our PPP, the Sindh government. There is one stance,” he asserted. Shah added that if President Zardari did not wish so, the PTI guests would not have been welcomed at the airport or facilitated. He said the PTI started making harsh statements, which also upset party members who noted the criticism despite offering them support. Asked about the police action against PTI workers at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the early hours of Sunday, Shah said an inquiry was underway about what led to it. He said the PTI was being urged to arrange the setup in the ground, but they were insistent on holding a gathering on the road. On CM Afridi’s claims about his convoy being forced to take dangerous routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad, Shah said: “He had complete protocol, and as per the security threat issued, he was brought via the safest routes. “Those were the safest routes, and police protection was with him,“ the PPP leader asserted. “How could he have returned if there were pickets and if roads were blocked?” Shah asked rhetorically. “As per the reports the administration has given, this protocol was adopted for their security and safety,“ the minister replied to a question about the police pickets set up. On reports of shelling at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the day despite the NOC, Shah said, “Something unpleasant happened there.” Criticising Zardari is our democratic right: Qaiser Responding to Shah on the same show, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “We think that Sindh’s people and government respect democracy and […] they respect their opponents.” He acknowledged that the PTI had differences with the PPP and concerns about it. “In our opinion, the illegitimate government in power right now is so because of their support,” he said. “The legislation that they are doing. [Criticising it] is our stance. It is our democratic right to have whatever stance we want,” Qaiser stressed. To a question raised by the host, Qaiser responded: “You and he (Shah) both understand what is happening from where. Will a democratic political party take instructions in this manner? Will we not have a say?” Qaiser said the PTI respected the PPP, adding: “Even if you say that we criticised Zardari sahib , that is our democratic right.” “Will this attitude continue? Is this democracy? […] Tell me, what unlawful [incident] has occurred over the past two days?“ Qaiser asked. He stressed the vendors needed two to three days to make arrangements at the venue, adding that there was “no lighting” at Bagh-i-Jinnah and that the Sindh government would be responsible for any unfortunate incident. Responding to Qaiser, Shah pointed out the welcome accorded to CM Afridi on Friday, asking if it would have been given “if there were some instructions from somewhere”. Shah also denied that the PPP “changed its strategy” because of the PML-N reportedly being criticised for its attitude towards the KP CM during his Lahore visit . Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.",
