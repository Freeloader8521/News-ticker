      "summary_orig": "An explosion tore through a Chinese-run restaurant in a hotel in a heavily guarded part of Afghanistan’s capital on Monday, killing a Chinese national and six Afghans and injuring several others, including a child, officials said. The restaurant was in the commercial Shahr-i-Naw neighbourhood of Kabul that includes office buildings, shopping complexes and embassies, police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said. The district is considered one of the safest in the city. The Chinese noodle restaurant was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, and served the Chinese Muslim community, Zadran said. One Chinese national, identified as Ayub, and six Afghans were killed in the blast, which occurred near the kitchen, while several others were injured, Zadran added. Videos shared on social media showed debris scattered on the street outside and smoke spewing from a large hole torn into the front of the restaurant building. “So far, we have received 20 people at our hospital,” Dejan Panic, humanitarian group EMERGENCYs Country Director in Afghanistan, said in a statement. “Among the wounded are four women and a child … Unfortunately, seven people were already dead on arrival.” There was no immediate word on the cause of the explosion. Authorities said they were investigating. In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the bombing and expressed grief over the loss of lives. “The president conveyed sincere sympathy with the injured and their families and prayed for their early recovery,” the statement read. “He paid tribute to the spirit of Chinese citizens who have continued to work for the development of Afghanistan despite rising insecurity and serious risks to their lives.” According to the statement, the president noted the Afghan Taliban regime’s failure to honour commitments made under the Doha Agreement, particularly the obligation to prevent the use of Afghan soil for acts of terrorism. “He recalled that Pakistan has repeatedly stressed that no terrorist groups should be allowed safe havens in Afghanistan and that regional peace and security must be upheld,” the statement said. The statement noted that other countries neighbouring Afghanistan, including Tajikistan, were recently affected by terrorists operating from Afghan soil. “The president further stated that the failure to establish a broad-based and inclusive government by the Taliban is contrary to the Doha Agreement,” the statement added. “He emphasised that full implementation of the agreement, in letter and spirit, along with concrete steps to end cross-border terrorism, remains essential.” The Taliban took control of war-torn Afghanistan in 2021 and said it would restore security, but bomb attacks have continued, many of them claimed by the local arm of the militant Islamic State group.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The death toll from the Gul Plaza blaze rose to at least 23 on Monday, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab saying that 65 people remained missing. The fire had erupted on Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. While the fire at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris. In the evening, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that 23 bodies had been recovered from the debris. He added that the body parts of some of the victims had been recovered. In a statement, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalal said that while “more than 20 bodies have been recovered, the final number of dead cannot be stated at the moment”. “Some bodies have been recovered in the form of body parts from various locations,” he said. “Until it is determined through a technical and forensic verification whether these parts are of the same person or different people, confirming the correct number [of deaths] is difficult.” Mohammed Shah, who was supervising Pakistan Navy’s fire brigade team at the spot, told Dawn on Monday evening that the fire had been controlled but smoke was still emanating from the site. Rescue 1122 spokesperson, Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that flames were controlled to a large extent on Sunday night, which paved the way for the cooling process. He said a search operation was initiated at three different spots. Karachi Additional IG Azad Khan told the media gathered at the scene that no evidence had emerged thus far suggesting arson. Speaking on Geo News ’ ‘Capital Talk’, Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah also said that the Sindh government was ready to form a judicial commission to probe the incident. ‘65 people remain missing’ Speaking on Geo News programme ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath ’, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that the tally thus far showed that 65 people were missing. “Others are saying there are 77 missing but I can confirm that it is 65,” Wahab said. “Of those 65, we have retrieved and identified 18 bodies. We have retrieved other bodies but they have not been identified; we are waiting on DNA,” he said. He said that firefighting operations had concluded and cooling work was ongoing. “We have been able to access three areas of the building: we can enter two areas where the structure is still standing, and one portion in the rear that collapsed,” Wahab said. The mayor added that until last night, reports of movement were received but when those areas were accessed by rescuers, there were no signs of life. He said that rescue workers had been told to be mindful of this and instructed to drill with caution. Asked about which institutions were responsible, the mayor said that assigning responsibility was not the primary focus at the moment. He said that an inquiry committee had been formed to ascertain the facts. He said that 1,200 shops were active in the plaza. “Over the years, naturally, problems emerged which need to be investigated for negligence,” he said. Inquiry committee set up; compensation announced Meanwhile, addressing a press conference with representatives of the business community earlier in the day, Sindh CM Murad announced Rs10 million in compensation for each deceased person’s family. “There can be no price tag for a person’s life. Their grief cannot be compensated in any way, but we are announcing Rs10m from the government for each person who lost their life,” the Sindh CM said, adding that the process would begin tomorrow (Tuesday). “Unfortunately, there has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident,” he said. While he refrained from giving a specific number, he said that it could possible be 80. “We are all sorrowful. We all share their grief,” the chief minister said, referring to the bereaved families. He also announced that an inquiry committee was being set up to probe the incident, headed by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi. He asserted that the inquiry’s aim was not to point blame but to acknowledge and correct one’s mistakes. However, he added, “If there is any evidence of sabotage, then obviously action will be taken [although] there is no such thing as of now.” Detailing the ongoing rescue operations, the Sindh CM said rescue personnel had carved out “three ways” to enter the building. He said 40 per cent of the mall’s building had collapsed, adding that the rest of it was also in a poor state. “Perhaps, we might need to demolish the entire building,” he feared. CM Murad also expressed the Sindh government’s desire to rehabilitate the affected businesses and make them functional again. Recalling his meeting with the business community earlier in the day, he said they discussed the short-term and long-term plan of action. The chief minister recalled the fire incidents at Bolton Market in 2009 — where the federal government’s aid was also sought — and at Timber Market in 2014, where traders were compensated. In the long-term, CM Murad said, local disaster management authorities will be strengthened and equipped better. He went on to identify one of the problems, saying that the rescue authorities were not able to “perform their duties freely” and requesting “everyone not to provide their expertise”. “All of us sitting in this room were involved in that hindrance,” the chief minister said, adding that officials could have inefficiencies. Responding to a question, he said, “There was a [shortage] of water and there were some difficulties […] I do not want to elaborate [but] the difficulties were that people had blocked the routes, which I also hold myself accountable for.” Stressing that the authorities were trying to account for the missing, CM Murad said, “I request each institution that considers it has the expertise to help us, to support us.” Taking note of suggestions to seek external help, the chief minister said, “One does not need to call at such occasions. [They] need to come forward on their own.” CM Murad vows to rehabilitate affected traders During his press conference, CM Murad detailed that a separate committee had been formed to assess traders’ losses and make recommendations regarding businesses’ rehabilitation. The committee includes Zubair Motiwala, Jawed Bilwani, Idress Memon, Junaid Makda and Rehan Hanif. The chief minister said it was decided to allocate a space temporarily to the affected businesses. The Sindh CM said shopkeepers’ associations will be asked to install fire alarms, stressing that the first “one to two hours” after a fire occurs were crucial. Prior to the press conference, CM Murad had held a meeting with representatives of the traders’ community where he vowed to immediately rehabilitate the affected businesses. “We will reconstruct the building of Gul Plaza,” he announced, according to a statement from his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa. “The Sindh government will have a forensic report conducted so the cause of the fire can be known,” CM Murad said, adding that the chief secretary would notify the fact-finding committee. Highlighting that President Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were repeatedly contacting him about the incident, the chief minister said, “The PPP leadership wants the traders of Gul Plaza to be rehabilitated urgently.” Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah said the restoration efforts would be undertaken with the advice of the traders. Commissioner Naqvi informed the meeting that the death toll could surge to over 50. CM Murad, after being told that the cooling process was underway, ordered that the work to clear the rubble be initiated right away. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab briefed the chief minister that 16 fire tenders and bowsers were involved in the dousing operations, in which “50 to 60” firefighters participated. He further said that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) had provided tankers and 431,000 gallons of water for the fire-extinguishing operations. CM’s aide Giyan Chand Essarani informed the meeting that the blaze erupted at 10:36pm on January 17, adding that Rescue 1122 ambulances reached the site within six minutes. He further said that a total of 24 fire rescue vehicles took part in the operations, including those of KMC and the Pakistan Navy. Sindh governor calls incident ‘national tragedy’ The Sindh government also established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625. Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, said that the incident had now “turned into a national tragedy”. A woman speaks to reporters (not pictured) as she mourns six missing family members who were shopping at Gul Plaza Shopping Centre for a wedding ceremony, on Jan 19, 2026. — Reuters “Information about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,” he said. He further stated that while determining the cause of the fire was necessary, the priority for now was to save lives. “I am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,” he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders. Tessori vowed to “stand with the affected people” until their losses are fully compensated. “My cousin was inside,” said Raheel Ibrahim about Naveed Juma, who he said used to work at a shop on Gul Plaza’s first floor. “His phone was ringing till 12am [on Saturday] but he did not receive calls,” he said, adding that his cousin’s phone was unreachable afterwards. “Till now there is no news of him,” Ibrahim said, adding that his 43-year-old cousin had three young daughters. Another elderly man from the Metroville area said his daughter, daughter-in-law and sister had come to the mall for shopping on Saturday. “We have had no contact with them after 8pm that night,” he added. The distraught man lamented, “Wherever we go, they push us away like a football that ‘ask so and so, we do not know anything’.” Noting that some bodies were unidentifiable and needed DNA samples for cross-matching, the man said he was being told that details about that process would take two to three days. Traffic police announce alternate routes In an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza. The traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower.

      "summary_en": "KARACHI: The death toll from the Gul Plaza blaze rose to at least 23 on Monday, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab saying that 65 people remained missing. The fire had erupted on Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. While the fire at the mall located on M.A Jinnah Road was said to be doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris. In the evening, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that 23 bodies had been recovered from the debris. He added that the body parts of some of the victims had been recovered. In a statement, Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Dr Abid Jalal said that while “more than 20 bodies have been recovered, the final number of dead cannot be stated at the moment”. “Some bodies have been recovered in the form of body parts from various locations,” he said. “Until it is determined through a technical and forensic verification whether these parts are of the same person or different people, confirming the correct number [of deaths] is difficult.” Mohammed Shah, who was supervising Pakistan Navy’s fire brigade team at the spot, told Dawn on Monday evening that the fire had been controlled but smoke was still emanating from the site. Rescue 1122 spokesperson, Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that flames were controlled to a large extent on Sunday night, which paved the way for the cooling process. He said a search operation was initiated at three different spots. Karachi Additional IG Azad Khan told the media gathered at the scene that no evidence had emerged thus far suggesting arson. Speaking on Geo News ’ ‘Capital Talk’, Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah also said that the Sindh government was ready to form a judicial commission to probe the incident. ‘65 people remain missing’ Speaking on Geo News programme ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath ’, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that the tally thus far showed that 65 people were missing. “Others are saying there are 77 missing but I can confirm that it is 65,” Wahab said. “Of those 65, we have retrieved and identified 18 bodies. We have retrieved other bodies but they have not been identified; we are waiting on DNA,” he said. He said that firefighting operations had concluded and cooling work was ongoing. “We have been able to access three areas of the building: we can enter two areas where the structure is still standing, and one portion in the rear that collapsed,” Wahab said. The mayor added that until last night, reports of movement were received but when those areas were accessed by rescuers, there were no signs of life. He said that rescue workers had been told to be mindful of this and instructed to drill with caution. Asked about which institutions were responsible, the mayor said that assigning responsibility was not the primary focus at the moment. He said that an inquiry committee had been formed to ascertain the facts. He said that 1,200 shops were active in the plaza. “Over the years, naturally, problems emerged which need to be investigated for negligence,” he said. Inquiry committee set up; compensation announced Meanwhile, addressing a press conference with representatives of the business community earlier in the day, Sindh CM Murad announced Rs10 million in compensation for each deceased person’s family. “There can be no price tag for a person’s life. Their grief cannot be compensated in any way, but we are announcing Rs10m from the government for each person who lost their life,” the Sindh CM said, adding that the process would begin tomorrow (Tuesday). “Unfortunately, there has been a considerable loss of lives in this incident,” he said. While he refrained from giving a specific number, he said that it could possible be 80. “We are all sorrowful. We all share their grief,” the chief minister said, referring to the bereaved families. He also announced that an inquiry committee was being set up to probe the incident, headed by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi. He asserted that the inquiry’s aim was not to point blame but to acknowledge and correct one’s mistakes. However, he added, “If there is any evidence of sabotage, then obviously action will be taken [although] there is no such thing as of now.” Detailing the ongoing rescue operations, the Sindh CM said rescue personnel had carved out “three ways” to enter the building. He said 40 per cent of the mall’s building had collapsed, adding that the rest of it was also in a poor state. “Perhaps, we might need to demolish the entire building,” he feared. CM Murad also expressed the Sindh government’s desire to rehabilitate the affected businesses and make them functional again. Recalling his meeting with the business community earlier in the day, he said they discussed the short-term and long-term plan of action. The chief minister recalled the fire incidents at Bolton Market in 2009 — where the federal government’s aid was also sought — and at Timber Market in 2014, where traders were compensated. In the long-term, CM Murad said, local disaster management authorities will be strengthened and equipped better. He went on to identify one of the problems, saying that the rescue authorities were not able to “perform their duties freely” and requesting “everyone not to provide their expertise”. “All of us sitting in this room were involved in that hindrance,” the chief minister said, adding that officials could have inefficiencies. Responding to a question, he said, “There was a [shortage] of water and there were some difficulties […] I do not want to elaborate [but] the difficulties were that people had blocked the routes, which I also hold myself accountable for.” Stressing that the authorities were trying to account for the missing, CM Murad said, “I request each institution that considers it has the expertise to help us, to support us.” Taking note of suggestions to seek external help, the chief minister said, “One does not need to call at such occasions. [They] need to come forward on their own.” CM Murad vows to rehabilitate affected traders During his press conference, CM Murad detailed that a separate committee had been formed to assess traders’ losses and make recommendations regarding businesses’ rehabilitation. The committee includes Zubair Motiwala, Jawed Bilwani, Idress Memon, Junaid Makda and Rehan Hanif. The chief minister said it was decided to allocate a space temporarily to the affected businesses. The Sindh CM said shopkeepers’ associations will be asked to install fire alarms, stressing that the first “one to two hours” after a fire occurs were crucial. Prior to the press conference, CM Murad had held a meeting with representatives of the traders’ community where he vowed to immediately rehabilitate the affected businesses. “We will reconstruct the building of Gul Plaza,” he announced, according to a statement from his spokesperson Abdul Rasheed Channa. “The Sindh government will have a forensic report conducted so the cause of the fire can be known,” CM Murad said, adding that the chief secretary would notify the fact-finding committee. Highlighting that President Asif Ali Zardari and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari were repeatedly contacting him about the incident, the chief minister said, “The PPP leadership wants the traders of Gul Plaza to be rehabilitated urgently.” Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah said the restoration efforts would be undertaken with the advice of the traders. Commissioner Naqvi informed the meeting that the death toll could surge to over 50. CM Murad, after being told that the cooling process was underway, ordered that the work to clear the rubble be initiated right away. Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab briefed the chief minister that 16 fire tenders and bowsers were involved in the dousing operations, in which “50 to 60” firefighters participated. He further said that the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) had provided tankers and 431,000 gallons of water for the fire-extinguishing operations. CM’s aide Giyan Chand Essarani informed the meeting that the blaze erupted at 10:36pm on January 17, adding that Rescue 1122 ambulances reached the site within six minutes. He further said that a total of 24 fire rescue vehicles took part in the operations, including those of KMC and the Pakistan Navy. Sindh governor calls incident ‘national tragedy’ The Sindh government also established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625. Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who visited the site of the incident on Monday, said that the incident had now “turned into a national tragedy”. A woman speaks to reporters (not pictured) as she mourns six missing family members who were shopping at Gul Plaza Shopping Centre for a wedding ceremony, on Jan 19, 2026. — Reuters “Information about a pregnant woman being trapped inside is extremely concerning,” he said. He further stated that while determining the cause of the fire was necessary, the priority for now was to save lives. “I am in constant contact with three major builders of the city for the restoration of the market,” he added, elaborating on efforts to provide relief to traders. Tessori vowed to “stand with the affected people” until their losses are fully compensated. “My cousin was inside,” said Raheel Ibrahim about Naveed Juma, who he said used to work at a shop on Gul Plaza’s first floor. “His phone was ringing till 12am [on Saturday] but he did not receive calls,” he said, adding that his cousin’s phone was unreachable afterwards. “Till now there is no news of him,” Ibrahim said, adding that his 43-year-old cousin had three young daughters. Another elderly man from the Metroville area said his daughter, daughter-in-law and sister had come to the mall for shopping on Saturday. “We have had no contact with them after 8pm that night,” he added. The distraught man lamented, “Wherever we go, they push us away like a football that ‘ask so and so, we do not know anything’.” Noting that some bodies were unidentifiable and needed DNA samples for cross-matching, the man said he was being told that details about that process would take two to three days. Traffic police announce alternate routes In an advisory by the Karachi Traffic Police, the portion of M.A. Jinnah Road from Tibet Centre to Garden Chowk is closed to traffic due to ongoing rescue and recovery operations at Gul Plaza. The traffic police advised that commuters heading towards Tower from Numaish should turn right at Capri and proceed via Saddar Dawakhana, Empress Market, Regal, Burns Road, or Fresco Chowk, then take the route from Dilpasand to M.A. Jinnah Road to reach Tower. Commuters heading towards M.A. Jinnah Road or Mazar-i-Quaid from Fresco Chowk should continue straight towards Regal Market, turn right at Empress Market towards Frere Chowk, and then proceed to M.A. Jinnah Road. ‘Heartbroken’ United Kingdom’s High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriot said she was “heartbroken” by the tragic fire at the shopping plaza. “May strength be with the community at this time,” she said.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said on Saturday that the party’s future participation in meetings of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was conditional upon whether consultations would be allowed with incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. Neither Barrister Gohar nor Barrister Syed Ali Zafar — who represent PTI in JCP meetings — have attended recent sessions of the council during which, in separate meetings last week, the commission had recommended the confirmation of 31 additional judges as permanent judges. JCP is the key judicial body responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary Speaking to the media at the Supreme Court on Saturday, Gohar said, “The party will take a final decision whether or not to attend future meetings of the JCP after having consultation with the PTI founder”. When asked why PTI skipped meetings of the commission, Barrister Gohar explained that the status of the commission had changed after the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the establishment of the new courts, such as the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). He said that the party had serious reservations about the 26th Constitutional Amendment as well, which was enacted into law in 2024. However, Gohar maintained that despite that, PTI “still wanted to present the party’s point of view and give input in the selection of judges for the superior judiciary, but then our meetings with the PTI founder were severed”. He maintained that due to no contact with Imran, the party is unable to consult him. “Just as we boycotted participation from other committees, we also decided to stay away from the meetings of the JCP,” he explained. “We will make a proper decision in this regard after meeting with Khan sahib ,” he added. Meetings with the PTI founder have been suspended till February 8, Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said in December last year. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. ‘NA opposition leader not appointed at behest of Nawaz’ On the matter of the appointment of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Gohar dismissed reports that the appointment was made at the behest of PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif. On January 16, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Achakzai was appointed leader of the opposition in the NA. Gohar held that it was at the discretion of the speaker of the National Assembly, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, to issue the notification. “I understand that it was done by the speaker National Assembly for which we were grateful,” he said. Responding to a question regarding the appointment of the opposition leader in the Senate, Gohar said, “We have been told that the notification of the opposition leader in the Senate will also be done in a few days”. He detailed that the PTI had filed nomination papers before the Senate Secretariat, hoping that the process would be completed today. “Since the PTI founder has already nominated leaders of the opposition in both the Houses, it will be better if they are appointed soon,” he said. In October 2025, PTI had nominated Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as its candidates for the slots of leader of the opposition in the National Assem­bly and Senate, respectively.",

      "title_orig": "Karachi fires: a timeline of major blazes and unanswered questions",
      "summary_orig": "The Gul Plaza inferno that erupted on Saturday night, killing at least 21 people and injuring several others, is one of the deadliest fires Karachi has witnessed in recent years. It is also the latest reminder of a grim and familiar pattern in a metropolis where fires routinely destroy homes, businesses and livelihoods. Across Pakistan, fires frequently break out in residential, commercial and industrial buildings due to a toxic mix of crumbling infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations and widespread negligence. Many structures lack basic fire exits, alarms and emergency response protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems sharply increase the risk of electrical short circuits. City planners and engineers estimate that around 70 per cent of Karachi’s residential, commercial and industrial buildings do not have an adequate fire safety system. Despite the frequency and scale of such incidents, accountability has remained elusive. Investigations are rarely concluded, recommendations are seldom implemented, and the same hazards persist, leaving citizens exposed to repeated tragedy. Below is a timeline of major fire incidents in Karachi over the past three years, showing how regularly the city is engulfed in flames — and how little appears to change. January 16, 2026 At least 20 containers were destroyed when a fire erupted at the Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT) at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT).  No casualties were reported as workers had gone for Friday prayers. A total of 20 fire tenders from the Rescue services, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) Fire Brigade, KPT and the Pakistan Navy brought the blaze under control within three hours. December 22, 2025 A fire broke out at the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in Landhi and was brought under control after several hours. No casualties were reported since factory workers had already left the building that evening. More than 15 fire tenders, including two snorkels, managed to control the fire by around 8:50pm. Cooling operations continued late into the night. December 4, 2025 The building of a garment factory in the EPZ collapsed after a fire erupted there, injuring two firefighters . November 23, 2025 A fire that broke out in a freight train at Cantt Station destroyed dried fruits, solar inverters and batteries inside the two bogies that were completely gutted. The same day, two people became unconscious due to smoke inhalation when a fire erupted in a high-rise building in the Soldier Bazaar area on Sunday evening. The shop where the fire erupted was destroyed in the blaze. November 2, 2025 No casualties were reported when a fire erupted near Munawar Chowrangi in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, although more than 300 huts were destroyed , along with motorcycles and sewing machines, while some goats were also killed. Four fire tenders managed to control the blaze in as many hours. Separately, a woman and her 25-year-old daughter were killed when a fire erupted inside a house near Shah Faisal Chowk in Orangi Town. October 27, 2025 One person was killed in a fire outside Karachi University, which engulfed a nearby graveyard, damaged some graves, and destroyed around 10-20 huts (makeshift houses). The fire also reached a nearby housing complex, which prompted citizens to vacate their flats. It took around 12 fire tenders to control the blaze. October 15, 2025 Five people, including two children, suffered burns when a fire erupted in a candle factory in the Sher Shah area, while one person was injured by a falling structure. The fire destroyed the industrial unit, as well as two nearby warehouses and four residential properties. October 8, 2025 No casualties were reported after a fire erupted in a plastic factory in Liaquatabad early in the morning. Three fire tenders managed to contain the blaze, which appeared to have been caused by a short circuit. September 27, 2025 Two women died of suffocation, and nine people were injured in a fire that erupted in a four-storey building in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA). Rescue officials said the fire erupted in a car showroom situated on the ground floor of the residential-cum-commercial building in DHA Phase-II and spread rapidly to other floors. Six fire tenders rushed to the scene and managed to control the blaze, which officials say was likely caused by a short circuit. September 9, 2025 At least four firemen and one cameraman of a private TV channel were injured when a fire destroyed a garment factory in New Karachi Industrial Area. The blaze erupted around 6:30am and the factory building collapsed around noon. Police say the presence of diesel drums compounded the fire, which spread rapidly and engulfed two more industrial units in its vicinity. The fire was eventually brought under control around 3:15pm. August 21, 2025 Six people died , and 33 were injured when a fire broke out in a warehouse near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex on MA Jinnah Road. The deaths were said to be a result of “multiple crush injuries and suffocation”, according to a medico-legal official. August 7, 2025 Eight people were injured in a massive factory fire at the EPZ that damaged three other factories. A total of 20 fire tenders with two snorkels, five ambulances and water bowsers were engaged in the fire that was controlled by 4pm after beginning at 10am. June 17, 2025 A massive fire that erupted in Millennium Mall, ostensibly due to an electrical short circuit, destroyed several hundred shops. While the blaze caused substantial financial loss, no one was killed or injured. The fire was controlled by over a dozen fire tenders of Rescue 1122 and KMC’s Fire Brigade. June 1, 2025 Eleven people were rescued, and no loss of life was reported when a fire broke out at the 12-storey Al-Rahim Tower on I.I. Chundrigar Road. The fire was apparently caused by a “short circuit” and spread through wiring in the building. Some employees climbed to the rooftop of the building, where they were rescued with the help of a snorkel, while four fire tenders managed to control the blaze after hectic efforts. The fire partially damaged one of the cars parked in the basement. April 10, 2025 A huge fire erupted in a factory inside the EPZ and was eventually contained with the help of five fire tenders and two water bowsers. All raw material present inside the factory, which was a plastic manufacturing industrial unit, was destroyed. No injuries or loss of life occurred since nobody was present in the factory at the time of the fire. March 10, 2025 A huge fire triggered by a cylinder explosion in an eatery in the afternoon destroyed 150 shops of a timber market on the Superhighway, although no one was hurt in the incident. February 15, 2025 Five members of the same family suffered critical burn wounds in an explosion caused by a leakage in a gas geyser in a four-storey house in Federal B Area’s Block 2 near Al-Falah Masjid. February 12, 2025 An abandoned restaurant at Do Darya in DHA Phase 8 was engulfed in a massive fire, which spread rapidly due to the restaurant’s wooden structure. It took four fire tenders to control the blaze, whose exact cause could not be ascertained immediately December 3, 2024 Two floors of the 13-storey Rimpa Plaza at M.A. Jinnah Road were completely destroyed, and another two were partially damaged when a fire erupted in the building, although no casualties were reported. Rescue 1122 said its fire and rescue team, along with two ambulances, four firetrucks, and a snorkel, eventually put out the blaze but initially faced difficulties “due to improper ventilation” in the building. September 11, 2024 A 55-year-old man died when a fire broke out at a residential building in Shah Faisal Colony Number 3. The blaze — the result of a cigarette being thrown near a petrol shop — was doused by a total of five fire brigade vehicles. August 16, 2024 A huge fire that broke out in an industrial unit in the SITE area was eventually controlled after hours-long efforts that caused one fireman to lose consciousness, although no loss of life was reported. Factory administration said that a high-tension wire passing above the factory snapped and fell on a gunny bag inside the industrial unit, which caught fire, spreading due to the presence of flammable material in the factory. July 8, 2024 A fire that broke out at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) building on I.I. Chundrigar Road led to the suspension of trading activity for around two hours, although no loss of life was reported. July 6, 2024 At least three people were hospitalised after being affected by smoke from a fire that erupted in a multi-storey building on Sharea Faisal, although no casualties were reported in the incident that took place at Kashif Centre. December 6, 2023 Three people were killed, and two suffered burn injuries when a fire broke out in a six-storey commercial and residential building on Main Shahrah-i-Pakistan near Ayesha Manzil in F.B Area. A total of 12 fire engines, two snorkels and two bowsers were needed to control the fire. November 25, 2023 Eleven people died, and 22 were injured in a fire at RJ Mall on Rashid Minhas Road, which officials blamed on a short circuit. Doctors and officials said the victims suffocated due to a lack of ventilation in the building. It took 12 fire engines, two snorkels and two bowsers to bring the fire under control. November 13, 2023 A 25-year-old woman suffered burn injuries after a fire erupted in the multi-storey Business and Finance Centre on I.I. Chundrigar Road, which had 300 offices and from which 2,000 employees were safely evacuated. It took 12 fire tenders to control the blaze. Police said initial reports suggested that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the electricity meters, although a K-Electric official claimed that the company’s electrical installations were found “intact and safe” with no damage to its substation. April 13, 2023 Four firefighters lost their lives , and 13 others were injured in a factory fire in New Karachi, resulting in significant damage to the building and its subsequent collapse.

      "summary_en": "The Gul Plaza inferno that erupted on Saturday night, killing at least 21 people and injuring several others, is one of the deadliest fires Karachi has witnessed in recent years. It is also the latest reminder of a grim and familiar pattern in a metropolis where fires routinely destroy homes, businesses and livelihoods. Across Pakistan, fires frequently break out in residential, commercial and industrial buildings due to a toxic mix of crumbling infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations and widespread negligence. Many structures lack basic fire exits, alarms and emergency response protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems sharply increase the risk of electrical short circuits. City planners and engineers estimate that around 70 per cent of Karachi’s residential, commercial and industrial buildings do not have an adequate fire safety system. Despite the frequency and scale of such incidents, accountability has remained elusive. Investigations are rarely concluded, recommendations are seldom implemented, and the same hazards persist, leaving citizens exposed to repeated tragedy. Below is a timeline of major fire incidents in Karachi over the past three years, showing how regularly the city is engulfed in flames — and how little appears to change. January 16, 2026 At least 20 containers were destroyed when a fire erupted at the Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT) at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT).  No casualties were reported as workers had gone for Friday prayers. A total of 20 fire tenders from the Rescue services, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) Fire Brigade, KPT and the Pakistan Navy brought the blaze under control within three hours. December 22, 2025 A fire broke out at the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in Landhi and was brought under control after several hours. No casualties were reported since factory workers had already left the building that evening. More than 15 fire tenders, including two snorkels, managed to control the fire by around 8:50pm. Cooling operations continued late into the night. December 4, 2025 The building of a garment factory in the EPZ collapsed after a fire erupted there, injuring two firefighters . November 23, 2025 A fire that broke out in a freight train at Cantt Station destroyed dried fruits, solar inverters and batteries inside the two bogies that were completely gutted. The same day, two people became unconscious due to smoke inhalation when a fire erupted in a high-rise building in the Soldier Bazaar area on Sunday evening. The shop where the fire erupted was destroyed in the blaze. November 2, 2025 No casualties were reported when a fire erupted near Munawar Chowrangi in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, although more than 300 huts were destroyed , along with motorcycles and sewing machines, while some goats were also killed. Four fire tenders managed to control the blaze in as many hours. Separately, a woman and her 25-year-old daughter were killed when a fire erupted inside a house near Shah Faisal Chowk in Orangi Town. October 27, 2025 One person was killed in a fire outside Karachi University, which engulfed a nearby graveyard, damaged some graves, and destroyed around 10-20 huts (makeshift houses). The fire also reached a nearby housing complex, which prompted citizens to vacate their flats. It took around 12 fire tenders to control the blaze. October 15, 2025 Five people, including two children, suffered burns when a fire erupted in a candle factory in the Sher Shah area, while one person was injured by a falling structure. The fire destroyed the industrial unit, as well as two nearby warehouses and four residential properties. October 8, 2025 No casualties were reported after a fire erupted in a plastic factory in Liaquatabad early in the morning. Three fire tenders managed to contain the blaze, which appeared to have been caused by a short circuit. September 27, 2025 Two women died of suffocation, and nine people were injured in a fire that erupted in a four-storey building in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA). Rescue officials said the fire erupted in a car showroom situated on the ground floor of the residential-cum-commercial building in DHA Phase-II and spread rapidly to other floors. Six fire tenders rushed to the scene and managed to control the blaze, which officials say was likely caused by a short circuit. September 9, 2025 At least four firemen and one cameraman of a private TV channel were injured when a fire destroyed a garment factory in New Karachi Industrial Area. The blaze erupted around 6:30am and the factory building collapsed around noon. Police say the presence of diesel drums compounded the fire, which spread rapidly and engulfed two more industrial units in its vicinity. The fire was eventually brought under control around 3:15pm. August 21, 2025 Six people died , and 33 were injured when a fire broke out in a warehouse near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex on MA Jinnah Road. The deaths were said to be a result of “multiple crush injuries and suffocation”, according to a medico-legal official. August 7, 2025 Eight people were injured in a massive factory fire at the EPZ that damaged three other factories. A total of 20 fire tenders with two snorkels, five ambulances and water bowsers were engaged in the fire that was controlled by 4pm after beginning at 10am. June 17, 2025 A massive fire that erupted in Millennium Mall, ostensibly due to an electrical short circuit, destroyed several hundred shops. While the blaze caused substantial financial loss, no one was killed or injured. The fire was controlled by over a dozen fire tenders of Rescue 1122 and KMC’s Fire Brigade. June 1, 2025 Eleven people were rescued, and no loss of life was reported when a fire broke out at the 12-storey Al-Rahim Tower on I.I. Chundrigar Road. The fire was apparently caused by a “short circuit” and spread through wiring in the building. Some employees climbed to the rooftop of the building, where they were rescued with the help of a snorkel, while four fire tenders managed to control the blaze after hectic efforts. The fire partially damaged one of the cars parked in the basement. April 10, 2025 A huge fire erupted in a factory inside the EPZ and was eventually contained with the help of five fire tenders and two water bowsers. All raw material present inside the factory, which was a plastic manufacturing industrial unit, was destroyed. No injuries or loss of life occurred since nobody was present in the factory at the time of the fire. March 10, 2025 A huge fire triggered by a cylinder explosion in an eatery in the afternoon destroyed 150 shops of a timber market on the Superhighway, although no one was hurt in the incident. February 15, 2025 Five members of the same family suffered critical burn wounds in an explosion caused by a leakage in a gas geyser in a four-storey house in Federal B Area’s Block 2 near Al-Falah Masjid. February 12, 2025 An abandoned restaurant at Do Darya in DHA Phase 8 was engulfed in a massive fire, which spread rapidly due to the restaurant’s wooden structure. It took four fire tenders to control the blaze, whose exact cause could not be ascertained immediately December 3, 2024 Two floors of the 13-storey Rimpa Plaza at M.A. Jinnah Road were completely destroyed, and another two were partially damaged when a fire erupted in the building, although no casualties were reported. Rescue 1122 said its fire and rescue team, along with two ambulances, four firetrucks, and a snorkel, eventually put out the blaze but initially faced difficulties “due to improper ventilation” in the building. September 11, 2024 A 55-year-old man died when a fire broke out at a residential building in Shah Faisal Colony Number 3. The blaze — the result of a cigarette being thrown near a petrol shop — was doused by a total of five fire brigade vehicles. August 16, 2024 A huge fire that broke out in an industrial unit in the SITE area was eventually controlled after hours-long efforts that caused one fireman to lose consciousness, although no loss of life was reported. Factory administration said that a high-tension wire passing above the factory snapped and fell on a gunny bag inside the industrial unit, which caught fire, spreading due to the presence of flammable material in the factory. July 8, 2024 A fire that broke out at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) building on I.I. Chundrigar Road led to the suspension of trading activity for around two hours, although no loss of life was reported. July 6, 2024 At least three people were hospitalised after being affected by smoke from a fire that erupted in a multi-storey building on Sharea Faisal, although no casualties were reported in the incident that took place at Kashif Centre. December 6, 2023 Three people were killed, and two suffered burn injuries when a fire broke out in a six-storey commercial and residential building on Main Shahrah-i-Pakistan near Ayesha Manzil in F.B Area. A total of 12 fire engines, two snorkels and two bowsers were needed to control the fire. November 25, 2023 Eleven people died, and 22 were injured in a fire at RJ Mall on Rashid Minhas Road, which officials blamed on a short circuit.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Monday called for a “new Pakistan”, which is democratic, where there is rule of law, and where there is no cruelty. Achakzai — who is on a four-day visit to Sindh along with a delegation of opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to mobilise the masses for a nationwide strike and protest rallies scheduled for February 8 — expressed these views while addressing lawyers at the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi. Apart from him, other TTAP leaders, including Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and PTI’s Asad Qaiser, also spoke at the seminar titled “Protecting the Basic Structure of the Constitution of Pakistan”. “Let’s make Pakistan a democratic country, a country where people have the power, and there is rule of law and the Constitution,” said Achakzai, adding that democracy had not been allowed to flourish in the country. “The country is ailing like a cancer patient.” “Let’s comply with the social contract with the people. Injustice breeds disharmony among people. We want the formation of a new Pakistan, where there is no cruelty.” He also said, “We are a group of decent people,” and that the line of respect should not be crossed in politics. Moreover, he stressed that small provinces had also rendered sacrifices in the freedom movement for Pakistan. “We are not here to fight people […] Countries are not run at gunpoint,” Achakzai further stated, adding that people of all races and languages should be treated equally. “Our country is facing difficulties because of rogue and arbitrary behaviours. [But] we don’t want a civil war,” he said. The opposition leader also mentioned that there was no accountability for the expenditure of funds received through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan. Speaking about the inferno at Karachi’s Gul Plaza shopping mall, he asked why the building did not have emergency exits. “The matter should be investigated and those responsible should be punished.” Achakzai also asserted that the PTI founder had won the 2024 general election and “blocking his way [to Parliament] is constitutionally and religiously wrong”. Saying that the “spirit of freedom his being crushed among the youth”, he urged people to stand up “against cruelty”. Moreover, he said the TTAP protesters would not resort to violence on February 8 and urged the people of Sindh to take to the streets. “We have come out to save the country, come join us,” he said, concluding his speech. Before him, TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas also addressed the seminar, saying that presently, the Constitution in the country was “controversial”. He criticised the incumbent government, maintaining that people were losing confidence in the rulers, and the public was facing oppression. “The entire system is being employed for unlawful acts,” he further alleged. The senator also mentioned Form 47 — an allusion to the alleged rigging in the 2024 general elections — saying that “some people had been given a fake mandate”. He further lamented the “weakening of the three pillars of the country”. While he did not specify the “three pillars”, this ostensibly was a reference to the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. Abbas said February 8 was a very important day, “when we will show the government the power of the people”. He also highlighted the importance of Pakistan’s location and called it the “heart of Asia”. The senator claimed that “global powers have always tried to keep [Pakistan] under their control”. PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “The way this country is being run, that makes progress impossible.” He also alleged that presently, there was government interference in lawyers’ bodies, claiming that efforts were being made to “weaken the voice of lawyers”. Qaiser regretted that the “executive has become an authority over the judiciary”, adding that the trust of people in the judiciary was eroding. “What option are people left with then?” he questioned. The PTI leader also lamented the “unfair distribution of resources” in the country, adding that the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan was “chaotic”. He further said the 1973 Constitution had been discarded, adding that “if you want to commit a robbery, why even let [people] vote?” Qaiser said the TTAP would need everyone’s support for the February 8 protest, the purpose of which was to “restore the judiciary and establish the Constitution’s supremacy”.",

      "summary_orig": "The devastating fire at Gul Plaza, a landmark shopping centre on Karachi’s MA Jinnah Road, is not merely an accident or an unfortunate lapse in safety compliance. It is a grim reminder that poor governance kills. As rescue operations continue and the death toll rises in the aftermath, what is already evident is that this tragedy was foreseeable, preventable, and rooted in institutional failure rather than fate. Gul Plaza was an old, densely packed commercial building with hundreds of shops spread across its basement and upper floors, with inadequate emergency exits and fire safety systems. Despite its prominence and heavy daily footfall, reports indicate that the building lacked critical emergency exits and fire-venting infrastructure — features that should have been enforced long ago by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). Ensuring compliance with these standards is not optional; it is the statutory responsibility of the authority charged with public safety. The question is not whether a short circuit or another trigger caused the fire; it is why a structure with known safety deficiencies was allowed to operate for decades. The answer lies in institutional decay and bad governance. Systemic rot To be fair to individual officers, the SBCA itself has been rendered structurally weak. Over the last several years, the post of director-general (DG) appears to have been treated as a portable office rather than a strategic leadership position. Multiple DGs have been rotated and replaced in rapid succession, without explanation and with tenures too short to allow meaningful enforcement. When leadership is unstable, accountability collapses. When enforcement depends on personal courage rather than institutional backing, violations become routine. This pattern reflects a deeper and more troubling reality: appointments and transfers at the SBCA appear to be driven less by considerations of competence, integrity, and public safety and more by pliability to vested interests. Officials who are perceived to attempt to enforce rules, resist illegal conversions, or block unsafe constructions are often seen to be sidelined; those who accommodate vested interests are seen to be rewarded. This is not governance; it is the deliberate hollowing out of regulatory institutions. In earlier writings, I have argued that bad governance promotes corruption and corruption can kill as surely as bombs and militancy. Corruption is not just about bribery; it is about the systematic erosion of norms and safeguards that protect citizens. When building safety codes are ignored with impunity, when regulators are neutralised by political interference, and when accountability is treated as an inconvenience, the results can be catastrophic. In that sense, corruption kills not only through direct theft but by tearing the safety net that holds society together. This form of institutional sabotage is far more insidious than isolated corruption because it becomes normalised. Over time, citizens come to expect that regulations exist only on paper, that enforcement is negotiable, and that compliance is secondary to convenience. Buildings become death traps not because the rules are unclear, but because enforcement has been deliberately neutralised. The rot runs deep The problem is not confined to Karachi. In medium-sized cities such as Hyderabad and Sukkur, and in smaller towns like Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas, and Dadu, master plans are routinely seen to be ignored, residential areas reportedly converted into commercial hubs, and low-rise plots somehow become multi-storey buildings in violation of regulations. Whenever a conscientious officer is seen to enforce planning laws or court-approved master plans, it seemingly results in their swift transfer. This brings us to the question of accountability. Policymakers who sanction frequent, unexplained transfers of regulatory heads must be held responsible for the consequences of their decisions. When leadership instability becomes systemic, it is no longer an administrative matter; it is a policy choice. And when that choice leads to loss of life, accountability cannot stop at lower-level officials or building owners. In countries that take governance seriously, such failures trigger criminal inquiries reaching the highest levels of decision-making. In Pakistan, prime ministers have been removed for alleged legal violations. Why, then, is it unthinkable to hold chief secretaries, ministers, or heads of regulatory bodies meaningfully accountable when repeated governance failures result in deaths? Courts have taken suo motu notice of far less consequential matters. Will they now intervene where human lives have been lost? The case for accountability Governance is a trust delegated by voters and taxpayers. In an age defined by technology, global competition, and data-driven decision-making, citizens have every right to demand competence, integrity, and continuity in public institutions. Development projects may still be launched and ribbon-cuttings may continue, but at what cost? Putting unqualified or seemingly compromised individuals in charge of complex regulatory systems is like entrusting a multi-billion-rupee project to someone chosen for obedience rather than expertise. Something may be built, but it will not be safe, sustainable, or worthy of public trust. The fire at Gul Plaza should mark a turning point. Bad governance is not a soft concept — it is a profound threat to life and dignity. Institutional decay weakens national resilience just as surely as any external threat. In another previous newspaper article, I had argued that those who destroy institutions from within, who prioritise pliability over professionalism, and who treat regulatory enforcement as negotiable are not merely negligent; they are intentionally undermining the foundations of the state . If this tragedy does not prompt serious accountability and structural reform, it will not be the last. And the next fire, collapse, or disaster will again be described as an accident — until we finally accept that bad governance at the highest policymaking levels is the real culprit.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump’s government has asked countries to pay $1 billion for a permanent spot on his “ Board of Peace ” aimed at resolving conflicts, according to US media reports. The White House has asked various world leaders to sit on the board, chaired by Trump himself, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban and Canada’s Mark Carney. Member countries — represented on the board by their head of state — would be allowed to join for three years, or longer if they contributed more than $1 billion within the first year, according to Bloomberg , which first reported the sum. “Each member state shall serve a term of no more than three years from this charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the chairman,” stated the board’s draft charter obtained by Bloomberg and other media. “The three-year membership term shall not apply to member states that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.” The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but its charter, widely cited by US media, does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory. The White House said there would be a main board, a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern the war-wracked territory, and a second “executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role. “The Board of Peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” the charter says. ‘Failed institutions’ The document was sent to dozens of world leaders who were invited to join the board, The Times of Israel reported. It appears to take a swipe at international institutions such as the United Nations, saying that the board should have “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”. Trump has regularly criticised the United Nations and announced this month that his country will withdraw from 66 global organisations and treaties — roughly half affiliated with the UN. Membership of the board would be “limited to states invited to participate by the chairman”, according to the full draft charter published by the Times of Israel . Trump would have the power to remove member states from the board, subject to a veto by two-thirds of members, and choose his replacement should he leave his role as chairman. The “Board of Peace” began to take shape on Saturday as the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, Argentina and Canada were asked to join . Trump also named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff as members. Israel has objected to the line-up of a “Gaza executive board” to operate under the body, which includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi. Putin invited to join ‘Board of Peace’: Kremlin Separately, Russia said it was seeking to “clarify all the nuances” of the offer with Washington, without adding if the Kremlin chief was inclined to join. Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told AFP in an interview that Putin “also received an invitation to join this Board of Peace”. Moscow for years tried to balance relations with all major players in the Middle East — including Israel and the Palestinians. But since the conflict in Gaza and Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Putin has moved away from Israel, boosting ties with its foes like Iran. Moscow has also sought closer relationships with the Gulf states amid growing Western isolation. The White House has reached out to various figures around the world, including Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif , to sit on the so-called “Board of Peace”, chaired by the US president himself. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump talk during a bilateral meeting at the G20 leaders summit in Osaka, Japan, June 28, 2019. — Reuters/File Putin has previously praised Trump’s efforts to resolve conflicts. “He’s really doing a lot to resolve these complex crises, which have lasted for years, even decades,” Putin said last October. Referring to the situation in the Middle East, Putin said: “If we succeed in achieving everything Donald has strived for, it will be a historic event.” The assault on Ukraine and the conflict in Gaza have strained Moscow’s traditionally good relations with Israel, home to a large Russian-born community. The Kremlin has repeatedly criticised Israel’s response to the October 7 attacks and called for restraint. “The Gaza Strip is experiencing a humanitarian catastrophe in the full sense of the word,” Putin was quoted as saying by the news agency RIA Novosti at a meeting with Palestinian leader Mahmud Abbas last May. “Russia, as a friend of the Palestinian people, is trying to provide regular assistance,” the Russian president added.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday granted lawyer and activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, one-day protective bail in relation to their arrest warrants in a case linked to controversial social media posts. The case has been registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production. Justice Azam Khan of the IHC took up the petition today and stayed the arrest of Mazari and Chattha until tomorrow. Lawyer Kamran Murtaza, who represented the couple, informed the court that their bail had twice been cancelled. “Now an order has been issued to arrest them,” he said. He maintained that “if there were any misdoings on his client’s part, the judge should demonstrate patience”. “The judge is holding hearings every 15 minutes,” he said.“Imaan is a woman, and she has been sick,” he added. Earlier in the day, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had directed authorities to obtain a search warrant for Mazari and Chattha. As the hearing at the sessions court resumed after two sittings, the prosecutor informed the session court that the two accused now have protective bail in the IHC and were ordered to appear before the court tomorrow. The judge adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow. Judge Majoka directed that the accused should be presented in the sessions court “within one hour of the appearance at IHC”. The judge also refused to entertain a request from the assistant counsel for adjournment till the day after tomorrow, stating that the counsel had taken “undue advantage” and no concession would be provided. Judge Majoka expresses displeasure During the hearing earlier today, judge Majoka expressed displeasure over why the accused had not yet been arrested. He directed the NCCIA officials to obtain a search warrant for the accused’s residence from a magistrate and ordered them to present Mazari and Chattha in court by 11am. When the hearing resumed, National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials, police officials, and special prosecutors appeared before the court. The court was informed that the arrest had not yet been made. NCCIA officials and police sought further time to submit a report regarding the arrest. Judge Majoka then adjourned the hearing till 2pm, warning that “whoever’s report is unsatisfactory, action will be taken against them”. On Saturday, the court reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mazari and Chattha for their repeated absences from trial proceedings. In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Judge Majoka noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the NCCIA. During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest. At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad high court. The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused. Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants. The case The case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",

On Saturday, the court reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mazari and Chattha for their repeated absences from trial proceedings. In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Judge Majoka noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the NCCIA. During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest. At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad high court. The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused. Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants. The case The case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",
      "title": "Social media posts case: IHC grants Imaan, Hadi one-day protective bail",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday granted lawyer and activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, one-day protective bail in relation to their arrest warrants in a case linked to controversial social media posts. The case has been registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), in which the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. On January 17, Mazari and Chattha challenged their arrest orders in the IHC, arguing that the trial court had unlawfully curtailed their right of defence, issued arrest warrants without fulfilling mandatory legal requirements, and ordered judicial custody along with virtual production. Justice Azam Khan of the IHC took up the petition today and stayed the arrest of Mazari and Chattha until tomorrow. Lawyer Kamran Murtaza, who represented the couple, informed the court that their bail had twice been cancelled. “Now an order has been issued to arrest them,” he said. He maintained that “if there were any misdoings on his client’s part, the judge should demonstrate patience”. “The judge is holding hearings every 15 minutes,” he said.“Imaan is a woman, and she has been sick,” he added. Earlier in the day, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had directed authorities to obtain a search warrant for Mazari and Chattha. As the hearing at the sessions court resumed after two sittings, the prosecutor informed the session court that the two accused now have protective bail in the IHC and were ordered to appear before the court tomorrow. The judge adjourned the proceedings until tomorrow. Judge Majoka directed that the accused should be presented in the sessions court “within one hour of the appearance at IHC”. The judge also refused to entertain a request from the assistant counsel for adjournment till the day after tomorrow, stating that the counsel had taken “undue advantage” and no concession would be provided. Judge Majoka expresses displeasure During the hearing earlier today, judge Majoka expressed displeasure over why the accused had not yet been arrested. He directed the NCCIA officials to obtain a search warrant for the accused’s residence from a magistrate and ordered them to present Mazari and Chattha in court by 11am. When the hearing resumed, National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials, police officials, and special prosecutors appeared before the court. The court was informed that the arrest had not yet been made. NCCIA officials and police sought further time to submit a report regarding the arrest. Judge Majoka then adjourned the hearing till 2pm, warning that “whoever’s report is unsatisfactory, action will be taken against them”.

      "summary_orig": "A contingent of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) arrived in Saudi Arabia to take part in a multinational aerial combat exercise, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release on Monday. The PAF contingent, comprising F-16 Block-52 fighter aircraft alongside dedicated air and ground crew, arrived at King Abdulaziz Air Base, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to participate in the multinational aerial combat exercise ‘Spears of Victory 2026’. “The exercise is witnessing the participation of fighter jets and combat support elements from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, France, Italy, Greece, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America,” the ISPR said. “It offers a robust platform to enhance interoperability, operational synergy, mutual understanding and capacity building among participating air forces, particularly in large force employment, night composite air operations, integrated ISR (Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance), and operations in advanced electronic warfare environments.” Through participation in this multinational forum, the PAF seeks to enhance interoperability with partner air forces and “validate its operational preparedness in a contested, technology-driven battle space”. The military’s media wing elaborated that PAF fighter aircraft undertook a non-stop flight from their home base in Pakistan to Saudi Arabia, “demonstrating the long-range operational reach and expeditionary capabilities of Pakistan Air Force”. “During the conduct of the exercise, PAF pilots flying advanced F-16 Block-52 aircraft equipped with modern avionics and Beyond Visual Range capabilities will be pitched against air crews of participating air forces operating a wide array of sophisticated combat aircraft,” it added. The ISPR further said that the participation of the PAF contingent in the exercise not only reflected its firm commitment to regional and international military cooperation, but also underscored its “professional excellence and proven capability to operate effectively in diverse and demanding operational environments alongside leading contemporary air forces”. In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies , with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.",

According to Regional Police Officer (RPO) Bahawalpur Ghazi Muhammad Salahuddin, Rahim Yar Khan police had cordoned off Kacha Rajwani, with contingents from Rajanpur (Punjab) and Ghotki (Sindh) taking part. Sindh police and Rangers were also conducting action in adjoining riverine areas. He said 1,700 police personnel had been deployed along with eight drone teams, six bulletproof vehicles and three armoured personnel carriers. Modern technology was being used to ensure effective progress and restore law and order in the area, he said, adding that police were conducting action against criminal elements under a coordinated and well-planned strategy. The RPO clarified that suspects who renounce criminal activities and voluntarily surrender to the police would not be engaged in encounters and would be produced before the courts in accordance with the law. However, criminals have been strictly warned to lay down their arms and surrender. He further emphasised that the operation would continue until the writ of the government was fully established in the riverine areas. District Police Officer (DPO) Rahim Yar Khan Irfan Ali Samo stated that action against criminals was ongoing and that ensuring the safety of the lives and property of the public remained the top priority. According to details, police with a heavy contingent and full combat equipment have launched a decisive operation against bandits after cordoning off the areas of Machka and Kacha Rajwani. Earlier this month, the Sindh government announced a “massive” operation against dacoits in the katcha areas of the province, vowing to eliminate them through the use of state force. Speaking to reporters after presiding over a high-level meeting on the law and order situation in the Sukkur and Larkana ranges, Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said it had been decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”. “We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits you see on social media,” he said, adding that special focus would be placed on Sukkur and Larkana. Mr Lanjar stressed that dacoits would be given a chance to lay down their arms and join the national mainstream. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them. There will be a fight and they will be eliminated through the use of state force,” he warned. The home minister thanked the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation in which a no-go katcha area was vaca­ted. He said individuals kidnapped from Sindh were recovered from Punjab with the full cooperation of the Rangers and other security agencies. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2026",
