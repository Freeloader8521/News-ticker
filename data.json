      "title_orig": "Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza resigns from LHC following 27th Amendment",
      "summary_orig": "Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza on Saturday tendered his resignation as a judge of the Lahore High Court (LHC), becoming the first judge to resign from any high court after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was enacted into law. According to family sources, his resignation letter stated that in light of the latest amendment to the Constitution, he could not continue in good conscience. Justice Mirza was appointed as an additional judge of the LHC in March 2014, and his superannuation was due on March 6, 2028. He is a brother-in-law of PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja. He is the son of late Justice Zia Mehmood Mirza , a former Supreme Court judge who delivered the famous and only dissenting opinion among seven judges in the case of Benazir Bhutto vs President of Pakistan. Justice Mirza’s resignation comes two days after the passage of the contentious 27th Amendment, which has been assailed as a “ flagrant attack ” on judicial independence by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ). The move also follows the resignations of the Supreme Court’s senior puisne judge, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, and Justice Athar Minallah, both of whom wrote strongly worded resignation letters censuring the 27th Amendment. Amid speculation about possible transfers of high court judges, Justices Mohsin Akhtar Ka­­­yani and Saman Rafat Imtiaz of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) have hinted they might not be available to hear cases in the federal capital from next month. 27th Amendment and its impact on judiciary The 27th Amendment, besides bringing changes in other domains , alters the judiciary’s functioning in two areas — constitutional matters and the transfer of judges. The legislation empowers the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan to transfer high court judges without their consent — a provision that has raised concerns with­­in sections of the judiciary. The most notable decision made by the ruling coalition is the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which experts say has dethroned the Supreme Court as the country’s highest judicial forum. The reason for those concerns is that the FCC will now deal with crucial constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday paid a visit to the Cadet College in Wana, where an attack was thwarted earlier this week, saying that elements from “across the border” were responsible for terrorist incidents. In remarks which were televised, Naqvi told tribal elders gathered at the college during his visit that several officials from Pakistan — including himself, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Defence Minister Asif Khawaja — had spoken to Afghanistan about the issue of terrorism. “We repeatedly told them one thing: terrorism should be stopped. Do not destroy the peace in our country,” he said. The minister further said that Pakistan’s economic indicators and its relations with other countries were headed in the right direction. However, elements from “across the border” came to the country to carry out attacks, he said. He also referred to the suicide blast in Islamabad on Tuesday, saying that elements from “across the border” were involved. “Our local people aren’t used [to carry out these attacks],” the minister said. “For some time now, you can see none of the attacks have been carried out by a local citizen,” he said. According to a handout issued by the interior ministry, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Frontier Corps (South) Inspector General Major General Mehr Omar Khan had welcomed the minister at the college. During his visit, Naqvi met officers and soldiers from the Pakistan Army, who had participated in foiling the attack, and also met students and faculty members from the college. The statement said that Naqvi also announced that the college would be renovated, adding that the Pakistan Army and FC had set a remarkable example of bravery and professionalism by safely rescuing all students and teachers.\n‎\n“The enemy wanted to execute an Army Public School -like attack, but our brave soldiers foiled the attempt, sending the terrorists to hell and defeating the conspiracy,” he was quoted as saying. “These are savages who have no link with humanity. No faith permits targeting children, and these beasts have no religion. Calling them human is an insult to humanity,” he said. Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. In November 2022 , the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.",

      "summary_orig": "At least nine people were killed and 32 injured in an “accidental explosion” at the Nowgam police station in India-occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar when confiscated explosives detonated late last night, authorities said on Saturday. Most of those killed were policemen and forensic team officials who were extracting samples from a large cache of explosives seized earlier this week in Haryana state, the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) said. The Ministry of Home Affairs confirmed the casualties, PTI reported . The ministry’s joint secretary, Prashant Lokhande, said the cause of the incident was being investigated and any other speculation into the cause of the blast was unnecessary. Both the region’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and Director General of Police Nalin Prabhat termed the incident “accidental”. The governor said he has ordered a “probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion”, while the police chief also stressed, “Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary.” “Due to the sensitive and unstable nature of the recovered material, the sampling and examination were being carried out with extreme caution. Despite all precautions, an accidental blast occurred last night,” the police officer was quoted as saying by The Hindu . “The building of the police station has been severely damaged and the adjacent buildings have been affected,” he added. “Small successive explosions” prevented immediate rescue operations by the bomb disposal squad, the PTI stated. Indian security forces arrive near the site of an explosion inside a police station in Srinagar, India-occupied Kashmir on Nov 15, 2025. — Reuters The local police have also dismissed reports of a group named as People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) claiming responsibility or of any other foreign link as “patently false, baseless and mischievous”. According to the PTI , those killed in the incident included three people from the Forensic Science Laboratory, two from the revenue department, two police photographers, a member of the State Investigation Agency and a tailor. At least 24 police personnel and three civilians were admitted to various hospitals in Srinagar, PTI quoted officials as saying. Some of the bodies had been “completely burnt”, a police source told Reuters . “The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station.” Raids in IoK following Delhi blast The blast comes four days after a deadly car explosion in Delhi, which killed at least eight people in what India has called a “ terror incident ”. India’s anti-terrorism National Investigation Agency is leading the probe into the blast, but so far,  officials have given little further information on who the perpetrators might be — and whether it was a homegrown group or had links from abroad. Indian media have widely connected the November 10 blast with a string of arrests just hours before, when they claimed to have seized explosive materials and assault rifles. Indian police have carried out sweeping raids in occupied Kashmir since Wednesday. There has been no confirmation that the searches this week are connected to the New Delhi explosion, but the raids represent a renewed effort by police to tighten security after the incident. Officers also raided Al-Falah University in Faridabad, while security forces on Friday demolished a house in occupied Kashmir’s Pulwama district.",

At least 24 police personnel and three civilians were admitted to various hospitals in Srinagar, PTI quoted officials as saying. Some of the bodies had been “completely burnt”, a police source told Reuters . “The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station.” Raids in IoK following Delhi blast The blast comes four days after a deadly car explosion in Delhi, which killed at least eight people in what India has called a “ terror incident ”. India’s anti-terrorism National Investigation Agency is leading the probe into the blast, but so far,  officials have given little further information on who the perpetrators might be — and whether it was a homegrown group or had links from abroad. Indian media have widely connected the November 10 blast with a string of arrests just hours before, when they claimed to have seized explosive materials and assault rifles. Indian police have carried out sweeping raids in occupied Kashmir since Wednesday. There has been no confirmation that the searches this week are connected to the New Delhi explosion, but the raids represent a renewed effort by police to tighten security after the incident. Officers also raided Al-Falah University in Faridabad, while security forces on Friday demolished a house in occupied Kashmir’s Pulwama district.",

Team incharges asked to submit reports to chief security officer of their respective division on daily basis In a directive, the senior superintendent of police operations said in line with the government’s orders, the police crackdown against illegal Afghan nationals was continuing, but the police performance regard was disappointing. Keeping in view this, the police have established a task force tasked with apprehending illegal Afghan nationals and shifting them to the holding centres on a daily basis. The concerned police officials (Muharrars) have been directed not to assign any other duty to those selected as members of the special units. A pro forma was also distributed among the special team in-charges regarding arresting illegal Afghan nationals and submitting their findings by 9pm to the chief security officer of their respective division on a regular basis. During the last two days, the Rawalpindi police along with Special Branch, CTD and City Traffic Police conducted search and strike operations to arrest Afghan nationals illegally residing in the garrison city. As many as 92 Afghan nationals illegally residing in the garrison city were detained, while eight cases were registered against landlords and tenants who did not register their tenancy details with the concerned police station. Police on Friday conducted search operations in different areas and checked 1,123 houses, 336 shops, 49 hotels, two inns and the particulars of a total of 1,524 people, a police spokesman said. He said that during the search operations, 92 illegal Afghan residents were detained. Eight cases were registered against landlords and tenants who failed to register their tenancy details. The search operations were conducted in the areas of Kallar Syedan, Rawat, Gujar Khan, Chontra, Dhamial, Mandra, Kahuta, Chakri, Pirwadhai, Ratta Amral, Ganjmandi, City, Waris Khan, Banni, New Town and Sadiqabad. The operations were aimed at establishing peace and order and rooting out crime. The police spokesman said that all resources were being used to establish the rule of law and maintain peace and order. Meanwhile, a man was gunned down by two unidentified motorcycle riders in the RA Bazaar Police Station area on Friday night, police said. Initial police reports suggested that Adalat Khan, a resident of Tehsil Havelian, Abbottabad, had booked a ride for Ghaziabad. While he was travelling on a motorcycle and reached the PSO Pump on Ghaziabad Street, two unknown individuals arrived on another motorcycle and opened fire with a pistol. As a result, Adalat Khan was critically injured and died on the spot. The attackers managed to escape from the scene. Police have launched an investigation into the murder.

The concerned police officials (Muharrars) have been directed not to assign any other duty to those selected as members of the special units. A pro forma was also distributed among the special team in-charges regarding arresting illegal Afghan nationals and submitting their findings by 9pm to the chief security officer of their respective division on a regular basis. During the last two days, the Rawalpindi police along with Special Branch, CTD and City Traffic Police conducted search and strike operations to arrest Afghan nationals illegally residing in the garrison city. As many as 92 Afghan nationals illegally residing in the garrison city were detained, while eight cases were registered against landlords and tenants who did not register their tenancy details with the concerned police station. Police on Friday conducted search operations in different areas and checked 1,123 houses, 336 shops, 49 hotels, two inns and the particulars of a total of 1,524 people, a police spokesman said. He said that during the search operations, 92 illegal Afghan residents were detained. Eight cases were registered against landlords and tenants who failed to register their tenancy details. The search operations were conducted in the areas of Kallar Syedan, Rawat, Gujar Khan, Chontra, Dhamial, Mandra, Kahuta, Chakri, Pirwadhai, Ratta Amral, Ganjmandi, City, Waris Khan, Banni, New Town and Sadiqabad. The operations were aimed at establishing peace and order and rooting out crime. The police spokesman said that all resources were being used to establish the rule of law and maintain peace and order. Meanwhile, a man was gunned down by two unidentified motorcycle riders in the RA Bazaar Police Station area on Friday night, police said. Initial police reports suggested that Adalat Khan, a resident of Tehsil Havelian, Abbottabad, had booked a ride for Ghaziabad. While he was travelling on a motorcycle and reached the PSO Pump on Ghaziabad Street, two unknown individuals arrived on another motorcycle and opened fire with a pistol. As a result, Adalat Khan was critically injured and died on the spot. The attackers managed to escape from the scene. Police have launched an investigation into the murder.

The terrorists killed in Bazid Khel village of Darra Adam Khel on Thursday late night were identified as Muhammad Qasim, Shahid and Sahir alias Pata, all belonging to the Saad alias Shah Gul group, the officials said, adding that they were involved in attacks on police, including the killing of Constable Younis on Sept 17. Sahir was also involved in an attack on a police check post in Tor Chappar on Oct 6, in which Constable Bahadar was martyred. District Police Officer Shehbaz Elahi said the SHO of Muhammad Riaz Shaheed police station was on routine patrol when unknown gunmen opened fire at 1:22am. Police retaliated, leading to an intense exchange of fire that resulted in the killing of the three terrorists. Weapons were recovered from them. In Karak district, the CTD killed another terrorist in the Banda Daud Shah area on Thursday night. District police spokesman Shaukatullah said CTD personnel were conducting an operation in the mountainous region when they came across a group of terrorists. Mortar strike claims young girl’s life in Tirah An intense firefight ensued, with the militants using light and heavy weapons. After the firing stopped, law enforcement personnel searched the area and found the body of a terrorist identified as Suleman alias Akram, a resident of Kohat. He was wanted in several terrorism cases, including attacks on SNGPL installations. Girl killed Meanwhile, a girl was killed and eight people were injured in two separate bombing incidents in Tirah valley over the past two days. Sources said the eight-year-old girl died in Bar Qambarkhel when a mortar shell struck a house on Wednesday night. In another incident, eight persons were injured when an explosive device dropped from a quadcopter struck a wedding ceremony in the Shalobar area. The injured were taken to Mishti hospital in Orakzai district and later referred to Peshawar for further treatment. It could not be confirmed who operated the quadcopter, though security forces have previously accused militants of using such devices to target their positions. Meanwhile, unidentified gunmen abducted an engineer and two dam workers from the Mamanrry dam area in Bara on Thursday night. Sources said no group had claimed responsibility and the motive was unclear. The engineer had been hired by a private firm to conduct a survey. In Landi Kotal, a man was injured when a pistol accidentally discharged in the Ziyarrhai area on Friday. He was taken to Landi Kotal Hospital, where his condition was stated to be out of danger.

Perhaps the judges realised that it was futile to expect different results in the prevailing environment.

Senior justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah gracefully resigned once it became clear that the deeply contentious 27th Amendment would now be considered law . Critics say the amendment, which has reconfigured the country’s justice system to place a new Federal Constitutional Court above all other forums of justice, has reduced the Supreme Court to no more than a glorified district court. Given the extensive powers handed over to the FCC, that assessment is not off the mark. Rather than be rendered second-class judges, they may have thought it fit to depart with their prestige intact. It would also have been clear to the judges, given the precedent set with the Constitutional Bench, that the regime would not be interested in picking independent-minded judges for the new court. Some have criticised their decision, asking why they did not exit at the time of the 26th Amendment , which set the foundations for the 27th. The judges may answer that eventually, but one cannot fault them for not having tried to effect change from within their institution. Over time, it has become clear that no rule applies in the present set-up. Without rules, no change can ever be possible. The 27th Amendment was designed to be the end of the line for such judges. This brings us to the civilian role in this coup. This is not the first instance when the powers that be have sought to subjugate the judiciary, but it is the first time a civilian dispensation has so extensively facilitated the effort. The lack of courage and commitment shown to democratic ideals from those who, till yesterday, would not tire of speaking about the supremacy of the will of the people has only highlighted the hypocrisies of our political system. This lack of conviction in the idea of a fair system of governance will have grave consequences. That much is inevitable. Published in Dawn, November 15th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Global watchdog ranks country 27th out of 100 • India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh fared better • China, Iran and Russia at bottom ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked 27th out of 100 — ‘Not Free’ — in terms of internet freedom by a global democracy watchdog in a recent report, which cited government measures to expand censorship practices. During June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025, the report issued by the US-based Freedom House noted that the authorities threatened to block virtual private networks (VPNs) and adopted amendments to the country’s cybercrime law that rights groups said could be abused. On the other hand, countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh are markedly more open, classified as ‘Partly Free’, with much higher freedom scores of 51, 53, and 45, respectively. The watchdog was unable to track Afghanistan’s score. The countries placed at the bottom are China, Myanmar, Iran and Russia with scores of 9, 9, 13¸and 17, respectively. The watchdog noted that governments in the countries that suffered the most extreme declines over the 15 years of global deterioration in internet freedom — Pakistan, Egypt, Russia, Turkiye, and Venezuela — intensified their control over the online environment in response to challenges to their rule. Between 2011 to 2015, Pakistan’s internet freedom deteriorated sharply, plunging from 55 to 69. From 2012 onwards, the status moved from ‘Partly Free’ to ‘Not Free’, reflecting increasing restrictions. “Pakistanis reported periods of poor internet quality and disruptions to their access to WhatsApp, Signal, and other platforms throughout the coverage period,” the report noted. “Researchers found that the connectivity disruptions were likely linked to the deployment of new website monitoring and blocking technology,” it added. It noted that in November last year, the authorities restricted internet services across Islamabad as widespread protests in support of former prime minister Imran Khan took place. “[Imran] Khan was imprisoned throughout the coverage period.” It continued that the platform became accessible during a four-day military conflict between Pakistan and India , which followed a terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. It maintained that “the military establishment sought to curtail the influence” of the PTI founder and his party. VPNs The report noted that in May this year, Pakistani officials unblocked X (formerly Twitter), which had been restricted since February 2024. “Authorities repeatedly threatened to block VPNs operating in Pakistan without registration. Registration requirements released in Nov 2024 required the disclosure of information identifying customers; however, at the end of the month authorities said they would not block unregistered VPN connections,” the report noted. “The development reportedly came after the law ministry found that the government lacked legal standing to block VPNs.” The watchdog noted that amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) signed into law in January 2025 contained ambiguous language rights groups said could be used to remove online speech deemed undesirable by authorities. It added that at least five people were sentenced to death during the coverage period after being convicted of blasphemy in connection with material posted online. The report noted that Pakistan held regular elections under a competitive multiparty system. “However, the military exerts enormous influence over the conduct of elections, government formation, and policies; intimidates the media; and enjoys impunity for indiscriminate or extralegal use of force,” it added. Of the 72 countries assessed in Freedom on the Net 2025, conditions deteriorated in 28, while 17 countries registered overall gains. “The authorities often impose selective restrictions on civil liberties. Militants conduct terrorist campaigns against the state and also regularly carry out attacks on members of religious minority groups and other perceived opponents.” Global situation Overall, it noted that the global internet freedom decli­ned for the 15th consecutive year. Kenya experienced the most severe decline of the coverage period, after authorities responded to nationwide protests over tax policy in June 2024 by shutting down internet connectivity for around seven hours and arresting hundreds of protesters.

      "summary_orig": "• Asia suffered 47pc of total losses over 33 years • Floods in Pakistan affected 9m people, destroyed crops on large scale ISLAMABAD: Disasters have caused an estimated $3.26 trillion in agricultural losses worldwide over the past 33 years — an average of $99 billion annually, or roughly four per cent of global agricultural GDP — according to a new report released by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) on Friday. The report, titled Impact of Disasters on Agriculture and Food Security 2025 , highlights how digital technologies are transforming the way farmers, governments and communities monitor risks, anticipate impacts and protect livelihoods. “The global agricultural sector stands at a critical juncture, facing an unprecedented convergence of disasters, while simultaneously witnessing remarkable advances in digital technologies that offer new possibilities for understanding, predicting and managing disaster risks,” it added. Between 1991 and 2023, disasters wiped out 4.6bn tonnes of cereals, 2.8bn tonnes of fruits and vegetables, and 900m tonnes of meat and dairy. These losses translate to a daily per capita reduction of 320 kilocalories — 13-16pc of average energy needs, the report estimated. The FAO report said Asia accounts for the largest share of global losses of 47pc, totaling $1.53tr, reflecting both the scale of agricultural production and the region’s high exposure to floods, storms and droughts. In Pakistan, monsoon floods affected over 9m people and destroyed 849,000 hectares of crops, coming just one year after the catastrophic 2022 floods from which the country is still recovering. The consecutive flooding events have fundamentally altered Pakistan’s agricultural landscape, with soil erosion, salinisation and infrastructure destruction creating long-term challenges for agricultural recovery. The report identified digital transformation as a game-changer for agricultural disaster risk reduction. Emerging tools such as artificial intelligence (AI), remote sensing, mobile connectivity, drones and sensors are now enabling hyperlocal, real-time insights that improve early warning, advisory services, risk transfer mechanisms and anticipatory action. “Digital technologies are already revolutionising how we monitor risks, deliver early warnings and support farmers’ decision-making. From the 9.1m farmers now accessing parametric insurance through digital platforms to the communities using our early warning systems to evacuate 90pc of at-risk populations before disasters strike, we are witnessing a fundamental shift from reactive response to proactive risk reduction,” said FAO Director General QU Dongyu. Losses in production resulting from disasters correspond to a reduced availability of 320 kcal per person per day globally, with iron losses corresponding to 60pc of requirements for men and critical shortfalls in essential vitamins and minerals that have the potential to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. According to the report, disaster impacts on agriculture extend far beyond immediate production losses to include infrastructure damage, market disruptions, financial system failures and ecosystem service degradation that can persist for years after initial events. Current assessment tools must be extended to systematically capture both direct and indirect impacts and take into consideration non-economic values, differentiated effects on vulnerable groups, biodiversity losses and long-term ecosystem disruptions, it said. Marine heatwaves alone are estimated to have caused $6.6bn in fisheries losses (1985-2022), with 15pc of global fisheries affected and production losses exceeding 5.6m tonnes, demonstrating the severe yet largely unmeasured impacts on aquatic food systems.

      "summary_orig": "Babar Azam finally ended his 807-day wait for a One-day International century, scoring an unbeaten 102 to lead Pakistan to an eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the second match at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Friday, sealing the three-match series with a game to spare. The former Pakistan skipper, under intense scrutiny after 83 innings without a three-figure score, struck eight boundaries in a 119-ball innings that blended patience with poise. He reached his milestone in the 47th over, pulling pacer Pramod Madushan to midwicket for a single, before collapsing to his knees in prostration and embracing Mohammad Rizwan at the non-striker’s end. The Rawalpindi crowd erupted, having waited long for this moment. Reaching the milestone, Babar equalled former opener Saeed Anwar’s record for the most ODI hundreds for Pakistan — 20 centuries. Rizwan played the ideal supporting role, remaining unbeaten on 51 off 54 balls, hitting five fours and a six. The pair added an unbroken 112 for the third wicket, guiding Pakistan across the finish line two balls into the 49th over. The chase began explosively. Openers Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman raced to 77-0 in the Powerplay. Saim smashed 33 off 25 balls (five fours and a six) before holing out to mid-off off pacer Dushmantha Chameera in the 10th over. Fakhar, dropped thrice, anchored with 78 off 93 balls (eight fours and six) before falling to a superb low catch by Janith Liyanage at short midwicket off Chameera in the 31st. Sri Lanka’s fielding lapses proved decisive. Fakhar survived a skier spilled by substitute Pavan Rathnayake, a miscued loft dropped by Asitha Fernando at long-off off Charith Asalanka, and an earlier edge. These errors allowed Pakistan to maintain momentum on a pitch offering little after early swing. Chameera was Sri Lanka’s only wicket-taker, finishing with 2-58 in 10 overs. The rest struggled: Asitha Fernando leaked 66 in 8.2 overs without success, Pramod Madushan conceded 62 in eight, while Wanindu Hasaranga, usually a threat, went wicketless for 35 in 10. Captain Asalanka’s part-time spin and Janith Liyanage’s medium pace offered no control. Babar, initially cautious, grew in confidence. He reached fifty off 66 balls with a short-arm jab through point, then accelerated with trademark cover drives and pulls. Rizwan, joining at 177-2, rotated strike expertly before raising his fifty with a steer to deep midwicket. The winning runs came off Asitha in the 49th over — Babar guiding a low full toss to cover. The pair walked off grinning, series sealed. Earlier, having starred with the ball in the opener, Haris Rauf was at it again as Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to 288-8. The pacer, who finished with 3-66, responded each time when called upon, especially when Sri Lanka were threatening to post an even bigger total where he picked up two quick wickets to snuff out their hopes. Haris’ spell at the end came after leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed (3-41) had ripped through Sri Lanka’s top order; their exploits giving Pakistan a good chance of wrapping up the series despite a valiant half century by Liyanage and a counter-punching 44 by Kamindu Mendis. The match, initially scheduled for Thursday, was pushed back to Friday after the terror attack in Islamabad on Tuesday, when Pakistan had won the opener at the same venue. Salman Ali Agha, standing in place of flu-stricken skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi, had opted to bowl after winning the toss and it needed work from fast bowlers Naseem Shah and Mohammad Waseem Jr in the deep to get Pakistan their first breakthrough. Pathum Nissanka (24) had been looking good, having hit four boundaries, but was run out attempting a risky third run, with his departure bringing to an end a 51-run opening stand. Fellow opener Kamil Mishara (27) followed soon after; Rizwan’s quick glovework helping complete a stumping off Abrar, who sat out the first game due to illness and was returning to the playing XI after a match-winning performance against South Africa last week. Abrar had been difficult to read for Sri Lankan batters and struck again when Kusal Mendis (20) holed out to Mohammad Nawaz inside the circle on the leg-side. Abrar was hit for the first boundary of his spell when Asalanka swept him away but the leg-spinner hit back on the next ball, trapping the left-hander lbw with a ball that spun away after pitching. Sri Lanka reached 100 in the 23rd over and the first six of their innings came on the first ball of the 24th when Liyanage came down the track and hit Abrar over the long-on fence. Abrar was pulled out of the attack and that gave Sri Lanka the breathing space they needed and Liyanage and Sadeera Sameerawickrama (42) settled soon after. When the latter got his third boundary with a flick off Nawaz in the 29th, Salman felt Pakistan needed to change tact. Haris was called into action and the pacer, fresh from picking up four wickets in the opening ODI, responded by cleaning up Sameerawickrama, who also hit a six, with a length ball that hit the top of his off-stump and ended a 61-run stand. The incoming Kamindu launched Haris for a six and with the more sedate Liyanage took Sri Lanka to 200 in the 38th over. Pakistan turned to Abrar once again but Kamindu swatted him away for four as Sri Lanka set themselves up for a late charge. Spinner Nawaz was plundered for 14 in the 41st over where Liyanage raising his half-century off 56 deliveries and Kamindu getting his second six. But Haris broke the 73-run partnership when he had Kamindu, who hit four fours during his 38-ball stay, caught at the square leg fence. Liyanage fell in the next over, hitting Waseem to Nawaz at midwicket before Haris trapped Chameera lbw. Hasaranga’s unbeaten 37 in the end ensured Sri Lanka set Pakistan 289 to win.",

      "summary_orig": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government on Friday declared the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations, 2011, to be a law that violates basic human rights and approved a resolution passed by the KP Assembly to withdraw its appeal against the law from the apex court. In 2019, the then Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) provincial government extended the law to the entire province; however, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) nullified the move, terming the law a violation of basic human rights. The government, however, later obtained a stay order from the Supreme Court against the PHC verdict. On September 8, the KP Assembly passed a resolution recommending that the provincial government withdraw its appeal. “This House recommends that the provincial government declare the implementation of the law in KP and the merged districts to be against basic rights and withdraw its appeal against it from the Supreme Court,” the resolution read. On Friday, the chief minister’s aide on information and public relations, Shafiullah Jan, told the media that the most important decision made in the cabinet meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, concerned the Action in Aid of Civil Power regulation. Jan, while briefing the media after the cabinet meeting, said that the law was being misused and that the government had expressed its concerns. He added that the cabinet also approved an inquiry commission to investigate the attack on the Radio Pakistan building on May 9 during what he described as a “false flag operation”. He said that the commission formed to probe the Radio Pakistan Peshawar attack would collect all available evidence, including CCTV footage, and submit its findings to the cabinet. He added that the names of the commission members would be finalised in the next cabinet meeting. “The KP government believes that the May 9 operation was against PTI, to dismantle the party and to send its founder, Imran Khan, behind bars. PTI achieved nothing from May 9,” he said, and questioned who benefited from May 9 since it was used against PTI. The chief minister’s aide also criticised Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for speaking against Pashtuns, adding that an entire Pashtun generation had laid down their lives. He said that the federal government should be asked how the explosives entered Pakistan since the federal government controls the border. Jan said that the provincial government brought together the entire political leadership in KP under one roof and that the draft finalised after the peace jirga would be discussed in the security committee, followed by a provincial action plan. He also said that the TORs would be finalised and the details shared with the corps commander, adding that the final decision would be made by the chief minister. The aide also said that they would enhance the police’s capacity so that the department could counter militancy in the province. Jan added that the cabinet decided not to spend taxpayers’ money on publicity of individuals, adding that PTI believed in transparency and that the cabinet had decided there would be zero tolerance for corruption. He elaborated that the provincial government released a Rs4 billion grant for displaced persons since they had left their homes during Operation Zarb-e-Azb, but the federal government, even after promising financial assistance to the displaced families, never fulfilled its promises during the last three years. The chief minister’s aide informed that a package of Rs6 billion had been announced for the provision of missing facilities in schools across the province, adding that the chief minister had ordered the release of Rs1.20 billion. He said that 0.745 million children would be enrolled and a stipend would be paid to their parents. Additionally, funds were approved for roads in Swat and South Waziristan. Jan maintained that the cabinet members and the bureaucracy stressed the need to improve the law and order situation and governance, adding that further decisions would be made to bring visible changes over the next three years. The provincial government thanked all the political parties, tribal elders, and other participants for taking part in the peace jirga.",

      "summary_en": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government on Friday declared the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations, 2011, to be a law that violates basic human rights and approved a resolution passed by the KP Assembly to withdraw its appeal against the law from the apex court. In 2019, the then Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) provincial government extended the law to the entire province; however, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) nullified the move, terming the law a violation of basic human rights. The government, however, later obtained a stay order from the Supreme Court against the PHC verdict. On September 8, the KP Assembly passed a resolution recommending that the provincial government withdraw its appeal. “This House recommends that the provincial government declare the implementation of the law in KP and the merged districts to be against basic rights and withdraw its appeal against it from the Supreme Court,” the resolution read. On Friday, the chief minister’s aide on information and public relations, Shafiullah Jan, told the media that the most important decision made in the cabinet meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, concerned the Action in Aid of Civil Power regulation.

      "summary_orig": "The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday vowed to vigorously protest through all democratic means to restore the Constitution to its original form in the wake of the passage of the contentious 26th and 27th amendments. President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment on Thursday, enacting it into law. The TTAP had already ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the am­­end­ment since Sunday and urged the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution. While the 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their vote as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) had also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. In a post on X today, the TTAP said it was holding an emergency meeting at the residence of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. In attendance were Qaiser, PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar and Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai and others, including Zain Ali Shah, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Ali Asghar Khan, Hussain Akhwandzada, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Shaukat Basra. The members of the meeting later gathered and chanted slogans against the post-amendment Constitution and dictatorship and in favour of PTI founder Imran Khan and democracy. In a press release issued after the meeting, the alliance said: “TTAP reiterates its resistance and struggle against these unconstitutional amendments and will vigorously protest through all democratic means to restore the Constitution in its original form and demands that the Constitution be restored in its original form.” It said the amendments were against the basic structure of the Constitution and an attack on a fundamental pillar of democracy — the judiciary — that had subordinated the judiciary to the executive and “destroyed the basic structure of the Constitution” while introducing person-specific changes. The TTAP said its leaders rejected the amendments and demanded that the Constitution be restored to its original form. “These controversial constitutional amendments have completely destroyed the judiciary and limited the authority and existence of the Supreme Court,” the TTAP said. It also hailed the resignations of Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah as resistance to the “robbery of the Constitution” and paid tribute to judges who upheld their constitutional oath. Outlining the moves against the 27th amendment, the TTAP said MNAs and senators would march from the National Assembly to the Supreme Court on Monday, a resolution would be presented in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly against the 27th amendment and MPAs would march from the Punjab Assembly to the Lahore High Court on Monday with lawyers participating as well. The TTAP further announced observing next Friday as a ‘black day’ across the country. In other announcements, the TTAP said it fully supported the declaration of the KP Peace Jirga and demanded its implementation; demanded the immediate release of Imran, his wife and incarcerated PTI leaders and workers, as well as the leadership and members of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee. The PTI’s Parlia­mentary Commi­ttee previously suggested holding countrywide protests against the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, also voiced opposition to the amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court. Contentious bill The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution took shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved. In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment. The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when Bilawal announced on social media platform X on November 3 that the government had sought his party’s support for the amendment. Subsequently, the prime minister also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment.",
