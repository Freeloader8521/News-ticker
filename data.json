      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman returned to Dhaka on Thursday after nearly 17 years in exile, a homecoming the party hopes will energise supporters with Rahman poised to be the top contender for prime minister in the February 12 elections. Hundreds of thousands of supporters lined the route from the capital’s airport to the reception venue, waving party flags and carrying placards, banners, and flowers, while chanting slogans welcoming Rahman, as senior BNP leaders received him at the Dhaka airport under tight security. Rahman, 60, the son of ailing former prime minister Khaleda Zia, has lived in London since 2008 and led the BNP as acting chairman since 2018. Dressed in a light grey, finely checkered blazer over a crisp white shirt, Rahman exited the airport, removed his shoes to step barefoot onto Bangladeshi soil, and picked up a handful of earth in a symbolic gesture marking his return to the South Asian nation. He was seen standing beside the driver’s seat in a bus taking him to the reception venue, smiling and waving as crowds surged to catch a glimpse of their returning leader. He had been unable to return while facing multiple criminal cases at home. Rahman was convicted in absentia on charges that included money laundering and in a case linked to an alleged plot to assassinate former prime minister Sheikh Hasina but the rulings were overturned after Hasina was ousted last year in a student-led uprising, clearing the legal barriers to his return. His homecoming also carries personal urgency, with Khaleda Zia seriously ill for months. Party officials said Rahman would travel from the airport to a reception venue before visiting his mother. The political landscape has shifted sharply since Hasinas removal from power, ending decades in which she and Khaleda Zia largely alternated in office. A December survey by the US based International Republican Institute suggested the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race. Hasina’s Awami League party, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could disrupt the vote. Bangladesh is heading into the polls under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. While authorities have pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns, making Rahman‘s return a defining moment for the BNP and the country’s fragile political transition.",

      "title_orig": "If the Quaid came home",
      "summary_orig": "This piece was originally published on Aug 14, 2025. It’s a bit of a tired theme: Muhammad Ali Jinnah, briefly returned from the pearly gates, walks around the country he’s created. He sees violence, corruption, poverty, extremism, and an unlawful regime lording over it. Perhaps, nearly 80 years on, freedom means something else. He’s shocked, regrets what he’s founded, and calls it a day — or becomes a vehicle for some conservative columnist to tell the public what they should be doing instead. Only, the question lingers: would the Quaid have been all that surprised by what he’d seen? Because Jinnah witnessed violence, corruption, poverty and extremism under an unlawful regime for most of his years. And that’s without touching on the constant defeats that rutted his path: his family business collapsing around the time he returned from London; Gandhi elbowing him offstage as India’s most promising politician by 1920; the civil liberties he championed crushed by the British Raj; and the Nehru Report setting fire to Hindu-Muslim unity — the work of a lifetime. His own. In fact, the odds against anything resembling Pakistan were brutal before 1946: the Unionist Party’s obese landlords ran Punjab; Sindh was in the grips of Gandhian arch-feudal Soomros; the frontier was ruled by Congressites outright; and Balochistan wasn’t even on the provincial map. Lesser men, almost all men, would have surrendered; yet others would have haggled for scraps from within the Raj’s cage. But Jinnah had long understood that freedom was a terrible, vital business: not so much the absence of pain, but the choice to endure it for something essential to being alive. For freedom’s sake After all, beyond those dry law books, Jinnah was an idealist — no freedom fighter isn’t. His friend, Sarojini Naidu, called it right as early as 1917: “Never was there a nature whose outer qualities provided so complete an antithesis of its inner worth.” If he was skinny, it concealed “exceptional … endurance”; if he was aloof, it hid a “naïve and eager humanity”. If he seemed too rational and practical, it was only to “disguise a shy and splendid idealism”. It’s also how he changed map of the world — by keeping his eyes fixed to the eternities. As has been said of British premier Disraeli’s career (whom Liaquat Ali Khan enjoyed comparing to Jinnah): “Failure, failure, failure, partial success, renewed failure. Ultimate and complete victory.” But such victory can never be complete: if indeed the Quaid came home, he’d have found freedom in recession. We know this not from speculation, but from decades of documentary record. Interestingly, most of that record is nowhere to be found on August 14: beyond a few bumper stickers, Jinnah seems to have become much too radical, and thereby much too dangerous, for his own country to contend with. Jinnah vs the state For starters, consider liberty: is a citizen free if they can be tried by a military tribunal? Said Jinnah in 1919, “I am a firm believer that no man’s liberty should be taken away for a single minute without a proper judicial inquiry.” The Supreme Court disagreed last May, and chose to cite Ayub Khan’s laws rather than the founder’s speech. That brings us to the judiciary itself, the crown jewel of any free republic. But are the judges in a position to safeguard the people’s rights, now that the executive has snatched away their powers via the 26th amendment? “Powers which are going to be assumed by the executive, which means substitution of executive for judiciary, such powers are likely to be abused,” said Jinnah. He had said prior, “Instead of giving the powers to the executive, I would rather that the power was given to the judiciary … because in my opinion, it is a lesser evil than the executive.’ The unity regime has thought the opposite: stripping the courts of suo motu powers, choosing its own chief justice every three years, and reducing the entire judicature to a popularity contest. The regime may think, as the British once had, that Jinnah doth protest too much. London’s Edwin S. Montagu once asked him acidly, “Have you ever known any proposal come from any government which met with your approval?” And yet the Quaid wasn’t instinctively opposed to the state: he viewed a free country as one where the executive was in charge — just not its armed forces. He warned a future chief of general staff in 1947, “Never forget that you are the servants of the state. You do not make policy. It is we, the people’s representatives, who decide how the country is to be run. Your job is only to obey the decision of your civilian masters.” Yet what of said people’s representatives? As blanket convictions stream in and lawmakers are flung out of the assembly, it’s hard not to remember the Quaid’s words when Satyendra Chandra Mitra, a member of the Central Legislative Assembly, was slapped with preventive detention: “Here is a man who was arrested under a most obnoxious law which gives the executive absolute power to imprison a man on suspicion without trial … How long are you going to prevent him from what he is entitled to do?” And if the state cried law and order, he replied, “Is it to be performed in spite of the will of the people … by retaining a most reactionary and oppressive measure …? I maintain sir, that if the government were really responsive to public opinion, all the revolutionary organisations and anarchical organisations that you are now talking of and which you want to arrest and to destroy…will disappear.” This was part of a broader, daring stance — that violence and disorder stem not from uncontrollable populations, but unresponsive rule. Jinnah may well have been addressing Balochistan when he said, “Why do these educated young men take to bombs? Have you ever thought of it? … The way to prevent bombs being thrown is to meet the people, respond to their feelings, their sentiments and their legitimate and proper aspirations.” It most certainly isn’t to punish those who raise their voices for a better world, as we’re seeing today: journalists thrown on stop lists and anchors taken off television. Yet again, the barrister from Bombay was clear: “I say, protect the innocent, protect those journalists who are doing their duty and who are serving both the public and the government by criticising the government freely, independently, honestly, which is an education for any government.” Back to the Raj In sum, Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s starting point was freedom. As the late lawyer-historian A.G. Noorani wrote, no parliamentarian spoke as sharply to the British “or their Indian stooges” as Jinnah: “There was no nationalist more fervent than he; no stronger champion of freedom from British rule.” Because freedom was the end in and of itself. That seems hard to believe these days: as we recently read in these pages, Faisalabad’s anti-terrorism court handed down scores of convictions over the 9 May riots by reasoning the law was well-drafted and wide-ranging: arch-imperialist Lord Macaulay, “the first law-giver of the subcontinent”, had authored it after “the famous mutiny of 1857”. It’s already been questioned why the court would compare itself to its colonisers, and the PTI to yesterday’s rebels. But as a scholar of the Raj — if not of our own freedom movement — the learned judge would also know what Macaulay had written when those rebels were fired from cannons in Peshawar: that “their heads, legs, arms, flying in all directions was read with delight”. Reflected Macaulay, “I could be very cruel just now if I had the power.” The learned judge would also know that these weren’t the emotional outbursts of a jolted regent, but sober policy directions, steeped in the racial superiority of an alien overclass. All things considered, Macaulay thought us unfit for self-rule anyway; that what we could really “have [is] the next best thing — a firm and impartial despotism”; and that the British carried with them “all the noblest virtues of a sovereign caste”. By jingo, chaps. In fairness to Faisalabad, the anti-terrorism courts quote Macaulay instead of Jinnah in the same way the Supreme Court leans harder on Ayub’s Pakistan than the Quaid-i-Azam’s. As the song goes, it looks like freedom but it feels like death. All of which is to say that if Jinnah indeed came home today, the story of his life points to anything but a lament, a lecture, a sad retreat in the rain. What it points to is, frankly, audacity: that no wall can’t be breached — the Congress, the provincials, empire itself; none yielded willingly, and all looked permanent until the moment they fell. But fall they did, and Pakistan was born. So we continue. And we keep the faith.",

He had said prior, “Instead of giving the powers to the executive, I would rather that the power was given to the judiciary … because in my opinion, it is a lesser evil than the executive.’ The unity regime has thought the opposite: stripping the courts of suo motu powers, choosing its own chief justice every three years, and reducing the entire judicature to a popularity contest. The regime may think, as the British once had, that Jinnah doth protest too much. London’s Edwin S. Montagu once asked him acidly, “Have you ever known any proposal come from any government which met with your approval?” And yet the Quaid wasn’t instinctively opposed to the state: he viewed a free country as one where the executive was in charge — just not its armed forces. He warned a future chief of general staff in 1947, “Never forget that you are the servants of the state. You do not make policy. It is we, the people’s representatives, who decide how the country is to be run. Your job is only to obey the decision of your civilian masters.” Yet what of said people’s representatives? As blanket convictions stream in and lawmakers are flung out of the assembly, it’s hard not to remember the Quaid’s words when Satyendra Chandra Mitra, a member of the Central Legislative Assembly, was slapped with preventive detention: “Here is a man who was arrested under a most obnoxious law which gives the executive absolute power to imprison a man on suspicion without trial … How long are you going to prevent him from what he is entitled to do?” And if the state cried law and order, he replied, “Is it to be performed in spite of the will of the people … by retaining a most reactionary and oppressive measure …? I maintain sir, that if the government were really responsive to public opinion, all the revolutionary organisations and anarchical organisations that you are now talking of and which you want to arrest and to destroy…will disappear.” This was part of a broader, daring stance — that violence and disorder stem not from uncontrollable populations, but unresponsive rule. Jinnah may well have been addressing Balochistan when he said, “Why do these educated young men take to bombs? Have you ever thought of it? … The way to prevent bombs being thrown is to meet the people, respond to their feelings, their sentiments and their legitimate and proper aspirations.” It most certainly isn’t to punish those who raise their voices for a better world, as we’re seeing today: journalists thrown on stop lists and anchors taken off television. Yet again, the barrister from Bombay was clear: “I say, protect the innocent, protect those journalists who are doing their duty and who are serving both the public and the government by criticising the government freely, independently, honestly, which is an education for any government.” Back to the Raj In sum, Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s starting point was freedom. As the late lawyer-historian A.G. Noorani wrote, no parliamentarian spoke as sharply to the British “or their Indian stooges” as Jinnah: “There was no nationalist more fervent than he; no stronger champion of freedom from British rule.” Because freedom was the end in and of itself. That seems hard to believe these days: as we recently read in these pages, Faisalabad’s anti-terrorism court handed down scores of convictions over the 9 May riots by reasoning the law was well-drafted and wide-ranging: arch-imperialist Lord Macaulay, “the first law-giver of the subcontinent”, had authored it after “the famous mutiny of 1857”. It’s already been questioned why the court would compare itself to its colonisers, and the PTI to yesterday’s rebels. But as a scholar of the Raj — if not of our own freedom movement — the learned judge would also know what Macaulay had written when those rebels were fired from cannons in Peshawar: that “their heads, legs, arms, flying in all directions was read with delight”. Reflected Macaulay, “I could be very cruel just now if I had the power.” The learned judge would also know that these weren’t the emotional outbursts of a jolted regent, but sober policy directions, steeped in the racial superiority of an alien overclass. All things considered, Macaulay thought us unfit for self-rule anyway; that what we could really “have [is] the next best thing — a firm and impartial despotism”; and that the British carried with them “all the noblest virtues of a sovereign caste”. By jingo, chaps. In fairness to Faisalabad, the anti-terrorism courts quote Macaulay instead of Jinnah in the same way the Supreme Court leans harder on Ayub’s Pakistan than the Quaid-i-Azam’s. As the song goes, it looks like freedom but it feels like death. All of which is to say that if Jinnah indeed came home today, the story of his life points to anything but a lament, a lecture, a sad retreat in the rain. What it points to is, frankly, audacity: that no wall can’t be breached — the Congress, the provincials, empire itself; none yielded willingly, and all looked permanent until the moment they fell. But fall they did, and Pakistan was born. So we continue. And we keep the faith.",
      "title": "If the Quaid came home",
      "summary": "This piece was originally published on Aug 14, 2025. It’s a bit of a tired theme: Muhammad Ali Jinnah, briefly returned from the pearly gates, walks around the country he’s created. He sees violence, corruption, poverty, extremism, and an unlawful regime lording over it. Perhaps, nearly 80 years on, freedom means something else. He’s shocked, regrets what he’s founded, and calls it a day — or becomes a vehicle for some conservative columnist to tell the public what they should be doing instead. Only, the question lingers: would the Quaid have been all that surprised by what he’d seen? Because Jinnah witnessed violence, corruption, poverty and extremism under an unlawful regime for most of his years. And that’s without touching on the constant defeats that rutted his path: his family business collapsing around the time he returned from London; Gandhi elbowing him offstage as India’s most promising politician by 1920; the civil liberties he championed crushed by the British Raj; and the Nehru Report setting fire to Hindu-Muslim unity — the work of a lifetime. His own. In fact, the odds against anything resembling Pakistan were brutal before 1946: the Unionist Party’s obese landlords ran Punjab; Sindh was in the grips of Gandhian arch-feudal Soomros; the frontier was ruled by Congressites outright; and Balochistan wasn’t even on the provincial map. Lesser men, almost all men, would have surrendered; yet others would have haggled for scraps from within the Raj’s cage. But Jinnah had long understood that freedom was a terrible, vital business: not so much the absence of pain, but the choice to endure it for something essential to being alive. For freedom’s sake After all, beyond those dry law books, Jinnah was an idealist — no freedom fighter isn’t. His friend, Sarojini Naidu, called it right as early as 1917: “Never was there a nature whose outer qualities provided so complete an antithesis of its inner worth.” If he was skinny, it concealed “exceptional … endurance”; if he was aloof, it hid a “naïve and eager humanity”. If he seemed too rational and practical, it was only to “disguise a shy and splendid idealism”. It’s also how he changed map of the world — by keeping his eyes fixed to the eternities. As has been said of British premier Disraeli’s career (whom Liaquat Ali Khan enjoyed comparing to Jinnah): “Failure, failure, failure, partial success, renewed failure. Ultimate and complete victory.” But such victory can never be complete: if indeed the Quaid came home, he’d have found freedom in recession. We know this not from speculation, but from decades of documentary record. Interestingly, most of that record is nowhere to be found on August 14: beyond a few bumper stickers, Jinnah seems to have become much too radical, and thereby much too dangerous, for his own country to contend with. Jinnah vs the state For starters, consider liberty: is a citizen free if they can be tried by a military tribunal? Said Jinnah in 1919, “I am a firm believer that no man’s liberty should be taken away for a single minute without a proper judicial inquiry.” The Supreme Court disagreed last May, and chose to cite Ayub Khan’s laws rather than the founder’s speech. That brings us to the judiciary itself, the crown jewel of any free republic. But are the judges in a position to safeguard the people’s rights, now that the executive has snatched away their powers via the 26th amendment? “Powers which are going to be assumed by the executive, which means substitution of executive for judiciary, such powers are likely to be abused,” said Jinnah. He had said prior, “Instead of giving the powers to the executive, I would rather that the power was given to the judiciary … because in my opinion, it is a lesser evil than the executive.’ The unity regime has thought the opposite: stripping the courts of suo motu powers, choosing its own chief justice every three years, and reducing the entire judicature to a popularity contest.

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar was attacked in the United Kingdom, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since April 2022, leaving him “bruised and fractured”, it emerged on Thursday. “I have been attacked and been in the hospital and with the police. Bruised and fractured [ sic ],” the ex-SAPM said in text messages after Dawn reached out to him, seeking confirmation of a post about the incident on PTI’s X account. The PTI’s post at 9:50pm PKT on Wednesday said Akbar was attacked at his house in Cambridge in the morning. “The attacker punched him repeatedly in the face, as a result of which his nose and jaw were fractured,” it said. “Local police have collected all details, and an investigation is underway,” the party said. Akbar, who was the accountability adviser in the PTI government, was previously also attacked in November 2023 at his home in Hertfordshire. The attacker, a masked individual, had thrown acidic liquid at Akbar, the former SAPM had shared in a post on X, adding that, “I will not be intimidated nor bow down to those who are doing this”. Akbar had linked the attack to the Al Qadir Trust case against PTI founder Imran Khan, alleging that security agencies were harassing him to give evidence against the ex-premier. Separately, he had told Dawn , “I have been sent messages in recent months by people who are clearly not happy with me. I’ve been told to mend my ways or else…” Akbar had initiated legal action against the government of Pakistan in a UK court in April 2024 over the acid attack. He told Dawn that he had also sent notices to the Pakistan High Commission in UK and other Pakistani officials. However, in May 2024, the Foreign Office had “categorically rejected” what it said were “preposterous” claims by Akbar about the alleged involvement of state officials in the 2023 acid attack on him. Meanwhile, Akbar has been declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court in a case pertaining to alleged controversial statements made on X. Subsequently, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott, handing over extradition papers for Akbar. While Pakistan does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, both countries do have an agreement in place whereby London can repatriate Pakistani nationals involved in crimes and violating immigration laws.",

      "summary_orig": "DHAKA: The heir to Bangladesh’s longtime ruling family and a leader of its most powerful political party, Tarique Rahman is set to return home after 17 years in exile and ahead of key elections. Rahman, 60, an aspiring prime minister who has lived in London since he fled Bangladesh in 2008 over what he called a politically motivated persecution, is due to arrive in Dhaka on Thursday. Acting chairman of the Bang­la­desh Nationalist Party (BNP), he is expected to take the reins from his ailing mother , 80-year-old former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in the February 12, 2026 elections. But she was hospitalised soon after that pledge, and she has been in intensive care ever since. The elections will be the first since a mass uprising last year ended the 15-year hardline rule of Sheikh Hasina, who was at odds with the BNP. Since Hasina’s fall from power, Rahman has been acquitted of the most serious charge against him: a life sentence handed down in absentia for a 2004 grenade attack on a Hasina rally. He had denied the charges. BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has promised Rahman will “arrive among us on the soil of Dhaka” on Dec 25, which he said will be a “fantastic day”. Tarique Rahman, often pictured beside his mother on BNP banners, has long been groomed for leadership. In June, he met in London with Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner leading the interim government until the February elections. Violent politics Rahman, known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, carries a political name that has defined his life. Born in 1967 when the country was still East Pakistan, he was briefly detained as a child during the 1971 independence war. The BNP hails him as “one of the youngest prisoners of war”. His father, Ziaur Rahman, was an army commander. Ziaur Rahman gained influence months after a 1975 coup in which Sheikh Hasina’s father, founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was murdered. That fuelled lifelong tensions bet­ween the Zia and Hasina families, dubbed the “Battle of the Begums”. Ziaur Rahman was assassinated when his son was 15. The younger Rahman grew up in his mother’s political orbit, as Zia went on to become the country’s first female prime minister, alternating her terms in power with Hasina. Rahman briefly studied international relations at Dhaka University before entering politics at 23, joining the BNP in its fight against military ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad, according to his party. Allegations of nepotism Still, Rahman’s career has been dogged by allegations of nepotism and mismanagement. A 2006 US embassy cable des­cri­bed him as the BNP’s “heir apparent” who “inspires few but unnerves many”. Other cables labelled him a “symbol of kleptocratic government and violent politics” and accused him of being “phenomenally corrupt”. Rahman was arrested on corruption charges in 2007 and claimed he was tortured in custody. Reports suggested his release was conditional on leaving politics. Freed later that year, he flew to London in 2008 for medical treatment and never returned. After Hasina swept to power in 2008, her government jailed tens of thousands of BNP members. In 2018, Rahman was again sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment for allegedly orchestrating the 2004 attack on Hasina’s rally. Published in Dawn, December 25th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Current trajectory serves no one’s interest, Pakistan tells Security Council • China, Russia slam US ‘bullying’ and ‘cowboy-like’ conduct • Caracas warns of self-defence against ‘oil grab’ • Islamabad seeks diplomatic approach to resolve Iran nuclear issue UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has called on all sides to exercise maximum restraint and de-escalate tensions, as the United States continued to interdict vessels off the coast of Venezuela, a situation that drew sharp condemnation from China and Russia at the UN Security Council. Pakistan’s deputy permanent representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon addressed the council during a meeting requested by Venezuela. He emphasised that the “current trajectory serves no one’s interest”. “In a world marred by polarisation with conflicts affecting the lives and livelihoods of millions around the globe, it is all but imperative to once again underscore the centrality and inviolability of the UN Charter and its core principles,” Mr Jadoon said. He specifically highlighted the prohibition on the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. “We firmly believe that the principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of states, as enshrined in the UN Charter, are sacrosanct,” Mr Jadoon said. Reaffirming Pakistan’s position, he noted that while measures to counter transnational organised crime or narcotics trafficking are necessary, they must be cooperative and conform to international law. He urged engaged diplomacy to ensure the region remains a “Zone of Peace”. The sitting laid bare deep divisions between world powers. US Ambassador Mike Waltz asserted that sanctions would be enforced to the maximum extent to deprive Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of resources used to fund drug cartels. “The United States will do everything in our considerable power to protect our hemisphere, our borders and the American people,” Waltz said, claiming oil sales enable Maduro’s “narco-terrorist activities.” However, China and Russia slammed the US actions. Chinese envoy Sun Lei opposed “unilateralism and bullying”, demanding Washington heed the international community and uphold navigation safety. Venezuelan Ambassador Samuel Moncada rejected the US narrative, stating the threat is not drugs or security, but a desire for Venezuela’s oil and land. “The world knows that, if the scale of armed attacks continues, we will exercise, with all determination, our inalienable right to self-defence,” Moncada said. UN’s Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari noted that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stands ready to support diplomatic engagement, if requested by both parties. Council split on Iran Meanwhile, at another UN debate, Islamabad called for diplomatic engagement to resolve the Iran nuclear issue. “It is deeply regrettable that in recent months, divisions in the council and beyond have widened, taking us further away from the resolution of the issue,” Ambassador Jadoon told the 15-member council during a discussion on nuclear non-proliferation. He noted the situation has been complicated by unilateral actions and differing interpretations of the “snapback” mechanism. The council remains split over the legitimacy of holding meetings regarding the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement from which the US withdrew in 2018. Mr Jadoon cautioned that coercive measures would not bridge the gap and often hurt ordinary citizens. “We strongly believe that diplomacy and dialogue should be the guiding principles for the resolution of all outstanding issues concerning Iran’s nuclear program,” he said. He emphasised that the JCPOA framework could still prove useful if parties move forward with compromise. Mr Jadoon urged the restoration of trust in diplomatic engagement and stressed the critical role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in verifying compliance. The session marked the first meeting since France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback mechanism to reimpose sanctions, citing Iran’s non-performance. Jay Dharmadhikari, France’s deputy permanent representative, warned that Iran’s lack of implementation constitutes a “grave threat”. He added that if brought to military enrichment levels, Iran’s stockpile would be sufficient “to produce 10 nuclear explosive devices”. Published in Dawn, December 25th, 2025",

US Ambassador Mike Waltz asserted that sanctions would be enforced to the maximum extent to deprive Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of resources used to fund drug cartels. “The United States will do everything in our considerable power to protect our hemisphere, our borders and the American people,” Waltz said, claiming oil sales enable Maduro’s “narco-terrorist activities.” However, China and Russia slammed the US actions. Chinese envoy Sun Lei opposed “unilateralism and bullying”, demanding Washington heed the international community and uphold navigation safety. Venezuelan Ambassador Samuel Moncada rejected the US narrative, stating the threat is not drugs or security, but a desire for Venezuela’s oil and land. “The world knows that, if the scale of armed attacks continues, we will exercise, with all determination, our inalienable right to self-defence,” Moncada said. UN’s Assistant Secretary-General Mohamed Khaled Khiari noted that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres stands ready to support diplomatic engagement, if requested by both parties. Council split on Iran Meanwhile, at another UN debate, Islamabad called for diplomatic engagement to resolve the Iran nuclear issue. “It is deeply regrettable that in recent months, divisions in the council and beyond have widened, taking us further away from the resolution of the issue,” Ambassador Jadoon told the 15-member council during a discussion on nuclear non-proliferation. He noted the situation has been complicated by unilateral actions and differing interpretations of the “snapback” mechanism. The council remains split over the legitimacy of holding meetings regarding the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement from which the US withdrew in 2018. Mr Jadoon cautioned that coercive measures would not bridge the gap and often hurt ordinary citizens. “We strongly believe that diplomacy and dialogue should be the guiding principles for the resolution of all outstanding issues concerning Iran’s nuclear program,” he said. He emphasised that the JCPOA framework could still prove useful if parties move forward with compromise. Mr Jadoon urged the restoration of trust in diplomatic engagement and stressed the critical role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in verifying compliance. The session marked the first meeting since France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered the snapback mechanism to reimpose sanctions, citing Iran’s non-performance. Jay Dharmadhikari, France’s deputy permanent representative, warned that Iran’s lack of implementation constitutes a “grave threat”. He added that if brought to military enrichment levels, Iran’s stockpile would be sufficient “to produce 10 nuclear explosive devices”. Published in Dawn, December 25th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Pakistani Consulate in Los Angeles issued a stern warning against a message circulating online and on messaging platforms that claims to be an “important notice” regarding Pakistan visas. Officials have confirmed that the message is false and is part of a pattern of phishing scams designed to collect sensitive personal and financial information from unsuspecting applicants. Upon accessing the consulate’s website, the following notice was displayed. A screenshot of a notice from the Pakistani Consulate in Los Angeles warning about unauthorised visa applications. — Screengrab A statement issued by the Pakistan Embassy in Washington stated: “The Consulate General disassociates itself from all such unauthorised individuals, agents, or entities and shall not be responsible for any loss, delay, misrepresentation, or other adverse consequences arising from engagement with them.” The fraudulent message falsely purports to come from the consulate and directs visa applicants to submit information through links that are not authorised by the government of Pakistan. Such scams are designed to harvest passport details, social security numbers, bank account information, and credit card data, which can later be used for identity theft, unauthorised transactions, financial fraud and other criminal activities. The consulate strongly reiterated that Pakistani visa applications must be submitted only through the official government online portal: https://visa.nadra.gov.pk . Visa applicants were urged to avoid intermediaries, agents, or unauthorised websites, regardless of claims of faster processing or special access. They were also advised to be cautious when sharing personal or financial information online, with the consulate adding that requests for social security numbers, bank details, or other identity-related data in relation to visa applications should be treated as red flags. The public was urged by the consulate to verify all information directly through official channels and to report any suspicious messages or websites to the relevant authorities. “This advisory is being issued in the public interest to protect applicants from scams that can have devastating financial and personal consequences,” officials said. Applicants looking for updated guidance and official visa information were instructed to visit the consulate’s website at https://pakconsulatela.org/visa-services . The warning comes amid a sharp rise in online fraud globally. According to the US Federal Trade Commission , consumers in the United States reported losing more than $12.5 billion to fraud in 2024, a sharp increase over previous years, as scammers increasingly exploit phishing, identity theft, and impersonation tactics online. Data also show a significant rise in credit card fraud and identity theft, with hundreds of thousands of cases reported in 2025 alone, highlighting how criminals misuse personal and financial information once it is obtained. Cybersecurity researchers have documented an 18 per cent increase in phishing attacks in Pakistan during 2024, as criminals increasingly target individuals with deceptive links and spoofed communication. Courts in the United States and other countries have sentenced individuals involved in multi-million-dollar phishing and fraud schemes, where victims — often targeted through impersonation and phishing — were defrauded of large sums. Officials noted that victims of similar scams have, in some cases, lost their entire life savings, as stolen data is used to gain access to bank accounts, obtain fraudulent loans, or conduct unauthorised transfers.",

      "summary_orig": "• Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar says TTAP has ‘conditionally resolved’ to take up govt offer • PTI spox puts the ball in Achakzai, Raja Nasir Abbas’ court; says Imran has barred party from entering any talks ISLAMABAD: A day after PM Shehbaz Sharif reiterated the government’s willingness to engage in a political dialogue, the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) exp­ressed its willingness to engage in such a process, albeit conditionally. At a recent national conference, organised by the TTAP alliance, participants had agreed that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. But if the spokesperson for the country’s main opposition party is to be believed, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is not interested in sitting across the table from the government. A meeting of opposition leaders was held on Wednesday, chaired by PkMAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and attended by Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Sajid Tareen, Asad Qaiser, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, and Akhunzada Hussain Yousufzai, among others. Talking to Dawn , TTAP deputy chief Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that Wednesday’s huddle had resolved to hold talks with the government. Participants also agreed on the need for a new charter to address the country’s political and financial issues and the spiralling law and order situation, in order to give hope to the despondent masses. However, it was made clear that the dialogue process must have some clear goals. “The dialogue will be held for holding the transparent elections in future, appointment of chief elections commissioner with consensus, supremacy of the parliament, rule of law, assurance of human rights, and democratic and constitutional norms,” Mr Khokhar said. He said that Mr Achakzai has also held a meeting with Aleema Khan, Imran Khan’s sister, to discuss the proposal with her. It is worth mentioning that Mr Achakzai had previously assured National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq that all political parties would agree to restore the 1973 Constitution, he would be responsible for making sure that Imran Khan would sign on to the initiative. PTI stands firm But taking a diametrically opposite view, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram claimed that the party would steer clear of any negotiations with the federal government on the orders of Imran Khan himself. Speaking to ARY News a day earlier, Mr Akram – when asked if the PTI wants to negotiate with the government – categorically said that the party was “not interested”. “I met Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and he said that Imran instructed the party not to engage with the government in any way,“ he explained. However, in the same breath, he clarified that Mr Achakzai or Allama Raja Nasir have the authority to decide whether or not they want to talk. Mr Akram said that the two opposition alliance leaders would decide how to respond to the government’s invitation. He added that, while speaking with the TTAP, he noted that other “friends” within the alliance are in favour of talks. The party spokesperson also claimed that the same two men would also decide whether to call for a protest, or not. “Since Imran Khan instructed the PTI against starting talks, under the directions of Salman Akram Raja, we rejected the offer,” he said.

      "summary": "Imran Ahmed and Clare Melford among five Europeans hit with visa bans over claims they wish to ‘suppress American viewpoints they oppose’ The Global Disinformation Index , which is run by Clare Melford, one of the two Britons on the list of five Europeans facing US visa restrictions because of their work to stop online disinformation and hate (see 9.28am ), has described the US state department’s decision as “immoral, unlawful and un-American”. In a reponse, a GDI spokesperson said: The visa sanctions … are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship. The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with. Their actions today are immoral, unlawful, and un-American. WE’VE SANCTIONED: Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, the leader and founder of HateAid, a German organization founded after the 2017 German federal elections to counter conservative groups. HateAid is an official “trusted flagger” (a censor) under the EU’s anti-speech Digital Services Act (DSA) and routinely demands access to propriety social media platform data to help it censor more. Hodenberg cited threat of “disinformation” from “right-wing extremists” online in upcoming U.S. and EU elections when circulating a petition for the DSA to become more strongly enforced to allow data access for “researchers”. WE’VE SANCTIONED: Josephine Ballon, co-leader of HateAid, who flags disfavored speech throughout Europe under the Digital Services Act. In addition to her running an official “trusted flagger” body under the DSA, she serves on Germany’s Advisory Council of the Digital Services Coordinator (DSC), which directly advises Germany’s DSC on the application and enforcement of the DSA. In February 2025, Ballon spoke before an American audience in a notable 60 Minutes interview, outlining her position on censorship succinctly: “Free speech needs boundaries.” In October 2024, she vowed to stop the “emotionalization of debates” by “regulating platforms”.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least four children were injured in the Gondalabad area of Kurram district on Wednesday after a quadcopter attack, said official sources. For months, militants in the region have used quadcopters to drop explosives on security forces and the current year has seen an increase in such attacks. In today’s attack, a quadcopter released its explosive payload over a residential area. As a result, three boys and a girl sustained injuries, confirmed official sources. The injured minors were shifted to a nearby medical facility for medical treatment. Security sources condemned the attack, calling it “an act of violence against innocent civilians and children”. “Such incidents reflect a deliberate targeting of non-combatants and have nothing to do with religion or humanitarian values,” they added. An investigation into the incident is underway, while security in the area has been tightened following the attack. Last week, two women and two teenagers were injured in a quadcopter attack in the Janikhel area of Bannu district. A week before the Bannu attack, another attack in the same area injured four people, including two children. Earlier in the month, three boys were killed, and another was injured when a quadcopter crashed in a residential area of Mamand Khel in Bannu.

      "summary_orig": "This article was originally published on December 25, 2024. It has been replugged. It’s a fickle thing, the public memory — in what it chooses to remember, and what it wishes to forget. It’s worse still on days like these, where everyone invokes the founder’s name and cites his message without actually understanding it, or what he stood for. After all, the act of forgetting is a statement of its own. Because Muhammad Ali Jinnah is a problem for today’s Pakistan. He’s too liberal for the right, too nationalist for the left, too civilian for the generals, and too much of a merit hire for the dynasts. Wouldn’t it be best, then, to leave the gent on a pedestal that’s too high to reach? But if the founder remains confined to portraits and postage stamps, it’s come with a cost: our now perma-crisis is the logical outcome of shirking his ideas for years. It’s also why a core aspect of his life has been suppressed so well: Jinnah as parliamentarian. Enter the Rowlatt Act The Quaid ranked among the greatest lawmakers of his generation; in a land that increasingly sees the law as a force for coercion, that fact has faded from view. But reading Jinnah in today’s Pakistan — amid the 26th amendment as well as military trials of civilians — is no less than instructive. For our purposes, we’ll revisit one of the earliest and most powerful speeches of his career: on the right to fair trial and due process in 1919. As the chaos of the first World War died down, India hoped for its liberties to be restored. What it got was the opposite: the all-out repression of the Rowlatt Act — emergency trials and arrests without cause. In making their case, the British raged about low conviction rates in ordinary courts, how it was impossible to cope with agitations ‘under the normal law’, and how the protesters’ aim was to promote an uprising against the government. The forces of anarchy were allowed ‘unrestricted license to prosecute their designs’, said crusty Home Member Sir William Vincent. Up against such colonisers was Jinnah in the Imperial Legislative Council at Delhi. As India convulsed with protests, Jinnah said on September 23, 1918, “Surely it cannot be said that all of a sudden these men became regular criminals. The cause is this, my Lord, that there is discontent; there is dissatisfaction; there is unrest. Might I say, my Lord, that it is partly, if not wholly, due to your policy.” Yes, India was aflame with riots, but the problem was born of an unfeeling regime and lack of representation — and the Rowlatt Bill “was a wrong remedy for the disease”. Said the Quaid, “Instead of giving the powers to the executive, I would rather that the power was given to the judiciary, and I would rather even that these offences be tried in a summary way by judicial tribunals, because in my opinion, it is a lesser evil than the executive.” A stark warning Well over a century ago, Jinnah was against displacing the judges for the state. More the pity that our members so recently saw fit to pass the horror show of the 26th amendment — the Quaid was clearer about the rule of law in 1918 than many that took oath under his portrait in 2024. Which brings us to his main address on February 6, 1919 — what editors Malik Mohammad Jafar and I A Rehman would call one of the most glorious chapters of his long career. “My Lord, to any man who believes in law and justice, these measures seem abhorrent and shocking … my first ground [for opposition] is this, that it is against the fundamental principles of law and justice, namely, that no man should lose his liberty or be deprived of his liberty without a judicial trial in accordance with the accepted rules of evidence and procedure.” A forensic takedown followed: “… My third ground is that the powers which are going to be assumed by the executive, which means substitution of executive for judiciary, such powers are likely to be abused … Fourth … there is no precedent or parallel that I know of, in any other civilised country, where you have laws of this character enacted.” And to what end? “… You may be able to get hold of more real offenders but … at the cost of many other innocent men who will be persecuted and who will have no chance, no opportunity, of a proper trial.” Ultimately, if such a brutal law were passed, “you will create in this country, from one end to the other, a discontent and agitation, the like of which you have not witnessed, and it will have, believe me, a most disastrous effect upon the good relations that existed between the government and the people.” Jinnah came to the crux: “I am a firm believer that no man’s liberty should be taken away for a single minute without a proper judicial inquiry.” To be clear, this wasn’t some soapbox speech. When his warnings went unheeded, and Lord Chelmsford, India’s governor-general, pushed the emergency bill through, Jinnah stayed true to himself — he resigned from parliament as soon as the vote was announced in March 1919. He would write to Chelmsford, “The constitutional rights of the people have been violated at a time when there is no real danger to the state, by an overfretful and incompetent bureaucracy which is neither responsible to the people nor in touch with real public opinion.” Jinnah continued, “I can be of no use to my people in the Council, nor consistently with one’s self-respect is cooperation possible with such a government … a government that passes or sanctions such a law in times of peace forfeits its claim to be called a civilised government.” Applying the Quaid’s principles today All this would be helpful to reflect on today: the founder’s views on liberty, on judicial trials as a right, on not replacing judges with the executive, on civil unrest as a political problem. Not least, he underscored his words with action — quitting a parliament that passed ugly bills via non-representatives (the Indian members were unanimously opposed to the Rowlatt Act). Interestingly enough, Mr Jinnah’s 1919 speech would be revived almost a hundred years later in 2015 — in District Bar Association, Rawalpindi vs Federation , the Supreme Court would allow military courts to try terrorists. In the minority were two future chief justices, Jawwad S Khawaja and Qazi Faez Isa. Siding with Justice Khawaja’s dissent (“… I am in complete agreement with his opinion”), Justice Isa cited Jinnah’s 1919 address to hold, “The Constitution does not permit trials of civilians by the military as it would contravene fundamental rights …” But when military trials of civilians returned in 2023, it would be the retired Justice Jawwad S Khawaja, who fulfilled the spirit of the Quaid’s speech — challenging the trials before the Supreme Court. By contrast, when the same case was fixed, Justice Isa, still serving, stormed off the bench and refused to hear the matter. As it turns out, Pakistan’s founding ideals have to be fought for every single day. Or, as the Quaid summed up back then, “My Lord, it is no use shirking the issue, it is no use hedging round the whole of this question.” For a brief moment in time, the Supreme Court’s five-member bench had answered that question with courage — striking down the very provision that allowed for civilians to be court-martialed. Not that this lasted: the judgment has since been suspended in appeal . Yet whatever the new ‘constitutional bench’ may decide, one fact is imperishable: the original verdict remains true to the Quaid’s address. May he be heard more often.

Siding with Justice Khawaja’s dissent (“… I am in complete agreement with his opinion”), Justice Isa cited Jinnah’s 1919 address to hold, “The Constitution does not permit trials of civilians by the military as it would contravene fundamental rights …” But when military trials of civilians returned in 2023, it would be the retired Justice Jawwad S Khawaja, who fulfilled the spirit of the Quaid’s speech — challenging the trials before the Supreme Court. By contrast, when the same case was fixed, Justice Isa, still serving, stormed off the bench and refused to hear the matter. As it turns out, Pakistan’s founding ideals have to be fought for every single day. Or, as the Quaid summed up back then, “My Lord, it is no use shirking the issue, it is no use hedging round the whole of this question.” For a brief moment in time, the Supreme Court’s five-member bench had answered that question with courage — striking down the very provision that allowed for civilians to be court-martialed. Not that this lasted: the judgment has since been suspended in appeal . Yet whatever the new ‘constitutional bench’ may decide, one fact is imperishable: the original verdict remains true to the Quaid’s address. May he be heard more often.

      "title": "What Jinnah thought of civil liberties and the right to a fair trial",
      "summary": "This article was originally published on December 25, 2024. It has been replugged. It’s a fickle thing, the public memory — in what it chooses to remember, and what it wishes to forget. It’s worse still on days like these, where everyone invokes the founder’s name and cites his message without actually understanding it, or what he stood for. After all, the act of forgetting is a statement of its own. Because Muhammad Ali Jinnah is a problem for today’s Pakistan. He’s too liberal for the right, too nationalist for the left, too civilian for the generals, and too much of a merit hire for the dynasts. Wouldn’t it be best, then, to leave the gent on a pedestal that’s too high to reach? But if the founder remains confined to portraits and postage stamps, it’s come with a cost: our now perma-crisis is the logical outcome of shirking his ideas for years. It’s also why a core aspect of his life has been suppressed so well: Jinnah as parliamentarian. Enter the Rowlatt Act The Quaid ranked among the greatest lawmakers of his generation; in a land that increasingly sees the law as a force for coercion, that fact has faded from view. But reading Jinnah in today’s Pakistan — amid the 26th amendment as well as military trials of civilians — is no less than instructive. For our purposes, we’ll revisit one of the earliest and most powerful speeches of his career: on the right to fair trial and due process in 1919. As the chaos of the first World War died down, India hoped for its liberties to be restored. What it got was the opposite: the all-out repression of the Rowlatt Act — emergency trials and arrests without cause. In making their case, the British raged about low conviction rates in ordinary courts, how it was impossible to cope with agitations ‘under the normal law’, and how the protesters’ aim was to promote an uprising against the government. The forces of anarchy were allowed ‘unrestricted license to prosecute their designs’, said crusty Home Member Sir William Vincent. Up against such colonisers was Jinnah in the Imperial Legislative Council at Delhi. As India convulsed with protests, Jinnah said on September 23, 1918, “Surely it cannot be said that all of a sudden these men became regular criminals. The cause is this, my Lord, that there is discontent; there is dissatisfaction; there is unrest. Might I say, my Lord, that it is partly, if not wholly, due to your policy.” Yes, India was aflame with riots, but the problem was born of an unfeeling regime and lack of representation — and the Rowlatt Bill “was a wrong remedy for the disease”. Said the Quaid, “Instead of giving the powers to the executive, I would rather that the power was given to the judiciary, and I would rather even that these offences be tried in a summary way by judicial tribunals, because in my opinion, it is a lesser evil than the executive.” A stark warning Well over a century ago, Jinnah was against displacing the judges for the state. More the pity that our members so recently saw fit to pass the horror show of the 26th amendment — the Quaid was clearer about the rule of law in 1918 than many that took oath under his portrait in 2024. Which brings us to his main address on February 6, 1919 — what editors Malik Mohammad Jafar and I A Rehman would call one of the most glorious chapters of his long career. “My Lord, to any man who believes in law and justice, these measures seem abhorrent and shocking … my first ground [for opposition] is this, that it is against the fundamental principles of law and justice, namely, that no man should lose his liberty or be deprived of his liberty without a judicial trial in accordance with the accepted rules of evidence and procedure.” A forensic takedown followed: “… My third ground is that the powers which are going to be assumed by the executive, which means substitution of executive for judiciary, such powers are likely to be abused … Fourth … there is no precedent or parallel that I know of, in any other civilised country, where you have laws of this character enacted.” And to what end? “… You may be able to get hold of more real offenders but … at the cost of many other innocent men who will be persecuted and who will have no chance, no opportunity, of a proper trial.” Ultimately, if such a brutal law were passed, “you will create in this country, from one end to the other, a discontent and agitation, the like of which you have not witnessed, and it will have, believe me, a most disastrous effect upon the good relations that existed between the government and the people.” Jinnah came to the crux: “I am a firm believer that no man’s liberty should be taken away for a single minute without a proper judicial inquiry.” To be clear, this wasn’t some soapbox speech. When his warnings went unheeded, and Lord Chelmsford, India’s governor-general, pushed the emergency bill through, Jinnah stayed true to himself — he resigned from parliament as soon as the vote was announced in March 1919. He would write to Chelmsford, “The constitutional rights of the people have been violated at a time when there is no real danger to the state, by an overfretful and incompetent bureaucracy which is neither responsible to the people nor in touch with real public opinion.” Jinnah continued, “I can be of no use to my people in the Council, nor consistently with one’s self-respect is cooperation possible with such a government … a government that passes or sanctions such a law in times of peace forfeits its claim to be called a civilised government.” Applying the Quaid’s principles today All this would be helpful to reflect on today: the founder’s views on liberty, on judicial trials as a right, on not replacing judges with the executive, on civil unrest as a political problem. Not least, he underscored his words with action — quitting a parliament that passed ugly bills via non-representatives (the Indian members were unanimously opposed to the Rowlatt Act). Interestingly enough, Mr Jinnah’s 1919 speech would be revived almost a hundred years later in 2015 — in District Bar Association, Rawalpindi vs Federation , the Supreme Court would allow military courts to try terrorists. In the minority were two future chief justices, Jawwad S Khawaja and Qazi Faez Isa.
