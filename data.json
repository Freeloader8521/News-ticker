      "summary_orig": "Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder Altaf Hussain was hospitalised in London on Sunday night after his “health deteriorated”. In a post on Sunday night, the party said doctors had conducted a medical examination of the MQM leader and admitted him to the hospital. Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi. “Mr Altaf Hussain was taken to the hospital on Sunday evening due to ill health, where after an initial examination, the doctors have admitted him to the hospital,” said the post on X. The party elaborated that doctors “administered an injection to him, and started an IV drip in view of weakness in his body”. Doctors will conduct a detailed examination of the party founder on Monday, added the post. The party founder was also “administered a blood transfusion on Sunday night on the advice of doctors,” a subsequent post on the party’s X handle said on Monday. In a post on X, London-based senior MQM leader Mustafa Azizabadi said Hussain’s ill health was caused by “severe mental stress and staying engaged in organisational work day and night for 18 to 20 hours”. Last year, the MQM founder was hospitalised on two occasions within a span of a month. He was admitted to a hospital in London on July 10 due to “severe illness” and was discharged on July 23 after undergoing multiple tests and blood transfusions. Hussain was again hospitalised on August 8 and was allowed to leave the next day. Doctors had diagnosed him with severe flu and a chest infection. The MQM founder had also remained in the intensive care unit at a hospital in Britain, apparently after contracting Covid-19 in February 2021. Hussain’s political journey Hussain was born on Sept 17, 1953, in Karachi. He obtained his early education at a public school in Karachi’s Azizabad neighbourhood, a middle-class locality where he spent his early years and his youth. He later enrolled at the University of Karachi (KU) to study Pharmacy and graduated from the programme in 1979. His political career began during his student years at KU when he and Azeem Ahmed Tariq founded the All-Pakistan Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO). Formed in 1978, APMSO gained a massive following within a short period of time. Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third largest party in the country. In the early 1990s, the MQM chief went into exile as the government at the time conducted an operation in Karachi. The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation. Viewed as the man who controlled Karachi from London, Hussain came under fire in May 2013 for his televised speech across Pakistan, where he allegedly demanded the separation of Karachi from the rest of Pakistan if the public mandate of his party was not acceptable to the ‘establishment’. The party later clarified, saying it was taken out of context. However, the final undoing of the MQM, as it was known, came after Hussain delivered an incendiary speech in August 2016 in which he not only raised slogans against Pakis­tan but also called the country “a cancer for the entire world”. Hours after the speech, MQM workers had attacked the ARY News office in Kara­chi. Authorities launched a crackdown following the speech, and the MQM’s Karachi headquarters and Hussain’s residence in Azizabad were sealed. Later, Hussain’s own party leaders in Pakistan distanced themselves from him and omitted his name from the party constitution. In October 2019, Hussain was charged with “encouraging terrorism” by British police over his speech. He was also arrested in the case earlier in 2019 but was released on bail. After deliberations that spanned three days, a 12-member jury had returned a majority verdict in Rex (crown) versus Altaf Hussain in February 2022, acquitting the MQM founder on two counts of ‘encouraging terrorism’. The jury found Hussain not guilty on both counts of encouraging terrorism, contrary to section 1(2) of the UK’s Terrorism Act 2006.",

      "summary_orig": "NEW DELHI: India will spend a record amount on infrastructure and defence, the finance minister said in her national budget speech on Sunday, with plans for high-speed rail, submarines and fighter jets. New Delhi plans to spend $133 billion on infrastructure and $85 billion on defence, a respective rise of around nine and 15 percent compared to last year’s budget. Data centres, artificial intelligence, and the mining and processing of rare earths will also receive government support, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told parliament. She said public spending on infrastructure had increased dramatically from around $21 billion (2 trillion rupees) in 2014-15 and that it was now at an “all-time high”. Rajnath says armed forces would be equipped with fighter jets, drones, ships, submarines and critical hardware The defence spending hike comes after a four-day conflict with Pakistan last May that killed at least 70 people, and saw both sides make extensive use of drones as well as intense missile and artillery barrages. ‘Best interest’ Defence minister Rajnath Singh described the spending as “unprecedented” and said it would help equip India’s armed forces with fighter jets, drones, ships, submarines and other critical hardware. “It is in the best interest of the nation,” he added. New Delhi is in the midst of negotiating defence contracts with domestic and international suppliers, including France, the United States and Germany. The world’s most populous country sees massive infrastructure spending as key to sustaining its high growth rate by boosting domestic manufacturing and creating millions of new jobs. “India is not content with simply being the fastest-growing economy,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after the budget. “India wants to become the world’s third-largest economy.” This year’s budget presents an ambitious roadmap to give new momentum to domestic manufacturing and self-reliance. Sectors including textiles, pharmaceuticals, electronics and chemicals are primary targets to boost exports, Sitharaman said. She promised the development of business parks for textiles and chemicals and said $5 billion would be spent on boosting domestic electronics manufacturing. Published in Dawn, February 2nd, 2026",

      "title_orig": "Why are there so few women candidates?",
      "summary_orig": "Only 78 women contesting the national election.—Courtesy The Daily Star THE number of women contesting the upcoming parliamentary elections starkly exposes the persistent under-representation of women in Bangladesh’s politics. Of the 1,981 candidates competing in the polls, only 78 are women. This glaring imbalance reflects the deep-rooted chauvinism and discrimination faced by women with political ambition. Moreover, nearly a third of nominated women candidates are wives, daughters, or relatives of influential men, indicating how difficult it is for women to participate in politics independently and on their own merit. This reality is particularly troubling in a country where women constitute half the population yet make up less than four percent of electoral candidates. Of the 78 women, only 17 are independents. As an analysis of Election Commission data by The Daily Star shows, around 30 parties have not nominated a single woman candidate. Two-thirds of parliamentary seats have no female contenders at all, and women with familial or marital ties to powerful political figures are far more likely to succeed than those without such connections. Thus, women are still not regarded as serious contenders. The exclusion of women is especially disheartening given their central role in the 2024 uprising, where women mobilised, organised, and took significant risks alongside men. Yet, their participation has not translated into greater political representation. Instead, women have increasingly been pushed out of public and political spaces, both overtly through exclusion and more insidiously by intimidation. Anti-women rhetoric has intensified both online and offline in recent times, sometimes driven by religion-based political groups seeking to silence women’s voices. Even the few women who have dared to contest elections have faced coordinated online attacks. Existing legal frameworks have done little to address the prevailing imbalance. The Representation of the People Order, 1972 requires political parties to reserve at least 33 percent of committee posts for women, including at the central level. Yet, most parties have failed to comply with this provision. Even one of the country’s largest and oldest parties, the BNP, has nominated fewer than ten women, while Jamaat-e-Islami has fielded none. Electoral politics in Bangladesh — shaped by money, patronage, and muscle power — systematically disadvantages women as parties, focused solely on winning seats, continue to prioritise male candidates. Women nominees are often expected to rely on the backing of fathers, husbands, or brothers. Political parties have failed women and the spirit of July uprising Even the proposal by the Women’s Affairs Reform Commission to increase the number of reserved seats to 100 with direct elections was not accepted by political parties. With no women representatives included in the July Charter consensus discussions, it was unsurprising that reserved seats were kept at only 50, with no provision for direct elections. If we are serious about democratic reform, women’s presence in parliament and political leadership must be substantially increased. A democracy cannot claim legitimacy when half its population remains so poorly represented. Political parties must move beyond tokenism and actively invest in developing women leaders, ensuring they have equal opportunities to compete, win, and shape the country’s future.

      "summary_en": "Only 78 women contesting the national election.—Courtesy The Daily Star THE number of women contesting the upcoming parliamentary elections starkly exposes the persistent under-representation of women in Bangladesh’s politics. Of the 1,981 candidates competing in the polls, only 78 are women. This glaring imbalance reflects the deep-rooted chauvinism and discrimination faced by women with political ambition. Moreover, nearly a third of nominated women candidates are wives, daughters, or relatives of influential men, indicating how difficult it is for women to participate in politics independently and on their own merit. This reality is particularly troubling in a country where women constitute half the population yet make up less than four percent of electoral candidates. Of the 78 women, only 17 are independents. As an analysis of Election Commission data by The Daily Star shows, around 30 parties have not nominated a single woman candidate. Two-thirds of parliamentary seats have no female contenders at all, and women with familial or marital ties to powerful political figures are far more likely to succeed than those without such connections. Thus, women are still not regarded as serious contenders. The exclusion of women is especially disheartening given their central role in the 2024 uprising, where women mobilised, organised, and took significant risks alongside men. Yet, their participation has not translated into greater political representation. Instead, women have increasingly been pushed out of public and political spaces, both overtly through exclusion and more insidiously by intimidation. Anti-women rhetoric has intensified both online and offline in recent times, sometimes driven by religion-based political groups seeking to silence women’s voices. Even the few women who have dared to contest elections have faced coordinated online attacks. Existing legal frameworks have done little to address the prevailing imbalance. The Representation of the People Order, 1972 requires political parties to reserve at least 33 percent of committee posts for women, including at the central level. Yet, most parties have failed to comply with this provision. Even one of the country’s largest and oldest parties, the BNP, has nominated fewer than ten women, while Jamaat-e-Islami has fielded none. Electoral politics in Bangladesh — shaped by money, patronage, and muscle power — systematically disadvantages women as parties, focused solely on winning seats, continue to prioritise male candidates.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s rice exports are no longer slowing down — they have already collapsed. Rice exports from Pakistan to all global destinations have fallen nearly 50 per cent in the first half of FY26. This is not a cyclical dip; it is a systemic failure. If this trajectory continues, Basmati — the country’s flagship geographical indication agricultural export — will soon be reduced to a nostalgic footnote rather than a viable industry. The country’s export managers have relied on ‘steroids’ of rebates and duty drawbacks to drive volume since the 1960s, rather than making our exports efficient, value-added and diversified to promote export culture in the country. Yet, instead of confronting the structural causes of the decline, the government has once again chosen the most convenient and least effective option: export rebates under the Duty Drawback of Local Taxes and Levies (DLTL) scheme. This policy may create the illusion of action, but in reality, it deepens distortions, rewards hoarders, punishes consumers, and accelerates Pakistan’s loss of global market share — particularly to India, our only Basmati competitor. Rebates that inflate prices, not exports DLTL is being sold as an export revival tool. In truth, it is a post-harvest windfall for stockists. Paddy procurement for the current cycle has been largely completed; the crop has shifted hands from rice growers to paddy stockists, shellers and rice millers. Rice paddy stocks are now in silos and warehouses locked by large traders and middlemen. Any incentive announced at this stage cannot reach growers, who already sold their produce months ago under depressed prices and rising input costs. Pakistan’s rice exports are being taxed into decline, and only structural reform — not stopgap rebates — can revive a sector edging toward permanent loss What DLTL does achieve is predictable: hoarders will restrict supply to earn premium open-market Basmati, and the price of other rice will surge, inflaming food inflation. In effect, the Pakistani consumer is being forced to subsidise rice exporters who have not made themselves efficient or capable of adding value to the rice stalk, husk, bran or broken rice by-products compared with regional peers, while rice growers — the backbone of the sector — remain excluded from the incentive chain. This is not export promotion; it is rent distribution and promotion of rent seekers. Painkillers for a terminal disease Pakistan’s rice exports are suffering from chronic ailments: the punitive withholding tax was doubled. Energy costs, expensive financing, inflated inland transport costs, and rising farm input prices are not minor irritants, they are competitiveness killers. Instead of addressing them, the government is prescribing DLTL as if it were a cure-all. It is not. At best, it is a painkiller. At worst, it accelerates the disease by distorting prices and delaying reform. A sector battling declining productivity and shrinking market share does not need rebates; it needs cost correction. The offshore profit problem There is another uncomfortable truth policymakers continue to ignore. A significant number of Pakistani rice exporters have established overseas entities using export refinance to re-route their exports through the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Madagascar and other African countries. Under rebate-driven regimes, exporters invoice shipments to their own overseas entities and will switch bill of lading and invoice to the eventual buyers. Furthermore, declared prices are inflated to maximise rebates. Bigwigs will enjoy the blessings of DLTL, while small exporters will vanish entirely from rice exports. Importers will not get any low-priced rice incentive, hence India will continue to grab our market share. Pakistan does not gain competitiveness. The fiscal burden, however, remains entirely domestic. India: the unforgiving competitor While Pakistan is debating rebates, India is executing policy. India has already overtaken Pakistan in both coarse and premium Basmati rice markets, including segments traditionally dominated by Pakistani Basmati in the UK, EU, Saudi Arabia, UAE and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries. Lower costs, predictable policies, and scale efficiencies have allowed Indian exporters to capture the shelf space Pakistan once owned. India does not rely on rebates to sell rice; it offers farm subsidies to reduce production costs. The area under cultivation is increasing, as well as the per-acre yield. India relies on cost competitiveness. Pakistan relies on DLTL incentives because it refuses to fix rising farm input costs. The real reform agenda If the objective is a genuine export revival, the path is an obvious one. First, withholding taxes on rice exports must be abolished to restore liquidity. Second, exports should be placed under a self-assessment scheme as previously. Third, tax income, not export sales turnover. Fourth, reduce energy tariffs for all exporters to regional benchmarks. And fifth, shift from trader-centric incentives to grower-centric productivity support. Furthermore, currently, exports are heavily taxed. Tax collections are largely made from rice exports of around $3 billion, while local rice trading of around $9bn is hardly taxed at all. Taxing domestic consumption over exports would stabilise domestic prices by reducing hoarding profiteering through domestic trade. There are thousands of local brands in domestic markets spread from Akbari Mandi Lahore to Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan, Bhawalpur, Sukkur, Hyderabad and Karachi, but tax collections from rice in these markets are negligible compared to rice exports. A sector on life support does not need another rebate. It needs surgery. And the longer policymakers delay, the closer Pakistan comes to losing one of its most valuable agricultural exports — permanently.

      "summary_orig": "The ongoing potato crisis in Pakistan has drawn extensive media coverage over the past four weeks. Overproduction, coupled with the closure of the Afghanistan border since mid-October 2025, has caused a market crash, with supply exceeding demand to the point that potatoes are being used as livestock feed. So, the potato sector stands as a classic example of policy and planning failures in the agriculture sector that result in the waste of the country’s precious resources. The current oversupply of potatoes stems largely from a bandwagon effect. In recent years, the crop yielded relatively higher profits, which induced farmers to increase its acreage significantly in both Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In 2024–25 alone, Pakistan’s potato area grew by 14 per cent, reaching 953,000 acres, with a production volume of 9.4 million tonnes. In Punjab, which produces roughly 95pc of the country’s potatoes, the area further expanded by 24pc in 2025–26. In addition, the area under high-yielding potato varieties such as ‘Esmee’ has also increased over the past two years, further boosting production. Moreover, a bumper crop is being harvested this year due to favourable weather conditions. As a result of these factors, potato production in the 2025–26 season is expected to reach 12m tonnes. Unfortunately, the government failed to anticipate this growing trend and did not expand exports accordingly in previous years. Meanwhile, domestic consumption and exports of potato value-added products have also lagged behind the surge in production. While many believe that reopening the border could help the situation, production levels are so high that even if exports match prior levels, they would still be inadequate to fully absorb the surplus Another factor adding pressure to the market is last year’s potato stocks held in cold storage facilities. Due to the border closure, these stocks — unlike in previous years — lasted until mid-January. Resultantly, the current crop has neither been exported nor absorbed by the domestic market in significant quantities so far. Consequently, over 80pc of the current harvest has yet to arrive in February and March. While many farmers and exporters believe that reopening the border could help resolve the crisis, production levels are so exceptionally high that even if exports match those of previous years — 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes to Afghanistan and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, which account for nearly 50pc of Pakistan’s potatoes exports — they would still be inadequate to fully absorb the surplus. Nevertheless, such exports could provide partial relief and send a positive signal to the market. Due to the market crash, farmers are facing massive financial losses at a time when they are already burdened with costly agricultural inputs. Ironically, both the Federal and Punjab governments have so far done nothing to address this crisis, except for a notification issued by the Ministry of Commerce on December 5, 2025, that permits the export of potatoes and kinnow to CIS countries via an alternative route through Iran. However, this route incurs higher freight charges, which negatively impact the cost competitiveness of Pakistani potatoes in these export markets. Many believe that the government has several tools at its disposal to support farmers and potato exporters; however, the real issue lies in a lack of political commitment and the PMLN’s approach to the agriculture sector. This is evident from statements by senior party members on television talk shows, where a sharp decline in potato prices is presented as beneficial in easing the financial burden on urban consumers. Similar arguments were advanced during the wheat harvesting season, when prices dropped to Rs1,800–2,200 per 40 kg. Statements at the time emphasised that lower wheat prices should be sustained to help reduce the cost of ‘roti’ for low-income households. Undoubtedly, providing affordable food to the poor — particularly to pre-empt protests like those seen in some regional countries — is important, given Pakistan’s rising unemployment and declining purchasing power. However, this should not come at the expense of farmers and must be done through targeted subsidies. Forcing farmers to absorb losses without any government support or reopening the border is a short-sighted approach that will further undermine the agriculture sector, which is already on the brink of collapse due to flawed policies and soaring input costs. Losses suffered by farmers will not only limit investment in upcoming crops, but are also likely to cause a sharp contraction in the area planted for the next potato crop in October. It must be recognised that, with the exception of wheat, which follows different dynamics, the acreage of most crops is highly sensitive to price fluctuations. For instance, in 2025, the area under sesame in Punjab declined by a substantial 37 per cent — from 1.75m acres to 1.09m acres — within a single year, following a drop in prices from Rs16,500 per 40 kg (2023 crop) to around Rs11,000 (2024 crop). Therefore, the government’s short-term approach could come at a very high cost to both the country and consumers in the coming years. To address this crisis, the government could incentivise exporters, processors, and stockists with interest-free loans to procure potatoes during the peak harvesting season and store them for year-round domestic consumption and exports up to December 2026. Punjab alone has over 800 dedicated potato cold storage facilities with a combined capacity exceeding 3.5m tonnes, while other provinces also have a significant number of functional storage facilities. Moreover, being semi-perishable, potatoes are also stored in the field under a thick layer of rice straw, without any quality loss, until June 1, after which temperatures rise excessively. This approach would provide the government and exporters ample time to identify new export markets and expand in existing ones. Furthermore, to support exporters and enhance their cost competitiveness, the government should also cover the additional freight charges incurred when using the Iran route for shipments to CIS countries. Only such interventions can achieve the two widely cherished national goals: ensuring food security and boosting agricultural exports.

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi announced on Sunday that he would soon convene a grand jirga for consultations with stakeholders across the province for a protest march on Islamabad. The CM shared his plans at a jirga at Khyber’s Jamrud Sports Complex, which he had announced last Sunday while responding to the federal government’s stance that neither the Centre, nor the military, had issued any directives for the “depopulation” of the Tirah Valley. The federal and provincial governments have been trading barbs over who authorised the evacuation process in the valley after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes amid concerns about a planned military actions. The evacuations, which were carried out in line with a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders — including local elders, the provincial government and the military — seem to have become a bone of contention after the displaced populace found themselves stranded in cold weather under open skies, with mismanagement by the authorities only adding to their troubles. Earlier this week, the federal government also insisted that the movement was actually seasonal migration and a routine practice, further maintaining that no military action had been planned for Tirah. At the peace jirga today, the KP CM asked those attending the gathering if they would accompany him for a protest march towards Islamabad to express their resentment against the “atrocities” which the people of Tirah had been subjected to, their “forced displacement”  and the “government’s U-turn on the military operation”. The CM said he would soon undertake a visit to merged districts to take their residents into confidence and would then convene a grand jirga prior to announcing a date for a protest march towards the federal capital. “We will assert at the grand jirga that only people are entitled to rule Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as it belongs to them, and that no decisions made behind closed doors in Islamabad will be acceptable any more”, he said among vociferous sloganeering from the emotionally charged audience. Afridi said that “no power on the earth could shake his confidence nor could his conscience be bought if he has the solid support and backing of his own people”. He alleged that conspiracies were hatched so that either governor’s rule could be enforced in the province or he was disqualified and sent packing on the basis of “concocted cases”. He claimed conspiracies were also planned to “eliminate him he if does not submit to the narrative of his political rivals”. But, “I have firm faith in God and I am not scared of anyone as I am a tribal and will never budge from our stated policy about militancy and military operations”, he asserted. On the allegations of the misuse of Rs4 billion pledged by his government for the displaced families of Tirah, he said  he would not hesitate to sanction even Rs100bn if the need arose as the federal government had “reneged on its promises of providing a paltry amount of Rs400,000 to the displaced families affected by previous military operations”. The CM vowed that “exemplary punishment” would be given to those who were found guilty of any irregularity in the utilisation of funds allocated for the displaced families of Tirah. He alleged discrimination against the people of KP, claiming: “We are considered as second class citizens. But I will continue to raise my voice against this injustice as I, being a soldier of Imran Khan, know how to secure our rights.” He further stated that he would travel to Islamabad on Monday to meet the prime minister to “plead the case of KP’s rights and secure our outstanding dues”. Afridi then termed the federal government’s stance on the displacement of Tirah people “a joke” and insisted that the “people of tribal areas have always rendered sacrifices for the country and they will dispel the negative propaganda against them”. The CM said the federal government “changed its stance on Tirah” on after the international media reported about the “actual sufferings of the people of the valley”. “We have been clamouring for a long time against the presence of outlawed militant groups in different parts of KP, particularly Tirah, and reminding the federal government that militant activities have increased. But, nobody took our assertions seriously while the situation gradually went out of everybody’s hands”, he said. He warned that the federal government’s statement about Tirah would lead to “people losing their confidence in the security establishment”. On the occasion, he also announced the establishment of a relief fund for the poor and needy in KP and appealed to the wealthy to contribute to it. The contributions would later be distributed among the needy people in Ramazan, he announced. He also condemned the terror attacks carried out in different parts of Balochistan on Saturday and expressed his solidarity with the people of the province while saying that the people of KP shared the grief and agony of the affected families. Earlier, provincial minister Meena Khan, MNA Iqbal Afridi, MPAs Abdul Ghani and Adnan Qadri Aldo made hard hitting speeches and held the federal government responsible for all the hardships faced by the displaced families of Tirah. Conspicuous by their absence were the members of the jirga of Tirah tribes who had negotiated the evacuation of families from the valley with representatives of the provincial government and security officials.",

The CM vowed that “exemplary punishment” would be given to those who were found guilty of any irregularity in the utilisation of funds allocated for the displaced families of Tirah. He alleged discrimination against the people of KP, claiming: “We are considered as second class citizens. But I will continue to raise my voice against this injustice as I, being a soldier of Imran Khan, know how to secure our rights.” He further stated that he would travel to Islamabad on Monday to meet the prime minister to “plead the case of KP’s rights and secure our outstanding dues”. Afridi then termed the federal government’s stance on the displacement of Tirah people “a joke” and insisted that the “people of tribal areas have always rendered sacrifices for the country and they will dispel the negative propaganda against them”. The CM said the federal government “changed its stance on Tirah” on after the international media reported about the “actual sufferings of the people of the valley”. “We have been clamouring for a long time against the presence of outlawed militant groups in different parts of KP, particularly Tirah, and reminding the federal government that militant activities have increased. But, nobody took our assertions seriously while the situation gradually went out of everybody’s hands”, he said. He warned that the federal government’s statement about Tirah would lead to “people losing their confidence in the security establishment”. On the occasion, he also announced the establishment of a relief fund for the poor and needy in KP and appealed to the wealthy to contribute to it. The contributions would later be distributed among the needy people in Ramazan, he announced. He also condemned the terror attacks carried out in different parts of Balochistan on Saturday and expressed his solidarity with the people of the province while saying that the people of KP shared the grief and agony of the affected families. Earlier, provincial minister Meena Khan, MNA Iqbal Afridi, MPAs Abdul Ghani and Adnan Qadri Aldo made hard hitting speeches and held the federal government responsible for all the hardships faced by the displaced families of Tirah. Conspicuous by their absence were the members of the jirga of Tirah tribes who had negotiated the evacuation of families from the valley with representatives of the provincial government and security officials.",
      "title": "At jirga on Tirah issue, KP CM announces another ‘grand jirga’ for consultations on protest march to Islamabad",
      "summary": "KHYBER: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi announced on Sunday that he would soon convene a grand jirga for consultations with stakeholders across the province for a protest march on Islamabad. The CM shared his plans at a jirga at Khyber’s Jamrud Sports Complex, which he had announced last Sunday while responding to the federal government’s stance that neither the Centre, nor the military, had issued any directives for the “depopulation” of the Tirah Valley. The federal and provincial governments have been trading barbs over who authorised the evacuation process in the valley after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes amid concerns about a planned military actions. The evacuations, which were carried out in line with a plan agreed upon by all stakeholders — including local elders, the provincial government and the military — seem to have become a bone of contention after the displaced populace found themselves stranded in cold weather under open skies, with mismanagement by the authorities only adding to their troubles. Earlier this week, the federal government also insisted that the movement was actually seasonal migration and a routine practice, further maintaining that no military action had been planned for Tirah. At the peace jirga today, the KP CM asked those attending the gathering if they would accompany him for a protest march towards Islamabad to express their resentment against the “atrocities” which the people of Tirah had been subjected to, their “forced displacement”  and the “government’s U-turn on the military operation”. The CM said he would soon undertake a visit to merged districts to take their residents into confidence and would then convene a grand jirga prior to announcing a date for a protest march towards the federal capital. “We will assert at the grand jirga that only people are entitled to rule Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as it belongs to them, and that no decisions made behind closed doors in Islamabad will be acceptable any more”, he said among vociferous sloganeering from the emotionally charged audience. Afridi said that “no power on the earth could shake his confidence nor could his conscience be bought if he has the solid support and backing of his own people”. He alleged that conspiracies were hatched so that either governor’s rule could be enforced in the province or he was disqualified and sent packing on the basis of “concocted cases”. He claimed conspiracies were also planned to “eliminate him he if does not submit to the narrative of his political rivals”. But, “I have firm faith in God and I am not scared of anyone as I am a tribal and will never budge from our stated policy about militancy and military operations”, he asserted. On the allegations of the misuse of Rs4 billion pledged by his government for the displaced families of Tirah, he said  he would not hesitate to sanction even Rs100bn if the need arose as the federal government had “reneged on its promises of providing a paltry amount of Rs400,000 to the displaced families affected by previous military operations”.

      "summary_orig": "• Slams Sindh govt for ‘detaining them under MPO’ • Sharjeel denies mass arrest or issuing blanket detention orders • Says law enforcement agencies acting strictly within the law KARACHI: The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Sunday accused the provincial authorities of arresting nearly 180 activists during nightlong raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance. However, the provincial government rejected the allegation and blamed the opposition party for spreading false narratives to build momentum for Feb 8 protest. The PTI alleged that the Sindh police carried out pre-dawn raids on the houses of its workers and leaders and picked up around 180 of them. Later in the evening, the central information department of the PTI issued a statement, claiming that the Sindh government had placed the held activists under one-month detention under the MPO. The party described the move as “political victimisation” and alleged that the arrests were carried out across the province to stop its planned protest on Feb 8. It said the use of MPO against its workers showed that the PPP-led Sindh government was pursuing a “non-democratic agenda” and suppressing political dissent. The party said that detaining “peaceful political workers” was a clear violation of the Constitution, the law, and basic human rights. The statement demanded that the Sindh government withdraw what it called a “black decision” and immediately release all detained PTI workers. Meanwhile, in a statement PTI-Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh clarified that their Feb 8 strike “is completely voluntary and peaceful, and no call has been given for blocking roads or forced closure”. He said PTI’s movement cannot be stopped by arrests and police crackdown. Sharjeel denies charges However, Sindh government categorically rejected PTI’s claims, calling them “completely false and misleading”. Senior Sindh Minister Sharjeel Memon, who also holds the portfolio of information, said no mass arrests or detentions under MPO had taken place. He told Dawn the PTI statement was based on incorrect information and aimed at creating unnecessary political hype. “Where’s the list of those arrested. It’s a blatant lie. The PTI is spreading false narratives to build momentum and gain political sympathy for its announced protest planned for February 8,” he said, adding: “The provincial government has not issued any blanket detention orders against PTI leaders or workers and that law enforcement agencies are acting strictly within the law.” The Sindh government, he said, believes in democratic values and the right to peaceful protest.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Sunday said he was hopeful of agreeing a deal with Iran after the country’s supreme leader warned that any US attack on the Islamic republic would trigger a regional war. Following the Iranian authorities’ response to anti-government protests that peaked last month, Trump has threatened military action and ordered the dispatch of an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East. Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday likened the recent protests to a “coup”, warning that a US attack would trigger a broad conflict. “The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,” he said, telling Iranians they “should not be scared” of Trump’s rhetoric. “They (rioters) attacked the police, government centres, IRGC centres, banks, and mosques, and burned the Quran … It was like a coup,” Khamenei said, adding that “the coup was suppressed”. Asked about the Iranian leader’s warning, Trump told reporters on Sunday: “Of course he is going to say that. “Hopefully we’ll make a deal. If we don’t make a deal, then we’ll find out whether or not he was right,” he said. The demonstrations in Iran began as an expression of discontent at the high cost of living, but grew into a mass anti-government movement that the country’s leaders have described as “riots” stoked by the United States and Israel. As tensions heightened between Iran and the US, Tehran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday said he was concerned about “miscalculations” but said he believed Trump was “wise enough to make the correct decision”. He said Iran has lost trust in the United States as a negotiating partner, adding that some countries in the region were acting as intermediaries to rebuild trust. “So I see the possibility of another talk if the US negotiation team follows what President Trump said: to come to a fair and equitable deal to ensure that there is no nuclear weapons,” he said in an interview with CNN . ‘Terrorist’ designations Tehran has acknowledged thousands of deaths during the protests, and on Sunday the presidency published a list of 2,986 names out of the 3,117 that authorities said were killed in the unrest. Of the total, 131 have yet to be identified but their details will be released soon, it said in a statement. Authorities insist most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”. The response to the protests prompted the European Union to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation, with Iranian lawmakers retaliating on Sunday by slapping the same designation on European armies. Lawmakers wore the green uniform of the Guards in a display of solidarity at the legislative session, where they chanted “Death to America”, “Death to Israel” and “Shame on you, Europe”, state television footage showed. It remained unclear what immediate impact the decision would have. The step matched similar classifications enacted by the United States, Canada and Australia. Threats and dialogue Firouzeh, a 43-year-old homemaker who declined to give her full name, said the recent tensions had left her “very worried and scared”. “Lately, all I do is watch the news until I fall asleep. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night to check the updates,” she said. IRGC official Ahmad Vahidi was quoted by the Mehr news agency as saying “enemies” sought to create a “war atmosphere”. But Ali Larijani, head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said on Saturday: “Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.” Trump also confirmed that dialogue was taking place, but without withdrawing his earlier threats, adding “we’ll see what happens”. The US president previously said he believed Iran would make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face military action. Tehran, meanwhile, has said it is ready for nuclear talks if its missile and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.",

      "title_orig": "‘We will fight this war’: CM Bugti says 145 terrorists killed in 40 hours across Balochistan",
      "summary_orig": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday expressed the firm resolve to eliminate terrorists after a spate of coordinated attacks across the province, adding that 145 militants were killed within a span of 40 hours. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed 92 terrorists. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Addressing a press conference in Quetta on Sunday, CM Bugti said 145 terrorists were killed in 40 hours, adding that their bodies were in the custody of the authorities. “This is the highest number since Pakistan is facing this war on terror,” he highlighted. “Our 17 law enforcement people, including police and FC and one Navy personnel, were martyred, and our civilian casualties are 31, including some injured,” CM Bugti said. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said on Saturday night that 15 personnel were martyred during the operations and 18 civilians, including women and children, were also killed during the attacks. Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, along with the Balochistan CM and corps commander, visited the injured policemen at the Combined Military Hospital in Quetta on Sunday. In his press conference, CM Bugti also said that the state shared the grief of bereaved families and assured that the welfare of the martyrs’ children was the government’s responsibility. “We had intelligence reports that this kind of operation is being planned, and as a result of those, we had already started pre-operations a day before, in which around 40 terrorists were killed in Shaban and Panjgur,” he detailed. The chief minister noted that the terrorists had planned to attack Quetta from Shaban, adding that the forces were “very vigilant”. CM Bugti termed the Gwadar incident, where he said five women and three children were killed, as the “most painful”. After the press conference, he also played video statements of those injured in Gwadar. Noting that a “narrative of independence” had been created, he said “terrorists are using the Baloch on India’s instructions”. “Whenever Pakistan begins to take off economically or on foreign fronts, you try to destabilise Pakistan by carrying out such attacks on India’s directives.” The chief minister said the terrorists had planned to enter the Red Zone and occupy important assets, which were foiled. However, he added, “Except for Nushki, where it took us some time to disengage them. Nushki is completely clear now.” CM Bugti said tracing and combing operations were underway and vowed, “We will not let them go.” Asked about reports of the Nushki deputy commissioner being abducted, the chief minister confirmed that the official was “at a safe place and had escaped their grip” when he last spoke with him. “No city was taken over,” he clarified in response to a query, recalling that he visited various areas in Quetta. “Not a single bank was looted.” Detailing an attempt to target a police station, the chief minister said terrorists were forcefully using “children as human shields”. The Balochistan CM also assailed attempts to frame terrorism as a “political issue”. “Is BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) a registered party with whom you have to hold a dialogue? […] They purely want to impose their ideology on us with the force of guns and push the Baloch into a futile war. […] You are linking this war with deprivation and rationalising this violence too.” He asserted that “rationalising this violence in the name of ethno-nationalism was a direct support to BLA”. Bugti then asked what some people wished for to be the outcome of such a dialogue. “As a result of dialogue, they want us to surrender? We will not. We will fight this war for a thousand years,” he affirmed. “We are not ready to surrender even for a second. They can carry out a thousand such attacks. They can destabilise us, but they cannot take an inch from us. This Pakistan is not for breaking away. These people cannot do it. And neither can their masters.” CM Bugti said “tools such as certain Sardars and social media” were being used to “disintegrate” the youth from the state. He expressed the resolve to further boost engagement with the population and the youth. Responding to a question, he asserted that terrorists were only terrorists and that it upset him when they were called “Baloch terrorists”. At another query, he emphasised that the state had still kept the door for talks open — unlike in the case of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — “just because of this so-called narrative [and] confusion spread in Pakistan’s intelligentsia, mainstream political leadership, judiciary and media for the last 30 years”. The chief minister observed that in the National Action Plan , the government started treating “Baloch militants as separate” from other terrorists. “What a confused nation we are. Are we fighting a serious war? he said. Noting that terrorists blend themselves within the civilian population, the chief minister asked, “Should we become brutal like them? “We could kill 10 [terrorists] by throwing one mortar, but what about the 20 civilians with them? This is the only reason why we do not want to become brutal like them.” CM Bugti also took exception to those arguing that the Balochistan “issue cannot be solved with force”. “When has force ever been used in Balochistan?” he asked rhetorically, adding that no military operation was conducted in any city. “It is a purely intelligence-driven war,” the chief minister stressed, noting that only intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted in the province. He also accused India’s Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of backing the terrorist activities, asserting that the authorities had “solid and circumstantial evidence”. Responding to a question, CM Bugti expressed the state’s firm resolve to continue the war against terrorism. “Why will we get tired? We are the state of Pakistan. We will not get tired,” he said, adding that military operations were not needed currently as IBOs were being carried out. The chief minister noted that while “all kinds” of arms were employed in the recent attacks, those left behind after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan had “spread into the market and were provided to them by their masters”. Responding to a query about the Safe City project, CM Bugti highlighted that cameras linked to the network were also targeted as they were a “threat” to them. Asked about the surge in terrorism, the chief minister noted there were “people who adopted the policy of appeasement and the institutions” that did the same after 2018. Pointing out that the institution had “punished their person”, the PPP leader asked whether the political leadership that did the same had held its people accountable. “The biggest reason behind the rise [in terrorism] today is the post-2018 appeasement,” CM Bugti asserted, adding that the policy had always proved to be harmful for the state. “There shouldn’t be any appeasement to those who took up arms against the state of Pakistan.” The chief minister strongly refuted that there was any “public sympathy” for such acts, highlighting that the public across the entire country was strongly condemning terrorism. “The only problem is narrative and the second problem is operations in grey. This operation is grey is the biggest problem for us,” he said. CM Bugti also reiterated what he emphasised during his media talk in a statement on X, saying: “The Government of Balochistan had clearly announced that it is the responsibility of the families of those who have joined the ranks of terrorists to inform the government. “Law will take its course against all the family members of these terrorists who did not alert the government,” he asserted. Later, speaking on Geo News show ‘ Naya Pakistan with Shehzad Iqbal ’, he refuted a BBC report that 1,000 to 1,200 militants had carried out the attacks and estimated that the number could be under 200 or 250 at maximum. The CM, however, clarified he did not have the accurate number. Asked about the number of BLA militants operating in Balochistan presently, he said he did not have the exact figure for that as well but they could be around 4,000 to 5,ooo in number. ‘Mopping-up’ operation underway: defence minister Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said peace has been established in Balochistan after yesterday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”. “At this moment in time, peace has been established, and the coordinated attack has been repulsed completely, and they (terrorists) have retreated,” Asif said while addressing the media in Sialkot. The defence minister further said that attempts were made to “target the FC (Frontier Corps) headquarters” in Nushki and Dalbadin, adding that all attacks were foiled. “They attempted to carry out a suicide attack in Dalbadin,” he said, adding that “all targets have been neutralised”. Echoing Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statements, Asif blamed the incidents on neighbouring India, adding that the attacks aimed to “destabilise the country at a time when it is on the path to progress”. “Our intelligence and the confessional statements by terrorists all prove linkages to India,” the defence minister said. The minister said that the BLA was now “making use of female bombers”, detailing that women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted” on Saturday. He added that in an attack in Pasni, the terrorists made use of a “female suicide bomber”. “The minds of young women are being polluted,” he said, adding that the BLA was now targeting “labourers and poor people struggling to survive”. “Their handlers are sitting in Afghanistan, and indoctrinating young children to be used for their nefarious purposes,” he added. Asif noted that terrorists were able to “operate easily” owing to Balochistan’s vast and sparsely populated area, vowing that the government would “work towards ending this advantage”. Terrorists using civilians as human shields: Tallal Chaudhry In a separate televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said terrorists were using civilians as human shields. Therefore, security forces had to operate with great caution, which took some time, he added. He said they were “hiding behind them and in some places, using families and children as shields to escape”. “Terrorists could have been responded to within minutes, but the operation was carried out with caution on soft targets to avoid harming civilian women and children, who were being used as shields by terrorist,” Chaudhry said. “If they are so capable, why don’t they attack openly instead of hiding behind women and children?” he added. The state minister also took note of a “false narrative” being spread on social media that terrorists have taken control of some areas — a claim also rebutted by CM Bugti in his press conference. Noting that videos, in some cases AI-generated, were aired by Indian media, Chaudhry pointed out that the “extent of terrorists’ connection with Indian media” was apparent as they were “transmitting from areas with no mobile signals, creating narratives, and broadcasting them”. “This clearly indicates India is backing them financially and logistically.” The interior official further asserted, “This is not about Baloch rights; it is about targeting things used by Baloch civilians.” He also stated that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has visited Quetta, “proving that the situation is normal and showing the federal government’s support of Balochistan”. “Most terrorists were killed; many were arrested. Some escaped, but are being pursued,” the state minister said. PTI criticises centre, Balochistan govt For its part, opposition party PTI expressed concerns over the security situation in Balochistan and criticised the federal and provincial governments for “lacking strategic approach”. The opposition party condemned the terrorist attacks in a statement and said it “salutes the heroic security personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice while defending the nation”. “We extend our deepest condolences to their families and stand in solidarity with all citizens affected by these attacks. Our prayers are with the injured and their families,” the statement said. It added that the deaths of innocent civilians — including women, children, and labourers — underscored the “cruel reality that ordinary people continue to bear the heaviest toll of terrorism”. PTI expressed alarm over the “rapidly deteriorating security situation in Balochistan”, noting that the simultaneous attacks across multiple districts “clearly indicated a meticulously planned effort to spread fear, undermine peace, and destabilise the entire country”. “The current situation clearly demonstrates that there is neither a serious strategic approach at the federal level nor an understanding of ground realities by the provincial government of Balochistan,” the statement added. It further stated: “The Balochistan government, under Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, appears limited to issuing statements while the province is practically in the grip of a severe crisis.” Similarly, it said, “irresponsible statements” made by the federal government and the interior minister in the past that “downplayed the situation”, have been proved inaccurate. “PTI believes that such negligence and temporary assurances have worsened the situation in a sensitive province like Balochistan, and the nation is now paying the price through increased terrorism. “The party is also deeply concerned over reports that thousands of citizens are stranded on key highways in Balochistan following the attacks, and communication systems, including the internet, have been suspended, preventing people from receiving accurate and timely information,” the statement read. PTI emphasised in the statement that it was the fundamental responsibility of the government to keep the public informed with complete transparency, ensuring that affected families were not left in uncertainty and distress regarding their loved ones. The party emphasised that the problems in Balochistan could not be addressed through mere statements, casual measures, or political negligence. “The rising wave of terror incidents, the loss of precious lives, and the growing hardships faced by citizens demand the implementation of a comprehensive and serious policy that prioritises peace, security, and the restoration of public confidence.” Ban on gatherings, face masks In the wake of the attacks, the Balochistan government has imposed a ban on gatherings, processions and sit-ins of five or more people across the province for one month. According to a Home Department order issued on Sunday, a ban was also imposed on covering faces in public places by using mufflers, masks or any other means that obstruct identification The display or use of weapons, pillion riding, the use of tinted glasses on vehicles, and the use of unregistered vehicles were also prohibited under the order. The bans were placed under Section 144 (power to issue order absolute) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). US, Iran, France,EU condemn attack Earlier in the day, US Charge de’ Affaires Natalie Baker strongly condemned the Balochistan terrorist attacks and affirmed that the United States remained a “steadfast partner” of Pakistan in efforts to ensure peace. “The United States strongly condemns January 31 attacks and acts of terrorist violence against security personnel and civilians in Balochistan, claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Baker said on X. On behalf of the US, she extended condolences to the victims of terrorism, their families and all those affected. “The Pakistani people deserve to live free from violence and fear,” she said. Baker added: “The United States remains a steadfast partner of Pakistan in its efforts to ensure peace and stability. We stand in solidarity with Pakistan during this difficult time.” In August 2025, the US also designated the BLA and its Majeed Brigade squad as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs). Besides the US, the British High Commission, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also condemned the latest terrorist activities. In a statement issued on Sunday, the Iranian embassy in Pakistan strongly condemned the “recent terrorist attacks leading to the martyrdom of a number of innocent civilians and brave security personnel and soldiers”. It conveyed Iran’s “sincere and deepest condolences and sympathy to the government and the honourable people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families”. It also extended prayers for the martyrs and the injured. The statement affirmed that Iran, “as a matter of principle, unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism, which remains a serious threat and concern for the international community”. “Such heinous acts, often supported by extraterritorial actors, must be confronted through collective regional and international cooperation,” it noted. Moreover, a post by the French embassy in Pakistan said: “We strongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks across Balochistan. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and our profound sympathy to all those affected. “We stand in solidarity with the people of Pakistan against terrorism in all its forms.” The European union (EU) also condemned the attack in a post on X. “The EU strongly condemns and unequivocally rejects terrorism in all its forms and stands with Pakistan. “We extend our deepest condolences to the families of civilians and security personnel killed in recent attacks in Balochistan and wish a speedy recovery to those injured,” the post said.

      "summary_en": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday expressed the firm resolve to eliminate terrorists after a spate of coordinated attacks across the province, adding that 145 militants were killed within a span of 40 hours. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed 92 terrorists. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Addressing a press conference in Quetta on Sunday, CM Bugti said 145 terrorists were killed in 40 hours, adding that their bodies were in the custody of the authorities. “This is the highest number since Pakistan is facing this war on terror,” he highlighted. “Our 17 law enforcement people, including police and FC and one Navy personnel, were martyred, and our civilian casualties are 31, including some injured,” CM Bugti said. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said on Saturday night that 15 personnel were martyred during the operations and 18 civilians, including women and children, were also killed during the attacks. Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, along with the Balochistan CM and corps commander, visited the injured policemen at the Combined Military Hospital in Quetta on Sunday. In his press conference, CM Bugti also said that the state shared the grief of bereaved families and assured that the welfare of the martyrs’ children was the government’s responsibility. “We had intelligence reports that this kind of operation is being planned, and as a result of those, we had already started pre-operations a day before, in which around 40 terrorists were killed in Shaban and Panjgur,” he detailed. The chief minister noted that the terrorists had planned to attack Quetta from Shaban, adding that the forces were “very vigilant”. CM Bugti termed the Gwadar incident, where he said five women and three children were killed, as the “most painful”. After the press conference, he also played video statements of those injured in Gwadar. Noting that a “narrative of independence” had been created, he said “terrorists are using the Baloch on India’s instructions”. “Whenever Pakistan begins to take off economically or on foreign fronts, you try to destabilise Pakistan by carrying out such attacks on India’s directives.” The chief minister said the terrorists had planned to enter the Red Zone and occupy important assets, which were foiled. However, he added, “Except for Nushki, where it took us some time to disengage them. Nushki is completely clear now.” CM Bugti said tracing and combing operations were underway and vowed, “We will not let them go.” Asked about reports of the Nushki deputy commissioner being abducted, the chief minister confirmed that the official was “at a safe place and had escaped their grip” when he last spoke with him. “No city was taken over,” he clarified in response to a query, recalling that he visited various areas in Quetta. “Not a single bank was looted.” Detailing an attempt to target a police station, the chief minister said terrorists were forcefully using “children as human shields”. The Balochistan CM also assailed attempts to frame terrorism as a “political issue”. “Is BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) a registered party with whom you have to hold a dialogue? […] They purely want to impose their ideology on us with the force of guns and push the Baloch into a futile war. […] You are linking this war with deprivation and rationalising this violence too.” He asserted that “rationalising this violence in the name of ethno-nationalism was a direct support to BLA”. Bugti then asked what some people wished for to be the outcome of such a dialogue. “As a result of dialogue, they want us to surrender? We will not. We will fight this war for a thousand years,” he affirmed. “We are not ready to surrender even for a second. They can carry out a thousand such attacks. They can destabilise us, but they cannot take an inch from us. This Pakistan is not for breaking away. These people cannot do it. And neither can their masters.” CM Bugti said “tools such as certain Sardars and social media” were being used to “disintegrate” the youth from the state. He expressed the resolve to further boost engagement with the population and the youth. Responding to a question, he asserted that terrorists were only terrorists and that it upset him when they were called “Baloch terrorists”. At another query, he emphasised that the state had still kept the door for talks open — unlike in the case of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — “just because of this so-called narrative [and] confusion spread in Pakistan’s intelligentsia, mainstream political leadership, judiciary and media for the last 30 years”. The chief minister observed that in the National Action Plan , the government started treating “Baloch militants as separate” from other terrorists. “What a confused nation we are. Are we fighting a serious war? he said. Noting that terrorists blend themselves within the civilian population, the chief minister asked, “Should we become brutal like them? “We could kill 10 [terrorists] by throwing one mortar, but what about the 20 civilians with them? This is the only reason why we do not want to become brutal like them.” CM Bugti also took exception to those arguing that the Balochistan “issue cannot be solved with force”. “When has force ever been used in Balochistan?” he asked rhetorically, adding that no military operation was conducted in any city. “It is a purely intelligence-driven war,” the chief minister stressed, noting that only intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted in the province. He also accused India’s Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of backing the terrorist activities, asserting that the authorities had “solid and circumstantial evidence”. Responding to a question, CM Bugti expressed the state’s firm resolve to continue the war against terrorism. “Why will we get tired? We are the state of Pakistan. We will not get tired,” he said, adding that military operations were not needed currently as IBOs were being carried out.

Asked about the number of BLA militants operating in Balochistan presently, he said he did not have the exact figure for that as well but they could be around 4,000 to 5,ooo in number. ‘Mopping-up’ operation underway: defence minister Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said peace has been established in Balochistan after yesterday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”. “At this moment in time, peace has been established, and the coordinated attack has been repulsed completely, and they (terrorists) have retreated,” Asif said while addressing the media in Sialkot. The defence minister further said that attempts were made to “target the FC (Frontier Corps) headquarters” in Nushki and Dalbadin, adding that all attacks were foiled. “They attempted to carry out a suicide attack in Dalbadin,” he said, adding that “all targets have been neutralised”. Echoing Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statements, Asif blamed the incidents on neighbouring India, adding that the attacks aimed to “destabilise the country at a time when it is on the path to progress”. “Our intelligence and the confessional statements by terrorists all prove linkages to India,” the defence minister said. The minister said that the BLA was now “making use of female bombers”, detailing that women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted” on Saturday. He added that in an attack in Pasni, the terrorists made use of a “female suicide bomber”. “The minds of young women are being polluted,” he said, adding that the BLA was now targeting “labourers and poor people struggling to survive”. “Their handlers are sitting in Afghanistan, and indoctrinating young children to be used for their nefarious purposes,” he added. Asif noted that terrorists were able to “operate easily” owing to Balochistan’s vast and sparsely populated area, vowing that the government would “work towards ending this advantage”. Terrorists using civilians as human shields: Tallal Chaudhry In a separate televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said terrorists were using civilians as human shields. Therefore, security forces had to operate with great caution, which took some time, he added. He said they were “hiding behind them and in some places, using families and children as shields to escape”. “Terrorists could have been responded to within minutes, but the operation was carried out with caution on soft targets to avoid harming civilian women and children, who were being used as shields by terrorist,” Chaudhry said. “If they are so capable, why don’t they attack openly instead of hiding behind women and children?” he added. The state minister also took note of a “false narrative” being spread on social media that terrorists have taken control of some areas — a claim also rebutted by CM Bugti in his press conference. Noting that videos, in some cases AI-generated, were aired by Indian media, Chaudhry pointed out that the “extent of terrorists’ connection with Indian media” was apparent as they were “transmitting from areas with no mobile signals, creating narratives, and broadcasting them”. “This clearly indicates India is backing them financially and logistically.” The interior official further asserted, “This is not about Baloch rights; it is about targeting things used by Baloch civilians.” He also stated that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has visited Quetta, “proving that the situation is normal and showing the federal government’s support of Balochistan”. “Most terrorists were killed; many were arrested. Some escaped, but are being pursued,” the state minister said. PTI criticises centre, Balochistan govt For its part, opposition party PTI expressed concerns over the security situation in Balochistan and criticised the federal and provincial governments for “lacking strategic approach”. The opposition party condemned the terrorist attacks in a statement and said it “salutes the heroic security personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice while defending the nation”. “We extend our deepest condolences to their families and stand in solidarity with all citizens affected by these attacks. Our prayers are with the injured and their families,” the statement said. It added that the deaths of innocent civilians — including women, children, and labourers — underscored the “cruel reality that ordinary people continue to bear the heaviest toll of terrorism”. PTI expressed alarm over the “rapidly deteriorating security situation in Balochistan”, noting that the simultaneous attacks across multiple districts “clearly indicated a meticulously planned effort to spread fear, undermine peace, and destabilise the entire country”. “The current situation clearly demonstrates that there is neither a serious strategic approach at the federal level nor an understanding of ground realities by the provincial government of Balochistan,” the statement added. It further stated: “The Balochistan government, under Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, appears limited to issuing statements while the province is practically in the grip of a severe crisis.” Similarly, it said, “irresponsible statements” made by the federal government and the interior minister in the past that “downplayed the situation”, have been proved inaccurate. “PTI believes that such negligence and temporary assurances have worsened the situation in a sensitive province like Balochistan, and the nation is now paying the price through increased terrorism. “The party is also deeply concerned over reports that thousands of citizens are stranded on key highways in Balochistan following the attacks, and communication systems, including the internet, have been suspended, preventing people from receiving accurate and timely information,” the statement read. PTI emphasised in the statement that it was the fundamental responsibility of the government to keep the public informed with complete transparency, ensuring that affected families were not left in uncertainty and distress regarding their loved ones. The party emphasised that the problems in Balochistan could not be addressed through mere statements, casual measures, or political negligence. “The rising wave of terror incidents, the loss of precious lives, and the growing hardships faced by citizens demand the implementation of a comprehensive and serious policy that prioritises peace, security, and the restoration of public confidence.” Ban on gatherings, face masks In the wake of the attacks, the Balochistan government has imposed a ban on gatherings, processions and sit-ins of five or more people across the province for one month. According to a Home Department order issued on Sunday, a ban was also imposed on covering faces in public places by using mufflers, masks or any other means that obstruct identification The display or use of weapons, pillion riding, the use of tinted glasses on vehicles, and the use of unregistered vehicles were also prohibited under the order. The bans were placed under Section 144 (power to issue order absolute) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). US, Iran, France,EU condemn attack Earlier in the day, US Charge de’ Affaires Natalie Baker strongly condemned the Balochistan terrorist attacks and affirmed that the United States remained a “steadfast partner” of Pakistan in efforts to ensure peace. “The United States strongly condemns January 31 attacks and acts of terrorist violence against security personnel and civilians in Balochistan, claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Baker said on X. On behalf of the US, she extended condolences to the victims of terrorism, their families and all those affected. “The Pakistani people deserve to live free from violence and fear,” she said. Baker added: “The United States remains a steadfast partner of Pakistan in its efforts to ensure peace and stability. We stand in solidarity with Pakistan during this difficult time.” In August 2025, the US also designated the BLA and its Majeed Brigade squad as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs). Besides the US, the British High Commission, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also condemned the latest terrorist activities. In a statement issued on Sunday, the Iranian embassy in Pakistan strongly condemned the “recent terrorist attacks leading to the martyrdom of a number of innocent civilians and brave security personnel and soldiers”. It conveyed Iran’s “sincere and deepest condolences and sympathy to the government and the honourable people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families”. It also extended prayers for the martyrs and the injured. The statement affirmed that Iran, “as a matter of principle, unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism, which remains a serious threat and concern for the international community”. “Such heinous acts, often supported by extraterritorial actors, must be confronted through collective regional and international cooperation,” it noted. Moreover, a post by the French embassy in Pakistan said: “We strongly condemn the recent terrorist attacks across Balochistan. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and our profound sympathy to all those affected. “We stand in solidarity with the people of Pakistan against terrorism in all its forms.” The European union (EU) also condemned the attack in a post on X. “The EU strongly condemns and unequivocally rejects terrorism in all its forms and stands with Pakistan. “We extend our deepest condolences to the families of civilians and security personnel killed in recent attacks in Balochistan and wish a speedy recovery to those injured,” the post said.

      "title_orig": "‘Situation has become intolerable for Pakistan’: Envoy to UN highlights rise in terror attacks from Afghan soil",
      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, highlighting the “exponential rise” cross-border terrorist attacks from Afghanistan, has said that the situation has become “intolerable for Pakistan”. His remarks come against the backdrop of a spate of coordinate attacks in Balochistan on Saturday. Clearing operations following the attacks continued on Sunday while Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said in the afternoon that 145 militants had been killed within a span of 40 hours. The military’s media affairs wing said the attacks were carried out by Fitna-al-Hindustan — a term that the state has designated for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Pakistan has also been raising alarm over the presence of terrorists in Afghanistan and accuses the Afghan Taliban of harbouring them. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to rein in terrorist outfits operating out of Afghanistan. Speaking to Dawn on Sunday, Ambassador Ahmad reiterated the accusation that the Afghan Taliban were sheltering militant groups operating against Pakistan and highlighted what he described as India’s long-standing support for proxy elements active from Afghan soil. He said the UN secretary general had “quite rightly pointed out” earlier this week that the international community expected the Afghan Taliban to ensure Afghan soil was not used for cross-border terrorism. The envoy noted that this commitment was central to the original Doha process but remained unfulfilled. Under the Doha agreement in 2020, which paved the way for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years, Kabul had committed to preventing militant groups from using its soil to threaten the security of the US, its allies and other countries. A recent article in US-based magazine Foreign Affairs said that terrorist violence in Pakistan has surged since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. It further described the Pakistan-Afghanistan border as “the most worrisome flashpoint in South Asia today.” The magazine noted that the simmering conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan now threatened to escalate, with potentially damaging consequences for the wider region. Citing Pakistani research organisations, Foreign Affairs reported that 2025 was Pakistan’s deadliest year in a decade. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, the country experienced a sharp rise in terrorist attacks, including by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The magazine described the upward trend as deeply concerning and warned that Pakistan could face even deadlier attacks in the near future. The report highlighted that repeated mediation efforts — including talks facilitated by Qatar, Turkiye, and Saudi Arabia — have failed to secure a lasting Taliban commitment to rein in the TTP. Cross-border strikes and retaliatory exchanges in recent months have further heightened tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, raising fears of a broader confrontation. According to the article, the Taliban appear unwilling to take action against the TTP, which maintains close ideological and operational ties with the Afghan Taliban. The magazine also suggested that the Afghan Taliban may be leveraging their confrontation with Pakistan for domestic political advantage, as defying Islamabad could bolster their legitimacy amid long-standing public resentment in their country. Of particular concern for Pakistan is the Taliban’s growing engagement with India. Foreign Affairs warned that warming Taliban-India ties, coinciding with a surge in attacks inside Pakistan, could further complicate regional security dynamics. Ambassador Ahmad pointed out that “the large presence of the TTP in Afghanistan, together with BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) Fitna-al- Hindustan , and their terrorist acts against Pakistan from Afghan soil, have also been reported by the UN Monitoring Team.” “There has been an exponential rise in terrorist attacks in recent years in Pakistan originating from across the border from Afghanistan,” he said, calling the situation “intolerable for Pakistan.” Reiterating Pakistan’s resolve to respond decisively, he said: “We are taking all necessary steps to counter and eliminate this menace, and we are resolute in this objective.” Pakistan attached particular importance to the Taliban’s pledge that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against other countries, the envoy said. “This undertaking has not been fulfilled,” he said. “The Taliban have failed to do so.” Ambassador Ahmad accused the Taliban authorities of complicity: “Not only have they failed to prevent these activities, they have sheltered, actively supported, and collaborated with these elements.” He asserted that the terrorists also enjoyed “external support,” adding: “It is well known that India has all along supported these proxies working against Pakistan.” He said concerns about Afghanistan had also been echoed by members of the Security Council. “There is broad recognition of the danger posed by terrorism emanating from Afghanistan,” he noted, adding that the country “unfortunately remains a terrorism hub under the Taliban,” a point raised by several council members during the most recent meeting on Afghanistan.",

      "summary_en": "WASHINGTON: Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, highlighting the “exponential rise” cross-border terrorist attacks from Afghanistan, has said that the situation has become “intolerable for Pakistan”. His remarks come against the backdrop of a spate of coordinate attacks in Balochistan on Saturday. Clearing operations following the attacks continued on Sunday while Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said in the afternoon that 145 militants had been killed within a span of 40 hours. The military’s media affairs wing said the attacks were carried out by Fitna-al-Hindustan — a term that the state has designated for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Pakistan has also been raising alarm over the presence of terrorists in Afghanistan and accuses the Afghan Taliban of harbouring them. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to rein in terrorist outfits operating out of Afghanistan. Speaking to Dawn on Sunday, Ambassador Ahmad reiterated the accusation that the Afghan Taliban were sheltering militant groups operating against Pakistan and highlighted what he described as India’s long-standing support for proxy elements active from Afghan soil. He said the UN secretary general had “quite rightly pointed out” earlier this week that the international community expected the Afghan Taliban to ensure Afghan soil was not used for cross-border terrorism. The envoy noted that this commitment was central to the original Doha process but remained unfulfilled. Under the Doha agreement in 2020, which paved the way for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years, Kabul had committed to preventing militant groups from using its soil to threaten the security of the US, its allies and other countries. A recent article in US-based magazine Foreign Affairs said that terrorist violence in Pakistan has surged since the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021. It further described the Pakistan-Afghanistan border as “the most worrisome flashpoint in South Asia today.” The magazine noted that the simmering conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan now threatened to escalate, with potentially damaging consequences for the wider region. Citing Pakistani research organisations, Foreign Affairs reported that 2025 was Pakistan’s deadliest year in a decade. According to the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies, the country experienced a sharp rise in terrorist attacks, including by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The magazine described the upward trend as deeply concerning and warned that Pakistan could face even deadlier attacks in the near future. The report highlighted that repeated mediation efforts — including talks facilitated by Qatar, Turkiye, and Saudi Arabia — have failed to secure a lasting Taliban commitment to rein in the TTP. Cross-border strikes and retaliatory exchanges in recent months have further heightened tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, raising fears of a broader confrontation. According to the article, the Taliban appear unwilling to take action against the TTP, which maintains close ideological and operational ties with the Afghan Taliban. The magazine also suggested that the Afghan Taliban may be leveraging their confrontation with Pakistan for domestic political advantage, as defying Islamabad could bolster their legitimacy amid long-standing public resentment in their country. Of particular concern for Pakistan is the Taliban’s growing engagement with India. Foreign Affairs warned that warming Taliban-India ties, coinciding with a surge in attacks inside Pakistan, could further complicate regional security dynamics.

      "summary_orig": "Israel said on Sunday it was terminating the humanitarian operations of the international charity Doctors Without Borders in Gaza after the organisation failed to provide a list of its Palestinian staff. “The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism is moving to terminate the activities of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in the Gaza Strip,” the ministry said. The decision follows “MSF’s failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region”, it added, stating that the group will cease its work and leave Gaza by February 28. In December, the ministry announced it would prevent 37 aid organisations, including MSF, from operating in Gaza from March 1 for failing to provide detailed information about their Palestinian staff. It had alleged that two MSF employees had links with Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which the medical charity vehemently denies. On Sunday, the ministry said MSF had committed in early January that it would share the staff list as required by the Israeli authorities. “Despite its public commitment, the organisation refrained from transferring the lists,” the ministry said. “Subsequently, MSF announced it does not intend to proceed with the registration process at all, contradicting its previous statements and the binding protocol. “In accordance with the regulations, MSF will cease its operations and depart the Gaza Strip by February 28, 2026,” the ministry added. In a statement posted on its website on Friday, MSF acknowledged that it had, as an “exceptional measure”, agreed to share a list of names of its Palestinian and international staff with the Israeli authorities. “However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required,” the charity said. “These included that any staff information would be used only for its stated administrative purpose and would not [be used to put] colleagues at risk.” MSF said it had not received assurances on these fronts, so “concluded that we will not share staff information in the current circumstances”. Israel to partially reopen Gaza’s Rafah crossing today Meanwhile, Israel is set to partially reopen the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt today, following months of urging from humanitarian organisations, though access will be limited to the movement of people. The reopening comes amid ongoing violence in the Palestinian territory, with Gaza’s civil defence agency reporting dozens killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday, while the Israeli military said it was retaliating against ceasefire violations. The Rafah crossing is a vital gateway for both civilians and aid, but has remained closed since Israeli forces seized control of it in May 2024 during the war with Hamas, aside from a brief and limited reopening in early 2025. Israel had previously said it would not reopen the crossing until the remains of Ran Gvili — the last Israeli hostage held in Gaza — were returned. His remains were recovered days ago, and he was laid to rest in Israel on Wednesday. “The Rafah Crossing will open this coming Sunday (February 1) in both directions, for limited movement of people only,” COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body overseeing civil affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories, said on Friday. Entry and exit “will be permitted in coordination with Egypt, following prior security clearance of individuals by Israel, and under the supervision of the European Union mission”, it added. However, key details remain unclear, including how many people will be allowed to cross and whether those seeking to return to Gaza will be permitted entry. A source at the border told AFP that Sunday would be largely devoted to preparations and logistical arrangements. The crossing is set to open on Sunday on a trial basis to allow the passage of wounded individuals, ahead of a regular reopening scheduled for Monday, three sources at the crossing said. However, no agreement has yet been reached on the number of Palestinians permitted to enter or exit, the sources added, noting that Egypt plans to admit “all Palestinians whom Israel authorises to leave” the territory. “Every day that passes drains my life and worsens my condition,” said Mohammed Shamiya, 33, who suffers from kidney disease and requires dialysis treatment abroad. “I’m waiting every moment for the opening of the Rafah land crossing.” Anxious wait Safa al-Hawajri, who has received a scholarship to study overseas, is also eagerly awaiting the reopening on Sunday. “I’m waiting in the hope of fulfilling my ambition, which is tied to the reopening of the crossing,” said Hawajri, 18. “I hope to be able to travel as soon as it opens.” Located on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, Rafah is the only crossing into and out of the territory that does not pass through Israel. The crossing lies in an area held by Israeli forces following their withdrawal behind the so-called “Yellow Line” under the terms of a US-brokered ceasefire that came into effect on October 10. Israeli troops still control more than half of Gaza, while the rest remains under Hamas authority. The ceasefire has now entered its second phase and calls for reopening the crossing following the release or return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Hamas had called for its full reopening in both directions after the remains of Gvili were brought back to Israel. The reopening is expected to facilitate the entry of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic body, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), established to oversee the day-to-day governance of the territory’s 2.2 million residents. The committee is to operate under the supervision of the so-called “Board of Peace” chaired by US President Donald Trump. The NCAG, headed by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath , is expected to enter the Gaza Strip once the Rafah crossing reopens. Violence continued ahead of the crossing’s reopening. At least 32 people, including children, were killed on Saturday in Israeli air strikes in Gaza, reported the civil defence agency. Israel’s military said the strikes were retaliation for an incident on Friday in which eight Palestinian fighters exited a tunnel in the city of Rafah, which it said violated the ceasefire.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan, along with seven other Muslim-majority countries, condemned on Sunday the repeated violations of the ceasefire in Gaza by Israel, asserting that these actions risked undermining efforts for restoring stability at a time when regional and international partners were working collectively to advance the second phase of US President Donald Trump’s plan. The eight countries — Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan , Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and United Arab Emirates — had worked with Trump’s administration on a plan last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. Implementation of the plan began in October 2025, leading to a ceasefire in Gaza more than two years after the onslaught began. Israel, however, has repeatedly violated the the truce, carrying out strikes in the Strip. Meanwhile, work is ongoing on the second phase of Trump’s plan, shifting focus from ceasefire implementation to demilitarisation, technocratic governance and reconstruction. In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the eight countries that worked on the plan, said strongly condemned Israel’s repeated violations of the ceasefire in Gaza, “which have resulted in the killing and injuring of more than a thousand Palestinians”. “These actions risk escalating tensions and undermining efforts aimed at consolidating calm and restoring stability, at a time when regional and international parties are working collectively to advance the second phase of President Donald Trump’s peace plan and to implement the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803,” the statement said. It said the foreign ministers of the eight countries “consider that these repeated violations constitute a direct threat to the political process and hinder ongoing efforts to create appropriate conditions for transitioning to a more stable phase in the Gaza Strip, both in terms of security and humanitarian conditions, and stress the necessity of full commitment to ensuring the success of the second phase of President Trump’s peace plan”. They called on all parties to “fully uphold their responsibilities during this critical period and to exercise the utmost restraint, in order to preserve and sustain the ceasefire, refrain from any actions that may undermine the current process, and create favourable conditions to move forward toward early recovery and reconstruction, as well as advancing a just and lasting peace grounded in the Palestinian right to self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and the Arab peace initiative”.",
