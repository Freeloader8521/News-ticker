      "summary_orig": "Former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s recent shenanigans have brought back memories of what it was like when the mercurial man from Dera was the focus of PTI’s politics in the province. His sudden departure from the party’s tumultuous politics in October of last year, had turned the political dynamics of the province on its head. In a way, his fate was not too different from that of other PTI-nominated chief ministers who came before him – Mahmood Khan and Parvez Khattak. They too faded into the political wilderness once removed from power. With the PTI currently in the throes of another leadership crisis, the Sardar from Kulachi returned with a bang. For almost five months, Gandapur shied away from the media limelight that he so loved while in office. But in recent media appearances, he is clearly back to his boisterous self. While the party’s energies were fully devoted towards highlighting Imran Khan’s health issues and pushing the narrative that he has been denied timely treatment, the jilted former CM’s resurfacing was being viewed with a mixture of trepidation and chagrin. ‘Comeback tour’ Earlier this week, he showed up at a PTI protest in Islamabad, breaking his silence by giving back-to-back interviews to TV channels and podcasts, where he trashed his party and its leadership without restraint. He even praised Mohsin Naqvi – at a time when the party regards him as one of those responsible for the current plight of their leader – claiming that the federal interior minister had made “more serious and sustained efforts than anyone else to secure Imran’s release from jail.” This even prompted KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi to remark that Gandapur was Naqvi’s “good boy”. “Naqvi had adopted him, and I do not think the interior minister has made any attempt to release Imran,” the governor said in a TV appearance following the former CM’s re-emergence. In his recent comments, the man from Dera also targeted Aleema Khan. This seemed to be a continuation of his gripe with Imran’s sister, whose influence he had previously blamed for his ouster from office last year. The subjects Gandapur broached upon raised many eyebrows, both among the leadership and commentators, and his behaviour left political pundits guessing: what motivated this sudden outburst, and what is his endgame? Over the course of the past week, Dawn reached out to PTI central spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram, provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan and provincial government spokesperson Shafi Jan for comment. While the former two did not respond to requests for comment, the latter simply refused to discuss the matter, saying it was “the party’s internal issue and he could not comment on it.” A spokesperson for Gandapur initially agreed to respond to written queries, but did not respond to subsequent communications. Then, on Friday night, a few days after opening Pandora’s Box, Gandapur seemed to have a change of heart, issuing a two-minute video, where he reluctantly apologised for his outburst. “People are creating a controversy out of my angry remarks. If my remarks have hurt someone… I am sorry for the time being,” he said. Gandapur justified his anger by saying that the party had been unable to secure their legitimate demand of ensuring proper treatment for the incarcerated Imran. “If someone is not angered by this, than they lack humanity,’” he said. Party insiders’ views “The question is why the former chief minister, who remained sequestered from politics in his Dera lair for the past several months, suddenly made an appearance in Islamabad,” a PTI office bearer requesting anonymity, told Dawn . He said the former chief minister’s staff had cited several court cases against him in the federal capital as the reason why he stayed in his native town. “Now all of a sudden his legal troubles are of no consequence, and he is on every talk show in town.” However, a local journalist in Dera Ismail Khan contested this assertion, saying Gandapur was staying in Islamabad most of the time after his resignation and visited his native town occasionally. “He had become very active in district politics over the last month,” the journalist said. In PTI circles, party leaders are especially puzzled by the timing of Gandapur’s statements. The social media brigade, meanwhile, feels vindicated, having dubbed Gandapur a “sellout and an establishment tout” long ago. “Gandapur is a good politician, but whenever he faces a camera, he loses control over his emotions,” said one PTI insider. He said that the PTI honoured him and he should play his role when the party is under pressure, but “the time was not opportune for his utterances”. “If what he did in Islamabad continues, then he could turn into another Sher Afzal Marwat,” he said. MNA Marwat, an outspoken lawyer, had risen to prominence by leading demonstrations after the party and workers were at the receiving end of a crackdown in the aftermath of the May 9 violence. He was later expelled from the party’s ranks for similarly divisive statements, upon Imran’s orders. Gandapur’s outburst, according to a senior party leader, carried even more sinister undertones. “Ali Amin wanted to undermine his successor, KP Chief Minister Muhammad Sohail Afridi, and his efforts, which is why he has given these statements,” he said. Describing the former chief minister as ‘a loose cannon’, the senior party leader said Gandapur may be eyeing an opportunity for himself in case of Afridi’s disqualification – the matter of code of conduct violations in the Haripur by-poll is pending against the incumbent before the Election Commission of Pakistan. “The powers that be have hinted to Gandapur that he has another chance of becoming chief minister if Afridi is disqualified, and that is why he has been flexing [his muscles],” he said. Gandapur, the senior party leader said, has little goodwill left in the party, and even if Afridi is disqualified, the party was unlikely to entrust him with the responsibility of leading KP again. Meanwhile, Aleema, who has been at the receiving end of several of Gandapur’s attacks, dismissed his outbursts as a case of “shooting the messenger”. “Since they owe their seats to Imran, they cannot say anything against him, so they target the family instead,” she said, in a recent interview with Independent Urdu . “And when they are saying anything against us, they are [actually] venting their anger against Imran,” she said.",

      "title_orig": "Trump to travel to China next month, with US tariffs in focus",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for a highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies, a trip announced as the Supreme Court overturned Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imported goods. A White House official confirmed the trip on Friday, just before the highest US court dealt Trump a stinging defeat by striking down many of the tariffs he has used in a global trade war, including some against rival China. Trump’s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on an extended visit to Beijing had been expected to revolve around extending a trade truce that kept both countries from further hiking tariffs. Ruling raises questions for US-China relations But the Supreme Court’s reversal created new questions for tense US-China relations that had recently stabilised after Trump trimmed tariffs on Chinese goods, in exchange for measures from Beijing, including cracking down on the illicit fentanyl trade and pausing export restrictions on critical minerals. Twenty percent tariffs on China’s US-bound exports were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the court ruled Trump had overstepped. Those tariffs were tied to national emergencies related to fentanyl distribution and trade imbalances. Other duties on Chinese goods, including those implemented under legislated trade authorities known as Section 301 and Section 232, remain in place. It was not immediately clear how many of the tariffs Trump would restore, but he told a press conference that he would impose a new 10% global tariff for 150 days. Trump’s last trip to China, in 2017, was the most recent by a US president. “That’s going to be a wild one,” Trump told foreign leaders visiting Washington on Thursday about the upcoming China visit. “We have to put on the biggest display you’ve ever had in the history of China.” The Chinese embassy in Washington declined to comment on the dates of the trip, which were first reported by Reuters. Beijing has not confirmed the trip. Trump sees trade imbalance as national emergency The Trump administration has said the global tariffs were necessary because of national emergencies related to trade imbalances that have weakened US manufacturing. Trump had already been “playing defense” in the trade war, given the effectiveness of Beijing’s threat to cut off rare earths, said Scott Kennedy, a China economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The tariff defeat likely “cements his weakness in their eyes,” he said. Chinese officials “like the direction of travel of the bilateral relationship in which the US is diminished and they want to keep things from re-escalating,” Kennedy said. Trump’s visit will be the leaders’ first in-person talks since an October meeting in South Korea, where they agreed on the trade truce. While the October meeting largely sidestepped the sensitive issue of Taiwan, Xi raised US arms sales to the island when the two leaders spoke this month. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a position Taipei rejects. The US, bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, has formal diplomatic ties with China, but it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island’s most important arms supplier. Washington announced its largest-ever arms sale approval with Taiwan in December, including $11.1 billion in weapons that could ostensibly be used to defend against a Chinese attack. Taiwan expects more such sales. Xi also said during the February call that he would consider further increasing soybean purchases, according to Trump. Struggling US farmers are a major political constituency for Trump, and China is the top soybean consumer. Analysts said on Friday that China may be less likely to follow through on another big purchase of US soybeans after the Supreme Court ruling. Although Trump has justified hawkish policy steps from Canada to Greenland and Venezuela as necessary to thwart China, he has eased policy toward Beijing in the past several months in areas from tariffs to advanced computer chips and drones. The global trade war Trump initiated after he began his second term as president in January 2025 has alienated other trading partners, including allies. Critics had argued that imposing steep tariffs on countries across the board actually insulated Beijing from the tariff barrage and reduced incentives to move supply chains out of China. Friday’s ruling could indirectly increase pressure on Beijing if the effective tariff rates on other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, fall more than those on China, said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. “Unlike with many other countries, there is a well-established, much more legally durable mechanism for most of the tariffs on China that make them less affected than those on other countries,” Chorzempa said.",

Friday’s ruling could indirectly increase pressure on Beijing if the effective tariff rates on other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, fall more than those on China, said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. “Unlike with many other countries, there is a well-established, much more legally durable mechanism for most of the tariffs on China that make them less affected than those on other countries,” Chorzempa said.",
      "title": "Trump to travel to China next month, with US tariffs in focus",
      "summary": "US President Donald Trump will travel to China from March 31 to April 2 for a highly anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies, a trip announced as the Supreme Court overturned Trump’s sweeping tariffs on imported goods. A White House official confirmed the trip on Friday, just before the highest US court dealt Trump a stinging defeat by striking down many of the tariffs he has used in a global trade war, including some against rival China. Trump’s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on an extended visit to Beijing had been expected to revolve around extending a trade truce that kept both countries from further hiking tariffs. Ruling raises questions for US-China relations But the Supreme Court’s reversal created new questions for tense US-China relations that had recently stabilised after Trump trimmed tariffs on Chinese goods, in exchange for measures from Beijing, including cracking down on the illicit fentanyl trade and pausing export restrictions on critical minerals. Twenty percent tariffs on China’s US-bound exports were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, which the court ruled Trump had overstepped. Those tariffs were tied to national emergencies related to fentanyl distribution and trade imbalances. Other duties on Chinese goods, including those implemented under legislated trade authorities known as Section 301 and Section 232, remain in place. It was not immediately clear how many of the tariffs Trump would restore, but he told a press conference that he would impose a new 10% global tariff for 150 days. Trump’s last trip to China, in 2017, was the most recent by a US president. “That’s going to be a wild one,” Trump told foreign leaders visiting Washington on Thursday about the upcoming China visit. “We have to put on the biggest display you’ve ever had in the history of China.” The Chinese embassy in Washington declined to comment on the dates of the trip, which were first reported by Reuters. Beijing has not confirmed the trip. Trump sees trade imbalance as national emergency The Trump administration has said the global tariffs were necessary because of national emergencies related to trade imbalances that have weakened US manufacturing. Trump had already been “playing defense” in the trade war, given the effectiveness of Beijing’s threat to cut off rare earths, said Scott Kennedy, a China economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The tariff defeat likely “cements his weakness in their eyes,” he said. Chinese officials “like the direction of travel of the bilateral relationship in which the US is diminished and they want to keep things from re-escalating,” Kennedy said. Trump’s visit will be the leaders’ first in-person talks since an October meeting in South Korea, where they agreed on the trade truce. While the October meeting largely sidestepped the sensitive issue of Taiwan, Xi raised US arms sales to the island when the two leaders spoke this month. China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a position Taipei rejects. The US, bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, has formal diplomatic ties with China, but it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island’s most important arms supplier. Washington announced its largest-ever arms sale approval with Taiwan in December, including $11.1 billion in weapons that could ostensibly be used to defend against a Chinese attack. Taiwan expects more such sales. Xi also said during the February call that he would consider further increasing soybean purchases, according to Trump. Struggling US farmers are a major political constituency for Trump, and China is the top soybean consumer. Analysts said on Friday that China may be less likely to follow through on another big purchase of US soybeans after the Supreme Court ruling. Although Trump has justified hawkish policy steps from Canada to Greenland and Venezuela as necessary to thwart China, he has eased policy toward Beijing in the past several months in areas from tariffs to advanced computer chips and drones. The global trade war Trump initiated after he began his second term as president in January 2025 has alienated other trading partners, including allies. Critics had argued that imposing steep tariffs on countries across the board actually insulated Beijing from the tariff barrage and reduced incentives to move supply chains out of China. Friday’s ruling could indirectly increase pressure on Beijing if the effective tariff rates on other countries, particularly in Southeast Asia, fall more than those on China, said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. “Unlike with many other countries, there is a well-established, much more legally durable mechanism for most of the tariffs on China that make them less affected than those on other countries,” Chorzempa said.",

      "summary_orig": "COLOMBO: The struggles of stalwarts Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi have come under the spotlight as Pakistan eye a winning start to their T20 World Cup Super Eight campaign against New Zealand at the R. Premadasa Stadium here on Saturday. While Babar failed to deliver in his newly-assumed number four role — barring a decent outing against the USA — during the group stage, Shaheen has emerged as one of Pakistan’s weaker links throughout the tournament so far. The duo may well take a back seat against the BlackCaps, with the less experienced yet promising Khawaja Nafay and Salman Mirza expected to be entrusted with middle-order batting and new-ball bowling duties, respectively. On the eve of the fixture, Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson laid bare Babar’s vulnerabilities with the bat and hinted the former skipper could contribute only in a specific role, providing context as to why he was not sent in during the last group game against Namibia. “We think he’s a fine player through the middle, if required, in terms of if we’re in a little bit of trouble, or as we saw against the USA, once he gets himself set, he can increase his strike rate at that point,” said the coach. “So, we brought Babar back in for a specific role post the Asia Cup. We wanted some batsmanship through the middle, and he certainly brings that for us. “And he did in many games thro­ughout the last 10. So, the other day we got to the 12th over mark and at that point, Babar Azam is not the best person to come in.” Instead of Babar, Nafay was promoted to bat at four. Although the right-hander did not shine on his World Cup debut, it signalled that Pakistan had made significant adjustments to their initial plans. “We’ve got plenty of other opti­ons who can come in and perform that role towards the end,” Hesson said. For Shaheen, who was rushed back into the side following an injury two months ago, the T20 World Cup has been unforgiving. The left-armer, who once struck fear into opening batters, has conceded 11.22 runs per over during the showpiece, having bowled only nine overs in total. Salman, in contrast, has conceded six runs per over in the two matches he has bowled. The left-arm medium-pacer was dropped after a decent showing against the Netherlands, and missed the following two matches before replacing Shaheen in the Namibia fixture. The former, however, is likely to be Pakistan’s first choice in the upcoming games. “We made a call that Salman Mirza was coming in for Shaheen,” Hesson said. “He bowled incredibly well. To be fair, he was probably really unlucky not to be playing the second and third games. “His record since he started playing for Pakistan is exceptional.” Hesson said Pakistan would continue to back their spin-heavy strategy, at least in Colombo, even if that meant fielding a side packed with all-rounders. “[Mohammad] Nawaz is one of the best performing spinners in the world in T20 cricket,” said the New Zealander. “Since Shadab Khan came back, his figures have been exceptional. “Saim Ayub is already in the side and obviously has the ability to bowl the carrom ball. The fact that Usman Tariq has been able to bowl the tough overs through the middle and at the death has been a real advantage for us.” For New Zealand, meanwhile, the Super Eight stage will test their adaptability, with the side having played all their group matches in India. Pace, bounce and spin in Colo­mbo are likely to differ markedly from conditions in Chennai and Ahm­edabad, but batter Mark Chap­man said the players were well aware of the variations in pitches. “I think guys understand what they need to do on slower wickets after playing in India where pitches were batting friendly,” said the middle-order player. “So, we’re pretty confident that we’ll face up to whatever conditions are in front of us. “A lot of the guys have played a lot of cricket here before.” Pakistan have played all four of their matches in Sri Lanka and possess a potent spin attack. Chapman was confident New Zealand could cope with Pakistan’s spinners, including the unorthodox Usman, who pauses in his delivery stride and employs deceptive variations, including side-arm releases. “Obviously, Tariq has a pretty unique action with the way that he stops at the crease and that’s something to factor in,” Chapman said. “But each of the Pakistan spinners poses their own threat.” Published in Dawn, February 21st, 2026",

One carrier strike group — spearheaded by the nuclear-powered USS Abraham Lincoln — is already deployed 700 kilometres off the Iranian shore. It carries a complement of 60-90 aircraft including stealth fighters, attack helicopters and a full electronic warfare suite. Another carrier strike group, led by the USS Gerald Ford will be arriving in a week or less. The most advanced US carrier in the fleet, the Ford will add 70-plus aircraft to the tally, along with its advanced radar systems. Both carriers are supported by numerous military vessels, including high-tech destroyers, meaning that about a third of US naval assets are, or will soon be, in a position to strike Iran. F-15 Strike Eagles, F-35A stealth fighters and F-22 Raptors have been deployed from bases in the UK, Spain and Germany to the Middle East with additional assets en route from the US. More importantly, the US has deployed six out of its 16 E-3 Sentry aircraft to the region. The Sentry is America’s most advanced ‘eye in the sky’ command and control platform capable of airborne surveillance and early warning, with the ability to track over 600 targets simultaneously — aircraft, drones, cruise and ballistic missiles — and effectively coordinates the entire airspace of the battle. It’s a flying super-radar and the mother of all force multipliers rolled into one and it is not deployed lightly or for PR purposes. With its inclusion, the US has deployed a quarter of its entire airpower to the Middle East, making it the largest deployment of US airpower in the region since the 2003 Iraq war. Is all this for show? Is such a massive deployment only a bargaining tool? That’s unlikely at best and delusional at worst. Nor is the build-up limited to offence; anti-missile systems are in place across the region to interdict any missile and drone attacks by Iran on Israel or US bases. Those who believe the US has no intention of attacking Iran point to the lack of boots on the ground, but that calculation is based on the flawed premise that the US has any intention of occupying Iran. It does not; this would run contrary to the Trumpian way of war: short and sharp conflicts that can be sold as a victory for the president while also showcasing America’s unparalleled military might. It is sufficient for the US to simply bomb away all of Iran’s offensive and defensive capabilities, degrade its command and control, and attempt to isolate, incapacitate or decapitate Iran’s military and political leadership. In that calculus it would open up the way, as the extremist evangelical US Senator Lindsey Graham said “for the Iranian people to stage their own regime change”. With the weakening of central authority, one should expect Kurdish militants and separatists in Sistan-Baluchestan to step up their atta­cks, with the Mujahideen-i-Khalq staging guest appearances. All this will undoubtedly receive not just CIA support but also Mossad’s, which we have seen has deep infiltration in Iran. A beaten, broken and balkanised Iran, along the lines of Libya, Sudan, Iraq and Syria, would suit Israel perfectly; it’s what they want for the entire Middle East, as per the Yinon Plan of the 1980s. The US has deployed a quarter of its airpower to the Mideast As for the US, only the naïve would believe that there is a difference between their aims and those of Israel, at least when it comes to Iran, and then there are domestic politics to consider; given the fallout of the Epstein files , with even some Republican politicians calling out President Donald Trump. Would it be hard to imagine that he would start a war as a distraction? Didn’t Bill Clinton bomb Afgh­anistan and Sudan just three days after testifying to his relationship with Monica Lewinsky? But negotiations are still on between Iran and the US and, yes, there is a non-zero possibility they may succeed. What exactly is on the table? What are the face-saving off-ramps? For Iran to give up its enriched uranium is political and strategic suicide; anything less would be unacceptable to America. And then there is the big picture. China buys up to 80 per cent of Iran’s oil – some 1.38 million barrels a day — amounting to 14pc of China’s seaborne crude oil imports. Taking that off the table, or even disrupting it, amounts to economic warfare against China and can be seen as a prelude to containment, much like Venezuela before it. Because if you actually believe the US is ‘managing’ its decline and is happy to allow China its sphere of influence, then you’re wrong. The US plans to be the dominant global power for the foreseeable future and is acting accordingly. In that pursuit, chaos in Iran is indeed a desirable outcome. The writer is a journalist.

      "summary_orig": "A RECENT fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has called for an urgent high-level judicial inquiry into deaths during so-called operations conducted by the Punjab Police’s Crime Control Department, which has allegedly adopted a “deliberate policy of staged police encounters leading to extrajudicial killings”. According to the report, as many as 924 suspects were killed in at least 670 CCD-led encounters across Punjab over eight months in 2025 since the launch of the special branch of police created to curb organised crime and heinous offences. The CCD’s performance has been hailed by Punjab’s political leadership as a great achievement that has protected citizens’ life, property and honour. However, HRCP has rightly described such killings — averaging more than two fatal encounters per day — as “institutionalised practice”. The Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act, 2022, requires the Federal Investigation Agency to investigate every death in police custody under the supervision of the National Commission for Human Rights. Inquiries by judicial magistrates are required under Section 174 and 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc) in the case of custodial deaths. There’s no evidence that these legal formalities were observed to even try to ‘justify’ such fake encounters. It appears that this police culture of impunity has been perpetrated and patronised by those at the helm of political and security affairs in Pakistan’s largest province. HRCP has pointed to the lack of accountability mechanisms behind the CCD’s cold-blooded violence. A uniform template of allegations is followed: suspects open fire first, police fire back in self-defence, and, under highly improbable circumstances, the suspects are killed in their accomplices’ friendly fire; the dead suspects then turn out to be “hardened criminals”. These have been declared “lethal shortcuts” secured by bypassing proper investigation, prosecution and judicial oversight. HRCP wants an immediate “moratorium” on all encounter operations until legal safeguards and independent accountability mechanisms are established. After a year’s pre-service training at Police College Sihala in 1977, I was sent to Punjab to serve as assistant superintendent of police at Sheikhupura, Pakpattan and Jhang sub-divisions. Punjab Police has a reputation for using strong-arm tactics against criminals. A tough police chief in Lahore was known as ‘Halaku Khan’. Since the 19th century, Punjab Police’s interrogation techniques have been part of folklore. ‘Effective’ police officers were projected as macho figures in Punjab’s vast hinterlands. There were two types of officers: those who believed that the ends justified the means and harsh and extrajudicial measures were effective crime-control methods; the other smaller group comprised those who believed in the rule of law, due process and adherence to a code that gave primacy to human rights and dignity over brutality. Punjab’s current style of policing can be described as draconian. My father’s profession as a lawyer and his being a disciple of Mohammad Ali Jinnah set my course; I chose the path less trodden, which followed the rule of law. As SSP, I was appointed Lahore police chief in 1991; a recent predecessor was said to be an ‘encounter specialist’. The younger brother of the then prime minister was heading a crime control committee for Lahore district. It took me a while to make him understand that crime can be controlled through the painstaking tasks of intelligence collection and professional (and not extra-legal) interrogation of suspects, thorough investigations, collection of credible (and not cooked-up) evidence, assiduous prosecutions and meticulous trials. Over the next two years, the Lahore police took a rule-of-law approach to control crime as the media of those years can testify. The same politician became Punjab chief minister in 1997 and his elder brother the prime minister. On the recommendation of the then inspector-general of police (IGP) and chief secretary, he posted me as DIG of Faisalabad region. Terrorism and sectarian violence were at their peak in those days. The Crime Investigation Department was reorganised and an elite police force created to tackle sectarian violence. The Anti-Terrorism Act was promulgated in 1997, and special speedy trial courts were established. Within two years, hundreds of sectarian terrorists, mainly belonging to Sunni and Shia militant groups were arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated. Sectarian violence came down through lawful measures. Later, the CID was upgraded to the Counter-Terrorism Department and further successes were achieved. Both the political and security establishments achieved the desired results through an approach based on due process and the rule of law. Punjab’s current style of policing can be described as draconian. In the last three years or so, extremely harsh measures have been used against peaceful political protests, and the privacy of homes has been violated. Above all, extrajudicial and custodial killings by the CCD have created an environment of distrust and disgust. The ill-advised promulgation of the Torture and Custodial Death Act in 2022 has not stopped the killer cops from fighting crime by simply eliminating criminals. Will the federal police carry out a scrutiny of the provincial force? I doubt it. They themselves appear to be partners in this crime. The strategy of creating a special crime control department should be re-examined by Punjab’s political leadership. Shortcuts to fighting crime and populist displays of swift justice will backfire. Violence begets violence. Judicial scrutiny of custodial and extrajudicial killings under Sections 174 and 176 of CrPC is the only way to ensure viable and legal accountability. In our policing days, we were genuinely concerned when high courts took notice of illegal detentions, the misuse of force and deaths in custody. We would not let our juniors run amok. By following the unlawful directions of the ruling elite and deep state, the current police leadership has failed. They must now draw the line and ensure that the police follow the law and enhance their investigative skills and capacity. There are three key public office holders in a province: the IGP, the high court chief justice and the political chief executive. Will they follow the constitutional path or take the illegal course of reckless lawlessness that promotes a culture of impunity? We’ll know the answer for no one can escape scrutiny and eventual accountability that this holy month of fasting and introspection provides to all of us, especially the rulers.

      "title": "Culture of impunity",
      "summary": "A RECENT fact-finding report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has called for an urgent high-level judicial inquiry into deaths during so-called operations conducted by the Punjab Police’s Crime Control Department, which has allegedly adopted a “deliberate policy of staged police encounters leading to extrajudicial killings”. According to the report, as many as 924 suspects were killed in at least 670 CCD-led encounters across Punjab over eight months in 2025 since the launch of the special branch of police created to curb organised crime and heinous offences. The CCD’s performance has been hailed by Punjab’s political leadership as a great achievement that has protected citizens’ life, property and honour. However, HRCP has rightly described such killings — averaging more than two fatal encounters per day — as “institutionalised practice”. The Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act, 2022, requires the Federal Investigation Agency to investigate every death in police custody under the supervision of the National Commission for Human Rights. Inquiries by judicial magistrates are required under Section 174 and 176 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPc) in the case of custodial deaths. There’s no evidence that these legal formalities were observed to even try to ‘justify’ such fake encounters. It appears that this police culture of impunity has been perpetrated and patronised by those at the helm of political and security affairs in Pakistan’s largest province. HRCP has pointed to the lack of accountability mechanisms behind the CCD’s cold-blooded violence. A uniform template of allegations is followed: suspects open fire first, police fire back in self-defence, and, under highly improbable circumstances, the suspects are killed in their accomplices’ friendly fire; the dead suspects then turn out to be “hardened criminals”. These have been declared “lethal shortcuts” secured by bypassing proper investigation, prosecution and judicial oversight. HRCP wants an immediate “moratorium” on all encounter operations until legal safeguards and independent accountability mechanisms are established. After a year’s pre-service training at Police College Sihala in 1977, I was sent to Punjab to serve as assistant superintendent of police at Sheikhupura, Pakpattan and Jhang sub-divisions. Punjab Police has a reputation for using strong-arm tactics against criminals. A tough police chief in Lahore was known as ‘Halaku Khan’. Since the 19th century, Punjab Police’s interrogation techniques have been part of folklore. ‘Effective’ police officers were projected as macho figures in Punjab’s vast hinterlands. There were two types of officers: those who believed that the ends justified the means and harsh and extrajudicial measures were effective crime-control methods; the other smaller group comprised those who believed in the rule of law, due process and adherence to a code that gave primacy to human rights and dignity over brutality. Punjab’s current style of policing can be described as draconian. My father’s profession as a lawyer and his being a disciple of Mohammad Ali Jinnah set my course; I chose the path less trodden, which followed the rule of law. As SSP, I was appointed Lahore police chief in 1991; a recent predecessor was said to be an ‘encounter specialist’. The younger brother of the then prime minister was heading a crime control committee for Lahore district. It took me a while to make him understand that crime can be controlled through the painstaking tasks of intelligence collection and professional (and not extra-legal) interrogation of suspects, thorough investigations, collection of credible (and not cooked-up) evidence, assiduous prosecutions and meticulous trials. Over the next two years, the Lahore police took a rule-of-law approach to control crime as the media of those years can testify. The same politician became Punjab chief minister in 1997 and his elder brother the prime minister. On the recommendation of the then inspector-general of police (IGP) and chief secretary, he posted me as DIG of Faisalabad region. Terrorism and sectarian violence were at their peak in those days. The Crime Investigation Department was reorganised and an elite police force created to tackle sectarian violence. The Anti-Terrorism Act was promulgated in 1997, and special speedy trial courts were established. Within two years, hundreds of sectarian terrorists, mainly belonging to Sunni and Shia militant groups were arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated. Sectarian violence came down through lawful measures. Later, the CID was upgraded to the Counter-Terrorism Department and further successes were achieved. Both the political and security establishments achieved the desired results through an approach based on due process and the rule of law. Punjab’s current style of policing can be described as draconian. In the last three years or so, extremely harsh measures have been used against peaceful political protests, and the privacy of homes has been violated. Above all, extrajudicial and custodial killings by the CCD have created an environment of distrust and disgust. The ill-advised promulgation of the Torture and Custodial Death Act in 2022 has not stopped the killer cops from fighting crime by simply eliminating criminals. Will the federal police carry out a scrutiny of the provincial force? I doubt it. They themselves appear to be partners in this crime. The strategy of creating a special crime control department should be re-examined by Punjab’s political leadership. Shortcuts to fighting crime and populist displays of swift justice will backfire. Violence begets violence. Judicial scrutiny of custodial and extrajudicial killings under Sections 174 and 176 of CrPC is the only way to ensure viable and legal accountability. In our policing days, we were genuinely concerned when high courts took notice of illegal detentions, the misuse of force and deaths in custody. We would not let our juniors run amok. By following the unlawful directions of the ruling elite and deep state, the current police leadership has failed. They must now draw the line and ensure that the police follow the law and enhance their investigative skills and capacity. There are three key public office holders in a province: the IGP, the high court chief justice and the political chief executive. Will they follow the constitutional path or take the illegal course of reckless lawlessness that promotes a culture of impunity? We’ll know the answer for no one can escape scrutiny and eventual accountability that this holy month of fasting and introspection provides to all of us, especially the rulers.

      "summary_orig": "• Rubio hails Islamabad’s backing for Gaza plan, role in peace board • Offers cooperation on critical minerals • Premier meets regional leaders, IDFC chief WASHINGTON: Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif wrapped up a two-day visit to Washington on Friday, securing a US pledge to cooperate on crit­ical minerals and energy after aligning his country with a US President Donald Trump-led Gaza peace initiative and praising his role in defusing a regional crisis last year. PM Shehbaz met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday to discuss shifting the bilateral rela­tionship toward economic inv­es­tment while maintaining a partnership in counterterrorism, acco­rding to a State Depart­ment statement. In their meeting, Rubio thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for its role as a founding member of the “Board of Peace”, which held its inaugural session on Thursday. The State Department said Rubio also offered condolences for recent terror attacks in Pakistan and “reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counterterrorism”. The ‘meaningful’ discussions cov­ered Pakistan’s recent participation in the Critical Minerals Min­­isterial in Washington, with the US welcoming Islamabad’s eng­a­gement and discussing commercial opportunities for Ameri­can companies in the country’s energy and mineral resources. According to the Press Information Department of Pakistan, both sides reaffirmed the importance of Pakistan-US strategic ties and expressed satisfaction with the partnership’s progress under President Trump. They agreed to boost trade, expand economic cooperation and strengthen counterterrorism efforts, while emphasising the need for continued high-level engagement to advance shared goals. PM Shehbaz Sharif meets US Secretary Marco Rubio on the sidelines of BoP meeting.—APP ‘A saviour of South Asia’ PM Shehbaz also credited Trump with de-escalating a four-day military crisis between Pakistan and India in May. He called the president “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”, whose intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people”. Speaking at the summit, Trump recounted his actions during that conflict, saying he warned both countries that the US would halt trade negotiations and could impose steep tariffs. “I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” Trump said, adding that the economic threat helped achieve a de-escalation. A notable moment at the summit came when Trump devoted nearly four minutes of his address to praising Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership for their “constructive and responsible role for regional peace and stability”, referencing his meeting with PM Shehbaz and the Chief of Defence Forces, Field Marshal Asim Munir. The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots. Meeting with regional leaders According to Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz also held informal meetings with several leaders in Washington for the Board of Peace session, including the king of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, and the presidents of Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Indonesia. It described Pakistan’s participation in the board as part of its broader effort to support peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives and “global peace”. Separately, APP reported that PM Shehbaz met the chief executive of the US International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), Benjamin Black, on Friday. The premier praised the portfolio of more than $1bn and urged closer business-to-business engagement, while Black outlined the agency’s project pipeline and signalled interest in expanding the IDFC footprint in Pakistan. Officials played down expectations of major agreements, suggesting the visit was aimed more at setting a direction than producing headline deals. Published in Dawn, February 21st, 2026",

PM Shehbaz met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday to discuss shifting the bilateral rela­tionship toward economic inv­es­tment while maintaining a partnership in counterterrorism, acco­rding to a State Depart­ment statement. In their meeting, Rubio thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for its role as a founding member of the “Board of Peace”, which held its inaugural session on Thursday. The State Department said Rubio also offered condolences for recent terror attacks in Pakistan and “reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counterterrorism”. The ‘meaningful’ discussions cov­ered Pakistan’s recent participation in the Critical Minerals Min­­isterial in Washington, with the US welcoming Islamabad’s eng­a­gement and discussing commercial opportunities for Ameri­can companies in the country’s energy and mineral resources. According to the Press Information Department of Pakistan, both sides reaffirmed the importance of Pakistan-US strategic ties and expressed satisfaction with the partnership’s progress under President Trump. They agreed to boost trade, expand economic cooperation and strengthen counterterrorism efforts, while emphasising the need for continued high-level engagement to advance shared goals. PM Shehbaz Sharif meets US Secretary Marco Rubio on the sidelines of BoP meeting.—APP ‘A saviour of South Asia’ PM Shehbaz also credited Trump with de-escalating a four-day military crisis between Pakistan and India in May. He called the president “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”, whose intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people”. Speaking at the summit, Trump recounted his actions during that conflict, saying he warned both countries that the US would halt trade negotiations and could impose steep tariffs. “I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” Trump said, adding that the economic threat helped achieve a de-escalation. A notable moment at the summit came when Trump devoted nearly four minutes of his address to praising Pakistan’s civilian and military leadership for their “constructive and responsible role for regional peace and stability”, referencing his meeting with PM Shehbaz and the Chief of Defence Forces, Field Marshal Asim Munir. The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots. Meeting with regional leaders According to Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz also held informal meetings with several leaders in Washington for the Board of Peace session, including the king of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, and the presidents of Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Indonesia. It described Pakistan’s participation in the board as part of its broader effort to support peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives and “global peace”. Separately, APP reported that PM Shehbaz met the chief executive of the US International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC), Benjamin Black, on Friday. The premier praised the portfolio of more than $1bn and urged closer business-to-business engagement, while Black outlined the agency’s project pipeline and signalled interest in expanding the IDFC footprint in Pakistan. Officials played down expectations of major agreements, suggesting the visit was aimed more at setting a direction than producing headline deals. Published in Dawn, February 21st, 2026",

      "title_orig": "Trump says ‘considering’ strike on Iran as Tehran says draft deal to be ready in next ‘two, three days’",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran after ordering a major naval buildup in the Middle East aimed at heaping pressure on Tehran to cut a deal to curb its nuclear programme. The latest threat came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week. Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, which he subsequently extended to 15. Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump answered: “The most I can say — I am considering it.” After the talks in Geneva, Tehran said the two sides had agreed to submit drafts of a potential agreement, which Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told US media would be the “next step”. “I believe that in the next two, three days, that would be ready, and after final confirmation by my superiors, that would be handed over to Steve Witkoff,” he said, referring to Trump’s main Middle East negotiator. Araghchi also said US negotiators had not requested that Tehran end its nuclear enrichment programme, contradicting statements from American officials. “We have not offered any suspension, and the US side has not asked for zero enrichment,” he said in an interview released Friday by US TV network MS NOW . “What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear programme, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever,” he added. His comments stand in contrast to information relayed by high-ranking US officials, including Trump, who has repeatedly said Iran must not be allowed to enrich uranium at any level. Western countries accuse the Islamic republic of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes. Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy. Economic hardships sparked protests in December that evolved into a nationwide anti-government movement last month, prompting a crackdown from authorities. ‘No ultimatum’ The two foes held an initial round of discussions on February 6 in Oman, the first since previous talks collapsed during the 12-day Iran-Israel war last June, which the US joined by striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Washington has pursued a major military build-up in the region in tandem with the talks, and both sides have traded threats of military action for weeks. On Thursday, Trump again suggested the US would attack Iran if it did not make a deal within the timeframe he laid out. “We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,” Trump told the inaugural meeting of the “Board of Peace”, his initiative for the post-war Gaza Strip. Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be “legitimate targets” if the United States followed through on its threats. Araghchi, however, insisted that “there is no ultimatum”. “We only talk with each other how we can have a fast deal. And a fast deal is something that both sides are interested about,” he said. “We are under sanctions, (so) obviously any day that sanctions are terminated sooner it would be better for us,” he said, adding Iran had “no reason to delay”. Washington has repeatedly called for zero enrichment, but has also sought to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region — issues which Israel has pushed to include in the talks. The Israeli army said on Friday that it was on “defensive alert” regarding the situation with Iran, but that its guidelines for the public remained unchanged. Ratcheting up the pressure, Trump has deployed a significant naval force to the region. After sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and escort battleships to the Gulf in January, he ordered a second carrier, the Gerald Ford, to depart for the Middle East. Subsequently, the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier was seen entering the Mediterranean Sea on Friday. The carrier was seen transiting the Strait of Gibraltar — which links the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean — in a photo taken from the Gibraltar side of the strait. Iranian naval forces also conducted military drills this week in the Gulf and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz in their own show of force.",

      "summary_orig": "Batting great Babar Azam was moved down the batting order for Pakistan’s final T20 World Cup group game against Namibia for scoring too slowly, said head coach Mike Hesson on Friday. Azam, who is the highest run-scorer in T20 international history with 4,571 runs, was moved down the order for the must-win game against Namibia as Pakistan racked up 199-3 and secured a place in the Super Eights by 102 runs. The 2009 champions face New Zealand in Colombo on Saturday in the opening match of the second phase. “I think Babar is well aware that his strike rate in the power play in the World Cup is less than 100 and that’s clearly not the role we think we need,” Hesson told reporters after Pakistan’s final practice session on Friday was washed out by rain. Pakistan left out Azam for the same reason at last year’s Asia Cup and even after a dismal showing in the Big Bash League, he was still selected for the T20 World Cup. “We brought Babar back in for a specific role post the Asia Cup,” said Hesson. “We’ve got plenty of other options who can come in and perform that role towards the end. “Babar is actually the first to acknowledge that. “He knows that he’s got a certain set of skills that the team requires and there are certain times where other players can perform that role more efficiently.” Hesson also defended dropping pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi after he conceded 101 runs in three matches, including 31 in two overs against India . “We made a call that Salman Mirza was coming in for Shaheen, and he bowled incredibly well,” said Hesson. “To be fair, he was probably really unlucky not to be playing the second and third games.” Hesson was wary of Pakistan’s opponents on Saturday. “New Zealand have played a huge amount in the subcontinent in recent times, so we have to play at our best. “",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Police on Friday arrested the builder in connection with the deaths of 15 people in a building collapse triggered by a gas explosion in Soldier Bazaar a day earlier. Soldier Bazaar Station House Officer (SHO) Rizwan Patel confirmed that the owner-cum-builder Mohammed Irshad had been arrested after the registration of a first information report (FIR). He said the held suspect had rented out the building to the victims. The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn , was registered on the complaint of sub-inspector Khalid Mehmood at the Soldier Bazar police station under sections 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab ), 288 (negligent conduct with building), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 337-A (punishment of shajjah ) of the Pakistan Penal Code. According to the FIR, police received information on early Thursday morning about the collapse of a building in Gul Rana Colony, in which several people were killed and injured. Upon reaching the spot, the complainant said that one portion of the structure had completely collapsed. He said that the building, spread over 40 square yards, had been constructed using heavy-duty steel channels and nylon sheets. He further said that the building was a ground plus three-storey structure. The sub-inspector said that a man named Shahid Rasool lived on the first floor with his family. He said that at around 3:30am, Rasool’s wife lit a match to prepare Sehr, adding that the room was already full of gas due to a leakage. This led to the explosion, which caused the whole building to collapse, he said. The complainant further said that the rescue officials recovered at least 15 dead bodies from the rubble, while 15 others were injured in the incident. The official stated that the owner of the building had constructed the structure “illegally” in approximately 2007/2008. He said that the gas connection was also provided “illegally through pipes installed in a haphazard and unsafe manner, leading to the unfortunate incident. According to the FIR, the suspect committed negligence by installing substandard gas lines in an “illegally” constructed building. The complainant further said that the Bomb Disposal Unit had examined the destroyed building and submitted their report. He said that according to the unit, the gas leakage occurred because of substandard gas pipelines, which led to a gas leak and ultimately triggered an explosion when a match was lit.",
