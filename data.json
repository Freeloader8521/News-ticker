      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Tuesday paid a visit to Quetta, where she met with her Balochistan counterpart CM Sarfraz Bugti and assured him of her full support. CM Maryam’s visit comes in the wake of a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days . Security forces had responded by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1 ” in the province. “As the chief minister of Punjab, as a Pakistani and as your sister, all services and resources of Punjab, whatever cooperation or support you need — whether in operations against khawarij here or any kind of challenges in the government — we are with you,” Maryam said. She further assured Bugti, “Whatever kind of support you need, I am just a call away. I will be very glad if I can assist you or do something for the people of Balochistan.” Noting that this was her first visit to another province after assuming the office of Punjab CM in February 2024 , Maryam said she was glad it was to Quetta. “You have rightly said that you do not have fitna , but you have Fitna al Khawarij , which is your own unique set of challenges that Balochistan is facing,” she further remarked, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “A lot of courage and firmness is needed for it, which you are demonstrating by governing Balochistan in such situations, so hats off to you, CM sahib ,” Maryam said. The Punjab chief minister said she visited the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in the morning, where the “commitment” she saw was very “promising and encouraged” her. She prayed that may God help “Balochistan move forward and very soon eradicate the menace of terrorism” from the province. “May Balochistan be a cradle of peace, safety and happiness,” she added. According to her PML-N, CM Maryam held a meeting with Bugti and Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail. She also attended an event at the FC headquarters.",

      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari welcomed Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s invitation to visit the country and emphasised strengthening ties between Islamabad and Tashkent, the president’s media wing said on Tuesday. According to a press release by the President’s Secretariat, the president met with Uzbek Ambassador Alisher Tukhtaev, who called on him at Aiwan-e-Sadr and handed over a letter from the Uzbek president, who had visited Pakistan for two days last week. In his letter, Mirziyoyev thanked President Zardari, the government and the people of Pakistan for the extraordinary hospitality and warm welcome extended to him during his visit. He also expressed gratitude for being conferred the Nishan-e-Pakistan, Pakistan’s highest civil award, as well as the honorary professorship and doctorate, according to the statement. “President Mirziyoyev reiterated his invitation to President Zardari, earlier conveyed during their tête-à-tête,” it added, referring to the Uzbek president’s invitation to President Zardari to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”. “President Zardari accepted the invitation and directed the concerned authorities from the Pakistani side to coordinate with their Uzbek counterparts to finalise the visit later this year.” The president said that Pakistan attached great significance to its close brotherly relations with Uzbekistan, while underscoring the importance of effective follow-up on the outcomes of Mirziyoyev’s recent “historic and result-oriented” state visit to Pakistan, the statement said. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening cooperation with Uzbekistan in “key sectors including food and agriculture, mining, information technology, tourism, health and banking”. The president also welcomed Uzbekistan’s interest in importing halal meat, fruits and potatoes from Pakistan as a positive step towards enhancing bilateral trade, it added. “President Zardari also conveyed his gratitude to Mirziyoyev for his message of solidarity and support following the recent terrorist attack in Islamabad,” the statement said. Zardari reaffirmed the shared resolve of Pakistan and Uzbekistan to “continue their joint journey of peace, stability and development”. During Mirziyoyev’s two-day visit to Pakistan, the two sides signed a protocol for enhancing bilateral trade between the two countries to $2 billion within the next five years. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his delight that the Uzbek president and his delegation visited Islamabad, his “second home”, for the second time in four years. Meanwhile, Mirziyoyev declared that Pakistan was Uzbekistan’s “time-tested, reliable partner and closest friend” in South Asia.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran on Tuesday warned of “destructive” influence on diplomacy ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Washington for talks expected to focus on US negotiations with Tehran. “Our negotiating party is America. It is up to America to decide to act independently of the pressures and destructive influences that are detrimental to the region,” said Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei in a weekly press briefing. “The Zionist regime has repeatedly, as a saboteur, shown that it opposes any diplomatic process in our region that leads to peace.” Tehran and Washington resumed talks in Muscat on Friday, months after earlier negotiations collapsed following Israel’s unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June, which triggered a 12-day war. During the conflict, Israel targeted senior Iranian military officials, nuclear scientists and nuclear sites, as well as residential areas. The United States later joined the campaign, launching its own strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran responded with drone and missile attacks on Israel and by targeting the largest US military base in the Middle East, located in Qatar. “The June experience was a very bad experience. Therefore, taking these experiences into account, we are determined to secure Iran’s national interests through diplomacy,” Baqaei said. He insisted that Iran’s focus would remain strictly on the nuclear file in return for sanctions relief. Tehran has repeatedly said it rejects any negotiations that extend beyond that issue. On Saturday, Netanyahu’s office said in a statement that the Israeli premier “believes any negotiations must include limitations on ballistic missiles and a halting of the support for the Iranian axis”. The talks followed threats from Washington and the deployment of a US aircraft carrier group to the region after Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month. Iranian authorities said the protests, which erupted in late December over the rising cost of living, began as peaceful demonstrations before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, which they said were inflamed by the United States and Israel.",

      "summary_orig": "Less than two months after returning from nearly two decades of self-imposed exile in London, Tarique Rahman could win one of Bangladesh’s most pivotal elections and become prime minister, leading the country as his parents once did. If opinion polls hold, Thursday’s election would mark a remarkable reversal of fortune for the soft-spoken 60-year-old, who left the country in 2008, saying he needed medical treatment after his release from detention under a military-backed caretaker administration. He had been held after a crackdown on corruption. Army personnel patrol the streets ahead of the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 10, 2026. —Reuters He returned home to a hero’s welcome last Christmas after a youth-driven uprising uprooted his Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s arch-enemy, long-time premier Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, in August 2024. Hasina, now in exile in New Delhi, and Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, long dominated Bangladeshi politics, while Rahman’s father was a leading Bangladesh independence figure who ruled the country from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated. Rahman has pledged to recalibrate Bangladesh’s international partnerships to attract investment without tying the country too closely to any single power, in contrast with Hasina, who was seen as aligned with New Delhi. Rahman has also highlighted expanding financial aid for poor families, reducing reliance on garment exports by promoting industries such as toys and leather goods, and introducing a two-term, 10-year limit for prime ministers to deter autocratic tendencies. Vehicles pass by election campaign banners ahead of the national election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 10, 2026. —Reuters Events have unfolded so quickly since Rahman landed in Dhaka with his cardiologist wife and barrister daughter that he said he has scarcely had time to reflect. “I don’t know how we have passed every minute since we landed,” Rahman said on the sidelines of an interview with Reuters in his party office, flanked by his daughter Zaima, who has been trying to drum up support for her father. A man transports carts of vegetables at a marketplace ahead of Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 10, 2026. —Reuters Image makeover The bespectacled Rahman was born on November 20, 1965, in Dhaka to Khaleda and former president Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP. He studied international relations at the University of Dhaka, dropped out, and later started businesses in textiles and agricultural products. Since his return, Rahman has tried to project himself as a statesman ready to look beyond his family’s difficulties under Hasina. Gone is the image of a brash operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era, when his mother was prime minister. Although he never held a government post, Rahman was often accused of running a parallel power centre during her tenure, a charge he denies. “What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.” Members of “July Oikya”, a platform of several organisations that took part in the July 2024 revolution, march to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, Bangladesh, December 17, 2025. —Reuters/File Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many. He has always denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster. From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappearing, and offices shuttered. A member of the army raises his gun as he opens the vehicle door during patrolling on the streets ahead of the national election, as the government increases security measures, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 10, 2026. —Reuters Since returning, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring people’s ownership of the state and rebuilding institutions — a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a fresh start. Further helping to soften his image, the family’s fluffy Siberian cat, Jebu, has gone viral on social media. “She’s 7. She’s half Siberian. We adopted her,” Rahman’s daughter Zaima told Reuters . Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong. Party insiders say he is directly overseeing candidate selection, strategy and alliance talks, roles he once performed remotely. He may be a product of dynastic politics, but Rahman said restoring and sustaining democracy would be his biggest priority. “Only by practising democracy can we prosper and rebuild our country. If we practise democracy, we can establish accountability,” he said. “So we want to practise democracy, we want to rebuild our country.”",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Sindh government on Monday decided to release nearly 300 Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers who had been detained under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance last week, government sources and party leaders said. PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui said that Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar called party MPAs Wajid Hussain and Sajjad Ali Soomro to inform them of the government’s decision. “So we hope that our workers will be released by tomorrow [Tuesday] after all government formalities are completed,” she told Dawn . She claimed around 300 party workers and leaders from different tiers were arrested in raids that began last Sunday and continued ahead of the Feb 8 protest call. “We have already challenged their detention in court.” Meanwhile, government sources confirmed the PTI’s claim and said that the government had, in principle, decided to release all PTI workers and that the “documentary process” in this regard had already begun. Opposition party hopes detained activists will be freed today; claims home minister has conveyed the decision to two PTI lawmakers “So it may take some time, and by Tuesday evening we may see the workers being released from prison,” said a source. Last week, the PTI accused provincial authorities of arresting dozens of activists during night-long raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial MPO Ordinance. On Feb 1, the Sindh home department issued notifications under MPO to detain the PTI workers for 30 days on the ground that they “are instigating public to block roads, highways and organise sit-ins, which may disturb peace and tranquillity and can create serious law and order problems”. The party challenged the alleged detentions in the Sindh High Court (SHC) the very next day. On Friday, the Sindh High Court directed provincial authorities to produce the cabinet’s decision for issuing detention orders against PTI workers under the MPO Ordinance. A two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC, headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhary, also issued notices to the respondents and the Advocate General Sindh in around 35 identical petitions, fixing Feb 10 for hearing. Earlier on Monday, the PTI said that even after passing the Feb 8 protest call , its Karachi President Raja Azhar and Senior Vice President Faheem Khan were arrested by law enforcement authorities. Condemning the move as unconstitutional and politically motivated, the party spokesperson said that both leaders were shifted to the Central Prison and that even their families were unaware of the cases against them and their whereabouts. “We have been informed that both leaders were moved to the Central Prison on Monday evening. We were not allowed to meet them, nor were their families permitted to do so. This is open barbarity, which we strongly condemn,” she alleged. Published in Dawn, February 10th, 2026",

      "title": "Sindh govt decides to release all PTI workers held under MPO",
      "summary": "KARACHI: The Sindh government on Monday decided to release nearly 300 Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers who had been detained under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance last week, government sources and party leaders said. PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui said that Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar called party MPAs Wajid Hussain and Sajjad Ali Soomro to inform them of the government’s decision. “So we hope that our workers will be released by tomorrow [Tuesday] after all government formalities are completed,” she told Dawn . She claimed around 300 party workers and leaders from different tiers were arrested in raids that began last Sunday and continued ahead of the Feb 8 protest call. “We have already challenged their detention in court.” Meanwhile, government sources confirmed the PTI’s claim and said that the government had, in principle, decided to release all PTI workers and that the “documentary process” in this regard had already begun. Opposition party hopes detained activists will be freed today; claims home minister has conveyed the decision to two PTI lawmakers “So it may take some time, and by Tuesday evening we may see the workers being released from prison,” said a source. Last week, the PTI accused provincial authorities of arresting dozens of activists during night-long raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial MPO Ordinance. On Feb 1, the Sindh home department issued notifications under MPO to detain the PTI workers for 30 days on the ground that they “are instigating public to block roads, highways and organise sit-ins, which may disturb peace and tranquillity and can create serious law and order problems”. The party challenged the alleged detentions in the Sindh High Court (SHC) the very next day. On Friday, the Sindh High Court directed provincial authorities to produce the cabinet’s decision for issuing detention orders against PTI workers under the MPO Ordinance. A two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC, headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhary, also issued notices to the respondents and the Advocate General Sindh in around 35 identical petitions, fixing Feb 10 for hearing. Earlier on Monday, the PTI said that even after passing the Feb 8 protest call , its Karachi President Raja Azhar and Senior Vice President Faheem Khan were arrested by law enforcement authorities. Condemning the move as unconstitutional and politically motivated, the party spokesperson said that both leaders were shifted to the Central Prison and that even their families were unaware of the cases against them and their whereabouts. “We have been informed that both leaders were moved to the Central Prison on Monday evening. We were not allowed to meet them, nor were their families permitted to do so. This is open barbarity, which we strongly condemn,” she alleged. Published in Dawn, February 10th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Unanimous resolution demands intelligence, security upgrade in key areas • Opposition slams Basant celebrations amid nationwide grief; demands ex-military chiefs answer for Taliban return • Pandemonium erupts as parties trade blame over terrorism policies ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Monday strongly condemned the recent suicide attack in Tarlai, demanding a thorough, transparent and time-bound investigation to bring the perpetrators and sponsors of terrorism to justice. Through a unanimously adopted resolution moved by PPP Senator Syed Wa­­qar Mehdi, the House urged the strengthening of intelligence coordination and security arrangements, especially in the federal capital and at sensitive locations. The resolution condemned the suicide attack on civilians, stating it violates Islamic values, humanity, and Constitution. It expressed deep condolences to the victims’ families and prayed for the swift recovery of the injured. The House paid tribute to law-enforcement agencies, emergency responders, and medical personnel for their prompt professional response. It also suspended its routine to discuss the tragedy, affirming national unity amidst a blackout on TV and the Senate’s YouTube stream. However, the debate turned heated as opposition criticised Lahore’s Basant celebrations following major terror attacks in Balochistan and Islamabad. With incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan facing accusations re­­garding the resettlement of the Taliban in Pakistan, Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas called for a joint session of parliament. He demanded that the former military and spying age­ncy chiefs be summoned to explain who brought the Taliban back to the country. Senator Abbas regretted the dances performed as part of Basant celebrations in Lahore while dozens of families mou­rned. “This cold-heartedness would only benefit the terrorists,” Abbas remarked. He claimed timely hospital transfers could have saved lives. He argued that a collective funeral attended by the prime minister would have sent a necessary message of national unity. PTI’s parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said the Tarlai tragedy had brought tears to the eyes of every citizen, reminding the House that the time for politics and excuses had already passed. “This is the time for a decisive action,” he asserted, adding that Pakistan comes first. Barrister Zafar emphasised that unity needs public trust, which the government undermines by opposing Imran Khan. He urged dismantling terrorist net­­works completely, not just isolated arrests. “If Daesh or any other terrorist organisation is operating within the country, it must be dealt with immediately and decisively,” he said. Senator Sherry Rehman criticised federal ministers’ absence during the debate and praised the armed forces’ sacrifices, while condemning the opposition for setting conditions during a national crisis. “What our army has done against terrorists, no other army in the world has done,” she said. Ms Rehman criticised Imran Khan for alleged sympathies with the Taliban, noting there was a reason many referred to him as “Taliban Khan”. Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar took strong exception to criticism directed at the armed forces. “All of us politicians and parties have made mistakes. Our security agencies are fighting a war against terrorism. We have to stand firmly with our institutions,” the law minister said. However, JUI-Fazl Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman argued the nation could not be satisfied by simply blaming a neighbouring country. “We trained the youth under an institution and today we are calling them wrong,” he regretted. He contended that a policy distinction persisted where those who commit terrorism on institutional orders are considered “good Taliban”, while those who do not are labelled “bad Taliban”. Framing of cultural event Rejecting criticism of the cultural festival, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid framed the event as an act of defiance. “The terrorists want to make us mourn all the time but we will give a message to the terrorists, we will celebrate and destroy you,” he said. However, the session ended in pandemonium when PML-N’s Abid Sher Ali chided the PTI over the May 9 incidents, leading to intense verbal clashes. Lawmakers from both sides blamed one another for the ongoing menace of terrorism. Published in Dawn, February 10th, 2026",

      "title_orig": "REGION: A RESURGENT JAMAAT IN BANGLADESH",
      "summary_orig": "Ramesh Chandra, 44, from Gopalganj district in Bangladesh’s southwest, 127 kilometres from the capital Dhaka, has been making sculptures for over two decades. He is a voter in the Gopalganj-3 constituency, from where former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was elected for eight consecutive terms. Chandra has long supported Hasina’s Awami League. But this time, the situation is different. Following the mass student-led uprising on August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina fled to India. On May 10, 2025, the interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, banned the political activities of the Awami League and all its affiliates, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, a domestic judicial body founded by Hasina in 2010, is currently prosecuting Awami League leaders for “genocide” and “crimes against humanity”, related to the 2024 movement. Ironically, the same tribunal sentenced Hasina to death for ordering a crackdown on the 2024 protesters. Previously, the tribunal had awarded death sentences to several Jamaat-i-Islami leaders for ‘war crimes’ during the 1971 war and supporting Pakistan, resulting in the execution of Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mujahid in 2015 and Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami in 2016. Once banned and vilified in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-i-Islami is now polling neck-and-neck with the country’s mainstream opposition. As the country prepares for its first election since the 2024 uprising, voters disillusioned with corruption are turning to an unexpected alternative… The current government has stated that the Awami League will not be able to resume political activities until the trial is completed. As a result, the Awami League will not participate in the upcoming February 12 elections, the first national polls since the mass uprising. Despite being banned, the Awami League is campaigning against the polls on social media. When asked if he would be voting this time, Chandra tells Eos, “Why wouldn’t I vote? I will vote and, this time, I will vote for the Jamaat. Everyone has had a chance. This time, Jamaat should be given a chance,” he continues. “Besides, none of them [Jamaat leaders] engage in corruption and extortion,” he claims. Like Chandra, many other voters are now also leaning towards the Jamaat-i-Islami, reflecting a broader electoral transformation sweeping Bangladesh. A SURGING POLITICAL FORCE A December survey by the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) showed 30 percent of voters backing the party of the late former PM Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP); 26 percent supporting the Jamaat-i-Islami; and six percent supporting the National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the August 2024 popular uprising. Another mid-January joint poll by Projection BD, IILD, Jagoron Foundation and NarratiV indicates a tighter race, with BNP at 34.7 percent, Jamaat close behind at 33.6 percent and NCP at 7.1 percent. It’s a remarkable turnaround for both the leading parties, whose leaders had been incarcerated and executed and particularly for the Jamaat, which was banned under the Sheikh Hasina regime. Analysts say the Jamaat is competing closely with the BNP due to growing public dissatisfaction with corruption and extortion at the grassroots level, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Jamaat has sought to capitalise on this sentiment by presenting itself as a disciplined alternative. Its initiatives, including digital tools to track extortion complaints and monitor government spending, have drawn widespread attention. The party’s rising popularity among young voters is also evident. According to Election Commission data from November 2025, Bangladesh has around 127.7 million registered voters, including roughly 45 million aged 18 to 35. In recent student union elections at several universities, including Dhaka University, the Jamaat’s student wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir, won decisively across contested positions, while the BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal failed to secure any significant posts. Many experts believe the student parliament elections could influence the next national polls, though others disagree. The Jamaat-i-Islami has formed an 11-party electoral alliance for the upcoming elections, including with the NCP, the student-led party. With the Awami League absent, the BNP and the Jamaat-led coalition are poised to be the main contenders. Nahid Islam, convener of the NCP, tells Eos that the alliance is electoral rather than ideological. “Our political views differ from those of Jamaat-i-Islami, but we align on reform, justice and anti-corruption agendas,” he says. “That is why we formed this alliance.” Islam is confident that their 11-party coalition will get the votes. “If given the chance to form the government, decisions will be made on common principles and will not be dominated by any single party,” he adds. The JI chief, or ameer, Dr Shafiqur Rahman tells Eos that his party is receiving “overwhelming support” from across the country, citing independent surveys by, what he termed, credible pollsters. Dr Rahman says that, since the official campaign began on January 22, he has travelled to nearly half of Bangladesh, visiting more than two dozen districts and addressing around 100 public rallies. “At each rally, the crowds were overwhelming,” he says, claiming that large numbers of supporters had turned out in favour of Jamaat candidates. “The country has not witnessed such political euphoria in more than two and a half decades,” believes Dr Rahman. According to political analysts, the upcoming election, held after the 2024 popular uprising, could be the most important in the party’s history, with it potentially winning more seats than ever before. Last month, The Washington Post reported that US diplomats were seeking closer engagement with the Jamaat, expecting it to perform strongly. The publication said it has audio recordings that reveal a US diplomat describing the Jamaat as a potential “friend” and stating that it cannot impose Sharia-rule in the country due to Western economic pressure. The prospect of a Jamaat-led government has raised concerns in India, Bangladesh’s largest neighbour and Sheikh Hasina’s longtime ally. New Delhi views the Jamaat as pro-Pakistan, citing the party’s opposition to Bangladesh’s 1971 war that led to the country’s creation and alleged historical ties to Islamabad. Indian officials worry that the Jamaat coming to power could reorient Bangladesh’s traditionally India-friendly foreign policy. BNP supporters gather for a rally ahead of the upcoming national election, in Sylhet on Jan 22, 2026 THE QUESTION OF CAPABILITY Jamaat chief Dr Rahman is confident that his party is ready to govern. “If Allah wills it and the people give us the mandate on February 12, we are ready,” he tells Eos. “Over the past half-century, Jamaat has built a talented and honest pool of leaders, capable of managing every sector.” He recalled the 2001 BNP-Jamaat alliance government, noting that ministers such as Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mujahid efficiently managed key portfolios, introduced programmes that boosted employment, utilised taxpayers’ money for development, and rooted out corruption. “Now, after more than 20 years, we are even more confident our leaders will govern effectively across all ministries,” Dr Rahman adds. Dr Rahman’s thoughts are echoed by one of his party candidates, lawyer Mohammad Shishir Monir. “I alone am capable of running 10 ministries,” he tells Eos. “We have dozens more in our party like me, who are capable of running the country.” However, Dhaka University professor and political analyst Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan says that, while Jamaat had some experience in the BNP government from 2001 to 2006, they lack the experience of administration and running the government. Dilara Chowdhury, a former professor and political analyst at Jahangirnagar University, points out that capability and honesty matter more than experience when it comes to running the country. “Currently, Jamaat has more educated and qualified people in its ranks than other parties,” she adds. An analysis of candidates’ affidavits by Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo shows that, of the 224 candidates contesting under the JI’s scales symbol, 201 are highly educated, including 10 with PhD degrees. Among the 287 BNP candidates contesting under the rice sheaf symbol, 229 are highly educated, including eight PhDs. The analysis indicates that the percentage of highly educated and PhD-holding candidates among Jamaat’s ranks is slightly higher than that of the BNP. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM Jamaat-i-Islami chief Dr Rahman says the party’s goal is to establish a country based on insaaf [justice], where the majority are not ruled by a chosen few, public wealth is not plundered and no one remains above the law. “Is this not the basic tenet of a model Islamic society?,” he asks. “Is this not the demand of Gen Z, who overthrew a corrupt and fascist regime?” Dr Rahman emphasises that Bangladesh’s multicultural and multi-ethnic population would continue to enjoy equal rights as enshrined in the constitution. “We believe in the rule of law, transparency, accountability, democracy and shura [consultation],” he says. “These principles are already embedded in our constitution and we do not view them as contradictory to Islamic values. You may call it ‘Sharia’ or any other name.” Dr Rahman adds that any elements contradicting Islamic principles would be addressed through parliament, not by force. “Our opponents often use scare tactics, suggesting that ‘Sharia law’ would force women into strict dress codes or deny them education or careers,” he continues. “We have repeatedly clarified that no such measures will be enforced. Women will enjoy equity and fairness in all spheres of life,” Dr Rahman asserts. The party chief also addresses concerns over a Jamaat-led government’s adherence to national laws and UN human rights standards. “As a democratic party that has participated in every election since its inception, no one can deny that Jamaat-i-Islami is committed to the people’s mandate,” he says. Dr Rahman adds that the party sees democratic nations in the West and East as strategic partners and aims to build a stable, pluralistic society based on freedom of expression, rule of law, equity and justice. The Jamaat chief also points out that, despite attempts by the previous Awami League government to portray the Jamaat as militant, “they were never able to produce a single piece of evidence of Jamaat leaders or workers being involved in terrorism.” Bangladesh's Jamaat-i-Islami supporters shout slogans during a campaign rally in Mirpur on January 22, 2026 | AFP FROM PARIAH TO CONTENDER The Jamaat-i-Islami was founded in 1941 in Lahore, British India, by Islamist scholar Abul Ala Maududi. The party advocates Islam as the foundation for the state and society. During the 1971 war, JI opposed Bangladesh’s independence, and its leaders were accused of collaborating with the Pakistani army and committing war crimes. The party was banned after independence, but the ban was lifted following political changes in 1975, and it returned to politics in 1979. The Jamaat won 18 seats in the 1991 elections, three in 1996, 17 in 2001, and two in 2008 — a modest to poor showing in previous elections. A high court cancelled the party’s registration in 2013, while JI also boycotted the 2014 elections. In 2018, with the party still declared illegal, some of its candidates ran under BNP tickets while others contested as independents. The party remained ineligible for the 2024 election, with the ban only overturned after Hasina’s ouster. Dr Rahman, its chief, attributes the party’s growing current support to greater public exposure after the student-led July 2024 revolution and wider social media visibility, following decades of what he called “unfair” media portrayal. Dr Rahman thinks that the party’s suffering under the previous government, including the execution of its leaders and the imprisonment of its members, has earned it public sympathy. Unlike other parties, he claims, the Jamaat has avoided revenge or corruption. Instead, he says, the Jamaat cooperated with the interim government and the judiciary following Hasina’s ouster, demonstrating moral integrity that has won the party public support. Analysts say another key factor is public frustration with corruption and extortion involving BNP leaders and activists, while the Jamaat has relatively avoided such allegations. “People are fed up with BNP leaders and activists because of extortion,” says analyst Dilara Chowdhury. She adds that corruption and extortion lie at the root of most crises in Bangladesh and effective curbs could significantly reduce the country’s problems. Dr Khan of Dhaka University says that, with the marginalisation of the Awami League, the Jamaat has emerged as an alternative for some voters. “Public sympathy for the Jamaat has increased to some extent due to repression over the past 15 years,” he tells Eos. Like the Jamaat, the BNP is also campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. Speaking at a rally in Chittagong on January 25, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman said the party would crack down on corruption if elected. Analyst Dilara Chowdhury points out, however, that the public has greater trust in the Jamaat than the BNP on corruption. “During BNP’s time in power from 2001 to 2006, corruption was not reduced. That is why many people do not trust the BNP,” she adds. The Jamaat has also announced plans to launch a mobile app aimed at tackling extortion. At a recent election rally in Dhaka, Dr Rahman revealed that the app would allow individuals to anonymously file complaints against extortionists. By contrast, since August 5, 2024, numerous BNP leaders and activists have been implicated in cases relating to extortion and other allegations. Following media reports, the party expelled several thousand members. On September 18, 2025, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman said organisational action had been taken against more than 7,000 party members in response to various allegations. Analysts also point to internal conflict within BNP, which they say has not been evident within Jamaat. According to an October 2025 report by Dhaka-based Human Rights Support Society (HRSS), at least 85 people were killed and 5,017 were injured in internal BNP clashes between September 2024 and September 2025. Another factor behind the JI’s growing popularity is the party’s charitable activities, including welfare and social assistance programmes. Through disaster relief, financial support for low-income families, and educational and medical assistance, the party has expanded its engagement at the local level. In addition, institutions associated with the Jamaat, including banks, hospitals, coaching centres, schools and colleges, have helped create employment opportunities for party workers and supporters, while also providing education and healthcare services to the wider public. It is no surprise, then, that voters such as Gopalganj’s Ramesh Chandra are planning to stamp their vote on the scales symbol in the upcoming elections. But whether the Jamaat can translate polling numbers into actual seats, navigate coalition politics and govern a diverse nation of 170 million remains to be seen. What is certain is that the February 12 elections will reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape in ways unimaginable just 18 months ago — when Hasina still ruled and Jamaat was still fighting for political survival. For a party that opposed the country’s founding, the possibility of now leading it represents perhaps the most dramatic political reversal in Bangladesh’s history.

      "summary_en": "Ramesh Chandra, 44, from Gopalganj district in Bangladesh’s southwest, 127 kilometres from the capital Dhaka, has been making sculptures for over two decades. He is a voter in the Gopalganj-3 constituency, from where former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was elected for eight consecutive terms. Chandra has long supported Hasina’s Awami League. But this time, the situation is different. Following the mass student-led uprising on August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina fled to India. On May 10, 2025, the interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, banned the political activities of the Awami League and all its affiliates, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, a domestic judicial body founded by Hasina in 2010, is currently prosecuting Awami League leaders for “genocide” and “crimes against humanity”, related to the 2024 movement. Ironically, the same tribunal sentenced Hasina to death for ordering a crackdown on the 2024 protesters. Previously, the tribunal had awarded death sentences to several Jamaat-i-Islami leaders for ‘war crimes’ during the 1971 war and supporting Pakistan, resulting in the execution of Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mujahid in 2015 and Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami in 2016. Once banned and vilified in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-i-Islami is now polling neck-and-neck with the country’s mainstream opposition. As the country prepares for its first election since the 2024 uprising, voters disillusioned with corruption are turning to an unexpected alternative… The current government has stated that the Awami League will not be able to resume political activities until the trial is completed. As a result, the Awami League will not participate in the upcoming February 12 elections, the first national polls since the mass uprising. Despite being banned, the Awami League is campaigning against the polls on social media. When asked if he would be voting this time, Chandra tells Eos, “Why wouldn’t I vote? I will vote and, this time, I will vote for the Jamaat. Everyone has had a chance. This time, Jamaat should be given a chance,” he continues. “Besides, none of them [Jamaat leaders] engage in corruption and extortion,” he claims. Like Chandra, many other voters are now also leaning towards the Jamaat-i-Islami, reflecting a broader electoral transformation sweeping Bangladesh. A SURGING POLITICAL FORCE A December survey by the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) showed 30 percent of voters backing the party of the late former PM Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP); 26 percent supporting the Jamaat-i-Islami; and six percent supporting the National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the August 2024 popular uprising. Another mid-January joint poll by Projection BD, IILD, Jagoron Foundation and NarratiV indicates a tighter race, with BNP at 34.7 percent, Jamaat close behind at 33.6 percent and NCP at 7.1 percent. It’s a remarkable turnaround for both the leading parties, whose leaders had been incarcerated and executed and particularly for the Jamaat, which was banned under the Sheikh Hasina regime. Analysts say the Jamaat is competing closely with the BNP due to growing public dissatisfaction with corruption and extortion at the grassroots level, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Jamaat has sought to capitalise on this sentiment by presenting itself as a disciplined alternative. Its initiatives, including digital tools to track extortion complaints and monitor government spending, have drawn widespread attention. The party’s rising popularity among young voters is also evident. According to Election Commission data from November 2025, Bangladesh has around 127.7 million registered voters, including roughly 45 million aged 18 to 35. In recent student union elections at several universities, including Dhaka University, the Jamaat’s student wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir, won decisively across contested positions, while the BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal failed to secure any significant posts. Many experts believe the student parliament elections could influence the next national polls, though others disagree. The Jamaat-i-Islami has formed an 11-party electoral alliance for the upcoming elections, including with the NCP, the student-led party. With the Awami League absent, the BNP and the Jamaat-led coalition are poised to be the main contenders. Nahid Islam, convener of the NCP, tells Eos that the alliance is electoral rather than ideological. “Our political views differ from those of Jamaat-i-Islami, but we align on reform, justice and anti-corruption agendas,” he says. “That is why we formed this alliance.” Islam is confident that their 11-party coalition will get the votes. “If given the chance to form the government, decisions will be made on common principles and will not be dominated by any single party,” he adds. The JI chief, or ameer, Dr Shafiqur Rahman tells Eos that his party is receiving “overwhelming support” from across the country, citing independent surveys by, what he termed, credible pollsters. Dr Rahman says that, since the official campaign began on January 22, he has travelled to nearly half of Bangladesh, visiting more than two dozen districts and addressing around 100 public rallies. “At each rally, the crowds were overwhelming,” he says, claiming that large numbers of supporters had turned out in favour of Jamaat candidates. “The country has not witnessed such political euphoria in more than two and a half decades,” believes Dr Rahman. According to political analysts, the upcoming election, held after the 2024 popular uprising, could be the most important in the party’s history, with it potentially winning more seats than ever before. Last month, The Washington Post reported that US diplomats were seeking closer engagement with the Jamaat, expecting it to perform strongly. The publication said it has audio recordings that reveal a US diplomat describing the Jamaat as a potential “friend” and stating that it cannot impose Sharia-rule in the country due to Western economic pressure. The prospect of a Jamaat-led government has raised concerns in India, Bangladesh’s largest neighbour and Sheikh Hasina’s longtime ally. New Delhi views the Jamaat as pro-Pakistan, citing the party’s opposition to Bangladesh’s 1971 war that led to the country’s creation and alleged historical ties to Islamabad. Indian officials worry that the Jamaat coming to power could reorient Bangladesh’s traditionally India-friendly foreign policy. BNP supporters gather for a rally ahead of the upcoming national election, in Sylhet on Jan 22, 2026 THE QUESTION OF CAPABILITY Jamaat chief Dr Rahman is confident that his party is ready to govern. “If Allah wills it and the people give us the mandate on February 12, we are ready,” he tells Eos. “Over the past half-century, Jamaat has built a talented and honest pool of leaders, capable of managing every sector.” He recalled the 2001 BNP-Jamaat alliance government, noting that ministers such as Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mujahid efficiently managed key portfolios, introduced programmes that boosted employment, utilised taxpayers’ money for development, and rooted out corruption. “Now, after more than 20 years, we are even more confident our leaders will govern effectively across all ministries,” Dr Rahman adds. Dr Rahman’s thoughts are echoed by one of his party candidates, lawyer Mohammad Shishir Monir. “I alone am capable of running 10 ministries,” he tells Eos. “We have dozens more in our party like me, who are capable of running the country.” However, Dhaka University professor and political analyst Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan says that, while Jamaat had some experience in the BNP government from 2001 to 2006, they lack the experience of administration and running the government. Dilara Chowdhury, a former professor and political analyst at Jahangirnagar University, points out that capability and honesty matter more than experience when it comes to running the country. “Currently, Jamaat has more educated and qualified people in its ranks than other parties,” she adds. An analysis of candidates’ affidavits by Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo shows that, of the 224 candidates contesting under the JI’s scales symbol, 201 are highly educated, including 10 with PhD degrees. Among the 287 BNP candidates contesting under the rice sheaf symbol, 229 are highly educated, including eight PhDs. The analysis indicates that the percentage of highly educated and PhD-holding candidates among Jamaat’s ranks is slightly higher than that of the BNP. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM Jamaat-i-Islami chief Dr Rahman says the party’s goal is to establish a country based on insaaf [justice], where the majority are not ruled by a chosen few, public wealth is not plundered and no one remains above the law. “Is this not the basic tenet of a model Islamic society?,” he asks. “Is this not the demand of Gen Z, who overthrew a corrupt and fascist regime?” Dr Rahman emphasises that Bangladesh’s multicultural and multi-ethnic population would continue to enjoy equal rights as enshrined in the constitution. “We believe in the rule of law, transparency, accountability, democracy and shura [consultation],” he says. “These principles are already embedded in our constitution and we do not view them as contradictory to Islamic values. You may call it ‘Sharia’ or any other name.” Dr Rahman adds that any elements contradicting Islamic principles would be addressed through parliament, not by force. “Our opponents often use scare tactics, suggesting that ‘Sharia law’ would force women into strict dress codes or deny them education or careers,” he continues. “We have repeatedly clarified that no such measures will be enforced. Women will enjoy equity and fairness in all spheres of life,” Dr Rahman asserts. The party chief also addresses concerns over a Jamaat-led government’s adherence to national laws and UN human rights standards. “As a democratic party that has participated in every election since its inception, no one can deny that Jamaat-i-Islami is committed to the people’s mandate,” he says. Dr Rahman adds that the party sees democratic nations in the West and East as strategic partners and aims to build a stable, pluralistic society based on freedom of expression, rule of law, equity and justice. The Jamaat chief also points out that, despite attempts by the previous Awami League government to portray the Jamaat as militant, “they were never able to produce a single piece of evidence of Jamaat leaders or workers being involved in terrorism.” Bangladesh's Jamaat-i-Islami supporters shout slogans during a campaign rally in Mirpur on January 22, 2026 | AFP FROM PARIAH TO CONTENDER The Jamaat-i-Islami was founded in 1941 in Lahore, British India, by Islamist scholar Abul Ala Maududi. The party advocates Islam as the foundation for the state and society. During the 1971 war, JI opposed Bangladesh’s independence, and its leaders were accused of collaborating with the Pakistani army and committing war crimes. The party was banned after independence, but the ban was lifted following political changes in 1975, and it returned to politics in 1979. The Jamaat won 18 seats in the 1991 elections, three in 1996, 17 in 2001, and two in 2008 — a modest to poor showing in previous elections. A high court cancelled the party’s registration in 2013, while JI also boycotted the 2014 elections. In 2018, with the party still declared illegal, some of its candidates ran under BNP tickets while others contested as independents. The party remained ineligible for the 2024 election, with the ban only overturned after Hasina’s ouster. Dr Rahman, its chief, attributes the party’s growing current support to greater public exposure after the student-led July 2024 revolution and wider social media visibility, following decades of what he called “unfair” media portrayal. Dr Rahman thinks that the party’s suffering under the previous government, including the execution of its leaders and the imprisonment of its members, has earned it public sympathy. Unlike other parties, he claims, the Jamaat has avoided revenge or corruption. Instead, he says, the Jamaat cooperated with the interim government and the judiciary following Hasina’s ouster, demonstrating moral integrity that has won the party public support. Analysts say another key factor is public frustration with corruption and extortion involving BNP leaders and activists, while the Jamaat has relatively avoided such allegations. “People are fed up with BNP leaders and activists because of extortion,” says analyst Dilara Chowdhury. She adds that corruption and extortion lie at the root of most crises in Bangladesh and effective curbs could significantly reduce the country’s problems. Dr Khan of Dhaka University says that, with the marginalisation of the Awami League, the Jamaat has emerged as an alternative for some voters. “Public sympathy for the Jamaat has increased to some extent due to repression over the past 15 years,” he tells Eos. Like the Jamaat, the BNP is also campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. Speaking at a rally in Chittagong on January 25, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman said the party would crack down on corruption if elected. Analyst Dilara Chowdhury points out, however, that the public has greater trust in the Jamaat than the BNP on corruption. “During BNP’s time in power from 2001 to 2006, corruption was not reduced. That is why many people do not trust the BNP,” she adds. The Jamaat has also announced plans to launch a mobile app aimed at tackling extortion. At a recent election rally in Dhaka, Dr Rahman revealed that the app would allow individuals to anonymously file complaints against extortionists. By contrast, since August 5, 2024, numerous BNP leaders and activists have been implicated in cases relating to extortion and other allegations. Following media reports, the party expelled several thousand members. On September 18, 2025, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman said organisational action had been taken against more than 7,000 party members in response to various allegations. Analysts also point to internal conflict within BNP, which they say has not been evident within Jamaat.
