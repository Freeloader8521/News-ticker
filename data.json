      "summary_orig": "Italy are struggling to qualify automatically for next year’s World Cup finals and the pressure on the team is exacerbated by the tension surrounding next Tuesday’s qualifier with Israel in Udine. Italy was the scene of some of Europe’s biggest pro-Palestinian protests last weekend, as Israeli forces continue their offensive in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered across Italy in anger at Israel’s actions, and calls for the country to be barred from international sport have grown louder. The protests were in response to Israel’s military operation in Gaza, which was sparked by the attack by Hamas fighters on October 7, 2023, on Israeli communities near the Gaza Strip. During Friday’s massive strike action in support of the Palestinians, demonstrators went to the Italian national team’s training centre in Florence to demand the match against Israel be called off. As of Tuesday only around 4,000 tickets had been sold for the game in Udine, a small city in Italy’s far north-east, which was picked specifically to help limit the potential for disorder. Udine was the venue when Italy — who face Estonia in Tallinn on Saturday — last hosted Israel, in the Nations League in September 2024. That match passed off largely without incident, albeit surrounded by a massive security operation which included soldiers on the roof of the stadium. But the threat of much bigger and more disruptive protests led Udine’s mayor Alberto Felice De Toni to ask for the match to be postponed. ‘Very sad’ This week Italy’s coach Gennaro Gattuso said the situation in Gaza was “ very sad ” and lamented a difficult atmosphere for a match which will be key to Italy’s hopes of avoiding missing out on a third straight World Cup. “There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside it… I would have preferred to play a home match in front of an enthusiastic crowd like we did in Bergamo (where Italy beat Estonia 5-0) a month ago,” Gattuso said. His task was already complicated enough without the external political pressure of playing Israel, as direct qualification for the World Cup is seriously in doubt. Only the winner of the five-team group is guaranteed an automatic spot and Italy sit second, level on nine points with Israel and six behind leaders Norway, but with a game in hand on both. However Norway’s far superior goal difference — they have a 16-goal advantage over Italy — means Gattuso’s side can only top the group if they win all four of their remaining matches and Erling Haaland and company slip up before they travel to the San Siro next month. That leaves second place and a spot in the play-offs as the likely route to the World Cup, a tournament in which Italy haven’t played a knockout fixture since winning it in 2006. Italy exited at the qualification play-off stage for the last two World Cups, failing to reach the 2022 edition in Qatar despite being reigning European champions.",

      "summary_orig": "The agreement on the first stage of US President Donald Trump’s plan for ending Israel’s bombardment in Gaza went into effect on Thursday at 0900 GMT, Egyptian state-affiliated TV al-Qahera news reported. Earlier today, Israel and Hamas agreed to the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire aimed at ending a conflict that has killed tens of thousands, razed the Palestinian territory and unleashed a major humanitarian crisis. The deal includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel. Key developments US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”; says he thinks captives will probably be released on Monday Palestinian group Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, US President Donald Trump said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal. Qatar said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”. Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP Thursday. The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said. The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added. The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.” Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!” He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”. “The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview. “This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”. In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.” “Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”. Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”. In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt. “I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza. Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier. An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday. ‘Optimism prevails’ As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air. “We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza. Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce. In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday. Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible. The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning. Protests, prisoners Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return. One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for. High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media. Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”. Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration. Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen. There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007. Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries. It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza. Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack.",

The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.” Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!” He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”. “The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview. “This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”. In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.” “Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”. Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”. In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt. “I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza. Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier. An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday. ‘Optimism prevails’ As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air. “We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza. Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce. In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday. Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible. The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning. Protests, prisoners Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return. One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for. High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media. Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”. Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration. Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen. There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007. Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries. It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza. Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack.",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump has announced that Israel and Hamas have reached a long-sought deal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release under his plan for ending Israel’s two-year-old offensive in the Palestinian enclave. Under the deal , Hamas will release 20 living captives, while Israel will release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners detained since the start of its war on Gaza, according to AFP . It also entails a daily minimum of 400 trucks of aid for the besieged enclave for the first five days, to be increased in the following days. The two sides had also reached a ceasefire in January, but it was shattered after Israel resumed massive attacks on Gaza on March 18, killing over 400 in a day. Diplomatic efforts through the United Nations had also failed to secure peace, with the US repeatedly using its veto power to block resolutions calling for a humanitarian ceasefire. Here are some of the main reactions from around the world: United Nations “I welcome the announcement of an agreement to secure a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza, based on the proposal put forward by President Donald J. Trump. I commend the diplomatic efforts of the United States, Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye in brokering this desperately needed breakthrough,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement posted on X. “I urge all concerned to abide fully by the terms of the agreement. All hostages must be released in a dignified manner. A permanent ceasefire must be secured. The fighting must stop once and for all. Immediate and unimpeded entry of humanitarian supplies and essential commercial materials into Gaza must be ensured. The suffering must end. “The United Nations will support the full implementation of the agreement and will scale up the delivery of sustained and principled humanitarian relief, and we will advance recovery and reconstruction efforts in Gaza,“ the UN chief added. He urged all stakeholders to “seize this momentous opportunity to establish a credible political path forward towards ending the occupation, recognising the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people, and achieving a two-state solution that enables Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security”. Britain “I welcome the news that a deal has been reached on the first stage of President Trump’s peace plan for Gaza,” United Kingdom Prime Minister Starmer said in a statement. “This is a moment of profound relief that will be felt all around the world, but particularly for the hostages, their families, and for the civilian population of Gaza, who have all endured unimaginable suffering over the last two years. “This agreement must now be implemented in full, without delay, and accompanied by the immediate lifting of all restrictions on life-saving humanitarian aid to Gaza. “We call on all parties to meet the commitments they have made, to end the war, and to build the foundations for a just and lasting end to the conflict and a sustainable path to a long-term peace. Canada “Canada welcomes the agreement of Israel and Hamas to implement the first phase of the peace plan put forward by President Trump, and facilitated by Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye,” Global Affairs Canada, which manages the country’s diplomatic and consular relations, said. “After two long years, hostages will finally be reunited with their families - and that Israeli troops will withdraw to behind agreed upon lines. Immediate and unimpeded humanitarian aid must be provided to the many people in dire need across Gaza. “Canada will support all efforts to turn this positive step into lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians.” India India’s PM Narendra Modi, in a statement on X, welcomed the agreement “on the first phase of President Trump’s peace plan”. Modi also praised his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, saying: “This is also a reflection of the strong leadership of PM Netanyahu.” “We hope the release of hostages and enhanced humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza will bring respite to them and pave the way for lasting peace.” European Union The European Union’s Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas said the peace plan deal was a “significant breakthrough”. “This is a major diplomatic accomplishment and a real chance to end a devastating war and release all the hostages,” Kallas said, adding: “The EU will do what it can to support its implementation”. Turkiye The foreign ministry of Turkiye, one of the mediators, expressed the hope that the ceasefire “will bring an end to the genocide that has continued for the past two years”. “We expect the ceasefire agreement to be fully implemented,” it added. The ministry stressed the need for humanitarian aid to be delivered to Gaza, where a “humanitarian catastrophe has been unfolding, and that efforts for the reconstruction of Gaza be launched without delay”. “Turkiye will continue to provide substantial humanitarian aid to Gaza in the period ahead,” it stated. Turkiye also called for a just resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian question and the “realisation of a two-state solution in the coming period”. Italy “The peace is near,” Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said in a post on X. “Italy, which has always supported the US plan, is ready to do its part to consolidate the ceasefire, deliver new humanitarian aid, and participate in the reconstruction of Gaza. We are also ready to send troops if an international peacekeeping force is created to reunify Palestine.” Australia “Australia welcomes President Trump’s announcement that Israel and Hamas have signed off the first phase of the plan to bring peace to Gaza,” PM Anthony Albanese said in a joint statement with his FM Penny Wong. “After more than two years of conflict, hostages held and a devastating loss of civilian life, this is a much-needed step towards peace. Australia has consistently been part of international calls for a ceasefire, return of the hostages, and the unimpeded flow of aid to Gaza. We urge all parties to respect the terms of the plan.” PM Albanese voiced Australia’s strong support for the plan’s commitment to denying Hamas any role in the future governance of Gaza. “There is a very long road to recovery in Gaza, securing long-term peace and building the Palestinian state. Together with our partners, Australia will continue to do what we can to contribute to a just and enduring two-state solution.” New Zealand “Hamas needs to release all of the hostages and Israel must withdraw their troops to the agreed-upon line,” New Zealand FM Winston Peters said in a statement. “This is an essential first step towards achieving lasting peace. We urge Israel and Hamas to continue working towards a complete resolution.” Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia also welcomed the Gaza ceasefire plan, saying it hoped for “just and comprehensive peace” in the region. “The Kingdom stresses the need to adhere to the agreement and stop the Israeli aggression against Gaza; the complete withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces from the Strip and all other Palestinian and Arab territories, and the return of the displaced persons to their homes,” the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement . “The Kingdom also stresses the importance of building on this agreement to address the root causes of the conflict by enabling the Palestinian people to claim their rights, foremost among them is the establishment of an independent Palestinian state along the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. “The Kingdom hopes that this agreement will permanently end this brutal Israeli war, which has claimed the lives of more than 45,000 people and injured more than 100,000.” Ireland Ireland, which has also strongly criticised Israel’s military response, said the deal, “if grasped by all, can finally end the unconscionable human suffering”. “It can stop the dreadful bombing, silence the guns, end the famine and genocide, and allow a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza,” deputy prime minister Simon Harris said. China Foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Beijing hoped for a “permanent and comprehensive” ceasefire in Gaza as soon as possible “China advocates adhering to the principle that ‘Palestinians should govern Palestine’,“ Jiakun said.

      "summary_orig": "The article was first published in March 2025 and has been replugged for DawnMedia’s upcoming air pollution conference in Lahore. Tens of millions of Pakistanis spent at least four months breathing toxic air pollution 20 times above safe levels, in the worst winter smog season for several years, according to data analysed by AFP . Pakistan regularly ranks among the world’s most polluted countries, with Lahore often the most polluted megacity between November and February. AFP’s analysis of data recorded since 2018 by independent air monitoring project AQICN shows the 2024-2025 winter smog season started a month earlier in October and persisted at higher levels, including in cities normally less affected by pollution. Lahore’s 14 million residents spent six months breathing concentrations of PM2.5 — tiny particles that can penetrate the lungs and bloodstream — at levels 20 times or more than recommended by the World Health Organisation. Commuters move along a road amid smoggy conditions in Lahore on November 24, 2024. — AFP Those in Karachi, Pakistan’s biggest city, and the capital Islamabad were subjected to 120 days of the same choking pollution levels. “The smog is just getting worse every year,” admitted a factory owner in Lahore, who wished to remain anonymous after openly criticising government policies.\n“If I was rich, my first decision would be to leave Pakistan for Dubai, to protect my children and raise them in a smog-free environment,” he told AFP . Legal action Experts say the pollution is primarily caused by factory and traffic emissions. It worsens in winter as farmers burn crop stubble and cooler temperatures and slow-moving winds trap the deadly pollutants. This year, winter rains that typically bring relief did not arrive until late February, as climate change renders Pakistan’s weather patterns increasingly unpredictable . The smog was so thick it could be seen from space and prompted authorities to close schools serving millions of students across the largest province Punjab, including its capital Lahore. Young climate activist Risha Rashid said Islamabad is fast becoming “another Lahore” and has launched legal action against the government.\n“It’s really suffocating,” the 21-year-old, who has asthma, told AFP .\n“I cannot go out, even if I have exams. It’s not just affecting our physical health but our mental health as well.” An Ipsos poll in November found four out of five Pakistanis said they were affected by the smog. It can cause sore throats, stinging eyes and respiratory illnesses, while prolonged exposure can trigger strokes, heart disease and lung cancer.\nIts effects are worse for children, who breathe more rapidly and have weaker immune systems. ‘At war’ This smog season, Punjab’s provincial government declared a “war on smog”, increasing public air quality monitoring devices tenfold to around 30 and offering farmers subsidised rentals of machinery to clear crop stubble and avoid burning.\nIt also pledged to increasingly enforce emissions regulations on tens of thousands of factories and more than 8,000 brick kilns, a major source of black carbon emissions. But environmentalists and experts say action has been piecemeal and sometimes counterproductive, including restrictions on private air quality monitoring devices that the government claims give “misleading results that spread panic.” And anti-smog machines, including a tower in Lahore shut down two months after installation, are effectively useless, experts say. “It is like putting an air conditioner out in the open,” said one who spoke on the condition of anonymity. This photograph, taken on February 17, 202,5 shows Environment Protection Department (EPD) officials working at a Smog War Room as they monitor the air quality index in Lahore, one of the world’s most polluted city. — AFP Pledges for clean air Efforts that tackle pollution’s effects, rather than its source, miss the point, said Ahmad Ali Gul at Lahore’s University of Management and Technology.\n“It’s like when you have a bathtub and it’s overflowing and it’s creating a huge mess, do you first grab a towel or you first close the tap?” he said.\n“First, we need to focus on reducing the emissions and then we talk about how to protect ourselves from smog.” The government has blamed rival India, which borders Punjab province, for pollution blowing over into Lahore. But Pakistan has limited vehicle emissions standards, and officials admit 83pc of Lahore’s carbon emissions are from transport. This photograph taken on February 17, 2025 shows an Anti-Smog Squad (ASS) official looking at an air quality monitoring station installed on the terrace of a university in Lahore. — AFP “Switching to a cleaner fuel would give immediate results, we’ve seen it in other countries,” said Frank Hammes, the global CEO of the Switzerland-based AQI air quality project.\nBut that “needs a pretty strong central effort to push down sometimes the painful changes that need to be made in order to reduce air pollution,” he added. Pakistan’s government wants electric vehicles (EVs) to account for a third of new sales by 2030. Cheaper Chinese models launched in Pakistan in 2024 but currently make up just a fraction of overall car sales in a country where 40 per cent of the 240 million population lives in poverty, according to the World Bank. Pakistan had a taste of clean air during the pandemic when a lockdown forced vehicles off the streets and factories to close in March 2020, but it was short-lived, as the economic impact was too great for many to bear. “Air quality improved so much that we could even see the stars in Lahore in the evening,” said Omar Masud, a director of Urban Unit, which analyses pollution data for the government. While climate change can make air pollution worse, few Pakistanis worry about global warming, explained Abdul Sattar Babar, Ipsos director for Pakistan. “Most Pakistanis are overwhelmed by the economic challenges that they are facing,” he said.\n“When you can barely survive, climate issues are obviously not your primary concern”.

Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks , particularly targeting police personnel. DI Khan Regional Police Officer (RPO) Ashfaq Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that a police checkpoint in DI Khan’s Khutti area was attacked by terrorists from multiple sides. When asked to confirm if the checkpoint in charge — identified as Ahmed Nawaz — was seriously injured during the attack and later succumbed to his injuries, Anwar said, “Yes.” Funeral prayers for the deceased were offered today at the Ijaz Shaheed Police Lines, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported. In attendance at the funeral were: RPO Ashfaq Anwar, District Police Officer Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmad, SPs of CTD, investigation, city, and headquarters, officers of security forces, police officials, and the family members of the martyr, according to APP. The attack comes on the same day a major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in DI Khan, the military’s media wing said. Last week, a soldier was martyred and another was injured when unknown assailants opened fire on them near Bannu. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies. According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. With additional input from APP.",

      "summary_orig": "Afghanistan’s foreign minister arrived in India on Thursday for talks aiming to foster economic ties with New Delhi in the first such visit by a leader of the group since it seized power in 2021. The six-day trip by Amir Khan Muttaqi highlights the Taliban’s efforts to spur engagement with regional powers to secure eventual diplomatic recognition. He is set to meet Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and other officials to discuss a range of political, economic and trade matters. “We look forward to engaging discussions with him on bilateral relations and regional issues,” foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X welcoming the minister. Muttaqi is also expected to speak with Indian business representatives, visit the ancient monument to love, the Taj Mahal, and a historic Islamic seminary, media said. He arrives in New Delhi after talks in Moscow with diplomats from Afghanistan’s neighbours, who appeared to unite against US President Donald Trump’s stated aim of taking over the Bagram military base near Kabul, the capital. Russia is the only country to have yet recognised the Taliban administration, whose members are under UN sanctions including a travel ban and asset freeze, including Muttaqi, who got a temporary exemption to visit India. Historically, India and Afghanistan have had friendly ties but New Delhi does not recognise the Taliban and shut its embassy in Kabul after the US withdrawal from the war-shattered country in 2021. New Delhi opened a small mission a year later to ease the way for trade, medical support and humanitarian aid, while its senior officials have held two-way talks with Taliban leaders.",

      "summary_orig": "A major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, the military’s media wing said on Thursday. The development comes a day after the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred in an exchange of fire between the forces and the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district. According to the ISPR’s statement issued today, security forces carried out the IBO on Wednesday on the reported presence of “ khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij ” in the Daraban area of DI Khan. Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. During the operation, the ISPR said, seven “Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell” due to effective engagement by security forces’ troops. However, during the intense exchange of fire, 30-year-old Major Sibtain Haider, a resident of the Quetta district, embraced martyrdom. “A brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced shahadat .” The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were found in the custody of the slain terrorists, who had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as [the] killing of innocent civilians”. A sanitisation operation was being carried out to “eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area”, the ISPR statement said. It added that the “security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave sons further strengthen our resolve”. President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces’ successful operation in Daraban, DI Khan and paid rich tribute to Major Sibtain Haider for his “valour and sacrifice, saying the nation’s resolve to end terrorism remains unshakable”, a statement posted on the presidency’s X account said. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to martyred Major Sibtain Haider, according to a statement posted by his ministry on X. State-run APP reported that KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also lauded security forces for the successful operation and paid them rich tribute for their “courage and professionalism in eliminating terrorists who pose a threat to peace and stability in the region”. Expressing grief over the martyrdom of Major Sibtain Haider, he extended condolences to his family and prayed for the “elevation of his ranks in Jannah”. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Subsequently, amid rising terror attacks, the government labelled the group as Fitna al Khwarij and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers. Islamabad has also raised concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism.  In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. After Tuesday’s IBO in Orakzai, a statement from the ISPR said the participants at the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference held at General Headquarters expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of “Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al Khwarij and Fitna al Hindustan . Last month, after 19 soldiers were martyred in KP in multiple incidents, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that the  “Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan”.",

At least three police constables were reportedly injured in clashes with enraged TLP supporters, who attacked law enforcers with stones and iron rods. Police responded with tear-gas shelling, turning Multan Road into a battleground. Videos shared on social media, which could not be immediately verified by Dawn , showed TLP activists running as police fired tear gas. Other clips showed TLP activists holding up spent bullet casings and tear gas shells. The crackdown on TLP’s central office came after the group annou­nced plans for a massive anti-Israel demonstration outside the US emb­as­sy in the federal capital on Friday. In anticipation of the protest, the Islamabad administration has also begun placing shipping containers at Faizabad Interchange — the historic site of several TLP sit-ins. A statement issued by TLP in the early hours of Thursday claimed a number of their workers had been arrested, condemning raids on their supporters’ homes. Police sources said that the group had called a large number of supporters to Lahore, who had taken up position in temporary shelters. These elements attacked police parties as they moved in to raid the TLP main office. Armed with stones, clubs and iron rods, the enraged TLP men managed to push police back.

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan embassy in Jordan said late on Wednesday that former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan. Ahmad led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan. “In accordance with the instructions of the honorable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said. The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post. Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi. According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home. “He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Mushtaq was scheduled to reach Pakistan today. On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said. “Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said. Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted. He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.",

According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home. “He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Mushtaq was scheduled to reach Pakistan today. On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said. “Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said. Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted. He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.",

      "summary_orig": "CHICAGO: President Donald Trump on Wednesday called for jailing Chicago’s mayor and the governor of Illinois, both Democrats, as his administration prepared to deploy troops to the streets of the third-largest US city. Neither Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson nor Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker have been accused of criminal wrongdoing, though both have emerged as prominent opponents of Trump’s immigration crackdown and deployment of National Guard troops in Democratic-leaning cities. Trump’s call to imprison the two elected officials comes as another high-profile political rival, former FBI director James Comey, appeared in court to face criminal charges that have been widely criticised as flimsy. Donald Trump has frequently called for jailing his opponents since he first entered politics in 2015, but Comey is the first to face prosecution. On his social media platform, the president accused Johnson and Pritzker of failing to protect immigration officers who have been operating in Chicago. “The Chicago mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice officers! Governor Pritzker also!” Trump wrote, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel. ‘ICE free zone’ Johnson signed an executive order on Monday creating an “ICE Free Zone” that prohibits federal immigration agents from using city property in their operations. Hundreds of Texas National Guard soldiers have gathered at an army facility outside Chicago, over the objections of Pritzker, Johnson and other Democratic leaders in the state. Trump has threatened to deploy troops to more cities, which he said last week could serve as “training grounds” for the armed forces. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found most Americans oppose the deployment of troops without an external threat. Trump has ordered National Guard troops to Chicago and Portland , Oregon, following his earlier deployments to Los Angeles and Washington. In each case, he has defied staunch opposition from Democratic mayors and governors, who say Trump’s claims of lawlessness and violence do not reflect reality. “My goal is very simple. STOP CRIME IN AMERICA!” he wrote on his social media platform. Violent crime has been falling in many US cities since a Covid-era spike, and National Guard troops have so far been largely used to protect federal facilities, not fight street crime. Protests over Trump’s immigration policies in Chicago and Portland had been largely peaceful and limited in size, far from the conditions described by Trump administration officials. “What we have going on right now is literally domestic terrorism in Chicago,” Todd Blanche, the No. 2 Justice Department official, said on Fox News. Pritzker has accused Trump of trying to foment violence to justify further militarisation, and his state has sued to stop the deployment. A federal judge on Monday permitted the deployment to proceed for the time being. Another federal judge has blocked the deployment to Portland. Trump has threatened to invoke an anti-insurrection law to sidestep any court orders blocking him, which was last invoked during the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi left for New Delhi on Wednesday, the ministry said, in what would be the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since they seized power in 2021. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will hold talks with Indian Foreign Minister Subra­hmanyam Jaisha­nkar and other officials on political, economic and trade issues, the Afghan foreign ministry added. The visit comes just a day after Muttaqi attended a regional meeting in Moscow where Afgha­nistan’s neighbours including Pakistan, Iran, China and several Central Asian countries issued a joint statement opposing the deployment of foreign military infrastructure in the region. The statement was regarded as a signal of opposition to US President Donald Trump’s stated objective to retake control of the Bagram military base near Kabul. So far, Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration. Historically, India and Afghanistan had friendly relations but New Delhi shut its embassy in Kabul after the 2021 US withdrawal from the war-shattered country and the return to power of the Taliban. India opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support and humanitarian aid. New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries. Muttaqi’s trip was made possible after the UN Security Council Com­mittee temporarily lifted a travel ban on him to allow diplomatic engagements abroad, India’s foreign ministry said last week. Discussions during Muttaqi’s trip will centre on bilateral cooperation, trade exchanges, exports of dry fruit, facilities in the health sector, consular services and various ports, the Afghan Taliban foreign ministry said last week. Bar on social media On the other hand, access to several social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, have been “intentionally restricted” in Afghanistan, internet watchdog NetBlocks said on Wednesday. Social media sites have been intermittently accessible on smartphones since Tuesday, AFP journalists reported, a week after a 48-hour nationwide internet and phone blackout was imposed by Taliban authorities. “The restrictions are now confirmed on multiple providers, the pattern shows an intentional restri­ction,” said NetBlocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance. The disruption is “primarily impacting mobile with some fix-lines also affected”. Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The prolonged visa bureaucratic jamboree over , the AFC Asian Cup qualifier between Pakistan and Afghanistan will go ahead as scheduled. Afghanistan, however, will take to the pitch here at the Jinnah Stadium on Thursday without having held a single training session in the host country. In terms of rest and preparation, it is advantage Pakistan but it remains to be seen how Nolberto Solano’s men make it count against a side that only landed at the Islamabad airport on Wednesday evening as they search for their first victory in qualifying for the 2027 continental showpiece on Saudi Arabia. Afghanistan are also winless and pointless after their opening two Group ‘E’ matches and head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese will hope his players can rebound after a long wait to set foot in Pakistan due to a visa issue that till Tuesday had raised the spectre of the match being cancelled. Till Tuesday night, the Afghan team was waiting for clearance in Dubai after the Afghanistan Football Federation had bungled the visa application process, stating that the players and officials would appear for their biometric verification at the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul. With most Afghanistan players based abroad, the AFF was unable to ensure their presence at the Pakistan Embassy and eventually it went back and forth with Pakistan Football Federation on how its diaspora players could enter Pakistan for the game. A breakthrough was eventually reached when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi intervened and ensured that the Afghanistan delegation will be granted visa on arrival. “We are thankful to the Government of Pakistan for their support and coordination in facilitating the arrival of the Afghanistan team,” PFF president Mohsen Gilani was quoted as saying in a PFF press release. “I would also like to acknowledge and extend my sincere appreciation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Pakistan Sports Board and the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC) for their full cooperation.” Over 10 members of the Afghanistan team, along with Italian head coach Annese, landed on Wednesday evening while another batch was due to arrive at midnight. Three players, who got their visas in Kabul, are making a road trip from Peshawar. Those circumstances give Pakistan an edge with Solano having held a short training camp for his side ahead of the fixture, although the team could only call upon a handful of diaspora players due to the funding issue that has impacted the recently-elected PFF. It is Solano’s first game in-charge of the senior team since he took over as head coach in August and the Peruvian was hopeful his side could get a good result against the Afghans. “The players have been working really hard in training and we should hope for the best,” he told a news conference earlier on Wednesday. “We are well prepared and we expect a good match.” Thursday’s fixture is the first of a double-header between the two sides with Afghanistan hosting Pakistan in the return game in Kuwait on Tuesday. Syria and Myanmar, the two teams with maximum points in the group, will also meet each other twice in the next six days. Only the group winner will advance to the Asian Cup finals.

A breakthrough was eventually reached when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi intervened and ensured that the Afghanistan delegation will be granted visa on arrival. “We are thankful to the Government of Pakistan for their support and coordination in facilitating the arrival of the Afghanistan team,” PFF president Mohsen Gilani was quoted as saying in a PFF press release. “I would also like to acknowledge and extend my sincere appreciation to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, Pakistan Sports Board and the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC) for their full cooperation.” Over 10 members of the Afghanistan team, along with Italian head coach Annese, landed on Wednesday evening while another batch was due to arrive at midnight. Three players, who got their visas in Kabul, are making a road trip from Peshawar. Those circumstances give Pakistan an edge with Solano having held a short training camp for his side ahead of the fixture, although the team could only call upon a handful of diaspora players due to the funding issue that has impacted the recently-elected PFF. It is Solano’s first game in-charge of the senior team since he took over as head coach in August and the Peruvian was hopeful his side could get a good result against the Afghans. “The players have been working really hard in training and we should hope for the best,” he told a news conference earlier on Wednesday. “We are well prepared and we expect a good match.” Thursday’s fixture is the first of a double-header between the two sides with Afghanistan hosting Pakistan in the return game in Kuwait on Tuesday. Syria and Myanmar, the two teams with maximum points in the group, will also meet each other twice in the next six days. Only the group winner will advance to the Asian Cup finals.

      "title": "Pakistan eye first Asian Cup qualifying victory against late-to-arrive Afghanistan",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The prolonged visa bureaucratic jamboree over , the AFC Asian Cup qualifier between Pakistan and Afghanistan will go ahead as scheduled. Afghanistan, however, will take to the pitch here at the Jinnah Stadium on Thursday without having held a single training session in the host country. In terms of rest and preparation, it is advantage Pakistan but it remains to be seen how Nolberto Solano’s men make it count against a side that only landed at the Islamabad airport on Wednesday evening as they search for their first victory in qualifying for the 2027 continental showpiece on Saudi Arabia. Afghanistan are also winless and pointless after their opening two Group ‘E’ matches and head coach Vincenzo Alberto Annese will hope his players can rebound after a long wait to set foot in Pakistan due to a visa issue that till Tuesday had raised the spectre of the match being cancelled.
