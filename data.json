A police investigation team searched the parliamentary intelligence committee, the National Intelligence Service (NIS) and the National Counter Terrorism Center to secure evidence. The investigation is related to the knife attack Lee sustained during a visit to the southeastern city of Busan on Jan. 2, 2024, while he was leader of the Democratic Party. Lee sustained a stab wound to the neck from a 67-year-old man who approached him posing as a supporter, leaving him hospitalized and requiring surgery. Last month, the government designated the attack as a terrorism case during a meeting of the National Counterterrorism Committee and subsequently launched a task force to revisit the stabbing.

      "summary_orig": "A scheduled luncheon between President Lee Jae Myung and leaders of the country's main parties was canceled Thursday, after main opposition People Power Party (PPP) leader Jang Dong-hyeok announced about an hour before the meeting that he would not attend. The abrupt cancellation of the meeting, which would have been the first of its kind among the three leaders in nearly five months, is likely to worsen bipartisan conflicts over contentious issues. Jang said he was boycotting the luncheon in protest of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea’s (DPK) unilateral passage of two controversial judicial reform bills at the National Assembly’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee the previous evening. The PPP has been a vocal opponent of the measures — one amending the Court Organization Act to expand the number of Supreme Court justices and the other revising the Constitutional Court Act to allow constitutional challenges to court rulings.

      "summary_orig": "Indian defence officials on Thursday cleared the purchase of $39 billion worth of defence equipment, including more French Rafale jets, days ahead of a visit to the country by France’s President Emmanuel Macron. A defence ministry source told AFP that the clearance covered the purchase of 114 Rafale fighter jets, adding to the dozens already used by the Indian Air Force (IAF). “The procurement … will enhance the capability of undertaking air dominance roles across the spectrum of conflict and significantly boost the deterrence capabilities of IAF with long-range offensive strikes,” India’s defence ministry said in a statement, without specifying the number of jets being purchased. The approval by the defence acquisition council — comprising top military officers and the defence minister — is an important first step for any military hardware purchase in the country. “The majority of MRFA (Multi Role Fighter Aircraft) to be procured will be manufactured in India,” the statement added. New Delhi has pushed hard in the last decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment. India has boosted military hardware imports from the United States, France, and Israel. Macron is set to visit India on February 17. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has also liberalised laws to ease private investments in domestic defence manufacturing under the ‘Make in India’ policy initiative. Since 2015, India has bought 26 Rafale jets worth around $8.7bn and in April announced a fresh multi-billion dollar deal to buy 26 more of the fighter jets. Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes, during the four-day conflict between the two countries in May 2025.",

      "title_orig": "Counting begins in landmark Bangladesh elections after Gen Z revolution",
      "summary_orig": "Counting began on Thursday in Bangladesh’s first election since a deadly 2024 uprising and the subsequent student-led revolution, with powerful political heir Tarique Rahman bullish about defeating a coalition. Voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders have raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote. It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month. Rahman, 60, said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) could regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people. But he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by the Muslim-majority country’s Jamaat-i-Islami party. “If people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed,” Tarique said after voting. Polls closed at 4:30pm (3:30 PKT), with the first significant results potentially expected overnight. With around 128m people eligible to vote, turnout reached a high 32.88 per cent by noon at about three-fourths of the 42,651 polling centres across the country, Akhtar Ahmed, senior secretary of the Election Commission, told reporters. There were no reports of major violence, but a BNP leader died in a scuffle outside a polling booth in the coastal town of Khulna, and two paramilitary personnel and a 13-year old girl were injured when a home-made bomb exploded outside a polling booth in Hasina’s stronghold of Gopalganj. Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country on election day, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths. Election Commission officials reported “a few minor disruptions” but top party leaders on both sides raised fears of threats. In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008. “I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.” “This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.” Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party leader Shafiqur Rahman reacts after casting his vote at a polling station during Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 12, 2026. — AFP Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign. Jamaat, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Rahman saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result. UN experts warned ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “ tsunami of disinformation ”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters. ‘Ended the nightmare’ Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race. During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show. Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. — Reuters Interim leader Muhammad Yunus , who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote “will determine the future direction of the country”. The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina’s 15-year rule ended with her ouster in August 2024. His administration has barred her Awami League party from contesting the polls. Hasina, 78, was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India. Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”. ‘Spirit of the uprising’ He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule. The 127m voters were also voting in a referendum on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence. Yeasin Arafat Emon, 25, said he had backed the charter as it “reflects the spirit of the uprising”. Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists. Several voters were conflicted about participating in the election. Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred. But some are determined to cast their ballots. “During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.” Members of the army patrol outside the polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. —Reuters The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world’s second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India. The BNP’s Tarique — whose late parents both led the country — told AFP ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability. But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that “the economy has been destroyed”. President Zardari hopes for peaceful process President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning. “President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said. He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.",

Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. — Reuters Interim leader Muhammad Yunus , who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote “will determine the future direction of the country”. The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina’s 15-year rule ended with her ouster in August 2024. His administration has barred her Awami League party from contesting the polls. Hasina, 78, was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India. Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”. ‘Spirit of the uprising’ He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule. The 127m voters were also voting in a referendum on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence. Yeasin Arafat Emon, 25, said he had backed the charter as it “reflects the spirit of the uprising”. Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists. Several voters were conflicted about participating in the election. Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred. But some are determined to cast their ballots. “During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.” Members of the army patrol outside the polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. —Reuters The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world’s second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India. The BNP’s Tarique — whose late parents both led the country — told AFP ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability. But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that “the economy has been destroyed”. President Zardari hopes for peaceful process President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning. “President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said. He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.",

We have levers that we can pull and I know that through the Northern Territory Remote Area Investment, the NTRA, that is certainly an agreement between the commonwealth and the Northern Territory where I have pushed for those levers to be looked at. So we are halfway through that and we see this expiring in 2031. So we have another five years to really get to the end of this and hopefully close that gap. And that is our aim. There are certainly many, many moments of frustration. There is no doubt about that. Not just with the Northern Territory, there are other jurisdictions that we continually need to work with. But the NT specifically, I’ve reached out directly to the chief minister, I have raised directly the concerns around the incarceration rates, but also the deaths in custody that we’ve had in the last 12 months, really, in the NT in particular.

      "title_orig": "Canadian police identify 18-year-old woman as suspect in mass school shooting",
      "summary_orig": "The suspect in a deadly school shooting in western Canada was an 18-year-old woman with mental health issues who killed her mother and stepbrother before attacking her former school, police said on Wednesday, but investigators did not offer a motive for one of the worst mass slaughters in Canadian history. The killer, who police identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, died by suicide after the shooting on Tuesday in Tumbler Ridge, a remote community of 2,400 people in the Pacific province of British Columbia. Police revised the death toll down to nine, including Van Rootselaar, from the initially reported ten. On more than one occasion, Van Rootselaar had been apprehended under the provincial Mental Health Act for an assessment, said Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia. She once attended the school but dropped out four years ago. “Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,” McDonald said. Unlike the United States, school shootings are almost unheard of in Canada, and federal politicians initially struggled to maintain their composure. “We will get through this. We will learn from this,” a visibly upset Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters. Carney, who at one point looked close to tears, postponed a trip to Europe and ordered flags on all government buildings to be flown at half-mast for the next seven days. Hours later, legislators in the House of Commons observed a minute’s silence and listened as a sombre Carney said the killings had left the country in shock and mourning. “It is a town of miners, teachers, construction workers – families who have built their lives there, people who have always shown up for each other there … Tumbler Ridge represents the very best of Canada,” he said. McDonald said Van Rootselaar, who was born male but began identifying as female six years ago, had first killed her mother, 39, and 11-year-old stepbrother at the family home. She then went to the school, where she shot a 39-year-old woman teacher as well as three 12-year-old female students and two male students, one aged 12 and one aged 13. Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun. Dozens were injured, and two severely wounded victims, aged 12 and 19, remain in hospital. Police officers who arrived at the scene two minutes after the initial call encountered active gunfire, including rounds fired in their direction, according to authorities, before discovering Van Rootselaar dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound. “We do believe the suspect acted alone … it would be too early to speculate on motive,” McDonald told a press conference, saying police did not have information to suggest that anyone had been specifically targeted. Several prominent world leaders sent messages of condolence. King Charles, Canada’s head of state, said he was “profoundly shocked and saddened” by the deaths. Shooting among deadliest in Canadian history Details about some of the victims were slowly emerging on Wednesday. In an anguished Facebook post, Abel Mwansa said his 12-year-old son, also named Abel, had died in the shooting. Abel had once cried when his father proposed homeschooling because he loved going to school so much, his father wrote. He raised his son, Mwansa added, to respect his elders, “be strong, work hard, put a smile on the face like I do, focus on his studies, never miss school and to be a good kid.” Another woman, Shanon Dycke, said her 12-year-old niece, Kylie May Smith, was among the victims. “Pray for the other families who have lost their child, or are waiting to hear news,” she wrote on Facebook. “Just pray for Tumbler Ridge.” The attack sent shockwaves through the tiny community. “Everybody knows everybody,” Jordon Kosik, a resident, said in an interview. “People don’t lock their homes. They don’t lock their cars. You can just go to your neighbour’s house, just walk right in.” McDonald said police had seized firearms from the family residence about two years ago but returned them after the owner, who he did not identify, successfully appealed the decision. Canada has stricter gun laws than the United States, but Canadians can own firearms with a licence. Van Rootselaar previously had a firearms licence, but it expired in 2024. Canadians between the ages of 12 and 17 can obtain a minor’s firearms licence after taking a firearms safety course and passing tests. The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history. In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a petrol station. In December 1989, a gunman killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, before dying by suicide. “There’s not a word in the English language that’s strong enough to describe the level of devastation that this community has experienced,” said Larry Neufeld, a local provincial legislator. “It’s going to take a significant amount of effort and a significant amount of courage to repair that terror,” he told CBC News.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh will hold a national referendum on Thursday together with its first parliamentary election since violent protests ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. The referendum will give people a chance to vote on reforms to state institutions. Here is a look at why the referendum is being held, and what it entails. Why is a referendum needed? The referendum focuses on implementing the ‘ July Charter ’ drafted after the 2024 uprising to establish good governance, democracy, and social justice through institutional reforms, and to prevent “recurrence of authoritarian and fascist rule”. The interim government that took power after Hasina’s ouster approved the charter’s implementation order in November, saying public approval was necessary for key changes. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters What are people voting on? Voters will decide on four major reforms, including the creation of new constitutional bodies and the introduction of a bicameral parliament, whose upper house majority approval shall be needed for constitutional amendments. Other questions cover the implementation of 30 charter reforms — including term limits for prime ministers and enhanced presidential powers, along with broader changes in line with political parties’ commitments. How is the referendum being held? Each person will cast their vote by secret ballot. If a majority votes in favour, a Constitutional Reform Council will be formed to complete the reforms within 180 working days from its first session. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters Has Bangladesh held a referendum before? Bangladesh held three referendums before the Hasina government abolished the provision in 2011. A High Court reinstated it in 2024 after she was ousted. While the 1977 and 1985 referendums asked people if they had confidence in the then-presidents and their policies, the third, in 1991, asked whether Bangladesh should return from a presidential system to parliamentary democracy. People overwhelmingly voted “yes” in all three referendums. What do critics say? The referendum has been criticised for denying voters the chance to decide on reforms individually, instead clubbing together multiple proposals to force a single yes-or-no answer. Critics say this confuses voters by presenting a complicated premise and limits their ability to properly understand and debate the reforms. The interim government and political parties have also drawn criticism for framing a “yes” vote as essential, which critics say shrinks space for dissent by implying voting “no” means rejecting reform altogether.

      "summary_orig": "When the monsoon rains returned in 2025, they brought with them a fear quite familiar to millions of Pakistanis, not because the downpour was unusual, but because they had finally understood what it meant: floods are no longer rare disasters. Over the past several years, floods have become a recurring test of who in this country is protected and who is not. According to figures compiled by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the 2025 floods claimed at least 1,000 lives and affected nearly seven million people across the country. Punjab was the hardest hit, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and parts of Gilgit-Baltistan, where crops spread over hundreds of acres were lost, homes were washed away, and entire communities were displaced. Every time floods come, they bring with them a host of questions, all linked to their disproportionate impact: why do they affect some more than others? Why do some families lose everything while others rebuild within months? Why do they hit the same cities, same villages and same houses over and over again? Because beyond the visible damage that floods wreak is a deeper truth that researchers have been highlighting for years: floods do not create vulnerability; they expose it. It is called social vulnerability. What research says Social vulnerability is not just about income. It reflects where people live, how secure their livelihoods are, whether institutions work for them, and whether they are included in decision-making. Vulnerability grows when exposure, sensitivity, and lack of capacity combine. That is a hard reality faced by millions in Pakistan every year. Research across the world, and increasingly in Pakistan, shows that disasters are shaped by social conditions that exist long before hazards strike. Essentially, poverty, unsafe housing, weak services, poor planning, and lack of political voices determine who suffers most. This is most evident in studies on Pakistan’s flood-prone regions. They expose how households with low education, poor housing, limited land, and weak access to health and social services experience the greatest losses and the slowest recovery. Over one-third of households in flood-prone zones fall into high social vulnerability categories, research from both rural and urban areas shows. This means that even moderate floods can trigger long-term hardship. Informal settlements, which are often absent from official plans, mainly face the worst flooding and the least protection, despite housing essential urban labour. These findings are not academic abstractions; they describe everyday realities. When vulnerability turns into catastrophe For Pakistan, the 2022 floods were a turning point. They affected over 30 million people, with economic losses exceeding $30 billion. Once again, the devastation followed familiar lines. In Sindh, districts with poor housing, limited health services, and weak political representation remained under water for months — a reality that the coastal province, situated at the southern end, has lived with for years. Studies later showed that women, small farmers, tenant cultivators, and landless households faced deeper and longer-lasting impacts, including debt, distress migration, and food insecurity. The floods did not just destroy homes; they reduced people’s ability to cope with future shocks. When the floods returned in 2025, many families were only just beginning to recover from the previous disaster. In Punjab , prolonged river flooding, breaches, and overwhelmed drainage systems hit small farmers and daily-wage workers hardest. Many had already sold assets after previous floods. This time, there was nothing left to fall back on. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, flash floods and landslides struck mountainous districts where weak infrastructure and limited institutional reach turned rainfall into tragedy. In Gilgit-Baltistan, glacial melt and sudden floods damaged roads and homes, isolating valleys and exposing the growing vulnerability of mountain communities to climate extremes. The lesson was clear: when vulnerability is ignored, and recovery is incomplete, disasters return — even if rainfall doesn’t. The problem and the lesson Vulnerability — the word holds more value than it is given. And Pakistan should definitely start taking stock of it because what the country lacks is not disaster authorities or policies, but a vulnerability-centred approach. Disaster planning still prioritises physical infrastructure. Research shows that while embankments and roads matter, they cannot protect people who remain poor, excluded, and unsupported. Data gaps, weak coordination between institutions, limited local government capacity, and minimal community participation continue to undermine resilience efforts. As a result, disasters are treated as temporary emergencies instead of symptoms of deeper governance failure. Decades of vulnerability research point to one conclusion: resilience begins with governance. Reducing vulnerability requires institutions that are accountable, coordinated, and focused on people. Local governments must be empowered, land-use planning enforced fairly, social protection strengthened, and communities, especially women and the poor, should be involved in early warning, evacuation, and recovery. Most importantly, vulnerability must be treated as a development issue, not just a disaster concern. When inequality is reduced and institutions work, disasters lose much of their power to destroy lives. The floods of 2022 and 2025 were not just nature’s wrath. They were mirrors, reflecting how society is organised — who is protected and who is left exposed. If Pakistan continues to rebuild infrastructure without rebuilding institutions, floods will keep returning to the same doorsteps. But if the country listens to what research has long shown and puts vulnerability reduction at the heart of governance, disasters can become survivable, recovery faster, and resilience real. The rain will come again. The question is whether it will still find the same people waiting.

But if the country listens to what research has long shown and puts vulnerability reduction at the heart of governance, disasters can become survivable, recovery faster, and resilience real. The rain will come again. The question is whether it will still find the same people waiting.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Trump administration’s point man for South and Central Asia has told Congress that Pakistan remains an important US partner in the region, with Washington seeking to expand trade, economic cooperation, and security ties with the country. Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Sub-committee on South and Central Asia on Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored Pakistan’s role in regional engagement and highlighted growing bilateral cooperation. “Pakistan is another important partner in the region. We are working together with Pakistan to realise the potential of its critical mineral resources , combining US government seed financing with private sector know-how would benefit both of our countries,” he told the sub-committee. Referring to broader economic engagement, Kapur said: “Our trade in energy and agriculture is expanding as well.” He also pointed to continued security cooperation between the two countries, adding: “And our ongoing counter-terrorism cooperation helps Pakistan combat internal security threats while addressing transnational dangers that can harm the US or our partners.” During the subsequent question-and-answer session, lawmakers raised issues related to militancy, Pakistan’s past security strategy and broader regional dynamics. Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States. Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups. When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere. The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect. The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests. He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific. Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence. At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said. Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people. She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute. Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable. Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces. “We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) enabled the recovery of about Rs506 billion in disputed tax revenue over the past year by deciding hundreds of long-pending tax and revenue cases and lifting stay orders that had blocked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from collecting dues, according to the court’s Annual Report 2025-26. The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation. To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC). A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes. Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog. LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn. According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn. The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn. The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years. The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives. The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”. Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records. Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction. A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025. Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority. The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million. The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

LHC strikes down PRA sales tax case against Fauji Wind Energy on jurisdiction grounds Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn. According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn. The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn. The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years. The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives. The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”. Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records. Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction. A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025. Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority. The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million. The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) enabled the recovery of about Rs506 billion in disputed tax revenue over the past year by deciding hundreds of long-pending tax and revenue cases and lifting stay orders that had blocked the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) from collecting dues, according to the court’s Annual Report 2025-26. The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation. To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC). A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes. Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog.
