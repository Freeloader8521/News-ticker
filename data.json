      "summary_orig": "• Achakzai calls those violating Constitution ‘security risk’, says Nawaz sidelined for following law • Opposition alliance leaders visit Minar-i-Pakistan; supporters denied entry LAHORE: The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) has appealed to the people to take to the streets on Feb 8 to oppose “fascism, restore the Constitution, and safeguard the country’s sovereignty”. “Those playing with the Constitution of Pakistan are a security risk,” TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai said while speaking to journalists at the Lahore Press Club on Saturday. Mr Achakzai invited people from all walks of life to join the movement for the restoration of the Constitution and to take to the streets on Feb 8, marking the second anniversary of the February 2023 elections. “If we do not come out on the roads to stop fascism, restore the Constitution and the country’s sovereignty on Feb 8, we will all be responsible for Pakistan’s downfall,” he warned. Flanked by TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Haqooq-i-Khalq Party chief Ammar Ali Jan and Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Mr Achakzai said powerful quarters had blocked the natural process of leadership development through suppression, leading to internal crises. Unlike other countries, he said, courts had even snatched a political party’s election symbol. Referring to PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, the TTAP chief said the former PM had tried to follow the constitutional path but was sidelined and punished with a 10-year forced exile. Expressing hope that history would forgive him, Mr Achakzai said he had conveyed to Mr Sharif and would also speak to incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan that the next democratic government should honour judges who did not surrender to pressure and instead resigned from their positions, by conferring upon them the title of “Heroes of Democracy”. He said such judges should eventually be restored all the privileges they had given up in their struggle to uphold the Constitution, judiciary and courts. Responding to a question, Mr Achakzai said Pakistan could approach the United Nations to convene a round-table conference involving Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and China to discuss issues and find solutions. “No country alone can find and implement solutions,” he added. Allama Nasir Abbas said the “powerful” were blocking all avenues for reform and denying people their right to protest. “If the powerful block all ways to bring reforms, the people will rise to dismantle the oppressive system,” he warned. He said the martial laws imposed by Gen Ziaul Haq, Gen Pervez Musharraf and the current “undeclared martial law” were responsible for abrogating the Constitution. Calling on people to join the movement, he said the TTAP had been launched to restore the Constitution and empower citizens to claim their due rights. Ammar Ali Jan formally announced his party’s decision to join the TTAP movement for the restoration of the Constitution and democracy. He lamented that parliament had been rendered dysfunctional, the judiciary weakened and the media shackled. He said the country’s GDP was stagnant, more than 40 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line, educated and skilled youth were leaving the country, while a few companies were earning billions of dollars in profits. He said the people of Pakistan had the right to decide who should represent and rule them, rather than having state institutions decide the fate of the country and its citizens. “Those who work within their defined responsibilities will earn respect and honour from the people,” he said, adding that those who crossed their limits would face resistance and chaos. Former senator Khokhar said people’s lives had been ruined by the suppression of opposition. “When you push the opposition against the wall, people themselves rise and assume the role of opposition,” he said, citing the example of Azad Kashmir, where an elected government was deposed. Later, a TTAP delegation, led by Mr Achakzai and Allama Nasir Abbas, visited Minar-i-Pakistan and spoke to journalists. Local authorities allowed the delegation to enter the historic site but barred its workers and supporters who chanted slogans against the Punjab government. Speaking on the occasion, Mr Achakzai called on the people to take to the streets on Feb 8 to stand against oppression and fascism and restore true democracy, as envisaged in the Lahore Resolution. He said anyone who suspends or alters the Constitution is liable to punishment under Article 6. Allama Nasir Abbas said the delegation had come to Minar-i-Pakistan to send a message that the country belongs to its people, and that everyone must come forward to save it from the clutches of oppressors. He asserted that the fascists would ultimately be defeated by the people of Pakistan. Mustafa Nawaz Khokar said the Punjab government had effectively turned Iqbal Park into a “no-go area” for the public on weekends, noting that the Pakistan Day Resolution was passed at the park. The TTAP leaders also chanted slogans like “ Hum zulm mitanay niklay hein, aao hmaray saath chalo ”. The TTAP delegation also met people on city streets in the night and urged them to join the movement, close shops and observe a wheel-jam on Feb 8. They also distributed pamphlets prepared by the PTI Punjab across city streets, roads and at people’s residences. The delegation also visited Mazar-i-Iqbal and Bibi Pakdaman to pay homage.

      "summary_orig": "FOREIGN Minister Ishaq Dar is being greeted by Hissein Brahim Taha, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s secretary general, and Ambassador Fawad Sher on his arrival at the bloc’s secretariat in Jeddah.—X/@ForeignOfficePk ISLAMABAD: The Cou­­ncil of Foreign Min­isters of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held its 22nd extraordinary session in Jeddah on Saturday —adopting two resolutions, the first to condemn Israel’s recognition of the so-called “Somaliland” as an independent state and the second on Tel Aviv’s continued aggression aga­inst the Palestinian people as well as its plans for annexation and displacement from their land. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also participated in the session, where he was received by OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha and Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the bloc, Ambassador Fawad Sheron, upon his arrival. Israel has recently recognised Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Soma­liland’s president, Abdira­hman Mohamed Abdul­lahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords. Later, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”. According to a statement issued by the bloc, OIC Secretary General Taha in his speech emphasised that the extraordinary ministerial meeting was being held at a “very delicate and sensitive time” to discuss the “serious developments affecting the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Somalia”. Referring to Israel, he described its announcement recognising “Somaliland” region as an independent state as a “dangerous precedent that constituted a flagrant violation of international law and a direct threat to regional security and stability”. The secretary general explained that the current meeting was a follow-up to an extraordinary session of the executive committee with open membership at the level of permanent representatives, held at the headquarters of the organisation’s general secretariat on Jan 1. “It clearly reflects the extent of shared concern about these dangerous developments. It also reflects the collective awareness of member states of the need to adopt a unified, clear, and firm Islamic position that supports the Federal Republic of Somalia, its territorial integrity and sovereignty, based on the principles of the OIC Charter, the provisions of international law, and relevant United Nations resolutions,” he noted. Palestine situation In his address, the secretary general also discussed the situation in Palestine, stressing the need to compel Israel, the occupying power, to move to the second phase of the ceasefire agreement. He called for a comprehensive and permanent cessation of Israeli aggression, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the prevention of the displacement of the Palestinian people and the facilitation of the return of displaced persons to their homes. The meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers was preceded by a preparatory session at the level of senior officials. New chancery building Earlier in the day, Mr Dar inaugurated the new chancery building of the Consulate General of Pakistan in Jeddah at a ceremony, state-run APP reported. The ceremony was attended by Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq, Saudi dignitaries, Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah Syed Mustafa Rabbani, prominent members of the Pakistani community, and officials of the Pakistan Consulate in Jeddah. During the inauguration ceremony, the Pakistani flag was hoisted on the premises of the new chancery building, followed by a tree plantation in the chancery lawn, ribbon-cutting, unveiling of the plaque, and the offering of prayers for Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. A brief video report highlighting the features of the project was also displayed. Published in Dawn, January 11th, 2026",

      "summary": "FOREIGN Minister Ishaq Dar is being greeted by Hissein Brahim Taha, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s secretary general, and Ambassador Fawad Sher on his arrival at the bloc’s secretariat in Jeddah.—X/@ForeignOfficePk ISLAMABAD: The Cou­­ncil of Foreign Min­isters of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) held its 22nd extraordinary session in Jeddah on Saturday —adopting two resolutions, the first to condemn Israel’s recognition of the so-called “Somaliland” as an independent state and the second on Tel Aviv’s continued aggression aga­inst the Palestinian people as well as its plans for annexation and displacement from their land. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also participated in the session, where he was received by OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha and Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the bloc, Ambassador Fawad Sheron, upon his arrival. Israel has recently recognised Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Soma­liland’s president, Abdira­hman Mohamed Abdul­lahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords. Later, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”. According to a statement issued by the bloc, OIC Secretary General Taha in his speech emphasised that the extraordinary ministerial meeting was being held at a “very delicate and sensitive time” to discuss the “serious developments affecting the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Somalia”. Referring to Israel, he described its announcement recognising “Somaliland” region as an independent state as a “dangerous precedent that constituted a flagrant violation of international law and a direct threat to regional security and stability”. The secretary general explained that the current meeting was a follow-up to an extraordinary session of the executive committee with open membership at the level of permanent representatives, held at the headquarters of the organisation’s general secretariat on Jan 1. “It clearly reflects the extent of shared concern about these dangerous developments. It also reflects the collective awareness of member states of the need to adopt a unified, clear, and firm Islamic position that supports the Federal Republic of Somalia, its territorial integrity and sovereignty, based on the principles of the OIC Charter, the provisions of international law, and relevant United Nations resolutions,” he noted. Palestine situation In his address, the secretary general also discussed the situation in Palestine, stressing the need to compel Israel, the occupying power, to move to the second phase of the ceasefire agreement. He called for a comprehensive and permanent cessation of Israeli aggression, a complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the prevention of the displacement of the Palestinian people and the facilitation of the return of displaced persons to their homes. The meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers was preceded by a preparatory session at the level of senior officials. New chancery building Earlier in the day, Mr Dar inaugurated the new chancery building of the Consulate General of Pakistan in Jeddah at a ceremony, state-run APP reported. The ceremony was attended by Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq, Saudi dignitaries, Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah Syed Mustafa Rabbani, prominent members of the Pakistani community, and officials of the Pakistan Consulate in Jeddah.

      "summary_orig": "• ISPR says forces kill 11 terrorists in N. Waziristan, Kurram raids • One killed, two held in Khyber • Two CTD men martyred in Peshawar, Bajaur attacks • JUI-F leader dies after South Waziristan blast; Fazl condemns attacks on clerics PESHAWAR: At least 12 terrorists were killed in multiple counterterrorism operations and gun battles in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday, while violence elsewhere in the province left two Counter-Terrorism Dep­artment (CTD) personnel martyred in targeted attacks and claimed the life of a senior JUI-F leader who succumbed to injuries from a bomb blast a day earlier in South Waziristan. In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said security forces carried out two intelligence-based operations on Thursday after receiving information about the presence of terrorists. It said the first operation was conducted in North Waziristan, where troops engaged a terrorists’ location and gunned down six of them in an exchange of fire. The second operation, conducted jointly by police and security forces in Kurram district, resulted in the killing of five terrorists, the statement said. ISPR said weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, whom it described as “Indian-sponsored khwarij”. It said the terrorists had been involved in attacks on security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as the targeted killing of civilians. The military’s media wing said sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any remaining terrorists in the areas, adding that counterterrorism operations under the “Azm-i-Istehkam” vision would continue. Separately, one terrorist was killed, another injured and two were arrested during an exchange of gunfire in the Malagori area of Khyber district, sources told Dawn on Saturday. Residents alerted security forces after spotting a group moving towards the hilly locality of Murad Dhand near the Khunarri dam, the sources added. The sources said security forces, aided by local armed volunteers, engaged the terrorists, while gunship helicopters and artillery were also called to pound the terrorists’ position. A video circulating after the clash showed two blindfolded suspects in custody amid a crowd of residents, while an army official urged local volunteers not to shelter terrorists. Local sources said it was the first such clash in Malagori, where Chinese engineers and workers are stationed for maintenance work at the Warsak Dam and the construction of an irrigation canal from the dam to Peshawar. CTD officials martyred Meanwhile, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in the jurisdiction of the Regi police station in Peshawar on Saturday, police said. Police spokesperson Alam Khan said the official, identified as Sanaullah, was targeted in the Regi area and a search operation was launched. Another CTD official was martyred in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil on Saturday evening after unknown gunmen opened fire on him. Police and residents said the attack took place in Mena Bazaar, about 25 kilometres from Khar, the district headquarters. War Mamund SHO Aslam Khan said the official, identified as Saifur Rehman, 40, died while being shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Khar. JUI-F leader dies of wounds Separately, a senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader and district president of Wafaqul Madaris Al-Arabia, Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, died on Saturday after sustaining injuries in a bomb blast near a madrassa in Wana bazaar a day earlier. Police said an explosive device went off near a religious seminary in the Konra Cheena area of Wana in Lower South Waziristan, leaving Mr Wazir critically wounded. He was shifted towards Dera Ismail Khan for treatment but died on the way, officials said. Lower South Waziristan DPO Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir said investigations were underway. JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman con­demned the attack, saying it was not only an assault on an individual but on “a moderate, peaceful and democratic ideology”. He said the repeated targeting of religious scholars in South Waziristan was alarming and required urgent attention from the state. Party leaders reiterated their commitment to peaceful political struggle, religious harmony, democratic values and constitutional supremacy. In a separate incident in Upper South Waziristan, peace committee chief Qadeem Khan sustained minor injuries when an improvised explosive device targeted his vehicle in the Barwand area of Serwekai tehsil, police said. DPO Arshad Khan said the vehicle was damaged in the blast and the injured was shifted to a local hospital, where he was reported to be out of danger. Police cordoned off the area, collected evidence and launched a search for the attackers. With input from Khyber, Bajaur and South Waziristan Published in Dawn, January 11th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "HYDERABAD: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Saturday evening rejected allegations of a ‘political-terror nexus’ in KP as he addressed journalists at the Hyderabad Press Club (HPC). The KP CM reached Hyderabad earlier today for a day-long trip to mobilise the public for a nationwide street movement . Speaking at a ‘meet the press’ event, Afridi complained that KP was being meted out “stepmotherly treatment” by institutions that were supposed to strengthen democracy in the country and claimed that the PTI government was “toppled as a result of a London plan”. Afridi said a 15-point agenda was presented before Pakistan and “everyone agreed” that a military operation was not the solution to any problem. “The actual problem is that decisions are always taken in closed rooms,” he said. Afridi further added that if a military operation were launched in KP, the provincial government would be obliged to stand with its people. “I have asked my administration to facilitate all those people, whether they leave voluntarily or are forcibly expelled,” he said. PTI workers and supporters welcome KP CM Sohail Afridi at Giddu Chowk on Saturday. — Umair Rajput The provincial chief executive further said KP was not being given its rights by the federal government, which had stolen PTI’s mandate. “It is a fake federal government that is ruling after a regime-change plan,” he remarked. “I am the first CM elected from the merged districts in KP, and these tribal areas have remained deprived of their rights for the last 78 years,” he complained, adding that whenever sacrifices are discussed, tribal people’s contributions are cited as examples. He said that when his name as provincial chief executive was announced, a spokesperson of an institution rejected it. The KP CM lamented that other chief ministers travel in Pakistan Air Force jets frequently, both within and outside Pakistan. “We often saw that even breakfasts were brought through these jets,” he added. Afridi recalled that the federal government had committed funds for the TDPs in the area, but these funds were not provided. He said the KP government had provided Rs7.5 billion out of its own resources. “I have often mentioned that the merged districts are denied their share in the NFC’s divisible pool. The NFC is meant to be disbursed among four provinces, but it is technically shared among only 3.5 or 3.75 provinces, which is a constitutional violation,” he said. Afridi further said that erstwhile FATA areas “were not included in the NFC” and noted that these districts were not financially integrated into KP. He also claimed that KP’s share in the NFC exceeds Rs1,300 billion. “Rs100 billion had been promised but was not provided; it now stands at Rs300 billion, based on a ratio of 3 per cent of the divisible pool,” he said, adding that only Rs132 billion had been given, while the liability stood at Rs 568 billion. PTI workers and supporters welcome KP CM Sohail Afridi at Giddu Chowk on Saturday. — Umair Rajput Regarding claims of lawlessness in his province, he said the KP government lacks writ in areas “falling under cantonments”. Afridi added that the people of his province were satisfied with the KP government despite “oppression and attempts to eliminate the PTI”. “People not only voted for PTI but also protected it,” he added. He emphasised that “nationalist interests” are supreme, however, if Imran Khan seeks an independent judiciary and free media, this should not be interpreted as “stubbornness” on his part, as only real democracy can strengthen Pakistan. After arriving in the city, Afridi addressed PTI supporters and workers at Khurshid Chowk and in other areas of the city. CM Afridi arrived in Karachi yesterday on a four-day visit to garner momentum in the lead up to the planned February 8 protests , which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged. Sindh govt grants NOC for PTI’s Mazar-i-Quaid rally The Sindh government issued a formal no-objection certificate (NOC) to the PTI for their rally on Sunday at Bagh-i-Jinnah, adjacent to the Mazar-i-Quaid, said Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon. “The PTI leadership was informed in advance about permission for legal and constitutional activities,” he said. “There are some procedures for issuing a NOC which would take time to implement, but the Sindh government fulfilled its promise.” Memon added that the PTI is free to pursue political activities in Sindh, but noted that they would need to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in the NOC. “The Sindh government allows all political parties to carry out activities within the ambit of the law,” he stated. Arrival in Jamshoro Earlier today, CM Afridi was welcomed by Sindh United Party (SUP) President Syed Zain Shah upon his arrival at the G.M. Syed Edifice. Addressing the welcome event, CM Afridi said the politics of President Asif Ali Zardari has “ended” the politics of PPP’s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his daughter Benazir Bhutto. “Now, there is Zardari’s control over Sindh,” he said. Afridi was responding to SUP’s Shah, who had mentioned the KP CM’s remarks from Friday, in which he praised the PPP for “keeping the democratic traditions” of Bhutto and Benazir alive. He said Shah had misconstrued his remarks about PPP’s rule in Sindh. The chief minister slammed the PPP, which he said was once the “flag-bearer of the Constitution”, for changing the basic fabric of the Constitution through the 26th and 27th Amendments. “Whenever Imran Khan issues a call for a street movement, we hope that you will support us,” Afridi said. “The name is Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi. Remember it,” he said, taking a jibe at those who were “scared” of his name. He further quipped that “every chowk is D-chowk” when supporters raised slogans of Islamabad’s renowned D-Chowk. CM Afridi stressed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s struggle was for the “supremacy of the Constitution and the law, true democracy, rule of law, free media and the restoration of an independent judiciary”. “God willing, we will not sit calmly unless we fulfil this heartfelt desire of Imran Khan,” he vowed. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said Sindh had been deprived of its resources and added that “powerful quarters” have usurped provinces‘ resources. He said Sindh has the first right to use its gas over any other part of the country, adding that no one could snatch the province’s water. Raja pointed out that the PTI supported Sindh’s stance on the six canals issue . He maintained that PTI was not there for “politics of power” and therefore, it would not strike a deal. Sindh United Party (SUP) President Syed Zain Shah addresses an event held by his party in Jamshoro on Jan 10, 2026. — Umair Ali Rajput In his speech, the SUP president came down hard on the PPP, accusing it of selling Sindh’s resources in lieu of power. Shah said that for the last 79 years, either “military rule or puppet civilian rulers have ruled the country”. He said a “fake government” was installed not only in the 2024 elections but in 2022 as well, when Imran was ousted. He demanded fresh and transparent elections and the release of all political prisoners, including Imran and Yasmin Rashid. In a post on Facebook, the SUP demanded the release of “all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, Ali Wazir, Mahrang Baloch, and Moro [incident’s] prisoners“. At around 2pm, the PTI shared a video , saying CM Afridi and his convoy had reached Jamshoro. Another video showed him raising slogans of “Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi”. Hours earlier, the PTI’s KP chapter stated on X that the SUP was ready to welcome Afridi, with a stage set. PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh told reporters that Jamshoro district’s Kotri city was also among the party caravan’s stops. In a post earlier in the day, the PTI shared a video of PTI Hyderabad Youth Wing’s “enthusiastic” members chanting slogans as they stood prepared to welcome the KP CM at the Hyderabad Insaf House. In a post on X, the PTI detailed the KP CM’s itinerary for his trip to Hyderabad, where he is set to address the local press club, attend the Insaf Students Federation’s convention and participate in “street movement activities”. The party agenda also listed an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) in Hyderabad, though the lawyers’ body claimed it had never granted permission for Afridi to visit or address the bar. The bar association’s general secretary had invited the KP CM in a letter dated Jan 7. However, in a press release issued on Jan 8, the HCBA clarified that its executive committee had rejected the application by a clear majority. It said the general secretary issued the letter in his personal capacity and used the bar’s letterhead without consent. Departure from Karachi “[We] have departed from Karachi for Hyderabad,” announced Sheikh shortly after 12pm. “God willing, Hyderabad will also come out on the streets massively like Karachi,” Sheikh said, hailing the massive public response received by CM Afridi in the metropolis a day earlier. Speaking to the media before departing, CM Afridi said, “We were extremely happy with the way we were welcomed in different districts of Karachi and the passion and spirit we saw in the public. We thank everyone.” Referring to his planned public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi on Sunday, the chief minister said the people of Karachi had “another big responsibility”. “We have to make this jalsa successful under all circumstances and send a message to the world that Karachi was Imran Khan’s, is Imran Khan’s, and, God willing, will remain Imran Khan’s,” he stressed. “Toward Hyderabad for street movement [ sic ],” said KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi on X, sharing a picture with CM Afridi, Sheikh and Raja. Sheikh also shared a video showing people showering petals on Afridi in a “splendid welcome” at Karachi’s Toll Plaza. We are patriots of Pakistan: Salman Akram Earlier on Saturday, Sheikh and Raja, along with others , gathered at Karachi‘s Hassan Square to record a statement as they began their journey to join CM Afridi’s convoy. Umer Dar , the brother of Usman Dar who quit the party in the wake of the May 9 riots, was among those present . Raja said: “Dear citizens of Sindh, we are present on your land today. I am standing opposite Karachi’s Hassan Square. As you know, a grand jalsa is being organised at 4:30pm tomorrow at Bagh-i-Jinnah under the shadow of Mazar-i-Quaid. “We have come before you with Imran Khan’s message. This is a message of freedom […], of defending the water of Sindh’s farmers,” he said. The PTI secretary general urged the public to attend the powershow and collectively raise their voice against the imprisonment of PTI leaders and the “violation of their privacy”. “We have to tell the oppressor that ‘we are alive, you cannot erase us’,” he said, calling the PTI and its founder “Pakistan’s future”. “We are the patriots of Pakistan, we are the sons of Sindh, we are the guardians of Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber Paktunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan,“ he said. Plan ahead A schedule shared by the PTI on X lists CM Afridi’s planned activities for Sunday, including the Mazar-i-Quaid gathering and a meeting with the All City Tajir Ittehad Association in Karachi. The schedule stated that Afridi would meet Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah on Monday (Jan 12) morning. Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid. On the other hand, a notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office on January 8 cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold a gathering in Qayyumabad. Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit. Addition reporting by Imran Ayub",

The schedule stated that Afridi would meet Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah on Monday (Jan 12) morning. Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid. On the other hand, a notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office on January 8 cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold a gathering in Qayyumabad. Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit. Addition reporting by Imran Ayub",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s authorities indicated on Saturday that they could intensify their crackdown on the biggest anti-government demonstrations in years, as the death toll rose to 65 and the Revolutionary Guards blamed the unrest on terrorists, vowing to safeguard the governing system. Major Iranian cities were gripped overnight by new mass rallies denouncing the Islamic Republic, as activists on expressed fear that authorities were intensifying their suppression of the demonstrations under the cover of an internet blackout. The two weeks of protests have posed one of the biggest challenges to the Iranian authorities, although Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States. Following the movement’s largest protests yet on Thursday, new demonstrations took place late Friday, according to images verified by AFP and other videos published on social media. This was despite an internet shutdown imposed by the authorities, with monitor Netblocks saying early on Saturday that “Iran has now been offline for 48 hours”. The blackout has sparked fears among activists that authorities are now violently cracking down on the protests, with less chance that the proof will reach the outside world. According to a report by the Iran Human Rights Activists News Agency, the death toll in the protests rose to 65, Anadolu reported . The report added that protests took place in 512 locations in 180 cities in all 31 provinces, resulting in the deaths of 50 protesters, 14 law enforcement and security officials, and one government-affiliated civilian. Demonstrations also left dozens injured and 2,311 detained. The injuries were largely caused by pellet shots and plastic bullets, according to the report. Authorities have not issued a statement about those killed or injured. Amnesty International said it was analysing “distressing reports that security forces have intensified their unlawful use of lethal force against protesters” since Thursday in an escalation “that has led to further deaths and injuries”. Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi warned on Friday that security forces could be preparing to commit a “massacre under the cover of a sweeping communications blackout”, and said she had already received reports of hundreds of people being treated for eye injuries at a single Tehran hospital. Norway-based Iran Human Rights group has claimed that at least 51 people have been killed in the crackdown so far, but warned the actual toll could be higher. Iranian authorities are using the “most blatant tools of repression”, prize-winning filmmakers Mohammad Rasoulof and Jafar Panahi said, pointing to the internet blackout. “Experience has shown that resorting to such measures is intended to conceal the violence inflicted during the suppression of protests,” they added. ‘Seize city centres’ In Tehran’s Saadatabad district, people banged pots and chanted anti-government slogans as cars honked in support, a video verified by AFP showed. Other images disseminated on social media and by Persian-language television channels outside Iran showed similarly large protests elsewhere in the capital, as well as in the eastern city of Mashhad, Tabriz in the north and the holy city of Qom. In the western city of Hamedan, a man was shown waving a Shah-era Iranian flag featuring the lion and the sun amid fires and people dancing. In the Pounak district of northern Iran, people were shown dancing round a fire in the middle of a highway. It was not possible to immediately verify the videos. Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted Shah, hailed the “magnificent” turnout on Friday and urged Iranians to stage more targeted protests on Saturday and Sunday. “Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,” Pahlavi said in a video message on social media. ‘Big trouble’ Pahlavi, whose father Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ousted by the 1979 revolution and died in 1980, added he was also “preparing to return to my homeland” at a time that he believed was “very near”. Authorities say several members of the security forces have been killed, and Khamenei, in a defiant speech on Friday, lashed out at “vandals” and accused the United States of instigating the protests. State TV on Saturday broadcast images of funerals for several members of the security forces killed in the protests, including a large gathering in the southern city of Shiraz. Iran’s army said in a statement that it would “vigorously protect and safeguard national interests” against an “enemy seeking to disrupt order and peace”. National security council chief Ali Larijani said in comments broadcast late Friday that “we are in the middle of a war”, with “these incidents being directed from outside”. US President Donald Trump again refused on Friday to rule out new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in June. “Iran’s in big trouble. It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,” Trump said. Protester replaces flag at Iranian Embassy in London A protester briefly replaced the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran at its London embassy with a former flag, flown before 1979, during a demonstration today, witnesses told AFP . A video posted to social media showed a man on the balcony of the embassy, near Hyde Park, replacing the country’s current flag with one used during the rule of the ousted shah to cheers from hundreds of demonstrators below. The flag — tri-coloured, with a lion and sun, surrounded by a wreath and crown — was a ceremonial one used in Iran before the 1979 revolution. It stayed in place for several minutes before being removed, witnesses on site told AFP . This screen grab taken from an anonymous user generated video via AFPTV on January 10 shows a protester holding Iran’s pre-1979 flag after pulling down the country’s current flag, on the balcony of Iran’s embassy in central London. —  AFP “Democracy for Iran. Shah Reza Pahlavi. Justice for Iran,” chanted the demonstrators, referring to the son of the late shah of Iran who now lives in the United States. Some also held placards reading “Free Iran”. “I’m here to support Iranians, my loved ones inside Iran — they’ve been protesting for two weeks today,” said one demonstrator, Taraneh, 33, who declined to give her last name. “The internet has been shut down … We get very little information from inside Iran,” she added. “But, you know, people are still in the streets. They’re being attacked.“",

      "summary_orig": "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Saturday urged demonstrators protesting the fatal shooting of a motorist by a US immigration agent to stay peaceful, saying that any unlawful actions would play into US President Donald Trump’s hands. Frey, a Democrat, cautioned them as civil liberties and migrant-rights groups prepared nationwide rallies to protest the killing of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Minnesota and US officials have offered starkly different accounts of the shooting. Twenty-nine people were arrested overnight in Minneapolis as police responded to protests, including a gathering of demonstrators outside a hotel believed to be lodging a visiting contingent of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, city Police Chief Brian O’Hara said. One police officer was injured in the response, O’Hara told a news conference on Saturday. People march during a demonstration against increased immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, January 9, 2026. —Reuters Frey, who has been critical of immigration agents and the shooting, said the demonstrations to date have remained mostly peaceful and that anyone causing damage to property or engaging in other unlawful activity would be arrested by the police. “We will not counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos. He wants us to take the bait,” Frey said at the news conference. The fatal shooting of Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, came soon after some 2,000 federal officers were dispatched to Minneapolis in what ICE’s parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, called the “largest DHS operation ever.” Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as a “reckless” example of “governance by reality TV.” O’Hara said more than 200 law enforcement officers were dispatched to the Hilton Canopy Hotel on Friday night to respond to what started as a “noise protest” but then escalated, with more 1,000 demonstrators gathered on site. “We initiated a plan and took our time to de-escalate the situation, issued multiple warnings, declaring an unlawful assembly, and ultimately then began to move in and disperse the crowd,” O’Hara said Saturday. Federal-state tensions escalated further on Thursday when a US Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. Using language similar to its description of the Minneapolis incident, DHS said the driver had tried to “weaponize” his vehicle and run over agents. The two DHS-related shootings this week have drawn thousands of protesters to the streets of Minneapolis, Portland and other US cities, with many more demonstrations under the banner “ICE Out For Good” planned for Saturday and Sunday. Protest organisers said more than 1,000 weekend events have been planned across the country demanding an end to large-scale deployments of ICE agents, mostly to cities led by Democratic politicians. The rallies were being organised by a coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn Civic Action, Voto Latino, and Indivisible, some of which were at the forefront of “No Kings” protests against Trump last year.",

Frey, a Democrat, cautioned them as civil liberties and migrant-rights groups prepared nationwide rallies to protest the killing of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Minnesota and US officials have offered starkly different accounts of the shooting. Twenty-nine people were arrested overnight in Minneapolis as police responded to protests, including a gathering of demonstrators outside a hotel believed to be lodging a visiting contingent of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, city Police Chief Brian O’Hara said. One police officer was injured in the response, O’Hara told a news conference on Saturday. People march during a demonstration against increased immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, Minnesota, US, January 9, 2026. —Reuters Frey, who has been critical of immigration agents and the shooting, said the demonstrations to date have remained mostly peaceful and that anyone causing damage to property or engaging in other unlawful activity would be arrested by the police. “We will not counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos. He wants us to take the bait,” Frey said at the news conference. The fatal shooting of Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, came soon after some 2,000 federal officers were dispatched to Minneapolis in what ICE’s parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, called the “largest DHS operation ever.” Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as a “reckless” example of “governance by reality TV.” O’Hara said more than 200 law enforcement officers were dispatched to the Hilton Canopy Hotel on Friday night to respond to what started as a “noise protest” but then escalated, with more 1,000 demonstrators gathered on site. “We initiated a plan and took our time to de-escalate the situation, issued multiple warnings, declaring an unlawful assembly, and ultimately then began to move in and disperse the crowd,” O’Hara said Saturday. Federal-state tensions escalated further on Thursday when a US Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. Using language similar to its description of the Minneapolis incident, DHS said the driver had tried to “weaponize” his vehicle and run over agents. The two DHS-related shootings this week have drawn thousands of protesters to the streets of Minneapolis, Portland and other US cities, with many more demonstrations under the banner “ICE Out For Good” planned for Saturday and Sunday. Protest organisers said more than 1,000 weekend events have been planned across the country demanding an end to large-scale deployments of ICE agents, mostly to cities led by Democratic politicians. The rallies were being organised by a coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn Civic Action, Voto Latino, and Indivisible, some of which were at the forefront of “No Kings” protests against Trump last year.",

The violence in Aleppo erupted after efforts to integrate the Kurds’ de facto autonomous administration and military into the country’s new government stalled. Since the fighting began on Tuesday, at least 21 civilians have been killed, according to figures from both sides, while Aleppo’s governor said 155,000 people have been displaced. On Saturday evening, state television reported that Kurdish fighters “who announced their surrender … were transported by bus to the city of Tabaqa” in the Kurdish-controlled northeast. An AFP correspondent saw at least five buses on Saturday carrying fighters leaving the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsud district, accompanied by security forces. Kurdish fighters sit in a bus as they leave the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood accompanied by security forces in Aleppo, Syria on January 10. — AFP Their departure came as US envoy Tom Barrack on Saturday met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, and afterwards issued a call for a “return to dialogue” with the Kurds in accordance with an integration agreement sealed last year. In a statement to the official SANA news agency earlier today, the military announced “a halt to all military operations in the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood”. A Syrian security source had told AFP that the last Kurdish fighters had entrenched themselves in the area of al-Razi hospital in Sheikh Maqsud, before being evacuated by authorities. On the outskirts of Sheikh Maqsud, families who were unable to flee the violence were leaving, accompanied by Syrian security forces, according to an AFP correspondent. Men were carrying their children on their backs as women and children wept, before entering buses taking them to shelters.

Government forces began striking the district overnight after a deadline elapsed for Kurdish fighters to withdraw during a ceasefire. Residents waiting to return At the entrance to the district, 60-year-old resident Imad al-Ahmad waited for permission from the security forces to return home. “I left four days ago… I took refuge at my sister’s house,” he told AFP . “I don’t know if we’ll be able to return today.” Nahed Mohammad Qassab, a 40-year-old widow also waiting to return, said she left before the fighting to attend a funeral. “My three children are still inside, at my neighbour’s house. I want to get them out,” she said. Residents react as a bus carrying Kurdish fighters prepares to leave the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood accompanied by security forces in Aleppo, Syria on January 10. — AFP The clashes, some of the most intense since Syria’s new authorities took power, present yet another challenge as the country struggles to forge a new path after the ousting of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Both sides have blamed the other for starting the violence in Aleppo. ‘Fierce’ resistance Kurdish forces earlier reported coming under artillery and drone attacks, and claimed on social media to be mounting a “fierce and ongoing resistance”. The army said three soldiers had been killed by Kurdish fighters, while state television accused them of launching drones at residential areas of Aleppo. A flight suspension at Aleppo airport was extended until late Saturday. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control swathes of the country’s oil-rich north and northeast, and were key to the 2019 territorial defeat of the Islamic State group.

Members of Syrian government security forces stand guard along a street in the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood of Aleppo, Syria on January 10. — AFP Turkey has launched successive offensives to push Kurdish forces from the frontier. Elham Ahmad, a senior official in the Kurdish administration in Syria’s northeast, accused Syrian authorities of “choosing the path of war” by attacking Kurdish districts and of “seeking to put an end to the agreements that have been reached”. “We are committed to them and we are seeking to implement them,” she told AFP . The March integration agreement was meant to be implemented last year, but differences, including Kurdish demands for decentralised rule, have stymied progress. Ahmad welcomed on X a proposal by international mediators to evacuate the Kurdish forces from Sheikh Maqsud, but on condition that the local Kurdish population is protected. Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the renewed clashes cast doubt on the government’s ability to unite the country after years of civil war. Syria’s authorities have committed to protecting minorities, but sectarian bloodshed rocked the Alawite and Druze communities last year.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: After addressing workers and supporters at Minar-i-Pakistan, Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leadership commenced a public outreach campaign in Lahore. Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mahmood Khan Achakzai of the TTAP, visited different markets and commercial areas of the provincial capital to rally support for the opposition alliance’s street movement . As part of the drive, videos posted on X by the opposition leadership showed the leadership distributing pamphlets. “A large number of people expressed solidarity with the leadership of Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan,” said a post on X by the opposition alliance. Obstacles at Minar-i-Pakistan Earlier in the evening, Abbas and Achakzai reached Minar-i-Pakistan to address supporters of the PTI and the opposition alliance. However, local authorities closed all doors and blocked party workers from entering the Minar-i-Pakistan ground but allowed the TTAP leadership to proceed. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik chided the Punjab government for not even allowing the TTAP delegation to present a resolution at Minar-i-Pakistan. Speaking to Dawn , she said the party had called its workers to accompany the TTAP delegation, but the “terrified Punjab government” shut the gates of the Minar-i-Pakistan ground. Drawing a comparison, Malik said the Punjab government allegedly smashed the vehicles of delegation members, while Sindh allowed a reception for the PTI delegation led by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. Later, the TTAP delegation visited Mazar-i-Iqbal and the Bibi Pak Daman shrine to pay homage. Lahore Press Club address Abbas and Achakzai also held a press conference at the Lahore Press Club, along with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Haqooq-i-Khalq Party General Secretary Ammar Ali Jan. Abbas, speaking at the press conference, said that the opposition movement was about “reforms, protection of the Constitution, ensuring the rights of the people, and the liberation of the downtrodden classes of society”. He maintained that those in power were “blocking all routes to any reform”. “What avenues will people be left with otherwise?” the leader questioned. “They will rise and revolt against the system.” Achakzai also spoke at the press conference, reiterated his earlier stance that the “Constitution was under attack” and the country had been plunged into a crisis. “We are the common people of Pakistan, and we love this country just as much as anyone,” he said. “We have to collectively bring the country out of this crisis,” Achakzai said. “We are not here to tell people that please come follow us; we are here to ask them to stand with us,” Achakzai added. Achakzai also called on people to join the opposition’s movement, stating that, “In such a crisis, it is a sin to stay at home; you must come out on the streets”. “It does not matter what party you belong to, which sect, if you love this country, come and sit with us,” he said. In response to a question regarding talks with the government, the TTAP chief said that regardless of what happens, “we will not make a deal at the expense of Pakistan”. Achakzai further reiterated that “Pakistan’s army needs to stay within its framework as other countries’ armies do.” “Those playing with the Constitution of Pakistan are a security risk,” he said. Achakzai said the powerful quarters “had stopped the natural process of developing leadership through suppression that led to create internal crises.” Citing that PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif tried to take the right path of the constitution, the TTAP chief said he was sidelined and punished for a 10-year forced exile. Hoping that history would forgive him, Achakzai said that he had asked Nawaz and would also speak to incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan that the “next democratic government should honour all those judges with the title of ‘heroes of democracy’ — those who did not surrender to the powerful and resigned from their jobs.” “Such judges should one day be rewarded with all privileges that they had surrendered in their endeavour to uphold the Constitution, judiciary and courts,” Achakzai said. Responding to a question, Achakzai suggested Pakistan could request the United Nations to call a round-table conference, where Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and China could sit together, thrash out issues and find solutions. “No country alone can find and implement solutions,” he added. Ammar Ali Jan also spoke at the press conference and announced that his party, along with trade unions and student organisations, was joining the TTAP for “restoration of democracy, upholding of the Constitution, and the security of the country”. He lamented that the parliament had been “rendered dysfunctional, the judiciary ruined, and the media chained.” Meanwhile, PTI has also issued a call to the masses to gather at Minar-i-Pakistan, where the TTAP leadership is expected to announce a formal resolution. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged party leaders, workers and others to reach Minar-i-Pakistan and prove themselves as good hosts. As part of today’s activities, the delegation was expected to head to the Data Darbar and Bibi Pak Daman shrines to pay their tributes. The TTAP delegation wanted to visit Data Darbar to pay homage as soon as it entered Lahore on Thursday; however, the Punjab government blocked all roads leading to the shrine. Therefore, the opposition alliance had kept the TTAP delegation’s movements secret, hoping they would find open routes to the shrine and Minar-i-Pakistan. PTI Punjab also distributed pamphlets in an effort to mobilise the party’s support base for the upcoming street movement. On Thursday, Achakzai, who led the TTAP caravan from Islamabad to Lahore, urged the nation and political parties to support its wheel-jam and shutter-down strike to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8 elections, saying the protest would also pave the way for talks with the government.",

      "summary_en": "LAHORE: After addressing workers and supporters at Minar-i-Pakistan, Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leadership commenced a public outreach campaign in Lahore. Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mahmood Khan Achakzai of the TTAP, visited different markets and commercial areas of the provincial capital to rally support for the opposition alliance’s street movement . As part of the drive, videos posted on X by the opposition leadership showed the leadership distributing pamphlets. “A large number of people expressed solidarity with the leadership of Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan,” said a post on X by the opposition alliance. Obstacles at Minar-i-Pakistan Earlier in the evening, Abbas and Achakzai reached Minar-i-Pakistan to address supporters of the PTI and the opposition alliance. However, local authorities closed all doors and blocked party workers from entering the Minar-i-Pakistan ground but allowed the TTAP leadership to proceed. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik chided the Punjab government for not even allowing the TTAP delegation to present a resolution at Minar-i-Pakistan. Speaking to Dawn , she said the party had called its workers to accompany the TTAP delegation, but the “terrified Punjab government” shut the gates of the Minar-i-Pakistan ground. Drawing a comparison, Malik said the Punjab government allegedly smashed the vehicles of delegation members, while Sindh allowed a reception for the PTI delegation led by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. Later, the TTAP delegation visited Mazar-i-Iqbal and the Bibi Pak Daman shrine to pay homage. Lahore Press Club address Abbas and Achakzai also held a press conference at the Lahore Press Club, along with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Haqooq-i-Khalq Party General Secretary Ammar Ali Jan. Abbas, speaking at the press conference, said that the opposition movement was about “reforms, protection of the Constitution, ensuring the rights of the people, and the liberation of the downtrodden classes of society”. He maintained that those in power were “blocking all routes to any reform”. “What avenues will people be left with otherwise?” the leader questioned. “They will rise and revolt against the system.” Achakzai also spoke at the press conference, reiterated his earlier stance that the “Constitution was under attack” and the country had been plunged into a crisis. “We are the common people of Pakistan, and we love this country just as much as anyone,” he said. “We have to collectively bring the country out of this crisis,” Achakzai said. “We are not here to tell people that please come follow us; we are here to ask them to stand with us,” Achakzai added. Achakzai also called on people to join the opposition’s movement, stating that, “In such a crisis, it is a sin to stay at home; you must come out on the streets”. “It does not matter what party you belong to, which sect, if you love this country, come and sit with us,” he said. In response to a question regarding talks with the government, the TTAP chief said that regardless of what happens, “we will not make a deal at the expense of Pakistan”. Achakzai further reiterated that “Pakistan’s army needs to stay within its framework as other countries’ armies do.” “Those playing with the Constitution of Pakistan are a security risk,” he said. Achakzai said the powerful quarters “had stopped the natural process of developing leadership through suppression that led to create internal crises.” Citing that PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif tried to take the right path of the constitution, the TTAP chief said he was sidelined and punished for a 10-year forced exile. Hoping that history would forgive him, Achakzai said that he had asked Nawaz and would also speak to incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan that the “next democratic government should honour all those judges with the title of ‘heroes of democracy’ — those who did not surrender to the powerful and resigned from their jobs.” “Such judges should one day be rewarded with all privileges that they had surrendered in their endeavour to uphold the Constitution, judiciary and courts,” Achakzai said.

An internet shutdown imposed by the authorities on Thursday has largely cut the protesters off from the rest of the world, but videos that trickled out of the country showed thousands of people demonstrating in Tehran overnight into Saturday morning. They chanted: “Death to Khamenei,” in reference to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and: “Long live the shah.” Continue reading...",

      "title_orig": "Denmark’s Greenland dilemma: Defending a territory already on its way out",
      "summary_orig": "When US Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets his Danish and Greenlandic counterparts next week, Denmark will be defending a territory that has been moving steadily away from it and towards independence since 1979. United States President Donald Trump’s threats to seize Greenland have triggered a wave of European solidarity with Denmark. But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality — Denmark is rallying support to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and negotiate directly with Washington. “Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards,” said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at the University of Copenhagen. Strategic relevance Denmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its geopolitical relevance in the Arctic territory, strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the US ballistic missile defence system. Yet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if Greenlanders choose independence — or strike their own deal with Washington. The stakes extend beyond Denmark’s national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order. An infographic showing Greenland’s location in the Arctic Ocean. — Reuters Denmark’s foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22. “National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,” the two leaders said. “They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country … Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.” This week, Frederiksen said: “If the US chooses to attack another Nato country, everything stops, including Nato and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two.” Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen talks with the head of the Arctic Command Soeren Andersen, aboard the defence inspection vessel Vaedderen in the waters around Nuuk, Greenland on April 3, 2025. — Reuters/File The ‘Greenland Card’ For now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force. Copenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump’s threats. “It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive,” he said. During the Cold War, Greenland’s strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington, allowing it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a Nato ally. An aerial view shows western Greenland on September 16, 2025. — Reuters/File This became known as “ the Greenland Card ”, according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen’s Centre for Military Studies. But Greenland’s aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders’ right to independence if they choose. All Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how and when to achieve it. Trump’s pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint. “How much should we fight for someone who doesn’t really care about us?” Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters . The financial burden Copenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland’s economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2 per cent in 2025. The central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800m Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence — bringing total annual spending to just under $1bn. In addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42bn Danish crowns ($6.54bn) Arctic defence package in response to US criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland. Some reject framing the relationship in transactional terms, pointing to Denmark’s legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history. “We’re talking about family relations, [a] long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland,” said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. “So this is much more, it’s not just about defence and economy, it’s about feelings, it’s about culture.” Difficult balancing act Prime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute. For now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time “when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the US’s bad side is no good for anyone in the West”. Frederiksen also faces an election this year, though Greenland has not been a major theme. “I don’t understand why we have to cling to this community with Greenland when they so badly want out of it,” Lone Frank, a Danish science writer and broadcaster, told Reuters . “To be completely honest, Greenland doesn’t inspire any sense of belonging in me.”",

      "summary_orig": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader succumbed to his injuries on Saturday morning after being critically wounded in a bomb blast near a madressah in the Wana bazaar area. Police said on Friday that a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) was planted in the Konra Cheena area near a religious seminary to target Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, who was also the district president of Wafaqul Madaris al Arabia. He was immediately taken to Dera Ismail Khan for medical treatment but breathed his last on the way. Lower South Waziristan District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway. He said law enforcement agencies were examining all aspects of the incident, adding that the evidence collected from the site was being analysed to trace those responsible. The attack on Maulana Sultan is the latest in a series of incidents targeting religious scholars and JUI-F leaders in South Waziristan, particularly in Wana and the Birmal tehsil, over the past two years. In a statement posted on X, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his deep grief on Sultan’s death, describing him as a “devoted and courageous leader”. “This incident is not merely an attack on an individual but an assault on the moderate, peaceful, and democratic ideology,“ he said, asserting that the JUI-F was the “flag-bearer” of these values. “Following Bajaur, the targeting of freedom-loving and peace-advocating scholars in regions carrying deep religious significance like South Waziristan marks a deeply alarming pattern,” he said. Fazl recalled that in March 2025, JUI-F’s South Waziristan Emir was “severely injured” in a bomb blast and “till date remains under treatment at Multan’s Nishtar Hospital”. He further pointed out that former JUI-F district president Maulana Mirza Jan Wazir had been injured in a terrorist attack in June 2024 and had now passed away. Fazl said that the targeting of a party such as the JUI-F, which believed in “moderation, tolerance and constitutional struggle”, was extremely upsetting and a moment for serious reflection. The JUI-F chief said such attacks on scholars were “not only resounding proof of the failure and negligence of security institutions but also sinister attempts to suppress the peaceful narrative” that his party had been promoting for years across the country, including tribal areas. “The sole crime of such scholars is that they advocate for reason over the gun, love over hatred, and peace over discord,” Fazl lamented. He asserted that the JUI-F had always opposed oppression and violence, spoken for the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and adopted the struggle for reform and peace as its motto while remaining within the framework of the state. “This is precisely why the party, while staying away from all shades of extremism and radicalism, is recognised as a balanced, responsible, and mainstream national political force.” Fazl called on the “institutions responsible for national security” to recognise their constitutional and moral obligations; ensure the establishment of peace and the effective protection of scholars across the country, particularly in the tribal districts; and fulfil the demands for justice by meting out punishment to the elements involved in these tragic incidents. He affirmed that the JUI-F would continue its struggle for peace, religious harmony, democratic values, and constitutional supremacy in the country with “full resolve, no matter how many sacrifices it must give along the way”. Peace committee chief unhurt in blast Separately, a suspected improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeted the vehicle of peace committee chief Qadeem Khan in the Barwand area of South Waziristan’s Servekai tehsil. The remains of the vehicle. — Photo provided by author Upper South Waziristan DPO Arshad Khan said that the vehicle sustained significant damage in the attack, but the peace committee chief escaped with minor injuries. Police sources said security personnel reached the site immediately, cordoned off the area, and shifted the injured leader to a local hospital. The DPO confirmed that initial inquiries suggest the blast was carried out using an IED, deliberately targeting the peace committee chief. He said police were examining all aspects of the incident and had launched a search operation to apprehend the perpetrators.",

      "summary": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader succumbed to his injuries on Saturday morning after being critically wounded in a bomb blast near a madressah in the Wana bazaar area. Police said on Friday that a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) was planted in the Konra Cheena area near a religious seminary to target Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, who was also the district president of Wafaqul Madaris al Arabia. He was immediately taken to Dera Ismail Khan for medical treatment but breathed his last on the way. Lower South Waziristan District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway. He said law enforcement agencies were examining all aspects of the incident, adding that the evidence collected from the site was being analysed to trace those responsible. The attack on Maulana Sultan is the latest in a series of incidents targeting religious scholars and JUI-F leaders in South Waziristan, particularly in Wana and the Birmal tehsil, over the past two years. In a statement posted on X, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his deep grief on Sultan’s death, describing him as a “devoted and courageous leader”. “This incident is not merely an attack on an individual but an assault on the moderate, peaceful, and democratic ideology,“ he said, asserting that the JUI-F was the “flag-bearer” of these values. “Following Bajaur, the targeting of freedom-loving and peace-advocating scholars in regions carrying deep religious significance like South Waziristan marks a deeply alarming pattern,” he said. Fazl recalled that in March 2025, JUI-F’s South Waziristan Emir was “severely injured” in a bomb blast and “till date remains under treatment at Multan’s Nishtar Hospital”. He further pointed out that former JUI-F district president Maulana Mirza Jan Wazir had been injured in a terrorist attack in June 2024 and had now passed away. Fazl said that the targeting of a party such as the JUI-F, which believed in “moderation, tolerance and constitutional struggle”, was extremely upsetting and a moment for serious reflection. The JUI-F chief said such attacks on scholars were “not only resounding proof of the failure and negligence of security institutions but also sinister attempts to suppress the peaceful narrative” that his party had been promoting for years across the country, including tribal areas. “The sole crime of such scholars is that they advocate for reason over the gun, love over hatred, and peace over discord,” Fazl lamented. He asserted that the JUI-F had always opposed oppression and violence, spoken for the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and adopted the struggle for reform and peace as its motto while remaining within the framework of the state. “This is precisely why the party, while staying away from all shades of extremism and radicalism, is recognised as a balanced, responsible, and mainstream national political force.” Fazl called on the “institutions responsible for national security” to recognise their constitutional and moral obligations; ensure the establishment of peace and the effective protection of scholars across the country, particularly in the tribal districts; and fulfil the demands for justice by meting out punishment to the elements involved in these tragic incidents. He affirmed that the JUI-F would continue its struggle for peace, religious harmony, democratic values, and constitutional supremacy in the country with “full resolve, no matter how many sacrifices it must give along the way”.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Friday continued to make a case for him deserving the Nobel Peace Prize, yet again highlighting his role in ending the May 2025 conflict between Pakistan and India. Taking media queries after a meeting with oil and gas executives at White House in Washington, Trump was asked about Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado’s offer to share her Nobel Peace Prize with the US president. “Norway is very embarrassed with what took place,” Trump said; the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for selecting the Nobel Peace Prize laureates. “Whether people like Trump or don’t like Trump, I settled eight wars — big ones,” Trump said — a claim that he has repeated in the past. “Some going on for 36 years, 32 years, 31 years, 28 years, 25 years. Some just getting ready to start, like India and Pakistan, where already eight jets were shot out in the air,” Trump said. He pointed out that he arranged a ceasefire between the two countries in “rapid order without nuclear weapons”. “I can’t think of anybody in history that should get the Nobel prize more than me, and I don’t want to be bragging but nobody else settled wars. Obama got the Nobel prize . He had no idea why. He still has no idea,” Trump said, calling former US president Barack Obama a “bad president”. “You should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. These were major wars. These were wars that nobody thought could be stopped. President Putin called me [and] he said about two of the wars that he’s been trying to stop them for 10 years [but] he wasn’t able to do it. He couldn’t believe it,” Trump said. “So, in theory, you should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. Every war was major. But I don’t care about that; I care about saving lives. I’ve saved tens of millions of lives,” he added, before recalling his Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in September. “The prime minister of Pakistan came here and he made a very public statement. He said that President Trump saved a minimum [of] 10 million lives having to do with Pakistan and India, and that was going to be raging.” Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared in April 2025 when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was, without evidence, blamed on Islamabad, which strongly refuted the allegations. The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in May with the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries. India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks. Initially stating that five jets were shot down during the May conflict — albeit without specifying of which side — Trump gradually raised that number to seven in October , and then eight in November . He has also praised Chief of the Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on several occasions, calling him a “ highly respected general ”, a “ great fighter ” and “ my favourite ”.",

The FO also shared the phone numbers for the Pakistan embassy in the three cities; Tehran +98-21-66-9413-88/89/90/91, +98-21-66-9448-88/90, +98 910 764 8298; Zahidan +98 54 33 22 3389, +989046145412; Mashhad +98 910 762 5302, +98 937 180 7175. Protests have taken place across Iran for nearly two weeks in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions. Iranian rights group HRANA said on Friday it had documented at least 62 deaths, including 14 security personnel and 48 protesters, since demonstrations began on December 28. At the start of January, US President Donald Trump had warned that the US was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran’s security forces killed protesters. In response, in his first comments on the escalating protests, Khamenei on Friday called the demonstrators “vandals” and “saboteurs”. In a speech broadcast on state TV, he said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians”, in apparent reference to Israel’s June war against the Islamic republic, which the US supported and joined with strikes of its own. He predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution. For his part, Trump issued a new warning to Iran’s leaders on Friday, saying: “You better not start shooting because we’ll start shooting too.” “I just hope the protesters in Iran are going to be safe, because that’s a very dangerous place right now,” he added. Earlier this week, Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson said Islamabad firmly opposed any foreign interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, including Iran, in its first public comments since protests erupted. He said Pakistan viewed the situation in Iran as an internal matter and rejected external pressure or aggression. The spokesperson stressed that Pakistan did not wish to comment on Iran’s internal developments.",

      "summary_orig": "Venezuela said on Friday it had launched talks with the United States on restoring diplomatic ties, days after US forces deposed Nicolas Maduro as its president. It was the latest sign of cooperation following the leftist leader’s capture and US President Donald Trump’s claim to be “in charge” of the South American country. Officials said US diplomats were in Caracas to discuss reopening the country’s embassy, while in Washington, Trump met with oil companies over his plans to access Venezuela’s huge crude reserves. The government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez “has decided to initiate an exploratory diplomatic process with the government of the United States of America, aimed at re-establishing diplomatic missions in both countries,” Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement. John McNamara, the top US diplomat in neighbouring Colombia, and other personnel “travelled to Caracas to conduct an initial assessment for a potential phased resumption of operations,” a US official said on customary condition of anonymity. Venezuela said it would reciprocate by sending a delegation to Washington. Rodriguez, in a statement, condemned “the serious, criminal, illegal and illegitimate attack” by the United States and vowed: “Venezuela will continue to confront this aggression through the diplomatic route.” Trump vows oil investments Trump said earlier on Friday that he had called off a second wave of attacks on Venezuela due to the prisoner releases. The US president had suggested he might use force again to get his way in Venezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. At a White House meeting on Friday, he pressed top oil executives to invest in Venezuela’s reserves, but was met with a cautious reception — with ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods dismissing the country as “uninvestable” without sweeping reforms. Trump said foreign firms had enjoyed no meaningful protections under Maduro, “but now you have total security. It’s a whole different Venezuela.” He also stressed that the companies would deal only with Washington, not Caracas, when exploiting Venezuela’s oil resources. Trump earlier said that oil companies promised to invest $100 billion in Venezuela, whose oil infrastructure is creaky after years of mismanagement and sanctions. He had earlier announced a plan for the United States to sell between 30 million and 50 million barrels of Venezuelan crude, with the money to be used at his discretion. He promised any funds sent to Caracas would be used to buy only US-made products. In the meantime, Washington has maintained maritime pressure on oil tankers in the Caribbean, where it seized a fifth tanker carrying Venezuelan crude — oil that would be sold, Trump said. State-owned oil company PDVSA confirmed in a statement that one vessel was returning to Venezuelan waters, describing it as the “first successful joint operation” with Washington. Prisoners’ release Anxious relatives waited outside Venezuelan jails for a glimpse of their loved ones as the authorities began releasing political prisoners — a move Washington claimed credit for. “When I heard the news, I broke down,” said Dilsia Caro, 50, waiting for the release of her husband, Noel Flores, who was jailed for criticising Maduro. Venezuela began releasing prisoners on Thursday in the first such gesture since US forces removed and detained Maduro in the deadly January 3 raid. Trump told Fox News he would meet next week with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, whom he earlier brushed aside as lacking the “respect” to lead Venezuela. Exiled Venezuelan opposition figurehead Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia said that any democratic transition in the country must recognise his claim to victory in the 2024 presidential elections. Maduro was proclaimed the winner of the vote, but his re-election was widely seen as fraudulent. Gonzalez was hoping on Friday for the release of his son-in-law, who was detained a year ago in Caracas. Protests in Caracas Maduro was seized in a US special forces raid accompanied by airstrikes, operations that left 100 people dead, according to Caracas. US forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, to New York to face trial on drug-trafficking and other charges. Rodriguez insisted on Thursday that her country was “not subordinate or subjugated” despite her pledge to cooperate with Trump. Angry protesters rallied in the streets of Caracas on Friday, demanding Maduro’s release in the latest of a daily series of demonstrations. “We don’t have to give one little drop of oil to Trump after all that he has done to us,” said one protester, Josefina Castro, 70, a member of a civil activists’ group. “Our Venezuelan brothers died (in the attack), and that hurts.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has begun soft global marketing of the 2nd Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum, 2026 (PMIF26), scheduled to be held here on April 8 and 9, according to an official announcement on Friday. Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik held a briefing session with Pakistan’s ambassadors and high commissioners posted in key foreign capitals to advance preparations and mobilise international participation for the event. The meeting was conducted virtually with Pakistan’s missions abroad, while senior officials from the petroleum division and representatives of key public sector entities attended in person. The session focused on aligning diplomatic outreach with national economic priorities and positioning PMIF26 as a premier global platform for investment in Pakistan’s mineral and mining sector, the petroleum division said. PM approves national policy framework to reform gemstones sector During the briefing, the minister explained the aims, scale, and strategic importance of PMIF26 as a forum representing a national economic priority. He urged ambassadors and high commissioners to actively engage leading mining companies, institutional investors, financial institutions, and relevant government counterparts in their host countries to ensure broad-based and meaningful international participation. “PMIF26 will serve as a key platform for promoting mining awareness, stimulating economic activity, and attracting sustainable investment into Pakistan’s mineral sector,” the minister said, adding that the forum would build on the “success of PMIF 2025” held last year. He said the previous edition of the forum was organised in line with international standards and delivered tangible outcomes. “The forum attracted participants from over 50 countries and more than 5,000 delegates, while the signing of 14 memorandums of understanding with globally recognised companies validated growing international confidence in Pakistan’s mineral sector,” he added. PMIF 2026 is being planned as a strategic. technical conference — alongside an international gemstone exhibition — and a comprehensive resource library aimed at supporting informed as well as data-driven investment decisions. APP adds: Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday gave in-principle approval to a national policy framework to reform the gemstones sector, align it with international standards, and create a conducive environment for foreign investment, state-run APP reported. Chairing a high-level meeting on the country’s gemstone reserves, sectoral reforms, export enhancement, and adoption of modern technology, the prime minister directed strict adherence to timelines outlined in the policy framework this year. He also instructed immediate steps to establish international-standard laboratories and certification systems. PM Shehbaz ordered the establishment of two model centres of excellence for gemstones during the year and the engagement of internationally recognised experts to remove obstacles in policy implementation. He noted that Pakistan’s gemstone exports remained negligible despite the country having immense reserves, and called for encouraging private companies, particularly young entrepreneurs, to invest in the sector. Citing vast reserves of gemstones in Pakistan, he directed geological surveys to determine their location and value, ensuring full consultation with relevant institutions, provincial governments, and stakeholders. The meeting was told that Pakistan’s gemstone reserves were valued at around $450 billion, while annual exports stood at just $5.8 million. More than 5,000 companies are processing more than 30 types of precious stones in the country. Leading reserves in the country include those of emerald, peridot, ruby, topaz, and aquamarine. The industries and production ministry has chalked out a comprehensive action plan identifying challenges and priority measures to achieve a $1bn export target over five years through reforms. This year, the ministry will integrate the gemstone value chain into the national economy, promote local processing for value addition, adopt modern technology, launch private-sector training programmes, and introduce ‘Brand Pakistan’.

Chairing a high-level meeting on the country’s gemstone reserves, sectoral reforms, export enhancement, and adoption of modern technology, the prime minister directed strict adherence to timelines outlined in the policy framework this year. He also instructed immediate steps to establish international-standard laboratories and certification systems. PM Shehbaz ordered the establishment of two model centres of excellence for gemstones during the year and the engagement of internationally recognised experts to remove obstacles in policy implementation. He noted that Pakistan’s gemstone exports remained negligible despite the country having immense reserves, and called for encouraging private companies, particularly young entrepreneurs, to invest in the sector. Citing vast reserves of gemstones in Pakistan, he directed geological surveys to determine their location and value, ensuring full consultation with relevant institutions, provincial governments, and stakeholders. The meeting was told that Pakistan’s gemstone reserves were valued at around $450 billion, while annual exports stood at just $5.8 million. More than 5,000 companies are processing more than 30 types of precious stones in the country. Leading reserves in the country include those of emerald, peridot, ruby, topaz, and aquamarine. The industries and production ministry has chalked out a comprehensive action plan identifying challenges and priority measures to achieve a $1bn export target over five years through reforms. This year, the ministry will integrate the gemstone value chain into the national economy, promote local processing for value addition, adopt modern technology, launch private-sector training programmes, and introduce ‘Brand Pakistan’.
