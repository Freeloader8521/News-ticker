      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to a “longstanding” relationship with the United States, stating that “there is no either-or in our relations with other countries”. The DG ISPR expressed these views during an interview to a German media outlet. The interview, which seemed edited with a couple of cuts, was broadcast by Pakistani television channels on Friday. During the interview, the military spokesperson was asked about Army Chief Asim Munir’s visits to the US and whether they had helped with “warming up” relations between Islamabad and Washington. In his response, Lt-Gen Chaudhry appreciated the US and President Trump’s role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May after a four-day escalation. He said, “Over a period of time, we have been able to enhance and amplify on our convergences (with the US) and deftly managed the divergences.” “There are areas where a lot can be done, there are areas where a lot of engagement can be done,” he said, adding that “Pakistan views its relationship with the US as very important.” “We don’t think that these relationship have anything to do — or there is either-or with other countries.” At this point, the interviewer interjected him to mention China, with the DG ISPR continuing that “we at the same have very constructive and strategic relationships with China and other countries.” He said, noting that there is a lot of “scope” for collaboration between the US and Pakistan on the matter of counterterrorism. On that note, he expressed satisfaction over the US’s recent declaration of the Majeed brigade as a terrorist outfit. More to follow.",

      "summary_orig": "The government said Friday it will begin requiring the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on all international flights departing from domestic airports in 2027, part of efforts to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. The transport ministry said it will mandate a minimum blending ratio of 1 percent SAF in outbound flights in 2027 before gradually increasing the requirement to 3-5 percent in 2030 and 7-10 percent in 2035. SAF is made from various materials, such as used cooking oil, waste and renewable energy sources. It can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared with regular jet fuel. The measure aligns with global trends, including the International Civil Aviation Organization's carbon reduction goals and the European Union's ReFuelEU initiative, which requires carriers to blend SAF at increasing levels. Officials say the policy will help create demand for SAF in Korea, helping local energy and chemical companies to develop such products and supply networks. To help airlines manage related costs, the government will offer subsidies, tax benefits and other",

      "summary_orig": "• US vetoes resolution calling for immediate Gaza ceasefire, Democrats table resolution for recognition of Palestine • Focus on Middle East may affect scheduled Trump-Shehbaz meeting • PM heads to London, will attend UN moot on two-state solution WASHINGTON: With world leaders expected to converge on New York for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the escalating crises in Gaza and Qatar are reshaping global diplomatic priorities, with significant implications for Pakistan’s engagement with the United States. In addition to his address at the General Assembly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is also expected to take part in the high-level international conference for the ‘Peaceful Sett­lement of the Question of Pales­tine and the Imple­men­tation of the Two-State Solution’. The conference, which will take place on Monday, would require the Pakistani delegation to hold close consultations with Arab and Muslim leaders during the UNGA. At a news briefing this week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres noted that the 80th UNGA was meeting “in turbulent — even uncharted — waters”. The UN chief pointed out that nearly 150 heads of state and government, alongside thousands of officials and diplomats, will participate in this “World Cup of diplomacy” that begins in New York on Monday. “Palestine is going to be the huge elephant [in the room] in this session of the General Assembly,” said Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour, while explaining how this issue will keep the world leaders busy. US veto and resolution On Thursday, Washington reverted to its usual ways as it vetoed a draft Security Council resolution, which would have demanded an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, as well as calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on aid deliveries into the besieged Palestinian enclave. The text, drafted by the elected 10 members of the 15-member council, would also have demanded the immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all prisoners held in Gaza. It received 14 votes in favour, but the US used its veto power for a sixth time to come to Israel’s aid. In a rare move last week, the US had backed a Security Council statement condemning recent strikes on Qatar, though the text did not mention Israel was responsible. In another surprising development, Senate Democrats introduced a resolution calling for the US to extend recognition to the Palestinian state. Although the measure is unlikely to pass the chamber where President Donald Trump’s Repu­blicans have a 53-47 majority, the resolution urges US recognition of a demilitarised Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who is leading the effort, said in a statement: “America has a responsibility to lead, and the time to act is now.” Rescheduled Islamabad’s proactive stance in condemning the Israeli airstrike on Qatar and its subsequent diplomatic engagements have elevated its profile within the Muslim world, with the recent signing of a mutual defence accord with Saudi Arabia further enhancing its significance in regional security discussions. In addition, the shifting focus of the UNGA in the wake of Israel’s belligerent actions is also expected to impact meetings scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the summit, as those are now expected to be dominated by hectic diplomacy by Middle Eastern actors. Amidst all this, diplomatic sources in Washington suggested that a proposed meeting between US President Donald Trump and PM Shehbaz Sharif may have to be rescheduled. While the White House is still interested in the meeting, the intensifying crises in Gaza and Qatar may necessitate a shift in focus, sources said. President Trump is expected to engage with Israeli and Arab leaders during the UNGA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already announced that he is meeting President Trump at the White House on Sept. 29, soon after Trump’s consultations with world leaders at the UNGA. This may mean that the Shehbaz-Trump interaction is confined to the sidelines of the assembly session in New York. Embassy sources, however, say that Islamabad would prefer a full-fledged meeting at the White House, to address bilateral and regional issues. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, who has previously met President Trump at the White House, is also expected to accompany PM Shehbaz. PM in London Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif arrived in London on Thursday for meetings with senior British officials, ahead of his US trip. According to sources, the prime minister will remain in London until Sept 21. During his stay, he is scheduled to hold meetings with senior officials and address a gathering of Pakistanis organised by the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation. Before landing in London, the premier made a stopover in Geneva to meet his elder brother, Nawaz Sharif. The elder Sharif had arrived in Geneva four days ago for medical treatment, accompanied by his son, Hassan Nawaz, and his physician, Dr Adnan. Mr Sharif is expected to travel to London on Monday to join the prime minister and his delegation, which includes Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and the prime minister’s special assistant, Tariq Fatemi.

      "summary": "• US vetoes resolution calling for immediate Gaza ceasefire, Democrats table resolution for recognition of Palestine • Focus on Middle East may affect scheduled Trump-Shehbaz meeting • PM heads to London, will attend UN moot on two-state solution WASHINGTON: With world leaders expected to converge on New York for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the escalating crises in Gaza and Qatar are reshaping global diplomatic priorities, with significant implications for Pakistan’s engagement with the United States. In addition to his address at the General Assembly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is also expected to take part in the high-level international conference for the ‘Peaceful Sett­lement of the Question of Pales­tine and the Imple­men­tation of the Two-State Solution’. The conference, which will take place on Monday, would require the Pakistani delegation to hold close consultations with Arab and Muslim leaders during the UNGA. At a news briefing this week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres noted that the 80th UNGA was meeting “in turbulent — even uncharted — waters”. The UN chief pointed out that nearly 150 heads of state and government, alongside thousands of officials and diplomats, will participate in this “World Cup of diplomacy” that begins in New York on Monday. “Palestine is going to be the huge elephant [in the room] in this session of the General Assembly,” said Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour, while explaining how this issue will keep the world leaders busy. US veto and resolution On Thursday, Washington reverted to its usual ways as it vetoed a draft Security Council resolution, which would have demanded an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, as well as calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on aid deliveries into the besieged Palestinian enclave. The text, drafted by the elected 10 members of the 15-member council, would also have demanded the immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all prisoners held in Gaza. It received 14 votes in favour, but the US used its veto power for a sixth time to come to Israel’s aid. In a rare move last week, the US had backed a Security Council statement condemning recent strikes on Qatar, though the text did not mention Israel was responsible. In another surprising development, Senate Democrats introduced a resolution calling for the US to extend recognition to the Palestinian state. Although the measure is unlikely to pass the chamber where President Donald Trump’s Repu­blicans have a 53-47 majority, the resolution urges US recognition of a demilitarised Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who is leading the effort, said in a statement: “America has a responsibility to lead, and the time to act is now.” Rescheduled Islamabad’s proactive stance in condemning the Israeli airstrike on Qatar and its subsequent diplomatic engagements have elevated its profile within the Muslim world, with the recent signing of a mutual defence accord with Saudi Arabia further enhancing its significance in regional security discussions. In addition, the shifting focus of the UNGA in the wake of Israel’s belligerent actions is also expected to impact meetings scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the summit, as those are now expected to be dominated by hectic diplomacy by Middle Eastern actors. Amidst all this, diplomatic sources in Washington suggested that a proposed meeting between US President Donald Trump and PM Shehbaz Sharif may have to be rescheduled. While the White House is still interested in the meeting, the intensifying crises in Gaza and Qatar may necessitate a shift in focus, sources said. President Trump is expected to engage with Israeli and Arab leaders during the UNGA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already announced that he is meeting President Trump at the White House on Sept. 29, soon after Trump’s consultations with world leaders at the UNGA. This may mean that the Shehbaz-Trump interaction is confined to the sidelines of the assembly session in New York. Embassy sources, however, say that Islamabad would prefer a full-fledged meeting at the White House, to address bilateral and regional issues. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, who has previously met President Trump at the White House, is also expected to accompany PM Shehbaz. PM in London Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif arrived in London on Thursday for meetings with senior British officials, ahead of his US trip. According to sources, the prime minister will remain in London until Sept 21. During his stay, he is scheduled to hold meetings with senior officials and address a gathering of Pakistanis organised by the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation. Before landing in London, the premier made a stopover in Geneva to meet his elder brother, Nawaz Sharif. The elder Sharif had arrived in Geneva four days ago for medical treatment, accompanied by his son, Hassan Nawaz, and his physician, Dr Adnan. Mr Sharif is expected to travel to London on Monday to join the prime minister and his delegation, which includes Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and the prime minister’s special assistant, Tariq Fatemi.

      "summary_orig": "THE signing of a ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia is being seen as a moment of tectonic significance for the Middle East and South Asia. On the face of it, it is a declarative pact, containing a commitment to collective defence in the spirit of Nato’s Article 5, from where the accord borrows language regarding an attack on one partner being considered aggression against both. Beneath the surface, however, there is deliberate ambiguity about the scope of this agreement, which implies strategic signalling. The obvious signal is that Riyadh believes US security guarantees are no longer the sole hedge for its defence, and that it is prepared to institutionalise its own deterrence. What is public is short and formal. The official statement gave only a brief description, saying the agreement aims “to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression.” Riyadh will look to benefit from ‘operational and symbolic bite’ of Pakistan’s military capabilities That measured phrasing is a diplomatic curtain, but conversations behind it have been anything but modest. Because the written text is opaque and probably deliberately ambiguous, the debate that followed — especially among Western experts — focused first and foremost on one explosive possibility — does this pact imply a Pakistani nuclear umbrella for Saudi Arabia? One senior Saudi official, when asked by Western media whether the pact might obligate Pakistan to provide such a guarantee, bluntly said, “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.” Saudi commentators amplified the implication on television. Political analyst Muneef Al-Harbi said, “All available military means on both sides will be used if needed… Nothing is excluded, even deterrent means.” Those observations fuel speculation about the existence of an itemised nuclear-sharing clause because they show what Riyadh’s own media ecosystem and public intellectuals believe the agreement is meant to achieve. Speculation in western circles notwithstanding, Pakistan’s position on the nuclear deterrent is very clear; Islamabad was obliged to develop nuclear capability for self-defence and deterrence and it is intended solely for safeguarding the country’s own sovereignty and territorial integrity, not for extension to other states. Western reaction Even so, the immediate reaction from Washington likely is likely to be alarm, tempered by a degree of calculation. As Christopher Clary, a scholar at the Stimson Centre, told Dawn , “The US is not enemies with either Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, but it would likely view any explicit nuclear-sharing arrangement with concern.” Nuclear sharing and extended deterrence, in his view, are much harder in practice than in theory, so only time will tell what stipulations the pact actually entails. Whatever the eventual reality, the accord has already shifted the political conversation. Ambiguity it seems, is also a form of deterrence. The Saudi side has also been quite explicit about the more conventional building blocks of the pact. As Jamal Al-Harbi, the press attaché at the Saudi embassy in Islamabad, wrote in Arab News: “The newly signed agreement aims to expand military cooperation on multiple levels. Key elements include joint military exercises to improve operational readiness and interoperability, intelligence sharing to counter emerging threats, particularly terrorism and cross-border insurgencies.” “Additionally, it includes defence industry collaboration, with potential for technology transfer and co-production of military equipment, as well as capacity building and training, building on the longstanding tradition of Pakistani military personnel working with Saudi forces. There is potential for mutually beneficial industrial partnerships in emerging security fields such as cybersecurity, drone technology, and space-based defence systems.” Put plainly, the pact is not merely a rhetorical shield. If the partners follow through with joint planning, interoperability standards, intelligence fusion, and defence-industrial links, the result would be the most significant re-architecture of Gulf security since the US basing network was built after 1990. Whether it becomes an integrated command and operational reality with rotational deployments, pre-negotiated contingency plans, and shared logistics will determine whether this is a heavyweight security alliance or an expensive piece of theater. Treaty or agreement? The document’s label — an “agreement” rather than a “treaty” — has yielded an argument about legal force. Ahmer Bilal Soofi, President of the Research Society of International Law, told Dawn that the Vienna Convention provides a simple test: Article 2 defines a treaty as “an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law … whatever its particular designation.” By that standard, form and substance matter more than the label. If the parties intend binding commitments and write them down, the instrument acquires the legal character of a treaty regardless of what a headline calls it. Who does it aim to deter? Timing explains a lot. The signing followed high-profile Israeli strikes in Doha and comes amid a broader sense in Gulf capitals that the United States may not be the automatic guarantor it once was. Riyadh’s public posture is that the pact is not aimed at any single state; privately, the message is unmistakable. Whatever the primary object of Riyadh’s deterrence; be it Tehran, Tel Aviv, or a broader effort to project power into contested theatres, the pact may well reshape the balance of power in the Middle East — especially because Pakistan’s conventional and nuclear capabilities carry symbolic as well as operational bite. That symbolism cuts both ways. For Islamabad, the pact cements Pakistan’s claim to be more than a regional player. For Riyadh, it validates a strategy of strategic hedging maintaining American ties while deepening relations with Islamabad, China, and Russia. To quote Muneef Al-Harbi: “Saudi Arabia doesn’t replace one strategic partner with another. It expands its partnerships: with the West, with China, with Russia. Agreement with Pakistan fits this pattern.” The India problem The new alignment could also put Riyadh in an awkward position with New Delhi. India has worked steadily to cultivate Riyadh for energy, trade, and diplomatic support and would not welcome an explicit security tether between its principal energy supplier and its strategic rival. New Delhi’s public line on the signing of the agreement is that it will “study the implications.” This captures Delhi’s dilemma about how to preserve commercial ties without neglecting a shifting security calculus that may now require defensive reassessments. “In South Asia, it may heighten India’s caution in dealing with Pakistan,” the Saudi embassy’s media attaché warned. An ‘Islamic Nato’? This is something which has long been theorised. Past Saudi efforts, like the 2015 Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, proved more symbolic than operational. But the latest pact is different precisely because it ties the language of collective defence to concrete cooperation. Brig Faisal Al-Hamad suggested: “Right now, it’s bilateral, but don’t forget Saudi Arabia already has a joint defence pact with the GCC. Adding Pakistan makes seven countries. We may soon see this expand. At the very least, it’s the strongest step yet toward an Islamic strategic alliance.” Muneef Al-Harbi went further, arguing that “This pact reshapes regional security — it may not stop at just Riyadh and Islamabad. Other countries may join this Saudi-Pakistani track.” Whether Egypt, Turkey, or others sign on will turn on politics, prestige, and whether capitals prefer loose security webs or binding commitments.

      "summary_orig": "NEW DELHI: India’s opposition leader on Thursday accused the election commission of blocking an investigation into alleged large-scale voter roll tampering, in a fresh attack on the body’s credibility and independence. Opposition leaders and critics have alleged multiple times that voting in the world’s largest democracy has been undermined by targeted manipulation of electoral rolls. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has denied all charges. But in his latest broadside, 55-year-old Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi accused the ECI of withholding key data that could help identify those accused of tampering with electoral rolls. He accused ECI chief Gyanesh Kumar of “protecting the people who are destroying and attacking the constitution”. The ECI called the accusations “incorrect” and “baseless”, saying that it had itself filed a police complaint against “certain unsuccessful attempts” to delete voters from rolls. Gandhi on Thursday unveiled what he called “100 per cent proof” of an attempt to delete thousands of voters in Karnataka state using automated software. He said the ECI had refused to share technical data sought by investigators examining an alleged operation targeting Congress-leaning areas. The Karnataka criminal investigation department has asked the ECI “18 times in 18 months,” he alleged. “And they are not giving it.” The allegations come ahead of elections expected in October or November in Bihar, India’s third-most populous state with at least 130 million people. The opposition alleged the ECI had embarked on a “mass disenfranchisement” exercise, after it gave voters in the state just weeks to prove their citizenship, requiring documents that few possess in a registration revamp.

      "summary_orig": "THE signing of the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in Riyadh on Wednesday is indeed a significant development for both states. Though defence ties between Islamabad and Riyadh go back to at least the 1960s, and Pakistani troops have been stationed in the kingdom during various periods, the fresh pact strengthens earlier agreements, and most importantly, reiterates the principle that “aggression against either country shall be considered aggression against both”. While the defence deal was reportedly being discussed over the past few years, timing is everything, and the fact that it was inked mere days after the Israeli attack on Qatar has not gone unnoticed globally. The Gulf Arabs, including Saudi Arabia, have seemingly come to the realisation that despite their deep ties with the US, America is unlikely to come to their defence. Hence they are now exploring other options. Pakistan, which maintains excellent ties with the Gulf monarchies, and which has a battle-tested military, appears to be a natural partner. However, some questions remain. For one, the situation in the subcontinent remains volatile. While the Saudis may have friendly ties with New Delhi, will Riyadh help defend Pakistan if India attacks this country again? These queries need clear answers, especially when India has refused to rule out further aggression against Pakistan. Reacting to the development, the Indian external affairs ministry has said it is “[studying] the implications” of the deal. Yet the importance of the Pak-Saudi defence pact cannot be overstated, and it is without doubt a diplomatic and geopolitical victory for Pakistan. Hopefully, the pact will deepen the already cordial ties between both states. It is also possible that other Gulf states may sign similar pacts with Pakistan in future. While bilateral defence ties should be pursued by Pakistan, looking at the bigger picture, especially where the collective security of the wider Middle East is concerned, there is still a void. Here, the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, founded in 2015 and headed by former army chief Raheel Sharif, can be repurposed for collective defence of the Muslim world. Currently, the 43-member body is underutilised. If it were expanded to include Iran and other Muslim states not currently members, it could send a strong message to Israel, which is arguably the biggest current security threat to the Palestinians as well as the larger Muslim and Arab world. Redefining the coalition’s aims could help end the genocide in Gaza, and prevent further attacks by the Zionist state on regional countries. The infrastructure of a ‘Muslim Nato’ already exists; all that remains is opening its doors to all Muslim states, and strengthening mutual defence capabilities. Such a coalition could also serve as a warning to states hostile to Pakistan to think twice before launching further attacks. Published in Dawn, September 19th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Internet, phone lines cut off across Gaza City • Gazans flee bombardment, head south on foot, in vehicles and on donkey carts • 85 Palestinians killed in strikes, gunfire; Israeli loses four soldiers GAZA CITY: Israeli tanks and jets pounded Gaza City , the target of a major ground offensive, on Thursday, prompting Palestinians to flee south, where the Israeli military announced the deaths of four soldiers. AFP journalists and witnesses saw a steady stream of Gazans heading south on foot, in vehicles and on donkey carts — their meagre belongings piled high. “There is artillery fire, air strikes, quadcopter and drone gunfire. The bombing never stops,” said Aya Ahmed, 32, sheltering with 13 relatives in Gaza City. “The world doesn’t understand what is happening. They (Israel) want us to evacuate south — but where will we live? There are no tents, no transport, no money.” Palestinians say the cost of a ride to the south has soared, in some cases topping $1,000. “The situation is indescribable — crowds everywhere, the sound of explosions, women and men crying and screaming as they walked while carrying their belongings,” said Shadi Jawad, 47, describing his family’s ordeal as they fled their home on Wednesday. The offensive has sparked international outrage, with the territory already devastated by the war and the Gaza City area gripped by a UN-declared famine. It comes ahead of a planned move by several countries, including France and Britain, to recognise a Palestinian state later this month at the UN. Israeli tanks were advancing on Thursday in two Gaza City areas that are gateways to the city centre, while internet and phone lines were cut off across the Gaza Strip, a sign that ground operations were likely to further escalate imminently. Israeli forces control Gaza City’s eastern suburbs and in recent days have been pounding the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al-Hawa areas, from where they would be positioned to advance on central and western areas where most of the population is sheltering. “We are scared, but what can we do?” said Bassam Al-Qanou, a displaced man sheltering with around 30 family members in one of countless ragged improvised tent camps along the city’s beach. At least 85 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, most in Gaza City, according to the territory’s health ministry. Later on Thursday, the Israeli military said four of its soldiers had been killed using an explosive device in Rafah, in southern Gaza. Published in Dawn, September 19th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Four terrorists eliminated in Khuzdar operation, says ISPR • Two FC men injured in Kalat grenade attack • Suicide bomber strikes convoy near Kech QUETTA: At least six people lost their lives in a powerful bomb explosion in the border town of Chaman, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy in Kech district, while security forces killed four militants in Khuzdar during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) on Thursday. Separately, four people, including two Frontier Corps officials, were injured in a grenade attack and firing by unknown armed men in the Mangochar area of Kalat division late in the evening. Officials said the Chaman blast ripped through a crowded taxi stand near the Pak-Afghan border in the evening, killing four people instantly and injuring two others. The wounded later succumbed to their injuries, raising the death toll to six. “The explosion took place near makeshift shops,” Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch told Dawn . Police and Levies forces rushed to the scene and shifted the dead and injured to the district hospital. “The blast left bodies mangled and body parts scattered,” eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told Dawn by phone. Police said initial investigations suggested explosives had been planted outside the shops at the taxi stand. The Balochistan Home Depart­ment confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident. It asked citizens to cooperate with investigation officials, stressing that the culprits would be brought to justice. Kech suicide attack Meanwhile, a convoy travelling from Gwadar to Turbat came under attack in the Dasht-i-Kuddan area of Kech district, around 60 kilometres from Turbat. Officials said gunmen opened fire on the convoy before a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden pickup into one of the buses. There was no official word from the local administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) about the incident. It was not immediately clear whether anyone had been killed or injured. The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack. Khuzdar operation Separately, the military’s media wing said on Thursday that security forces killed four militants linked to the “Indian proxy” group Fitna al-Hindustan during an intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar. “During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a statement. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the site, it added. “Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said. Thursday’s attacks come amid a surge in militant activity across Balochistan. Earlier this week, five militants were killed in Khuzdar. Last week, four militants were also killed during an IBO in Mastung, according to ISPR. A day earlier, two police stations and a Levies post were targeted in Sherani district, leaving one poli­ce­­man martyred and two Levies personnel injured. Published in Dawn, September 19th, 2025",

      "summary_en": "• Four terrorists eliminated in Khuzdar operation, says ISPR • Two FC men injured in Kalat grenade attack • Suicide bomber strikes convoy near Kech QUETTA: At least six people lost their lives in a powerful bomb explosion in the border town of Chaman, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy in Kech district, while security forces killed four militants in Khuzdar during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) on Thursday. Separately, four people, including two Frontier Corps officials, were injured in a grenade attack and firing by unknown armed men in the Mangochar area of Kalat division late in the evening. Officials said the Chaman blast ripped through a crowded taxi stand near the Pak-Afghan border in the evening, killing four people instantly and injuring two others. The wounded later succumbed to their injuries, raising the death toll to six. “The explosion took place near makeshift shops,” Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch told Dawn . Police and Levies forces rushed to the scene and shifted the dead and injured to the district hospital. “The blast left bodies mangled and body parts scattered,” eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told Dawn by phone. Police said initial investigations suggested explosives had been planted outside the shops at the taxi stand. The Balochistan Home Depart­ment confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident. It asked citizens to cooperate with investigation officials, stressing that the culprits would be brought to justice. Kech suicide attack Meanwhile, a convoy travelling from Gwadar to Turbat came under attack in the Dasht-i-Kuddan area of Kech district, around 60 kilometres from Turbat. Officials said gunmen opened fire on the convoy before a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden pickup into one of the buses. There was no official word from the local administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) about the incident. It was not immediately clear whether anyone had been killed or injured. The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack. Khuzdar operation Separately, the military’s media wing said on Thursday that security forces killed four militants linked to the “Indian proxy” group Fitna al-Hindustan during an intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar. “During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a statement. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the site, it added. “Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said. Thursday’s attacks come amid a surge in militant activity across Balochistan. Earlier this week, five militants were killed in Khuzdar. Last week, four militants were also killed during an IBO in Mastung, according to ISPR. A day earlier, two police stations and a Levies post were targeted in Sherani district, leaving one poli­ce­­man martyred and two Levies personnel injured. Published in Dawn, September 19th, 2025",

Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission for the former prime minister and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while confined in the same jail. According to sources, a three-member NCCIA team, headed by Additional Director Ayaz Khan, visited the Central Jail Adiala on Thursday for the second time during this week to question the PTI founder about his “X” handle. However, the sources said Mr Khan told the team to bring his lawyers if they wanted to question him on any matter and refused to participate in the investigation. The team arrived at Adiala Jail at around 3.30pm and left two hours later empty-handed amid ti­­ght security. The NCCIA launched the investigation after tweets were posted from Mr Khan’s account criticising government officials and the establishment.Earlier, on Tuesday, the same team had visited the Adiala Jail to investigate the PTI founder regarding the ope­ration of his social media account. Plea for conjugal rights Separately, A petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court seeking permission for the former premier Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi to exercise their conjugal rights, while confined in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. The petition, submitted under Article 199 of the Constitution, was filed by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and a supporter of Mr Khan. The respondents named in the petition include the Chief Commis­sioner Islamabad, the Punjab government, the Inspector General of Prisons Punjab, and the Superin­tendent of Central Jail Adiala. The petitioner argued that denying conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous court rulings. The plea referred to the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Conv­e­n­­tion on Human Rights, all of which safeguard the right to family life. It also cited a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh home department following Sup­reme Court directions, which allo­w­­ed convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. It furt­h­­er relied on the Federal Shariat Co­­urt’s landmark judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement. It requested the IHC to order the implementation of SC and Federal Shariat Court directives. A police spokesperson said that security will be beefed up around the ATC Rawalpindi on Friday during hearing of GHQ attack case, in which the PTI founder is set to attend the proceeding via video link.

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Thursday said the entry of other Arab nations in the mutual defence deal between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia was not ruled out, saying the “doors are not closed” for such developments. Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement , under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday. Talking more about the deal in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ and whether more Arab nations could become part of it, Asif said: “I cannot prematurely answer this, but I will definitely say the doors are not closed.” Asif said he had always called for a similar arrangement like Nato since there was greater vulnerability for Pakistan, pointing to the history of the region in the last 40-50 years. “I think it is a fundamental right of the countries and people here, particularly the Muslim population, to together defend their region, countries and nations.” He said there was no clause in the agreement that ruled out the entry of any other nation or that Pakistan could not sign a similar agreement with anyone else. Asked about whether Pakistan’s nuclear assets were also up for use under the agreement, Asif said: “What we have, our capabilities, will absolutely be available under this pact. But let me say, since Pakistan has become a nuclear state, never has anyone challenged our status of being a responsible nuclear power .” Asif said Pakistan had always offered its nuclear facilities for inspection and never committed any violation. He added that this is in contrast to Israel, which had not allowed any inspection. Questioned about whether any attack on one country would lead to the involvement of the other and vice versa, the minister said: “Yes, absolutely. There is no doubt in this.” He said neither Pakistan nor Saudi Arabia had named or conditioned the implementation of the defence deal with any specific country. “It is an umbrella that has been provided by both sides, that, if there is aggression against any side from any side, it will be jointly defended against and responded to.” Asif clarified it was not an “aggressive pact” but a defensive arrangement, similar to that of Nato. He added that Pakistan had also been involved in training Saudi forces for quite a while and the recent development was only a formalised “extension” of all that, adding that it was a positive thing. “If there is aggression, whether against Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, we will jointly defend against it.” He said Pakistan had always had talks on the issue with Saudi Arabia, saying the former had always had a large military and air force contingent present in the latter for many decades. “I think that [pre-existing] relationship has been more defined now and that understanding has been given the form of a defence agreement. This is embedded in the history of our military cooperation and our brotherly relationship with Saudi Arabia.” Asif also said the protection of the holy Islamic sites in Saudi Arabia was also a matter of a “sacred duty” for Pakistan. Questioned about whether the United States was taken into confidence on the matter, Asif said he felt there was no ground or justification for any other third party to be involved in the development. “This agreement will not be a hegemonic arrangement but a defensive arrangement … we don’t have any plans to conquer territory or attack anyone. But our fundamental right can’t be denied to us and we exercised that yesterday.” He reiterated that Pakistan could also pursue similar arrangements with other countries. ‘Afghanistan is a hostile country’ To a question about terrorist attacks on security forces, Asif reiterated that Afghan soil is being used to stage acts of terrorism in Pakistan. “We were swept into two wars in Afghanistan. The US, on both occasions, left the region and we are still dealing with the consequences, be it the Taliban, the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan), the BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) or anyone else,” Asif said, referring to the Soviet-Afghan War of the 1980s and the US-led International Security Assistance Force mission after 2001. “People embrace martyrdom daily; this liability emerged due to those two wars,” he added. “The Kabul government is not innocent in this, I am being categorical. Through these people, we are being blackmailed by them. “I say with no ambiguity: Afghanistan is a hostile country.” The defence minister added that Afghanistan was the last country to recognise Pakistan and that discussions on terrorism went nowhere. When asked if Arab states would act in response to Afghan aggression, Asif encouraged it. “I would not be against it, but how many times have we been there? They are involved in our politics as well, with a party I will not name,” he stated. “This party advocates for these people who have our children’s blood on their hands. “This is a subject Pakistan should be clear on, and we are very clear.” Defence deal According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”. “[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details. Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure , when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram. In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms. In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges. The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella, though finer details of the agreement were not made public. For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider. For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting the Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time. Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with China , Turkiye and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses. Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.",

      "title_orig": "Trump says US seeking control of Bagram air base given up in Afghanistan withdrawal",
      "summary_orig": "The United States is trying to get Bagram air base in Afghanistan back, President Donald Trump said on Thursday during a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump is on an official state visit to the UK — his second state trip to Britain — where he signed a technology agreement with Starmer earlier today. “We’re trying to get it back,” Trump said, referring to Bagram. “It’s one of the biggest airbases in the world; we gave it to them for nothing. We’re trying to get it back. “One of the reasons we want the base, as you know, is it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.” Bagram Air Base served as the linchpin for US operations in the rugged country, where the long war against the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies was fought with air strikes and resupply missions from the airfield. The historic Soviet-built airstrip was the main base for American forces in Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, attacks, up until their 2021 withdrawal , which led to a takeover by the Afghan Taliban. In July 2021, all US and Nato troops left Afghanistan’s biggest air base, signalling the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the country after two decades of war. A week after the US withdrawal, Bagram buzzed again with activity as Afghan forces settled into the vast premises, complete with its runways, barracks, control towers and hospital. Trump, Starmer sign tech deal to seal ‘unbreakable bond’ Before the joint presser, Trump and Starmer signed a huge tech deal, which the British PM hailed as “the biggest investment package of its kind in British history by a country mile”. Britain’s work in wooing the unpredictable Trump on his second state visit seemed to have paid off as he and Starmer signed the partnership, boosting ties in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy. Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer (R) and US President Donald Trump (L) shake hands as the pair sign a tech deal at Chequers, in Aylesbury, central England, on September 18. — AFP Trump said the deal was “very big”, and added of US relations with key Nato ally Britain that, “It’s an unbreakable bond we have regardless of what we’re doing today.” The deal comes on the back of pledges of £150 billion ($205bn) of investment into the UK from American giants, including Microsoft, Google and Blackstone. Trump disagrees with UK on recognising Palestinian state Continuing the press conference, Trump said he disagreed with Starmer over recognising a Palestinian state, speaking following their bilateral meeting. “I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score, one of our few disagreements, actually,” Trump said in response to a question during the press conference. Meanwhile, Starmer said he and Trump agreed on the ultimate aim of peace in the region. “We absolutely agree on the need for peace and a road map, because the situation in Gaza is intolerable,” he said. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a press conference at Chequers in Aylesbury, England on September 18. — Reuters When pressed about reports he was waiting for Trump to leave the country before formally recognising a Palestinian state this weekend, Starmer said: “I made my position clear at the end of July as to the timing, which has got nothing to do with this state visit. “I’ve discussed it with the president, as you would expect, amongst two leaders who respect each other and like each other and want to bring about a better solution in the best way that we can,” he added.",

      "summary_en": "The United States is trying to get Bagram air base in Afghanistan back, President Donald Trump said on Thursday during a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump is on an official state visit to the UK — his second state trip to Britain — where he signed a technology agreement with Starmer earlier today. “We’re trying to get it back,” Trump said, referring to Bagram. “It’s one of the biggest airbases in the world; we gave it to them for nothing. We’re trying to get it back. “One of the reasons we want the base, as you know, is it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.” Bagram Air Base served as the linchpin for US operations in the rugged country, where the long war against the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies was fought with air strikes and resupply missions from the airfield. The historic Soviet-built airstrip was the main base for American forces in Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, attacks, up until their 2021 withdrawal , which led to a takeover by the Afghan Taliban. In July 2021, all US and Nato troops left Afghanistan’s biggest air base, signalling the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the country after two decades of war. A week after the US withdrawal, Bagram buzzed again with activity as Afghan forces settled into the vast premises, complete with its runways, barracks, control towers and hospital. Trump, Starmer sign tech deal to seal ‘unbreakable bond’ Before the joint presser, Trump and Starmer signed a huge tech deal, which the British PM hailed as “the biggest investment package of its kind in British history by a country mile”. Britain’s work in wooing the unpredictable Trump on his second state visit seemed to have paid off as he and Starmer signed the partnership, boosting ties in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy. Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer (R) and US President Donald Trump (L) shake hands as the pair sign a tech deal at Chequers, in Aylesbury, central England, on September 18. — AFP Trump said the deal was “very big”, and added of US relations with key Nato ally Britain that, “It’s an unbreakable bond we have regardless of what we’re doing today.” The deal comes on the back of pledges of £150 billion ($205bn) of investment into the UK from American giants, including Microsoft, Google and Blackstone. Trump disagrees with UK on recognising Palestinian state Continuing the press conference, Trump said he disagreed with Starmer over recognising a Palestinian state, speaking following their bilateral meeting. “I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score, one of our few disagreements, actually,” Trump said in response to a question during the press conference. Meanwhile, Starmer said he and Trump agreed on the ultimate aim of peace in the region. “We absolutely agree on the need for peace and a road map, because the situation in Gaza is intolerable,” he said. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a press conference at Chequers in Aylesbury, England on September 18. — Reuters When pressed about reports he was waiting for Trump to leave the country before formally recognising a Palestinian state this weekend, Starmer said: “I made my position clear at the end of July as to the timing, which has got nothing to do with this state visit. “I’ve discussed it with the president, as you would expect, amongst two leaders who respect each other and like each other and want to bring about a better solution in the best way that we can,” he added.",

      "summary_orig": "Fresh witness statements have come to light in relation to the Toshakhana-2 case on a Bulgari jewellery set against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, alleging that the appraiser was pressured into undervaluing the ornaments. The development comes three days after a special judge central completed the cross-examination of the two key witnesses, an appraiser named Sohaib Abbasi and the former prime minister’s personal secretary, Inamullah Shah, in an over six-hour-long proceeding inside Adiala Jail. The case pertains to Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi retaining an expensive Bulgari jewellery set gifted by the Saudi royal family — including a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings — at a low price, causing significant loss to the exchequer. One of the witnesses, Sohaib Abbasi, confessed to undervaluing the Bulgari set at Rs5 million. He did so under the pressure of Imran Khan’s former personal secretary, Inamullah Shah, he claimed. Shah is the other key witness who has testified in the case. In his testimony, Abbasi said that he was “handed over the responsibility of the assessment of the set on May 25, 2022 by the Section Officer of [the] Cabinet Division.” Abbasi went on to say that Shah visited him and told him “that the two accused facing trial want to retain the jewellery set”, demanding that the assessment should be upto Rs5m. Abbasi alleged that he was told by Shah that he would be blacklisted from every government department if he refused to cooperate, so he undervalued the jewellery set and submitted a false report. Abbasi said that he joined the investigation on May 23, 2024 and requested a pardon in the case for undervaluing the jewellery set. Shah confirmed the allegation, stating that, “I asked Sohaib Abbasi to make [an] undervalued assessment (of the set) and he agreed to that,” adding that he remained in Abbasi’s office for 30-45 minutes during his visit for the jewellery set under question. The copies of both testimonies are available with Dawn.com. Shah also told the court that he was receiving double salaries while working for PTI and the government at the same time. In his testimony, he said, “I was appointed Comptroller of the PM house [from] 2019 to 2021,” but then Shah reveals that, “In that very time, I was also receiving salary additionally from PTI Central Secretariat.” As per Shah’s testimony, he was removed from his post in the same year, not because of receiving double salary, but “due to Bushra Bibi’s disapproval”. Shah believed that Bushra Bibi suspected Shah’s brother of having close ties with former PTI leader Jahangir Tareen. In July last year, an Islamabad court prohibited the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from pursuing the Toshakhana reference against Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, transferring the case to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) court. The case was transferred to a Special Judge Central, who will also decide on Imran and Bushra Bibi’s bail applications. Imran Khan, imprisoned since August 2023, is currently serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case, along with his wife. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.",

      "title_orig": "India says analysing ‘implications’ of Pak-Saudi mutual defence pact for national security",
      "summary_orig": "India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Thursday that it was analysing the “implications” of the recent mutual defence deal between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia for its own national security. Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday. A military confrontation between India and Pakistan recently occurred in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians . Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities. In a statement issued on today’s development, the Indian MEA said: “We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability. The government remains committed to protecting India’s national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains.” It added that the Indian government was already aware that the development, which it said “formalises a long-standing arrangement between the two countries”, was under consideration. Pakistan and India have fought three major wars since the two countries were carved out of British colonial India in 1947. After they both acquired nuclear weapons in the late 1990s, their conflicts have been more limited in scale because of the danger of nuclear assets coming into play. According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”. “[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details. Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure , when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram. In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms. In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges. The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella, though finer details of the agreement were not made public. For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider. For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting the Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time. Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkiye and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses. Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan captain Salman Agha said his team were ready to face India in the next round of the Asia Cup on Sunday after last week’s group-stage match between the arch-rivals ended in acrimony when the Indian side refused to shake hands. Pakistan beat United Arab Emirates in their final Group A game on Wednesday to advance to the Super Fours stage, where they will also play two teams from Group B in a round robin format. Bilateral cricket between India and Pakistan has been suspended since 2013, and they play each other only in multi-team tournaments. “We are ready, we are ready for any challenge,” Salman said after their 41-run victory against UAE. “We just want to play good cricket. If we play good cricket, like we have played in the last few months, I think we’ll be good against any side.” Fakhar Zaman made 50, but Pakistan’s frontline batters disappointed against the UAE’s modest attack, with opener Saim Ayub falling for his third successive duck in the tournament. Salman acknowledged they had to bat better. “We got the job done, but we still need to improve our batting in the middle order,” Salman said. “That’s been a concern and something we need to work on.” India had cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Pakistan last weekend in the first cricket match between the sides since a four-day military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end. India skipper Suryakumar Yadav dedicated their victory to the armed forces back home, which was seen as politicisation of the game. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match. The matter was settled after the PCB said ahead of yesterday’s match that Pycroft had apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts over a controversy during the recent Pakistan-India match. India and Pakistan could meet for a third time at the tournament if they both reach the September 28 final.",
