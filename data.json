In its National Defense Strategy (NDS), the Pentagon also said that the shift \"in the balance of responsibility\" is consistent with America's interest in updating U.S. force posture in Korea, as it seeks to \"modernize\" the Seoul-Washington alliance to focus more on deterring growing threats from its top strategic rival, China.

      "summary_orig": "ALTHOUGH the primary function of any government, whether elected or not, is to govern effectively and provide services and development to the people, a great deal of politics is involved in the process, especially if it is an elected dispensation. Striking a balance between politics and effective governance is one of the foremost challenges of contemporary democracies. Elected governments are expected to provide better governance as they supposedly have greater awareness of people’s needs and preferences and are accountable to citizens. In reality, many democratic countries, mostly in the developing world but now increasingly among the developed countries too, consider populism and emotive slogans appealing to religious, ethnic, provincial or national sensitivities to be a more effective strategy for electoral victory. Pakistan has hardly seen an election where serious governance matters became poll issues. In most cases, one emotive issue or the other became the decisive factor in elections. For example, in the 1970 election, claims of exploitation of the resources of the then East Pakistan had inflamed the political climate, and the people of East Pakistan overwhelmingly voted for Sheikh Mujib who championed their rights. The 1988 election was contested in the tragic aftermath of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s execution and the PPP won while riding on a sympathy wave. The 2008 election took place against the backdrop of Benazir Bhutto’s assassination the previous year, and it was no surprise that the PPP won the election. The 2024 election was held when PTI chairman Imran Khan was in prison and his party was deprived of the right to contest elections on a common election symbol. The resultant resurgence of a sympathy wave for the PTI led to its supported candidates securing the highest share of votes and seats in the National Assembly. Against this backdrop of repeated emotive poll campaigns, in which good governance remained effectively absent as an election issue, there was hardly any incentive for political parties to provide good governance and real development. Most of the development which took place was in the form of grand, flashy, highly visible and expensive projects , which could be completed within a short span of two to three years so that the government could take its credit before an election. The political governments, which focused relatively more on better governance and long-term development, generally failed to impress the voters as highly emotive narratives dominated the election campaigns. In a normal democracy and stable political environment, political parties should be contesting elections on the basis of their record of providing good governance and by proposing robust plans with financing strategies — not just wish lists — to resolve governance-related bottlenecks. Political parties generally do not see the benefit in putting so much time and effort into serious work, while emotive slogans and their effective use through the mainstream and social media, with some blessings from the intelligence agencies, can do the trick and they can come to power. One emotive issue or the other has been the decisive factor in elections. Given this background, it was gratifying to see that the present provincial and federal governments are shifting their focus to projecting their performance in governance and development through statistics. The PPP organised a well-attended roadshow in January in Islamabad, showcasing its performance in Sindh with party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari personally leading the effort. Hardly a fortnight goes by when the Punjab government is not launching new initiatives to address chronic governance issues. It has launched an effective garbage collection project and anti-encroachment campaign throughout the province, with even political opponents acknowledging the impact on the ground. Although it has been suspended by the court, a highly popular new law has been passed by the province to speedily end illegal occupation of immovable property in its effort to solve one of the most complex and torturous problems facing the people. DG ISPR recently acknowledged the efforts in promoting grassroots development by the Balochistan government. These include the formation of district development committees through which Rs1 billion (to be increased to Rs3bn in the next financial year) is being spent in each district in close consultation with the people of each district. In addition, the provincial government has ended the decades-old policing duality by integrating tribal levies into the regular police force. Although the KP chief minister is charged with the responsibility of organising street protests across Pakistan for the release of his party’s founder Imran Khan and has been spending much time visiting other provinces and undertaking many such activities which must be distracting him from his primary duties of governing, he has lately started devoting time to law and order, education and healthcare issues. The provincial government may have to devote more time and effort to governance as the people may demand a resolution of their problems. It is inappropriate to entrust a chief minister with the task of organising street protests; this should have been the responsibility of party officials. Generally, political parties do not prepare their officials for performing governance roles in case they come to power. Politicians are well-versed in organising political rallies, street protests, election campaigns, etc. They are hardly exposed to any orientation in governance until their party comes to power and they have to dive headlong into governance roles as ministers, chief ministers and prime ministers. In such a situation, the performance of individuals and the government is generally disappointing. A case in point is the PTI federal government from 2018 to 2022; Imran Khan had to acknowledge that the party was not ready for governance. It is important that political parties organise formal briefings and training for their officials. This is another reason why the local government tier is made effective so that political workers and officials learn their way up the governance ladder.

      "summary_orig": "IN the aftermath of the Gul Plaza fire, a war of words has erupted between the MQM and PPP over the poor state of civic affairs in Karachi, with the two federal coalition partners blaming each other for the decrepit condition of the megacity. In a presser on Thursday, the MQM claimed the PPP, which rules Sindh, was responsible for “chronic misgovernance” in Karachi, holding the party responsible for Gul Plaza and similar past disasters. The PPP replied in the same coin, with the Sindh information minister referring to the MQM’s past — and not entirely unearned — reputation for political violence. In a strange solution to the city’s urban woes, Federal Health Minister Mustafa Kamal, a former mayor of the city, called for placing Karachi under federal control. This is a very bad idea. It goes against the spirit of devolution as envisaged in the 18th Amendment, and can lead to ethnic strife in Sindh. Moreover, one can also question how efficiently the entities the centre currently controls are performing. The fact is that by engaging in mudslinging, both the MQM and PPP are deflecting attention from the real question: what ails Karachi and who is responsible? It would not be wrong to say that all parties, at the centre and the provincial level, including the MQM and PPP, are responsible for the city’s plight. Parties that have ruled at the centre, such as the PML-N and PTI, seem hardly interested in the Sindh capital’s future, with the former not having a major vote bank in the city, while the latter ignored Karachi despite bagging the majority of the metropolis’s National Assembly seats in 2018. As for the PPP, despite ruling Sindh for nearly two decades, its attempts to fix Karachi’s issues are cosmetic at best and negligence at worst. The MQM, which in the past enjoyed unparalleled power in Karachi, ‘gifted’ the city extortion, strikes and land-grabs (also known as ‘china cutting’). Hence the MQM criticising the PPP, or vice versa, is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Instead of unwise schemes such as making Karachi a federal territory, the solution lies in better and more responsive local government. Here the PPP has indeed blocked attempts at reforming the LG law in such a way that the third tier would become fully empowered. Instead, provincial ministers and bureaucrats still cling to what should be purely local powers. Even the ADB, in a 2024 report, has noted that “the devolution of funds and functionaries to the city has been poor”. This must change. Instead of dragging each other through the mud, the PPP, MQM and other parties interested in Karachi’s welfare must reform the LG law so that the city can become a more liveable place.

Instead, provincial ministers and bureaucrats still cling to what should be purely local powers. Even the ADB, in a 2024 report, has noted that “the devolution of funds and functionaries to the city has been poor”. This must change. Instead of dragging each other through the mud, the PPP, MQM and other parties interested in Karachi’s welfare must reform the LG law so that the city can become a more liveable place.

      "summary_orig": "UNDER normal circumstances, the journey from Bagh Markaz in Tirah to Bara — on the outskirts of Peshawar — should take no more than three to four hours. But ever since the authorities asked the people of Tirah to evacuate their homes — in preparation for an operation against terrorist elements who have infiltrated the area — this 110km route is taking several days to navigate. Although the northern parts of the country are in the grip of a severe cold spell , bringing with it rain and snow, this is not all that is holding up traffic on Bara Road. Families leaving the valley have to first register themselves with the authorities at Bara Markaz. From there, they must make their way to Dwa Thoye, where the road forks — with Peshawar in one direction and Afghanistan in the other. Here, they are supposed to be reimbursed for their transportation costs. After completing this stage, evacuees must then trek to Paindi Cheena and Mandi Kas. Here, they are given mobile phone SIMs and the official grant promised to displaced households. Inclement weather not the only hurdle, as authorities struggle to facilitate the smooth registration and movement of those who have left their homes According to those who have been through this lengthy process, the hold-up and long queues at these points are massively delaying their journey — amid inclement weather — to the relative calmer climes of Bara, where most Tirah residents already have winter homes. Unlike previous displacements carried out ahead of military action in these areas from 2008 to 2012, no camps have been set up for the internally displaced. This time, only those living in Tirah are being uprooted, and since most of the around 30,000 households in this area already have alternative lodgings near Peshawar, most are either staying at their own places, or with their extended families. But as Nazir Jan explains, the 110km journey from Bagh Maidan to Bara was nothing short of a nightmare for his family. The majority of people left their homes in haste, and faced immense hardships during the long wait to register themselves. Perhaps authorities did not anticipate the scale of the displacement that would come once military action was announced in the area. Although some families were reluctant to leave their homes, the sudden exodus from the valley has severely taxed authorities’ ability to ensure the smooth registration of those leaving. The bad weather hasn’t made things any easier, forcing authorities to repeatedly change plans and locations of registration and biometric verification centers in order to control the unruly ever-restless crowds that gather at these points. On a number of occasions, large groups of dissatisfied people have also blocked the roads and ransacked registration booths; since everyone wants their family to be registered as quickly as possible so they can move on towards their destinations, rather than wait in the open amid freezing temperatures. As of Thursday, however, the evacuation of families from Tirah was fully suspended, and authorities focused instead on clearing the backlog of families still stranded on the roads. Although the deadline for evacuating their areas was earlier set at Jan 25, the latest statement issued by Khyber House a day earlier said that the process of evacuation and registration would only restart after the weather improved. Resistance Residents of the restive Tirah Valley, which borders Afghanistan, have been holding out for quite some time. The authorities had demanded that they should either ask the militants to leave their area, take up arms against the intruders themselves, or simply leave their homes so the forces can move in to flush out the unwelcome visitors. The outlaws refused to leave and the locals were reluctant to take up arms. It was a fait accompli; they eventually had to agree to pack up their belongings and reluctantly leave the picturesque valley for the third time since 2015. The decision was not easy. Most of the inhabitants of Tirah had barely finished piecing their lives together, rebuilding their homes and lives after the last military operation. Although the government came to their help, initiating projects to improve their lives, the respite was short-lived. In 2022, locals found armed men roaming freely in their fields and knocking at their doors, seeking “food and shelter”. “We got struck between the devil and the deep sea,” Nazir Jan tells us while waiting in queue at the dusty Mandi Kas center to collect his transport fare. The miscreants had already started asserting themselves by intensifying attacks on security forces, demanding tax on agriculture produce from poppy and hemp crops, while also establishing parallel courts in some localities. In the words of Peer Mela resident Noor Habib, none of the nearly 20,000 families who reside in the valley were willing to leave their houses.

      "title_orig": "War in Gaza weakened Arab states, emboldened Israel, says Vali Nasr",
      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Iranian-American academic and political scientist Vali Nasr suggested on Friday that the war on Palestine had politically weakened Arab states and emboldened Israeli leaders, to the point that the latter had abandoned the two-state framework entirely. Speaking at a session titled ‘The Gaza War and the Remaking of the Middle East’, moderated by journalist Najam Sethi, Mr Nasr implied that the situation has proven detrimental to the Palestinian cause. He said Israel now believes it can pursue its objectives primarily through force. “With Arab states politically neutralised, Israeli leaders see little incentive to return to negotiations,” he added. According to him, Israeli leadership now views political compromise with the Palestinians as a security liability rather than a pathway to stability, effectively abandoning the two-state framework. Following the Gaza war, Israel moved against Hezbollah in Lebanon, significantly weakening the group’s operational capacity. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024 further altered the regional balance. Scholar notes Pakistan currently enjoying ‘diplomatic honeymoon’ with Washington, which won’t last for long Hamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian government, long aligned with Iran and regarded as part of the so-called “axis of resistance”, were effectively dismantled. “With this strategic buffer around Israel gone, Israeli policymakers believed they could confront Iran more directly,” the political scientist said, referring to Israeli-US military strikes on Iran in October 2024. He said Arab states have also seen their influence in regional affairs diminish, leaving them increasingly sidelined. Israel, Mr Nasr argued, has concluded that military strength is now its primary guarantee of security. As Iran’s regional influence declined, Arab and Muslim countries reassessed Tehran’s strategic importance as a symbol, pillar, and financier of resistance. “Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey moved to restore and strengthen ties with Iran, recognising its symbolic and geopolitical counterweight to Israel,” he said. Mr Nasr also said the events of Oct 7, 2023 marked a turning point that reshaped regional politics and power dynamics. “In many ways, everything in the Middle East changed on that day,” he said. Until then, he explained, US strategy in the region centred on normalising Saudi-Israeli relations, expanding the Abraham Accords, building regional trade corridors, and linking Middle Eastern economies with Europe and India while bypassing China. “The events of October 7 pushed the Palestinian issue, which the US and many regional allies had put on the back burner, back to the centre of global attention,” Mr Nasr said, adding that Israel’s security doctrine has since undergone a fundamental shift. He also criticised the “ Board of Peace ” initiative announced by US President Donald Trump, calling it ineffective because it excludes Palestinians. According to Mr Nasr, several participating countries joined mainly to maintain favourable relations with Trump rather than to advance a genuine peace process. Despite the shifting landscape, the political scientist said key questions remain unresolved. “The future of Gaza is still unclear. There are also uncertainties surrounding the role of a potential Pakistan-Saudi defence partnership and how Iran and Turkey will manage their competing interests in Syria,” he said. However, he concluded that the regional balance of power has already undergone a historic shift. “The Middle East has entered a new phase, and this transformation may well be permanent,” he said. ‘Diplomatic honeymoon’ In a separate discussion, titled ‘Pakistan: Between the USA and China’, Mr Nasr argued against the view that China’s rise is irreversible and America’s decline is inevitable, advising middle powers such as Pakistan to focus on strengthening their own technological and economic foundations. Sharing the stage with former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and journalist Raza Rumi, Mr Nasr described Pakistan’s current relationship with Washington as a diplomatic “honeymoon”, which had so far helped shield Islamabad from difficult questions regarding its strategic ties with China and its defence cooperation with Saudi Arabia. “This relationship has also helped Pakistan avoid scrutiny over its conflict with India, largely because it played its diplomatic cards well,” he said. Noting that Pakistan had also benefited from the recent strain in US-India ties, Mr Nasr cautioned that this favourable phase may not last long. “The United States effectively has two centres of power — one represented by the White House and the other by permanent institutions such as the State Department and the Pentagon,” he said. “Pakistan is currently engaging mainly with the White House and benefiting from it, but the institutional system is likely to reassert itself and reopen uncomfortable discussions.” Ms Khar largely agreed with Nasr’s assessment, and called for Pakistan to deepen its alignment with China — which she described as more predictable and consistent in its diplomacy — while maintaining constructive relations with the United States. “The US remains a global superpower and Pakistan must remain on the right side of Washington,” she said, but warned policymakers not to assume that this situation would last.

The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024 further altered the regional balance. Scholar notes Pakistan currently enjoying ‘diplomatic honeymoon’ with Washington, which won’t last for long Hamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian government, long aligned with Iran and regarded as part of the so-called “axis of resistance”, were effectively dismantled. “With this strategic buffer around Israel gone, Israeli policymakers believed they could confront Iran more directly,” the political scientist said, referring to Israeli-US military strikes on Iran in October 2024. He said Arab states have also seen their influence in regional affairs diminish, leaving them increasingly sidelined. Israel, Mr Nasr argued, has concluded that military strength is now its primary guarantee of security. As Iran’s regional influence declined, Arab and Muslim countries reassessed Tehran’s strategic importance as a symbol, pillar, and financier of resistance. “Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey moved to restore and strengthen ties with Iran, recognising its symbolic and geopolitical counterweight to Israel,” he said. Mr Nasr also said the events of Oct 7, 2023 marked a turning point that reshaped regional politics and power dynamics. “In many ways, everything in the Middle East changed on that day,” he said. Until then, he explained, US strategy in the region centred on normalising Saudi-Israeli relations, expanding the Abraham Accords, building regional trade corridors, and linking Middle Eastern economies with Europe and India while bypassing China. “The events of October 7 pushed the Palestinian issue, which the US and many regional allies had put on the back burner, back to the centre of global attention,” Mr Nasr said, adding that Israel’s security doctrine has since undergone a fundamental shift. He also criticised the “ Board of Peace ” initiative announced by US President Donald Trump, calling it ineffective because it excludes Palestinians. According to Mr Nasr, several participating countries joined mainly to maintain favourable relations with Trump rather than to advance a genuine peace process. Despite the shifting landscape, the political scientist said key questions remain unresolved. “The future of Gaza is still unclear. There are also uncertainties surrounding the role of a potential Pakistan-Saudi defence partnership and how Iran and Turkey will manage their competing interests in Syria,” he said. However, he concluded that the regional balance of power has already undergone a historic shift. “The Middle East has entered a new phase, and this transformation may well be permanent,” he said. ‘Diplomatic honeymoon’ In a separate discussion, titled ‘Pakistan: Between the USA and China’, Mr Nasr argued against the view that China’s rise is irreversible and America’s decline is inevitable, advising middle powers such as Pakistan to focus on strengthening their own technological and economic foundations. Sharing the stage with former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and journalist Raza Rumi, Mr Nasr described Pakistan’s current relationship with Washington as a diplomatic “honeymoon”, which had so far helped shield Islamabad from difficult questions regarding its strategic ties with China and its defence cooperation with Saudi Arabia. “This relationship has also helped Pakistan avoid scrutiny over its conflict with India, largely because it played its diplomatic cards well,” he said. Noting that Pakistan had also benefited from the recent strain in US-India ties, Mr Nasr cautioned that this favourable phase may not last long. “The United States effectively has two centres of power — one represented by the White House and the other by permanent institutions such as the State Department and the Pentagon,” he said. “Pakistan is currently engaging mainly with the White House and benefiting from it, but the institutional system is likely to reassert itself and reopen uncomfortable discussions.” Ms Khar largely agreed with Nasr’s assessment, and called for Pakistan to deepen its alignment with China — which she described as more predictable and consistent in its diplomacy — while maintaining constructive relations with the United States. “The US remains a global superpower and Pakistan must remain on the right side of Washington,” she said, but warned policymakers not to assume that this situation would last.

      "title": "War in Gaza weakened Arab states, emboldened Israel, says Vali Nasr",
      "summary": "LAHORE: Iranian-American academic and political scientist Vali Nasr suggested on Friday that the war on Palestine had politically weakened Arab states and emboldened Israeli leaders, to the point that the latter had abandoned the two-state framework entirely. Speaking at a session titled ‘The Gaza War and the Remaking of the Middle East’, moderated by journalist Najam Sethi, Mr Nasr implied that the situation has proven detrimental to the Palestinian cause. He said Israel now believes it can pursue its objectives primarily through force. “With Arab states politically neutralised, Israeli leaders see little incentive to return to negotiations,” he added. According to him, Israeli leadership now views political compromise with the Palestinians as a security liability rather than a pathway to stability, effectively abandoning the two-state framework. Following the Gaza war, Israel moved against Hezbollah in Lebanon, significantly weakening the group’s operational capacity.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan and Somalia agreed on Friday to strengthen collaboration in training, border management, disaster management and the adoption of a joint strategy against terrorism to deepen cooperation in internal security. The agreement was reac­hed as Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met a high-level Somali delegation led by Somalia’s Interior Minister Ali Yusuf at the Ministry of Interior. During the meeting, Mr Naqvi announced visa facilitation for Somali citizens tra­velling to Pakistan for medical treatment and education. Mr Naqvi assured his cou­nterpart of Pakistan’s full su­­pport to Somalia in policing and counterterrorism. He said Pakistan would extend complete cooperation to So­­m­­alia across multiple sectors. Mr Yusuf said his country was “facing a difficult situation and was actively fighting terrorists”. He expressed hope that the visit would expand bilateral relations between the two countries. Mr Yusuf expressed a str­ong desire to benefit from Pa­­kistan’s experience, noting that Naqvi’s initiatives for Islamabad’s infrastructure development were commendable. Both ministers stressed the need for impro­ved coordination to advance shared interests in various sectors. The Somali interior minister formally invited Mr Naqvi to visit Somalia and delivered a special message from the prime minister of Somalia for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

The agreement was reac­hed as Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met a high-level Somali delegation led by Somalia’s Interior Minister Ali Yusuf at the Ministry of Interior. During the meeting, Mr Naqvi announced visa facilitation for Somali citizens tra­velling to Pakistan for medical treatment and education.

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least five people were killed while 10 others were injured in a suicide attack at the residence of a peace committee member near Qureshi Morr on Friday night, according to officials. According to Dera Ismail Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada, the explosion occurred during a wedding celebration at the residence of the peace committee chief, identified as Noor Alam Mehsud. The participants were reportedly dancing to the beat of a drum when the attack was carried out. The blast caused the room’s roof to collapse, hampering rescue operations and making it difficult to reach those trapped under the debris. “The explosion was a suicide blast,” the DPO told Dawn . He said that an emergency had been imposed at the District Headquarter Hospital. In a statement, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said five bodies and 10 injured had been taken to the hospital. He said that seven ambulances, a fire vehicle and a disaster vehicle reached the site of the incident soon after it was reported, adding that a rescue operation was under way. Authorities cordoned off the area and launched an investigation into the incident. Initial reports said peace committee leader Waheedullah Mehsud alias Jigri Mehsud was among the dead. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi strongly condemned the blast and sought a report from the KP inspector general of police. According to a statement, he also directed law enforcement agencies to investigate the incident and identify those responsible. He said the responsible parties would be brought to justice. “The provincial government shares the grief of the martyrs’ families. All possible assistance will be provided,” he said. Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report into the incident, according to a statement from his office. “All possible medical assistance should be provided to the injured in the Dera blast,” he was quoted as saying, expressing grief over the incident. Earlier this month, armed assailants had killed four members of a peace committee in KP’s Bannu district. In November 2025, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked , also in KP’s Bannu district. Police officials told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Talib’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives. Additional input from Manzoor Ali",

      "summary_orig": "Outrage grew on Friday over the detention of a five-year-old boy in a massive immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, as US Vice President JD Vance defended the roundups by federal agents, prompting calls for a general strike. The superintendent of Columbia Heights Public Schools, where Ramos was a pre-school student, said the child and his Ecuadoran father, Adrian Conejo Arias, who were asylum seekers were taken from their driveway as they arrived home. Ramos was then used as “bait” by immigration officers to knock on the door of his home to draw out those inside, Zena Stenvik added. Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city, as US President Donald Trump presses his campaign to deport illegal immigrants across the country. Vance confirmed on Thursday that the five-year-old boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, was among those detained, but argued that agents were protecting him after his father “ran” from an immigration sweep. “What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?” he said. The UN rights chief Volker Turk called on US authorities to end the “dehumanising portrayal and harmful treatment of migrants and refugees”. Democratic congressman Joaquin Castro, whose constituency includes a San Antonio ICE detention centre to which it was thought Ramos was taken, rejected Vance’s explanation for Ramos’ arrest, branding authorities “sick liars.” “My staff and I have been trying to figure out his whereabouts, make sure he’s safe, and also to demand his release by ICE,” he wrote on X. Ramos’ teacher, whose name was given as Ella, called him “a bright young student”. “His classmates miss him. He comes into class every day and just brightens the room. All I want is for him to be back here and safe,” she said in a statement on Wednesday. Calls for a day of action against ICE and a general strike have been gaining traction on social media, with a demonstration expected in downtown Minneapolis on Friday. ‘Children as pawns’ Former US vice president Kamala Harris said she was “outraged” by Ramos’s detention and called him “just a baby”, while former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton accused law enforcement of “using children as pawns”. Images have emerged online showing Ramos being escorted by a man wearing black clothes and a black face covering. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the federal government was treating children “like criminals”. The Homeland Security Department rejected claims ICE agents targeted Ramos, saying he was “abandoned” by his father during his arrest. “For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended (his father) Conejo Arias,” it posted on X. “Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates.” ‘Taking a toll’ Ramos is one of at least four children detained in the same Minneapolis school district this month, local administrators said. The children’s detention came as the US attorney general announced the arrests of three activists accused of disrupting a church service with a protest accusing a pastor of working for ICE. Videos of that protest showed dozens of demonstrators chanting “ICE out!” in the church. Minneapolis has been rocked by increasingly tense protests since federal agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good on January 7. The officer who fired the shots that killed Good, Jonathan Ross, has neither been suspended nor charged. Marc Prokosch, the lawyer for Ramos and his father, said they followed the law in applying for asylum in Minneapolis, which is a sanctuary city where police do not cooperate with federal immigration. Children have long been caught up in federal immigration enforcement, under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Vance claimed such local efforts were hindering ICE efforts. “The lack of cooperation between state and local officials makes it harder for us to do our job and turns up the temperature,” Vance said. Minnesota has sought a temporary restraining order for the ICE operation in the state, which, if granted by a federal judge, would pause the sweeps. There will be a hearing on the application on Monday.",

      "summary_orig": "A Spanish court has sentenced a Pakistani man to 36 years in jail for murdering three elderly siblings over debts reportedly linked to an online romance scam. A jury in October convicted Dilawar Hussain of killing the two sisters and their disabled brother in Morata de Tajuna, near Madrid, in December 2023. In November, a Madrid court sentenced Hussain to 12 years in jail for each murder, citing a “psychological alteration” as a mitigating factor, according to a copy of the ruling seen by AFP on Friday. Hussain has appealed the sentence. Hussain, 44, turned himself in to police and admitted the killings after the siblings’ partially burned bodies were found in their home. The siblings, who were in their 70s, had been beaten to death, possibly with an iron bar. When he took the stand at his trial, Hussain asked for forgiveness, saying he had “heard voices” and “was not in my right mind”. Neighbours told Spanish media the tragedy was linked to a fake online love affair, in which the two sisters believed they were in long-distance relationships with two US servicemen. They were led to believe one of the servicemen had died and that the other needed money to cover costs so he could send them a share of a multi-million-euro inheritance, causing the sisters to rack up significant debts. Hussain, who rented a room in the siblings’ house, lent the sisters some 60,000 euros ($70,000), which they never repaid, according to the court ruling. This prompted him to attack one of the sisters with a hammer in February 2023 — months before the fatal attack at the end of that year. He received a two-year prison sentence for the attack, but it was suspended because it was his first offence, as is customary under Spanish law. Hussain faces a separate trial for allegedly murdering his 39-year-old Bulgarian cellmate in February 2024 while in a Madrid prison awaiting trial for the siblings’ deaths.",

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER/ SHANGLA/ RAWALPINDI: Commuters and residents faced difficulties on Thursday as snow blanketed several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Murree. While a restriction was placed on the entry of vehicles into Murree, a rescue operation was under way in Tirah. Meanwhile, the Met Office said more rain and snowfall was expected in different areas from Sunday night till Tuesday under the influence of a westerly wave. Rescue efforts in Tirah Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Bilal Faizi said on Friday that a comprehensive rescue operation was ongoing to help the people affected by heavy snowfall in the province. “The operation is ongoing in Tirah valley, Painda Cheena, Dawatoi and Bagh Maidan on the directives of Rescue 1122 director general,” he said in a statement. “Twenty-three operational vehicles of Rescue 1122 and rescue teams comprising more than 100 personnel are taking part in the rescue operation,” he said. In an update at 5:30pm, Rescue 1122 said 50 stranded vehicles and around 100 affected people had been rescued in Tirah. “The affected people have been shifted to safer locations, and the rescue operation is ongoing,” the Rescue 1122 statement said. It should be mentioned that the residents of Tirah have been vacating their homes amid a planned military operation against militants in the restive valley. Hundreds of displaced families were stranded on the road on Thursday due to the prolonged registration process, which was suspended in the evening due to heavy snowfall that began in earlier in the day. A statement issued by the Khyber Deputy Commissioner’s (DC) office on Friday said efforts were underway under the directives of KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to shift internally displaced persons (IDPs) stranded due to recent snowfall to safe locations. “The stranded families were shifted to Painda Cheena School and hostel, and a consignment of relief goods was also delivered at the location during the night,” it said. The statement further said that all the families were provided with blankets, while children were given sweaters and other essential items. “Due to timely relief operations by the provincial government, Pakistan Army, Frontier Corps and the district administration, all families remained safe. All affected families were provided immediate relief,” the statement said. According to the DC office, relief activities continued from Nangrosa to Dawatoi and from Dawatoi to Bagh Maidan. “Under the supervision of Rescue 1122 teams, children and women were evacuated first, followed by men,” it said. Rescue and relief operations continued late into the night to ensure that all families could be rescued, the DC office said. On Thursday night, KP CM Afridi had highlighted that the people of Tirah were stranded in the snowfall due to the “forced evacuation”. “The district administration as well as the resources of the entire province are being used to help them. People are trapped in about three places,” he said. Afridi said some people were being transported to nearby homes as well as to areas designated by the district administration. He also said that contact could not be established with some people due to a lack of mobile signals and blocked roads. “I am personally monitoring all the rescue activities. All departments have been instructed to rescue people and provide relief,” he said. Shangla receives heavy snowfall Meanwhile, KP’s Shangla district received a heavy amoung of snowfall, blocking major roads, including the Karakoram Highway, and disrupting the power supply to most areas. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), snowfall was reported in most parts of the province’s north on Thursday night, which continued till Friday morning. It said the heavy snowfall caused the blockade of roads in various districts. However, efforts were underway to reopen the roads. Attaullah Khan, a resident of Kotkay, told Dawn that his village had received 17 inches of snow last night. He said residents were anticipating that this snow would resolve the water shortage in during the spring. “I remember this heavy and constant snow was received in our village years ago. We are totally dependent on snow because we use spring water which comes from the mountain tops,” Khan said. Bakht Alam Khan, the tehsil council chairman of Chakesar, said the community had been praying for snowfall. He said a prolonged snow drought had severely affected agriculture and worsened water shortages in the area. He said the road blockades due to the snowfall was temporary but would also help them fulfil their water needs. Shujat Ali Khan told Dawn that Bisham had last received snowfall in 2013. He said the weather had brought joy to the people, especially the children. Restriction on entry of vehicles into Murree Snowfall also started in Murree on Thursday evening, and a Met official told Dawn on Friday afternoon that some areas in the city had received up to two feet of snow until then. “Up to 14 inches of snow was recorded in the Sunny Bank area while Galliyat and areas in the north of the city experienced even more snowfall,” he said. Murree Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Shirazi told Dawn that a restriction had been placed on the entry of vehicles in the city in view of the weather situation. However, no road had been closed thus far, and tourists who had reached Murree earlier were getting around the city without any restriction. The district administration was monitoring the situation, he added. District Emergency Officer Kamran Rashid told Dawn that some vehicles got stuck at Chitta Mor and near Mussiaree on the Murree Expressway, but they had been rescued. 9 killed in avalanche in Lower Chitral Nine people were killed and a child was injured when a house was struck by an avalanche in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower Chitral district, according to a statement from Rescue 1122.

All affected families were provided immediate relief,” the statement said. According to the DC office, relief activities continued from Nangrosa to Dawatoi and from Dawatoi to Bagh Maidan. “Under the supervision of Rescue 1122 teams, children and women were evacuated first, followed by men,” it said. Rescue and relief operations continued late into the night to ensure that all families could be rescued, the DC office said. On Thursday night, KP CM Afridi had highlighted that the people of Tirah were stranded in the snowfall due to the “forced evacuation”. “The district administration as well as the resources of the entire province are being used to help them. People are trapped in about three places,” he said. Afridi said some people were being transported to nearby homes as well as to areas designated by the district administration. He also said that contact could not be established with some people due to a lack of mobile signals and blocked roads. “I am personally monitoring all the rescue activities. All departments have been instructed to rescue people and provide relief,” he said. Shangla receives heavy snowfall Meanwhile, KP’s Shangla district received a heavy amoung of snowfall, blocking major roads, including the Karakoram Highway, and disrupting the power supply to most areas. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), snowfall was reported in most parts of the province’s north on Thursday night, which continued till Friday morning. It said the heavy snowfall caused the blockade of roads in various districts. However, efforts were underway to reopen the roads. Attaullah Khan, a resident of Kotkay, told Dawn that his village had received 17 inches of snow last night. He said residents were anticipating that this snow would resolve the water shortage in during the spring. “I remember this heavy and constant snow was received in our village years ago. We are totally dependent on snow because we use spring water which comes from the mountain tops,” Khan said. Bakht Alam Khan, the tehsil council chairman of Chakesar, said the community had been praying for snowfall. He said a prolonged snow drought had severely affected agriculture and worsened water shortages in the area. He said the road blockades due to the snowfall was temporary but would also help them fulfil their water needs. Shujat Ali Khan told Dawn that Bisham had last received snowfall in 2013. He said the weather had brought joy to the people, especially the children. Restriction on entry of vehicles into Murree Snowfall also started in Murree on Thursday evening, and a Met official told Dawn on Friday afternoon that some areas in the city had received up to two feet of snow until then. “Up to 14 inches of snow was recorded in the Sunny Bank area while Galliyat and areas in the north of the city experienced even more snowfall,” he said. Murree Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Shirazi told Dawn that a restriction had been placed on the entry of vehicles in the city in view of the weather situation. However, no road had been closed thus far, and tourists who had reached Murree earlier were getting around the city without any restriction. The district administration was monitoring the situation, he added. District Emergency Officer Kamran Rashid told Dawn that some vehicles got stuck at Chitta Mor and near Mussiaree on the Murree Expressway, but they had been rescued. 9 killed in avalanche in Lower Chitral Nine people were killed and a child was injured when a house was struck by an avalanche in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower Chitral district, according to a statement from Rescue 1122.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday again defended its decision to join the Board of Peace led by US President Donald Trump, with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal saying that Pakistan being at the “centre stage” along with its brother Muslim countries to contribute towards peace in Gaza and Palestine was a “diplomatic win”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was among the leaders and senior officials of 19 countries, including Pakistan, who gathered in Davos on Thursday and put their names to the founding charter of the Board of Peace — a move that has been denounced by the opposition. Trump had originally proposed establishing the board when he announced his plan last September to end the onslaught in Gaza. It was originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year onslaught on the Palestinian enclave, but the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Thursday had defended the move in the National Assembly, saying the country joined the body meant to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding in the interest of the Palestinian people. The matter was again debated in a joint session of Parliament on Friday, summoned by President Asif Ali Zardari a day earlier, and presided over by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq. Arguing in defence of the government’s decision to join the board during the session, Iqbal said this “diplomatic win” should be celebrated. He began his speech by recalling nuclear tests by Pakistan in 1998. “We set an example of Pakistan’s liberty and sovereignty when the then-US president called five times […] Pakistan was being pressurised from the world, but we took the decision [to conduct the tests] with courage,” he said. Amid a noisy protest from the opposition benches, he asserted, “We don’t need to be taught about Pakistan’s defence and integrity. We are the defenders of Pakistan’s freedom and sovereignty.” He went on to state that with the PML-N in power, “there can be no danger to Pakistan’s integrity and sovereignty.” Iqbal said the government and armed forces had proved during a four-day conflict with India in May that anyone intending to harm the country would get a befitting reply. “So nobody can taunt that we are cowards and negligent.” The minister said it was very easy to deliver speeches on Palestine in the House, adding that “our hearts have been wounded by the cruelty” that had been witnessed in the Palestinian enclave. “But Muslim countries took a collective initiative to end that bloodshed,” he continued, further stating that the opposition was refusing to accept the “peace that the people of Palestine have celebrated”. He went on to say that had the government decided not to join the Board of Peace, opposition members would have been decrying that Pakistan had been not been given any importance, that it had been isolated. They would have questioned why Pakistan was not a part of that big an initiavtive of peace, Iqbal said. Listing other Muslim countries that joined the Board of Peace, Iqbal asked were they not Muslim countries and brother countries of Pakistan. “Have they joined [the Board of Peace] to contribute to the bloodshed of Muslims?” The minister said prominent Muslim countries were given a chance through this initiative to play their role for the rights of the people of Palestine and for peace in Palestine. He stressed that the government’s stance was the same as that of the people of Pakistan: “that Israel was an aggressor and a cruel country, which — Netanyahu has the blood of Muslims and Palestinians on his hands.” “Our moral stance has not changed at all,” he said, adding that the government decided to join the board on the basis of this stance. “So that we can play our role along with our brother countries for peace in Palestine.” He said that a major reason behind “the halt to bombardment” in Palestine was the role of eight Muslim countries that worked with the Trump administration on a ceasefire plan for Gaza. “And the people [of Palestine] accepted that ceasefire, and they appreciated that the ensuing peace gave them an opportunity to begin their lives anew,” he maintained. The minister added: “Our stance regarding Palestine is unchanged. We still believe that the state of Palestine is the right of the people of Palestine. Pakistan supported this in the past and, it supports it today as well.” Speaking before Iqbal, Senate Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas took exception to the government’s decision to join the Board of Peace without taking Parliament into confidence. “The board will further add to the miseries of the people of Palestine. What Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu could not do will begin in the name of Board of Peace,” he decried. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also voiced opposition to the decision, claiming it was taken because of the “fear of Trump”. He accused the US president of strengthening Israel against Muslim countries such as Iran. Earlier, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza submitted an adjournment motion in the Senate, seeking discussion on Pakistan joining US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking the parliament or cabinet into confidence. In a post on X, the JUI-F Senator said, “An adjournment motion has been submitted in the Senate on behalf of JUI-F regarding Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace.” “The House may adjourn its normal business in order to discuss an issue of public importance, whereby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. issued a statement, i.e. ‘Pakistan will join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace to help achieve lasting peace in Gaza’ without taking the Parliament into confidence or without placing the matter before the Cabinet,” the motion read. It added that such an approach was “against the saying of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.” Joint session passes 3 bills The joint session also saw the passage of three bills — the Daanish Schools Authority Bill 2025, the Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025 — amid protest by the opposition. During the session, opposition members, led by opposition leaders in the Senate and NA — Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — gathered near the speaker’s dias and protested against the bills. President Zardari had returned these bills last month despite their passage by the Senate and the NA. With regards to the Daanish Schools Authority Bill, a statement by the Presidency had quoted Zardari as saying: “In the case of the establishment of Daanish schools in the provinces, prior consultation with the respective provincial governments is essential.” A day earlier, according to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, the government had already taken other allied parties into confidence on the matter and assured them that all three bills would be passed in the joint sitting. The PML-N leader said that he and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had met a PPP delegation, comprising Sherry Rehman, Naveed Qamar, and Farooq H. Naek, to assure the ruling partner that the proposed legislation would not impact the 18th Amendment, which had devolved education to provinces. When the Daanish Schools Authority Bill was presented in the joint sitting, the JUI-F objected to it. JUI-F Senator Murtaza contended that President Zardari had returned the bill unsigned and had termed it contrary to the Constitution. The bill, however, was passed. The Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025 was presented by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chaudhry while PPP MNA Shazia Marri also proposed an amendment in the legislation, both of which were approved. The JUI-F also recommended some amendments to the bill, which were rejected. PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui presented the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill, which was passed amid protest by opposition members. JUI-F chief Rehman termed the legislation “unconstitutional and unlawful”, calling for it to be referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology. He said the bill was contrary to Islam. In the legislation’s defence, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry contended that the bill would provide protection to not just women but men as well. Gul Plaza inferno In the joint sitting, members of both Houses of Parliament passed a resolution expressing solidarity with the victims of Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno, calling on the Sindh government to introduce “systemic reforms” ensuring that the tragedy is not repeated. The fire that erupted at Gul Plaza last week has left at least 67 people dead in its wake. The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. In the resolution passed today, the parliament expressed solidarity with the families of the victims and took note of the “reported shortcomings that turned an accident into a mass tragedy,” calling for systemic reforms. “The Parliament offers its heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families of the deceased and prays for the swift recovery of the injured,” the resolution read. It also paid tribute to firefighter Furqan Ali , who embraced martyrdom while battling the deadly fire. In the joint resolution, the parliament urged the Sindh government to “ensure compensation to the families of victims and immediate recovery of the businesses affected.” “Immediately undertake a city-wide emergency fire-risk audit of all commercial and residential buildings,” the resolution read, adding that the number of fire stations and firefighting equipment should be increased as well. It also called upon the federal government to “facilitate and provide necessary support to the Provincial Government of Sindh in this crisis situation.” The parliament vowed to “stand in unanimous solidarity with the people of Karachi and the victims’ families in this hour of immense grief”. It further demanded that “lasting action” should be taken so that “lives lost in Gul Plaza will not go in vain.” Senator Sherry Rehman calls on govt to play its part PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in her address to the joint session, expressed support for the resolution, calling on the federal government to play its part in supporting Karachi. “Gul Plaza tragedy has been heartbreaking for all of us,” she said, adding that it was particularly difficult for “families who were awaiting the recovery of their loved ones’ bodies”. During her address, the PPP leader underscored the need for readjusting resources as per population. Taking note of MQM-P’s demand of handing over Karachi to the federal government, she said, “PPP has many, many contributions to Karachi, and while everyone has a right to criticise, do not add fuel to the fire”. She urged MQM-P to “not engage in politics over dead bodies, rather help us in the recovery efforts”. Achakzai condemns Imaan and Hadi’s arrest Opposition leader in the NA Achakzai, while speaking in the National Assembly today, condemned the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, stating that “targeting political dissenters violated the Constitution”. The couple was arrested earlier today in Islamabad while they were reportedly en route to the district courts. Achakzai stressed that the “freedom of expression and basic civil rights were being continuously curtailed in the country”. “Using the law to protect the interests of a powerful class was unfortunate,” Acahkzai maintained, adding that such acts “severely undermined the public’s trust in state institutions”. Achakzai demanded their release, calling for a “transparent and impartial” investigation into the arrest.",

It also paid tribute to firefighter Furqan Ali , who embraced martyrdom while battling the deadly fire. In the joint resolution, the parliament urged the Sindh government to “ensure compensation to the families of victims and immediate recovery of the businesses affected.” “Immediately undertake a city-wide emergency fire-risk audit of all commercial and residential buildings,” the resolution read, adding that the number of fire stations and firefighting equipment should be increased as well. It also called upon the federal government to “facilitate and provide necessary support to the Provincial Government of Sindh in this crisis situation.” The parliament vowed to “stand in unanimous solidarity with the people of Karachi and the victims’ families in this hour of immense grief”. It further demanded that “lasting action” should be taken so that “lives lost in Gul Plaza will not go in vain.” Senator Sherry Rehman calls on govt to play its part PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in her address to the joint session, expressed support for the resolution, calling on the federal government to play its part in supporting Karachi. “Gul Plaza tragedy has been heartbreaking for all of us,” she said, adding that it was particularly difficult for “families who were awaiting the recovery of their loved ones’ bodies”. During her address, the PPP leader underscored the need for readjusting resources as per population. Taking note of MQM-P’s demand of handing over Karachi to the federal government, she said, “PPP has many, many contributions to Karachi, and while everyone has a right to criticise, do not add fuel to the fire”. She urged MQM-P to “not engage in politics over dead bodies, rather help us in the recovery efforts”. Achakzai condemns Imaan and Hadi’s arrest Opposition leader in the NA Achakzai, while speaking in the National Assembly today, condemned the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, stating that “targeting political dissenters violated the Constitution”. The couple was arrested earlier today in Islamabad while they were reportedly en route to the district courts. Achakzai stressed that the “freedom of expression and basic civil rights were being continuously curtailed in the country”. “Using the law to protect the interests of a powerful class was unfortunate,” Acahkzai maintained, adding that such acts “severely undermined the public’s trust in state institutions”. Achakzai demanded their release, calling for a “transparent and impartial” investigation into the arrest.",
      "title": "‘Diplomatic win’: In joint session, govt again defends decision to join Trump-led Board of Peace",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday again defended its decision to join the Board of Peace led by US President Donald Trump, with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal saying that Pakistan being at the “centre stage” along with its brother Muslim countries to contribute towards peace in Gaza and Palestine was a “diplomatic win”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was among the leaders and senior officials of 19 countries, including Pakistan, who gathered in Davos on Thursday and put their names to the founding charter of the Board of Peace — a move that has been denounced by the opposition. Trump had originally proposed establishing the board when he announced his plan last September to end the onslaught in Gaza. It was originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year onslaught on the Palestinian enclave, but the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Thursday had defended the move in the National Assembly, saying the country joined the body meant to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding in the interest of the Palestinian people. The matter was again debated in a joint session of Parliament on Friday, summoned by President Asif Ali Zardari a day earlier, and presided over by National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq. Arguing in defence of the government’s decision to join the board during the session, Iqbal said this “diplomatic win” should be celebrated. He began his speech by recalling nuclear tests by Pakistan in 1998. “We set an example of Pakistan’s liberty and sovereignty when the then-US president called five times […] Pakistan was being pressurised from the world, but we took the decision [to conduct the tests] with courage,” he said. Amid a noisy protest from the opposition benches, he asserted, “We don’t need to be taught about Pakistan’s defence and integrity. We are the defenders of Pakistan’s freedom and sovereignty.” He went on to state that with the PML-N in power, “there can be no danger to Pakistan’s integrity and sovereignty.” Iqbal said the government and armed forces had proved during a four-day conflict with India in May that anyone intending to harm the country would get a befitting reply. “So nobody can taunt that we are cowards and negligent.” The minister said it was very easy to deliver speeches on Palestine in the House, adding that “our hearts have been wounded by the cruelty” that had been witnessed in the Palestinian enclave. “But Muslim countries took a collective initiative to end that bloodshed,” he continued, further stating that the opposition was refusing to accept the “peace that the people of Palestine have celebrated”. He went on to say that had the government decided not to join the Board of Peace, opposition members would have been decrying that Pakistan had been not been given any importance, that it had been isolated. They would have questioned why Pakistan was not a part of that big an initiavtive of peace, Iqbal said. Listing other Muslim countries that joined the Board of Peace, Iqbal asked were they not Muslim countries and brother countries of Pakistan. “Have they joined [the Board of Peace] to contribute to the bloodshed of Muslims?” The minister said prominent Muslim countries were given a chance through this initiative to play their role for the rights of the people of Palestine and for peace in Palestine. He stressed that the government’s stance was the same as that of the people of Pakistan: “that Israel was an aggressor and a cruel country, which — Netanyahu has the blood of Muslims and Palestinians on his hands.” “Our moral stance has not changed at all,” he said, adding that the government decided to join the board on the basis of this stance. “So that we can play our role along with our brother countries for peace in Palestine.” He said that a major reason behind “the halt to bombardment” in Palestine was the role of eight Muslim countries that worked with the Trump administration on a ceasefire plan for Gaza. “And the people [of Palestine] accepted that ceasefire, and they appreciated that the ensuing peace gave them an opportunity to begin their lives anew,” he maintained. The minister added: “Our stance regarding Palestine is unchanged. We still believe that the state of Palestine is the right of the people of Palestine. Pakistan supported this in the past and, it supports it today as well.” Speaking before Iqbal, Senate Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas took exception to the government’s decision to join the Board of Peace without taking Parliament into confidence. “The board will further add to the miseries of the people of Palestine. What Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu could not do will begin in the name of Board of Peace,” he decried. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman also voiced opposition to the decision, claiming it was taken because of the “fear of Trump”. He accused the US president of strengthening Israel against Muslim countries such as Iran. Earlier, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza submitted an adjournment motion in the Senate, seeking discussion on Pakistan joining US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking the parliament or cabinet into confidence. In a post on X, the JUI-F Senator said, “An adjournment motion has been submitted in the Senate on behalf of JUI-F regarding Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace.” “The House may adjourn its normal business in order to discuss an issue of public importance, whereby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. issued a statement, i.e. ‘Pakistan will join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace to help achieve lasting peace in Gaza’ without taking the Parliament into confidence or without placing the matter before the Cabinet,” the motion read. It added that such an approach was “against the saying of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.” Joint session passes 3 bills The joint session also saw the passage of three bills — the Daanish Schools Authority Bill 2025, the Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025 — amid protest by the opposition. During the session, opposition members, led by opposition leaders in the Senate and NA — Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — gathered near the speaker’s dias and protested against the bills. President Zardari had returned these bills last month despite their passage by the Senate and the NA. With regards to the Daanish Schools Authority Bill, a statement by the Presidency had quoted Zardari as saying: “In the case of the establishment of Daanish schools in the provinces, prior consultation with the respective provincial governments is essential.” A day earlier, according to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, the government had already taken other allied parties into confidence on the matter and assured them that all three bills would be passed in the joint sitting. The PML-N leader said that he and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had met a PPP delegation, comprising Sherry Rehman, Naveed Qamar, and Farooq H. Naek, to assure the ruling partner that the proposed legislation would not impact the 18th Amendment, which had devolved education to provinces. When the Daanish Schools Authority Bill was presented in the joint sitting, the JUI-F objected to it. JUI-F Senator Murtaza contended that President Zardari had returned the bill unsigned and had termed it contrary to the Constitution. The bill, however, was passed. The Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025 was presented by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chaudhry while PPP MNA Shazia Marri also proposed an amendment in the legislation, both of which were approved. The JUI-F also recommended some amendments to the bill, which were rejected. PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui presented the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill, which was passed amid protest by opposition members. JUI-F chief Rehman termed the legislation “unconstitutional and unlawful”, calling for it to be referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology. He said the bill was contrary to Islam. In the legislation’s defence, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry contended that the bill would provide protection to not just women but men as well. Gul Plaza inferno In the joint sitting, members of both Houses of Parliament passed a resolution expressing solidarity with the victims of Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno, calling on the Sindh government to introduce “systemic reforms” ensuring that the tragedy is not repeated. The fire that erupted at Gul Plaza last week has left at least 67 people dead in its wake. The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. In the resolution passed today, the parliament expressed solidarity with the families of the victims and took note of the “reported shortcomings that turned an accident into a mass tragedy,” calling for systemic reforms. “The Parliament offers its heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families of the deceased and prays for the swift recovery of the injured,” the resolution read.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Hours after the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha on Friday, the couple was sent to jail on judicial remand by an anti-terrorism court. The development came in a case registered against the two for protesting outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and allegedly manhandling the IHC Bar Association (IHCBA) president. Strict security was enforced during the proceedings and lawyers and media persons were not allowed to enter the courtroom. The case was heard by ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Muhammad Zulqarnain. It should be mentioned that prior to Imaan and Hadi’s arrest on Friday morning, the two had spent three nights at the office of IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani. Their arrest subsequently prompted lawyers’ bodies to announce a complete strike, strongly condemning the action. Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court on Friday in the controversial social media posts case, in which Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Afzal Majoka had cancelled their bail on January 15 and issued their arrest warrants on January 16. According to IHCBA officials, Imaan and Hadi, along with the bar association’s president, had gone to surrender before IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfaraz Dogar today. However, they were informed by court staff that the chief justice was not present. They then returned to the bar association and later left for the district courts in an IHCBA vehicle, the officials said. As the convoy left the IHC premises, police vehicles already deployed outside the building for the past three days began following them. Near the underpass located in front of Serena Hotel, police intercepted the vehicle, arrested the couple and shifted them to an undisclosed location. Outside the Women Police Station, IHCBA President Gilani said that a new first information report (FIR) had been registered three days earlier against the two lawyers. He said that while the IHC had granted relief in one case, other matters were pending before Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, where the accused were required to appear. Meanwhile, IHCBA members alleged that despite assurances from the administration that the lawyers would not be arrested, police intercepted them and used force during the arrest. They claimed that police personnel assaulted the lawyers, forcibly opened vehicle doors, and manhandled Imaan during her arrest. The IHCBA expressed concern for her safety and alleged misconduct by law enforcement officials. IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said he was assured that the couple would not be arrested until they surrendered before the trial court. He resigned in protest over the arrest. Talking to Dawn , Jajja said that he has submitted his resignation to the Islamabad Bar Council. He said that the quarters concerned assured them of giving the couple a safe passage to face the trial. “Following the arrest, I have decided to quit from the office,” he said. Meanwhile, Additional District and Sessions Judge Majoka adjourned the hearing of the controversial social media posts case against the couple due to their absence. The court observed that the right to cross-examination could be closed if the accused failed to appear. Prosecutor Rana Usman informed the court that the accused were deliberately avoiding proceedings. Judge Majoka directed that cross-examination be completed by 3:30pm on Saturday, stating that sufficient time had already been granted. On Tuesday, the IHC — which Imaan and Hadi had approached for their bail in the social media posts case — had declared Judge Majoka’s arrest order against the two null and void and directed that the accused be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. The court categorically clarified that Imaan and Hadi should not be arrested in the case. However, the court had also observed that if the accused failed to appear before the trial court, the protection granted by the IHC would stand automatically terminated. ‘Fascism at its peak’ Earlier today, former minister and Imaan’s mother, Shireen Mazari, confirmed in a series of posts on X that her daughter had been arrested by police personnel, saying that she and her husband “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations.” The former lawmaker claimed that no first information report (FIR) was shown by the police and the bar association, “sadly, could do nothing”. “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!” Mazari added in a post on X. Mazari also shared videos showing police vehicles trailing the lawyers’ car, with officers stopping the vehicle and opening its doors. In a separate post, Mazari claimed the police “used violence on the bar leaders, [including] breaking the windows of the car, etc”. “All [because] the Twitter case had been exposed and more embarrassment would have followed in further [cross-examination] today,” the former minister said. “Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari alleged in another post. In a post at around 4:15pm, Mazari shared today’s court order and said: “So Imaan and Hadi were covertly presented in ATC just now, but lawyers were not allowed in and no one has been allowed to see this FIR, although the judge has ordered it be given to their lawyers. But they are being denied. Also no idea to which jail they will be taken.” In a subsequent post , she alleged: “Just learnt they were never even presented before the judge — kept in vehicle and taken away in the same vehicle so one could see what state they are in after violence was done on them during the arrest and maybe after arrest too. As good as a forced disappearance.” At around 5:30pm, Mazari posted that she had no idea where “my daughter and her husband have been taken or what state they are in after the violence perpetrated on them during the arrest and possibly after arrest also”. “Our lawyers had taken water and some dry fruits for them and medicine for Imaan but were denied access. Enforced Disappearance!” she claimed. ‘Illegal and unconstitutional move’ Earlier, Mazari also shared a video message of IHCBA President Gilani, who was with Imaan at the time of the arrest. “We spoke to the authorities yesterday and other institutions, and they made a commitment that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha will not be arrested and will be given safe passage to go to the district court,” said the bar president in a video posted on X. He said that, fearing arrest, the lawyers went to IHC Chief Justice Dogar and “informed him that there was a possibility we would be stopped; however, the chief justice did not hold court today.” Gilani said Imaan and Hadi, along with their lawyers, were on their way to the sessions court when their vehicles came “under attack by police” as soon as they passed by Serena Chowk. The IHCBA president claimed that the police subjected the lawyers to violence and broke the vehicles’ windows, forcing Imaan and Hadi out of the car. He further said that male personnel grabbed Imaan and pushed her into the police vehicle. Gilani also alleged that the police officials “pushed down [IHCBA] Secretary Jajja and beat him”. He called on the lawyers of both the IHC and the sessions court to reach the Sitara Market Women’s Police Station — where he said Imaan was being held — and observe a strike. “The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani asserted. Calling it a “very major incident for Islamabad”, Gilani emphasised that lawyers “guard the country’s integrity and law”. The IHCBA, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrest of the lawyer couple. The IHCBA and Islamabad Bar Association announced a strike for Friday, while the IBC called on lawyers to observe a strike on Saturday. The IBA added that it held an emergency meeting in light of the “illegal and unconstitutional move” to arrest the duo. The body called on authorities to “immediately release” the arrested lawyers. “The Islamabad Bar Association believes that every Pakistani has the right to defend themselves in the court,” the statement read, terming the arrest a “violation of fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and law”. The IBC condemned the “highly reprehensible conduct, including misbehaviour, assault and torture, perpetrated by the police officials” against Gilani and Jajja during the incident. It considered such actions “to be a blatant misuse of authority, aimed at harassing advocates and creating an atmosphere of fear and coercion within the legal community”. The IBC demanded Imaan and Hadi’s unconditional release, a transparent and independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved, and “strict disciplinary action against all those responsible for the misbehaviour, high-handedness and use of force”. Separately, eight newly elected members of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) called on lawyers’ bodies, including the PBC and the Supreme Court Bar Association, to condemn the “malicious persecution” of Imaan and Hadi. In a joint statement, Abid Shahid Zuberi, Shafqat Mehmood Chohan, Qazi Muhammad Arshad, Munir A Khan Kakar, Salman Akram Raja, Salahuddin Ahmad, Abdus Sattar Khan and Muhammad Maqsood Buttar urged lawyers’ bodies to protest the duo’s arrest and stand in solidarity with them at all forums. “We call upon the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and all other lawyers’ bodies to perform their duty and unequivocally condemn this malicious persecution of human rights defenders and to vigorously protest and stand in solidarity with Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha before all forums,” said the single-page statement. It added: “We are absolutely clear this brave couple is being punished solely for the sins of professionally representing victims of state oppression and speaking out against ongoing human rights abuses in Pakistan in order to set an example for others.” Cases against the duo Imaan and Hadi have recently mainly defended themselves in a case that pertains to controversial social media posts. The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad. They were indicted in the case on October 30 last year. ADSJ Majoka had issued arrest warrants for the couple on January 16, a day after cancelling their interim bail following repeated non-appearances. Subsequently, Imaan and Hadi challenged their arrest orders before the IHC. The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Earlier this week, a case dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo, relating to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case. Separately, on Thursday, Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra dismissed Imaan and Hadi’s pre-arrest bail applications in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025 — the same case in which they were arrested today.

The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad. They were indicted in the case on October 30 last year. ADSJ Majoka had issued arrest warrants for the couple on January 16, a day after cancelling their interim bail following repeated non-appearances. Subsequently, Imaan and Hadi challenged their arrest orders before the IHC. The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Earlier this week, a case dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo, relating to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case. Separately, on Thursday, Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra dismissed Imaan and Hadi’s pre-arrest bail applications in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025 — the same case in which they were arrested today.

      "title": "Lawyers Imaan Mazari, Hadi Ali Chattha sent to jail on judicial remand following arrest in Islamabad",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Hours after the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha on Friday, the couple was sent to jail on judicial remand by an anti-terrorism court. The development came in a case registered against the two for protesting outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and allegedly manhandling the IHC Bar Association (IHCBA) president. Strict security was enforced during the proceedings and lawyers and media persons were not allowed to enter the courtroom. The case was heard by ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Muhammad Zulqarnain. It should be mentioned that prior to Imaan and Hadi’s arrest on Friday morning, the two had spent three nights at the office of IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani. Their arrest subsequently prompted lawyers’ bodies to announce a complete strike, strongly condemning the action. Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court on Friday in the controversial social media posts case, in which Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Afzal Majoka had cancelled their bail on January 15 and issued their arrest warrants on January 16. According to IHCBA officials, Imaan and Hadi, along with the bar association’s president, had gone to surrender before IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfaraz Dogar today. However, they were informed by court staff that the chief justice was not present. They then returned to the bar association and later left for the district courts in an IHCBA vehicle, the officials said. As the convoy left the IHC premises, police vehicles already deployed outside the building for the past three days began following them. Near the underpass located in front of Serena Hotel, police intercepted the vehicle, arrested the couple and shifted them to an undisclosed location. Outside the Women Police Station, IHCBA President Gilani said that a new first information report (FIR) had been registered three days earlier against the two lawyers. He said that while the IHC had granted relief in one case, other matters were pending before Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, where the accused were required to appear. Meanwhile, IHCBA members alleged that despite assurances from the administration that the lawyers would not be arrested, police intercepted them and used force during the arrest. They claimed that police personnel assaulted the lawyers, forcibly opened vehicle doors, and manhandled Imaan during her arrest. The IHCBA expressed concern for her safety and alleged misconduct by law enforcement officials. IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said he was assured that the couple would not be arrested until they surrendered before the trial court. He resigned in protest over the arrest. Talking to Dawn , Jajja said that he has submitted his resignation to the Islamabad Bar Council. He said that the quarters concerned assured them of giving the couple a safe passage to face the trial. “Following the arrest, I have decided to quit from the office,” he said. Meanwhile, Additional District and Sessions Judge Majoka adjourned the hearing of the controversial social media posts case against the couple due to their absence. The court observed that the right to cross-examination could be closed if the accused failed to appear. Prosecutor Rana Usman informed the court that the accused were deliberately avoiding proceedings. Judge Majoka directed that cross-examination be completed by 3:30pm on Saturday, stating that sufficient time had already been granted. On Tuesday, the IHC — which Imaan and Hadi had approached for their bail in the social media posts case — had declared Judge Majoka’s arrest order against the two null and void and directed that the accused be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. The court categorically clarified that Imaan and Hadi should not be arrested in the case. However, the court had also observed that if the accused failed to appear before the trial court, the protection granted by the IHC would stand automatically terminated. ‘Fascism at its peak’ Earlier today, former minister and Imaan’s mother, Shireen Mazari, confirmed in a series of posts on X that her daughter had been arrested by police personnel, saying that she and her husband “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations.” The former lawmaker claimed that no first information report (FIR) was shown by the police and the bar association, “sadly, could do nothing”. “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!” Mazari added in a post on X. Mazari also shared videos showing police vehicles trailing the lawyers’ car, with officers stopping the vehicle and opening its doors. In a separate post, Mazari claimed the police “used violence on the bar leaders, [including] breaking the windows of the car, etc”. “All [because] the Twitter case had been exposed and more embarrassment would have followed in further [cross-examination] today,” the former minister said. “Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari alleged in another post. In a post at around 4:15pm, Mazari shared today’s court order and said: “So Imaan and Hadi were covertly presented in ATC just now, but lawyers were not allowed in and no one has been allowed to see this FIR, although the judge has ordered it be given to their lawyers. But they are being denied. Also no idea to which jail they will be taken.” In a subsequent post , she alleged: “Just learnt they were never even presented before the judge — kept in vehicle and taken away in the same vehicle so one could see what state they are in after violence was done on them during the arrest and maybe after arrest too. As good as a forced disappearance.” At around 5:30pm, Mazari posted that she had no idea where “my daughter and her husband have been taken or what state they are in after the violence perpetrated on them during the arrest and possibly after arrest also”. “Our lawyers had taken water and some dry fruits for them and medicine for Imaan but were denied access. Enforced Disappearance!” she claimed. ‘Illegal and unconstitutional move’ Earlier, Mazari also shared a video message of IHCBA President Gilani, who was with Imaan at the time of the arrest. “We spoke to the authorities yesterday and other institutions, and they made a commitment that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha will not be arrested and will be given safe passage to go to the district court,” said the bar president in a video posted on X. He said that, fearing arrest, the lawyers went to IHC Chief Justice Dogar and “informed him that there was a possibility we would be stopped; however, the chief justice did not hold court today.” Gilani said Imaan and Hadi, along with their lawyers, were on their way to the sessions court when their vehicles came “under attack by police” as soon as they passed by Serena Chowk. The IHCBA president claimed that the police subjected the lawyers to violence and broke the vehicles’ windows, forcing Imaan and Hadi out of the car. He further said that male personnel grabbed Imaan and pushed her into the police vehicle. Gilani also alleged that the police officials “pushed down [IHCBA] Secretary Jajja and beat him”. He called on the lawyers of both the IHC and the sessions court to reach the Sitara Market Women’s Police Station — where he said Imaan was being held — and observe a strike. “The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani asserted. Calling it a “very major incident for Islamabad”, Gilani emphasised that lawyers “guard the country’s integrity and law”. The IHCBA, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrest of the lawyer couple. The IHCBA and Islamabad Bar Association announced a strike for Friday, while the IBC called on lawyers to observe a strike on Saturday. The IBA added that it held an emergency meeting in light of the “illegal and unconstitutional move” to arrest the duo. The body called on authorities to “immediately release” the arrested lawyers. “The Islamabad Bar Association believes that every Pakistani has the right to defend themselves in the court,” the statement read, terming the arrest a “violation of fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and law”. The IBC condemned the “highly reprehensible conduct, including misbehaviour, assault and torture, perpetrated by the police officials” against Gilani and Jajja during the incident. It considered such actions “to be a blatant misuse of authority, aimed at harassing advocates and creating an atmosphere of fear and coercion within the legal community”. The IBC demanded Imaan and Hadi’s unconditional release, a transparent and independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved, and “strict disciplinary action against all those responsible for the misbehaviour, high-handedness and use of force”. Separately, eight newly elected members of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) called on lawyers’ bodies, including the PBC and the Supreme Court Bar Association, to condemn the “malicious persecution” of Imaan and Hadi. In a joint statement, Abid Shahid Zuberi, Shafqat Mehmood Chohan, Qazi Muhammad Arshad, Munir A Khan Kakar, Salman Akram Raja, Salahuddin Ahmad, Abdus Sattar Khan and Muhammad Maqsood Buttar urged lawyers’ bodies to protest the duo’s arrest and stand in solidarity with them at all forums. “We call upon the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and all other lawyers’ bodies to perform their duty and unequivocally condemn this malicious persecution of human rights defenders and to vigorously protest and stand in solidarity with Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha before all forums,” said the single-page statement.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Barbs flew in the Senate on Friday with the opposition taking the government to task over its policies and demanding a parliamentary probe into “institutional overreach” and “election fraud”. In response, the government accused the opposition of committing “economic terrorism” while also chiding it for the Results Transmission System (RTS) fiasco in the 2018 general polls. Speaking on a calling-attention notice, PTI’s Ali Zafar, the party’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, said Parliament had been made irrelevant and meaningless. His speech was interrupted several times by the members of the treasury benches, who loudly objected to his remarks. “Matters pertaining to the country’s economy, security and foreign policy are not brought before Parliament; [instead] decisions are taken in drawing rooms,” he said, regretting that even agreements linked to the country’s future were signed while keeping Parliament in the dark. “This is a betrayal of the constitutional concept of civilian supremacy,” he asserted. Noting that all the lawmakers were under oath to protect the Constitution, he called for regaining lost civilian space. “Will this Senate remain a rubber stamp or will it rise to face the storm? Let us ensure that the law is not merely the law of the powerful but the law of the land,” he remarked. Zafar said that a full-blown constitutional crisis had occurred after the February 8, 2024 general election. He said that despite the country’s people giving a clear decision on election day, an “attack” was carried out on democracy. “The people’s mandate was not only ignored but was systematically destroyed through violence and manipulation,” he said, adding that this struck at the heart of democracy itself. “This is against the very principle articulated by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah when he addressed the first Constituent Assembly on August 11, 1947 and said, ‘The authority of the government is conditional upon the will and consent of the people’,” he said. “The same was also stated by our first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, who said, ‘The greatest pillar of democracy is the free will of the people. The will is the foundation of the Constitution’.” Zafar went on to say that he was not raising the complaint as the representative of a particular political party. “This is the bell [signalling] national danger,” he said. Zafar stressed that when the mandate of the people was crushed, the government that would be “installed” would lack both legal power and moral authority. “Such a government cannot take hard decisions, cannot unite the nation, and can not lead the country through a crisis,” he remarked. He termed the incumbent government a “house built on sand”, saying it was bound to collapse. The PTI parliamentary leader also raised alarm over what he called the “economic slaughter” of the people of Pakistan. “Inflation is not a mere statistic or economic indicator. It is a sword hanging over the head of every citizen,” he said. The PTI leader further said that public debt was not just increasing, it was also ensuring that future generations would wear the “shackles of slavery”. “This government survives only on debt … they are not here to distribute progress, they are here to distribute misery,” he said, pointing out that public debt had risen to Rs80 trillion. “What is their plan? Is the plan only to tax those who are already burdened with taxes? … What is the vision for increasing exports? What arrangements have been made to create jobs for our youth? Where is the strategy to harness our immense potential in information technology? Where is the support for small and medium enterprises, the backbone of our economy?” he asked. “This government doesn’t have a policy or governance … only drift, confusion, and the dark clouds of an approaching storm,” he said. Expressing concern over the ongoing brain drain, he said, the best minds in the country were leaving because they saw no hope, no justice, and no future. He also said industries were relocating, production was decreasing and investment was fleeing the country. In his speech, Zafar also said that the country’s laws were being weaponised. “Cases are not being filed, they are being manufactured. A court case has become a punishment itself. This is political victimisation which is destroying the last remnants of public trust in the state,” he asserted. Zafar said the consequences of this were visible in the country’s foreign policy. “We have abandoned our principled stance on Kashmir,” he said, pointing out that Pakistan did not have a clear position on Venezuela or Iran. He said that a new world order was emerging and in the face of this new reality, every nation needed to defend its sovereignty and its “strategic autonomy”. “Every step we take, we have to think it through. The government will be required Parliament’s guidance at every step; you cannot go forward without Parliament’s guidance,” he said. However, at the same time, it was important for the government to have the public’s trust. “Without the public’s trust, you cannot take any step. And this you can only get when Imran Khan comes because the nation stands with him,” he said. Zafar continued that the PTI was not just the opposition but rather an “alternative government”, and had the plans to steer the country out of the economic quagmire. He demanded that a special parliamentary committee be constituted to investigate the serious allegations of election fraud and “institutional overreach”. He also said the House should pass a resolution rejecting the government’s policies that crush the country’s poor and deepen inequality. In response to Zafar’s speech, Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani sharply criticised the economic policies pursued by the PTI government between 2018 and 2022, saying repeated policy failures during that period pushed millions of Pakistanis below the poverty line and brought the country to the brink of default. He said the past PTI-government changed four finance ministers, noting that while an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme was initially rejected, it was later accepted on weak terms and eventually sabotaged for political reasons. Kayani alleged that when the PTI- led government realised it was losing power, it deliberately undermined the IMF agreement despite being aware that such actions could push the country towards default. The minister said the present government, after assuming office, took difficult but necessary decisions to revive the IMF programme, rebuild trust with international partners and avert sovereign default. Despite resistance and repeated attempts to derail the process, he said, the government succeeded in stabilising the economy. He said former ministers belonging to the PTI resorted to “economic terrorism” by writing letters to the IMF to derail the programme. The minister said that the government was committed to ensuring sustainable economic growth, expanding employment opportunities and putting Pakistan on a stable and resilient economic path. Kayani claimed that the government had successfully steered the country away from default, restored economic stability and was now focused on achieving sustainable growth and creating jobs. Kayani also said the PTI should apologise to the nation for their repeated attempts to push Pakistan towards default and trying to derail the IMF programme.",

He demanded that a special parliamentary committee be constituted to investigate the serious allegations of election fraud and “institutional overreach”. He also said the House should pass a resolution rejecting the government’s policies that crush the country’s poor and deepen inequality. In response to Zafar’s speech, Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani sharply criticised the economic policies pursued by the PTI government between 2018 and 2022, saying repeated policy failures during that period pushed millions of Pakistanis below the poverty line and brought the country to the brink of default. He said the past PTI-government changed four finance ministers, noting that while an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme was initially rejected, it was later accepted on weak terms and eventually sabotaged for political reasons. Kayani alleged that when the PTI- led government realised it was losing power, it deliberately undermined the IMF agreement despite being aware that such actions could push the country towards default. The minister said the present government, after assuming office, took difficult but necessary decisions to revive the IMF programme, rebuild trust with international partners and avert sovereign default. Despite resistance and repeated attempts to derail the process, he said, the government succeeded in stabilising the economy. He said former ministers belonging to the PTI resorted to “economic terrorism” by writing letters to the IMF to derail the programme. The minister said that the government was committed to ensuring sustainable economic growth, expanding employment opportunities and putting Pakistan on a stable and resilient economic path. Kayani claimed that the government had successfully steered the country away from default, restored economic stability and was now focused on achieving sustainable growth and creating jobs. Kayani also said the PTI should apologise to the nation for their repeated attempts to push Pakistan towards default and trying to derail the IMF programme.",

      "summary_orig": "Britain said United States President Donald Trump was “wrong to diminish” the role of Nato troops in Afghanistan, as his claims that they did not fight on the front line sparked outrage. In an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday, Trump appeared unaware that 457 British soldiers died during the conflict, following the September 11 attacks on the United States. “They’ll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan,” Trump told the US outlet, referring to Nato allies. “And they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,” he added. Trump also repeated his suggestion that Nato would not come to the aid of the United States if asked to do so. In fact, following the 9/11 attacks, the UK and several other allies joined the US in Afghanistan from 2001 after it invoked Nato’s collective security clause, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which treats an act of aggression against one or more members as an attack on all. As well as British forces, troops from other Nato ally countries, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Denmark and others also died. “Their sacrifice and that of other Nato forces was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s official spokesman said. “We are incredibly proud of our armed forces and their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.” ‘Heroes’ Care Minister Stephen Kinnock earlier said he expected Starmer would bring the issue up with Trump. “I think he will, I’m sure, be raising this issue with the president … He’s incredibly proud of our armed forces, and he will make that clear to the president,” he told LBC Radio . “It just doesn’t really add up what he said, because the fact of the matter is the only time that Article 5 has been invoked was to go to the aid of the United States after 9/11,” he added in an interview with Sky News . Defence Minister John Healey said Nato’s Article 5 has only been triggered once. “The UK and Nato allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan,” he said. The troops who died were “heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation.” Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died aged 18 in Afghanistan, told The Mirror newspaper that Trump’s remarks were “extremely upsetting”. Emily Thornberry, chair of the British parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, denounced them as “so much more than a mistake”. “It’s an absolute insult. It’s an insult to 457 families who lost someone in Afghanistan. How dare he say we weren’t on the front line?” the Labour Party politician said on the BBC’s Question Time programme on Thursday evening. According to official UK figures, 405 of the 457 British casualties who died in Afghanistan were killed in hostile military action. The US reportedly lost more than 2,400 soldiers.",

      "summary_orig": "British counter-terrorism police are investigating a series of what authorities have described as “highly targeted” attacks against two Pakistani dissidents living in the United Kingdom, according to a report published by The Guardian on Friday. Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command took over the investigation following four attacks that began on Christmas Eve in Cambridgeshire and Buckinghamshire. One person has been arrested, and one of the incidents involved the use of a firearm. The attacks targeted two prominent supporters of former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, who is currently incarcerated. One of the victims told The Guardian that his attackers appeared to be “fair-skinned, white or wearing masks” and said he feared for his life. The first two attacks took place on Christmas Eve. In Chesham, Buckinghamshire, two men broke into the home of a dissident shortly after 8am and vandalised the property. The second attack occurred at the Cambridgeshire home of rights lawyer Mirza Shahzad Akbar, a human rights lawyer and former member of Imran’s cabinet. Akbar, who was the accountability czar in the PTI government, was recently declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court. He also faces extradition efforts. In December, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott and handed over extradition papers for Akbar. Akbar, 48, told the newspaper he was attacked just after 8am when he opened his front door. “A masked man started punching me, after asking, ‘are you Shahzad Akbar?’ I must have got 25-30 punches on my face,” he said. He added that the attacker appeared “trained”, with “proper footwork like a boxer, going only for my face”. “My children and wife … were terrorised and screaming,” Akbar said, adding that he managed to push the attacker out of the house. Following the incident, counter-terrorism officers assumed control of the investigation. On police advice, Akbar and his family moved out of their home and went into hiding. He said that on December 31, he briefly returned to the property, and minutes after he left, a second attack took place. “Six minutes after my departure, two men were seen on the CCTV, faces covered,” Akbar said. “One man with a firearm shot straight into the front window; three shots were fired and the window was pierced through.” He said another attacker attempted to start a fire by throwing a burning rag through the window, but neighbours came outside, prompting the attackers to flee. A third attack occurred on January 10. Akbar said one man “sprayed some chemicals on the outer wall and then broke windows with an iron bar” before fleeing after alarms were triggered. Police said racist graffiti was also sprayed on the exterior of the house. Akbar said he believed he was targeted because of his political views. “I am a Pakistani dissident living in exile here,” he told The Guardian. “I am an open critic of the Pakistani regime.” “I cannot say who did it. However, one thing is certain: it was a targeted attack and the people who attacked were probably hired by someone,” he said. Akbar also said he had been the victim of an unsolved acid attack at his home in 2023. “I fear for my life and for my family’s lives,” he said. According to The Guardian , counter-terrorism officials have warned of an increase in attacks in the UK carried out by criminal proxies acting on behalf of states such as Russia, Iran and China against critics of their regimes. Britain’s Foreign Office has been criticised for failing to speak publicly about the attacks.",
