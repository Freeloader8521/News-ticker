      "summary_orig": "At first glance, Korea’s Incheon International Airport appears every bit the image of global glamour. Trains to the airport, which serves more than 70 million passengers a year, are filled with travelers — and with flight attendants commuting to work in full uniform. Even in freezing weather, they can be seen wearing thin jackets and low shoes that leave their ankles exposed. The sight has become a familiar part of the airport’s daily rhythm. Behind the scenes, however, lies a less visible reality. Many of these flight attendants are not choosing to commute in uniform, but are forced to — because their employers do not provide facilities like changing rooms. According to an aviation industry worker, the reason flight attendants report to work in thin uniforms that are not warm enough for the cold weather is simple: Airlines do not provide adequate changing rooms or lockers. The practice is not limited to low-cost carriers. Even Korean Air, a full-service airline that markets itself as a global carrier, requires flight attendants to arrive at work already in uniform or to change c",

The team began carrying out search and seizure warrants against the three civilian suspects on charges of violating the Aviation Safety Act at 8 a.m., according to the National Police Agency's National Office of Investigation. The joint investigation was launched last week after North Korea claimed South Korea infringed on its sovereignty with drone incursions in September and on Jan. 4. South Korea's military has denied involvement, saying it does not operate the drone models in question.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday granted activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha pre-arrest bail. The case dates back to July and resurfaced a day earlier. On Tuesday, the two had filed pre-arrest bail applications, which could not be taken up on an urgent basis as the couple struggled to avoid arrest. The case pertains to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani took the two to his office and assured them of complete safety, stating that no arrest would take place from within the bar premises. The couple took refuge in the IHCBA president’s office, while a large number of police officials, including a female station house officer, remained outside the premises. During the hearing today, Justice Muhammad Azam Khan took up the pre-arrest application and approved Mazari and Chattha’s bail against surety bonds of Rs10,000 each. Advocate Kamran Murtaza appeared on behalf of the petitioners, and a large number of lawyers and officials from the IHCBA were present in the courtroom in solidarity with the applicants. Addressing the court, Murtaza said that this was the first time in the country’s judicial history that a woman had to spend the night on court premises, adding that he personally felt responsible for what happened. “If there had been an old case, they would have arrested her first,” he said, adding that the petitioners had been appearing in various cases since July. “You are the custodian of the high court. You must ensure that no one is taken away from here,” the defence counsel pleaded with the judge. “We are not enemies of the country. As much as you have the right, I also have the right to be in this building,” advocate Murtaza said. He requested that the court grant protective bail and sought directions that no arrest should be made in any other case unless it has been formally placed on record. In response to his request, Justice Khan observed, “I am passing orders only to the extent of the FIR that is before me.” Subsequently, Justice Khan granted protective bail to Mazari and Chattha and restrained the police from arresting them in the case. Earlier on Tuesday, the IHC declared the trial court’s order against Mazari and Chattha null and void in a case over social media posts. In the case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. Justice Khan, in a two-page written judgment, disposed of the applications and directed that the accused be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses.",

      "summary_orig": "• PTI claims several held, injured after police scuttle rally in Pindi • Aleema seeks brother’s release; Uzma confident Feb 8 protest will ‘shut down’ entire country ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Tuesday moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission to meet incarcerated leader Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in Adiala jail, as well as an order by the court to end their unlawful solitary confinement. On the other hand, the Punjab police used force to disperse a PTI protest in Rawalpindi after the former ruling party wrapped up its sit-in outside the prison and decided to stage a rally in the garrison city. The PTI, in a statement posted on X after midnight, said the police crackdown resulted in several arrests and injuries. A group of about 17 senators, including Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, approached the high court under Article 199 of the Constitution, making the Punjab Home Department and the Adiala jail superintendent respondents. The petition challenged the alleged unlawful and unconstitutional use of solitary confinement and other inhumane practices against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi in jail. According to the petition, the continued solitary confinement amounts to torture and violates fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Barrister Zafar said the senators approa­ched the court in discharge of their constitutional duty of parliamentary oversight and to safeguard human dignity and the rule of law. The petition maintained Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi had been kept in prolonged isolation for the last two months without any judicial order or statutory justification under the Pakistan Penal Code or the Prisons Act. It alleged denial of basic prisoner entitlements, including access to books, news­­papers, TV, family visits, and confidential meetings with counsel, as well as the arbitrary refusal to allow lawmakers to meet them. The senators contended that these measures were punitive, politically motivated, and part of a broader pattern of coercive treatment of political detainees, undermining constitutional democracy and parliamentary oversight. Separately, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also arrived at the IHC to seek the fixing of cases related to Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi. According to sources, the PTI leadership requested a meeting with the IHC chief justice, but the meeting could not take place. Speaking to the media, Barrister Gohar said he had gone to the chief justice’s chamber to request early fixation of the cases but was unable to meet him. He added that another attempt would be made later. Barrister Gohar said the PTI had approa­ched the IHC about 15 times but could not secure a hearing date, stressing that a woman’s appeal should be heard expeditiously. Crackdown on PTI rally The PTI supporters and family members of Imran Khan staged a sit-in outside the prison for a few hours after they were barred from meeting the former prime minister in the morning. In the late evening, they decided to stage a rally in the garrison city, prompting the police to disperse the crowd. A video posted by the PTI on X showed several cars leaving the jail area, with party workers and supporters moving on foot. “Even today, Chairman Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were not granted a meeting with the family. Khan sahib’s sisters and party workers have set off for a protest rally in Islamabad,” the post’s caption read. However, the rally was scuttled by the police, with videos of the crackdown posted on X by the PTI. These videos could not be independently verified. The PTI claimed that its workers were also injured in the action, and several, including minors, were allegedly rounded up. It also alleged that the police roughed up the sisters of Mr Khan and other party leaders. Visit to Adiala In the morning on their way to the prison, the PTI leaders were stopped at ‘DHA Naka’ instead of ‘Factory Chowk’, but were allo­wed to move a little further after some time. Imran’s sister Uzma Khanam said that it has been decided that wherever the police stop them, they will hold ‘Quran Khwani’ there. She said that on February 8, the entire country “will be jammed” to protest the alleged rigging in the 2024 elections. She urged the party supporters to fly kites with the name of Imran Khan on Basant so that “his name and picture would be on land and in the skies”. Replying to a question, Aleema Khan said they wanted the release of Imran Khan instead of just meetings. PTI leader Shafiul­lah Jan said that in the past, the authorities used to stop PTI workers three kilometres from the jail, but on Tuesday, they were stopped eight kilometres from the jail.

The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of post-war Gaza, but its charter seen by AFP does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory, and members have to pay up to $1 billion for a permanent spot on it. The board “seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”, reads the preamble of the charter sent to countries invited to participate. It will be chaired by Trump himself, who will also “separately serve” as the representative of the United States. Dozens of countries and leaders have said they have received an invitation, including close US allies but also adversaries. A day earlier, the UAE president and Bahrain’s king accepted an invitation to sit on Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’, joining a handful of countries to have endorsed the initiative. Longtime US ally France, however, has indicated it will not join. While announcing the creation of the board last week, Trump also unveiled plans to establish a “Gaza Executive Board” operating under the body. The executive board would include Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi. Netanyahu has strongly objected to their inclusion. Ties between Turkey and Israel have deteriorated since Israel’s Gaza invasion started in October 2023 following an unprecedented attack by Hamas on Israel.",

      "summary_orig": "India will withdraw its diplomats’ families and dependents from Bangladesh in the face of security threats as tension rises ahead of a February 12 general election , an Indian official said on Wednesday. Campaigning begins on Thursday for Bangladesh’s election, which has sparked protests and counter-protests. Ties between the South Asian neighbours soured after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests. India’s past support for Hasina has frayed relations between the two neighbours since her overthrow. India’s withdrawal move was part of “internal readjustments”, the official said, without elaborating. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to Indian media reports of New Delhi’s decision. It was not immediately clear when the families would return. The foreign ministries of India and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In December, India summoned Bangladesh’s high commissioner, or ambassador to voice its concern over what it called a deteriorating security situation there, particularly threats targeting the Indian mission in the capital, Dhaka. Bangladesh’s ex-premier Hasina was sentenced to death in November after a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on the student-led uprising in 2024. The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly sought Hasina’s extradition to Bangladesh, while rejecting New Delhi’s concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community. Meanwhile, a popular student leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising, Sharif Osman Hadi, was wounded in an assassination attempt last month and died after being flown to Singapore for treatment. Hadi was a senior leader of the student protest group Inqilab Mancha and an outspoken critic of India. His death set off violent protests with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution.",

      "summary_orig": "• UNRWA slams ‘unprecedented attack’; Israeli foreign ministry claims ‘ownership’ • Palestinian football club in occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition JERUSALEM: Israeli bulldozers began demolitions at the headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in east Jerusalem on Tuesday, in what the organisation called an “unprecedented attack” and a “serious violation of international law”. UNRWA spokesman Jonathan Fowler said that Israeli forces “stormed into” the compound shortly after 7am and ejected security guards from the site, before bulldozers entered and began demolishing buildings. “This is an unprecedented attack against UNRWA and its premises. And it also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the privileges and immunities of the United Nations,” Fowler said. “What happens today to UNRWA can happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission around the world,” he warned. The demolition of the UNWRA headquarters comes at a time when a Palestinian children’s football club in the occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition after being threatened by Israel, despite an international campaign to save it, according to a BBC report. Roland Friedrich, the agency’s director in the occupied West Bank called the move political, saying “it seems the intent is to seize the land for settlement construction as has openly been stated by Israeli officials for many years in the media and elsewhere”. AFP photos showed heavy machinery demolishing structures at the UNWRA compound, where now an Israeli flag fluttered overhead. An AFP photographer reported that far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir had made a brief visit to the site. “For years, these supporters of terrorism were here, and today they are being removed from here along with everything they built in this place. This is what will happen to every supporter of terrorism,” the Israeli minister said. A series of investigations, including one led by France’s former foreign minister Cath­e­rine Colonna, found some ‘neutrality-related issues’ at UNRWA but stressed Israel had not provided conclusive evidence for its headline allegation. ‘Ownership’ In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry defended the de­­molitions and said Israel “owns the Jerusalem compound”. The compound in Israeli-occupied territory has been empty of UNRWA staff since January 2025, when Israel “ banned ” its operations in the Gaza Strip. “UNRWA-Hamas had alrea­­dy ceased its operations at this site and no longer had any UN personnel or UN activity there,” the foreign ministry asserted. “The compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law,” it insisted. UNRWA’s Friedrich said the UN rejected the Israeli claim, explaining that the compound “remains United Nations property and is protected by the privileges and immunities of the UN, regardless of whether it is currently in use”. Though the UNRWA ban applies in east Jerusalem due to its occupation by Israel, the agency still operates in Gaza. Attempt to erase identity UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini denounced the demolitions on X, saying it was yet another attempt by “Israeli authorities to erase the Palestine Refugee identity”. Meanwhile, a Palestinian children’s football club in the occupied West Bank faces im­­minent demolition despite an international campaign to save it, according to a BBC report. Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players, particularly those living in the nearby Aida refugee camp, while Israel declared it illegal. On Nov 3, 2025 the children found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field. It was followed soon by a demolition order. Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Shares leaked texts & AI mock-ups • EU sees opportunity to build ‘new independent Europe’ • Bessent urges leaders to calm down DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was ‘no going back’ on his goal to control Greenland, refusing to rule out taking the Arctic island by force and rounding on allies as European leaders struggled to respond. Trump’s ambition — spelled out in social media posts and mock-up AI images — to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow Nato member Denmark has threatened to blow apart the alliance that has underpinned Western security for decades. It has also threatened to reignite a trade war with Europe that rattled markets and companies for months last year, though Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against what he called “hysteria’ over Greenland. “As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back On that, everyone agrees!” Trump said after speaking to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. To drive home the message, Trump posted an AI image of himself in Greenland, holding a US flag. Another showed him speaking to leaders next to a map showing Canada and Greenland as part of the United States. Separately, he leaked messages including from French President Emmanuel Macron, who questioned what Trump was ‘doing on Greenland’. Trump, who has vowed to impose tariffs on countries that stood in his way, had earlier threatened to hammer French wines and champagnes with a 200pc tariff. ‘New independent Europe’ The European Union has threatened to hit back with trade measures. One option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($109 billion) of US imports that could automatically kick in on Feb 6 after a six-month suspension. Another option is the “Anti-Coercion Instrument” (ACI), which has never yet been used. It could limit access to public tenders, investments or banking activity, or restrict trade in services, the sector in which the US has a surplus with the bloc, including the lucrative digital services provided by US tech giants. Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told parliament in Copenhagen on Tuesday the worst may still lie ahead. “We can negotiate about everything political, including security, investments and the economy, but we cannot negotiate our most fundamental values: sovereignty, our country’s identity, our borders, our democracy,” she said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, which Trump is also due to attend this week, sought to rally leaders around building a “new independent Europe”. “The seismic change we are going through today is an opportunity, in fact a necessity to build a new form of European independence,” she said. “We will only be able to capitalise on this opportunity if we recognise that this change is permanent,” she added. Bessent pushes back against ‘hysteria’ Bessent, also speaking at the Davos gathering of the world’s political and business elite, said a solution would be found that ensures national security for the United States and Europe. “It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax,” he said. “I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all.” Asked about the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the US and Europe, Bessent replied: “Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case?… Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.” Danish sovereignty over Greenland questioned Protesters marched in Zurich, Switzerland, late on Monday, carrying a giant banner saying: “TRUMP NOT WELCOME. NO WEF! NO OLIGARCHY! NO IMPERIALIST WARS!”, Swiss newspaper NZZ reported. The foreign minister of Russia, which has been watching with glee as Trump’s drive to acquire Greenland widens splits with Europe, said that “Greenland is not a natural part of Denmark” and also denied that Moscow had any designs on the island. “It was neither a natural part of Norway nor a natural part of Denmark,” Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. “It is a colonial conquest. The fact that the inhabitants are now accustomed to it and feel comfortable is another matter.” Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

It has also threatened to reignite a trade war with Europe that rattled markets and companies for months last year, though Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against what he called “hysteria’ over Greenland. “As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back On that, everyone agrees!” Trump said after speaking to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. To drive home the message, Trump posted an AI image of himself in Greenland, holding a US flag. Another showed him speaking to leaders next to a map showing Canada and Greenland as part of the United States. Separately, he leaked messages including from French President Emmanuel Macron, who questioned what Trump was ‘doing on Greenland’. Trump, who has vowed to impose tariffs on countries that stood in his way, had earlier threatened to hammer French wines and champagnes with a 200pc tariff. ‘New independent Europe’ The European Union has threatened to hit back with trade measures. One option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($109 billion) of US imports that could automatically kick in on Feb 6 after a six-month suspension. Another option is the “Anti-Coercion Instrument” (ACI), which has never yet been used. It could limit access to public tenders, investments or banking activity, or restrict trade in services, the sector in which the US has a surplus with the bloc, including the lucrative digital services provided by US tech giants. Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told parliament in Copenhagen on Tuesday the worst may still lie ahead. “We can negotiate about everything political, including security, investments and the economy, but we cannot negotiate our most fundamental values: sovereignty, our country’s identity, our borders, our democracy,” she said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, which Trump is also due to attend this week, sought to rally leaders around building a “new independent Europe”. “The seismic change we are going through today is an opportunity, in fact a necessity to build a new form of European independence,” she said. “We will only be able to capitalise on this opportunity if we recognise that this change is permanent,” she added. Bessent pushes back against ‘hysteria’ Bessent, also speaking at the Davos gathering of the world’s political and business elite, said a solution would be found that ensures national security for the United States and Europe. “It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax,” he said. “I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all.” Asked about the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the US and Europe, Bessent replied: “Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case?… Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.” Danish sovereignty over Greenland questioned Protesters marched in Zurich, Switzerland, late on Monday, carrying a giant banner saying: “TRUMP NOT WELCOME. NO WEF! NO OLIGARCHY! NO IMPERIALIST WARS!”, Swiss newspaper NZZ reported. The foreign minister of Russia, which has been watching with glee as Trump’s drive to acquire Greenland widens splits with Europe, said that “Greenland is not a natural part of Denmark” and also denied that Moscow had any designs on the island. “It was neither a natural part of Norway nor a natural part of Denmark,” Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. “It is a colonial conquest. The fact that the inhabitants are now accustomed to it and feel comfortable is another matter.” Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Private sector entities of Pakistan and China have signed 78 memoranda of understanding worth $4.5 billion at the conclusion of Pak-China Agriculture Investment Conference, marking agriculture’s elevation as a priority sector under the second phase of CPEC. Briefing the media on Tuesday, Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain said the conference would contribute to increased bilateral agricultural trade, expanded investment in priority sub-sectors, modernisation of production and processing systems, and the establishment of commercial partnerships between private sector entities of the two countries. Cooperation across 10 priority sub-sectors of agriculture includes collaboration in seed production technology; export of heat-treated beef; construction of grain storages and warehouses; strengthening ties for cheese production and export; improvement of local milk processing machinery; export of heat-treated offal; collaboration in buffalo UHT milk and camel milk powder; poultry machinery and technology; chemicals and bio-pesticides; feed mill equipment; renewable technologies in irrigation; value addition in mango pulp and tea; efficient fodder production; fish and shrimp feed technology; fruit processing; development of sweet and seedless Chinese citrus orchards in Pakistan; value addition of rice; soya milk packaging; and exchange of best citrus varieties with mango (chaunsa) variety. Of the 78 agreements signed, 37 were business-to-business investment agreements, 24 joint ventures and 14 partnership agreements. The 10 priority sectors identified were agri-chemicals and inputs; agri-machinery; food processing and value addition; meat and poultry industry; dairy products; fruits and vegetables; animal feed; fisheries and aquaculture; cold chain systems; and food-grade packaging and equipment. Agriculture formally included as priority area under CPEC 2.0 To ensure implementation of the MoUs, dedicated units were being established in the ministry as well as at the Pakistan Embassy in Beijing to oversee follow-up, the minister said. He added that enhanced cooperation in agriculture would help boost Pakistan’s exports. Currently, Pakistan exports agricultural products worth $8bn, and the government aims to double this figure over the next three years. Mr Hussain explained that the conference was conceived as a targeted, investment-focused platform rather than a general consultative forum. Its design emphasised direct private sector engagement, investment matchmaking and facilitation support, aligned with national priorities for agricultural modernisation and export-led growth. He said 116 Chinese companies and 165 Pakistani companies were invited to participate, enabling business-to-business matchmaking between shortlisted firms from both sides. Pakistan also showcased investable projects, value chains and policy reforms. He added that Pakistan had already signed a protocol for milk products with China. Documents revealed that the food security ministry plans to sign more than 25 sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and export protocols with key partners, including China, in 2026. Pakistan plans to introduce a new seed policy and a national agricultural biotechnology policy to create pathways for GMO seeds. Proposals are under consideration to allow the export of pesticides and fertilisers under specific conditions, particularly targeting regional and African markets. The participants of the conference were informed that Pakistan’s annual fruit production exceeds 10 million tonnes, while vegetable production stands at over 9m tonnes. With a rising population, domestic demand is growing at more than 5pc annually. Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Tuesday the issue of missing persons had long been used as a propaganda tool against the state, adding that his government had now put in place a comprehensive legal framework to address the matter on a permanent basis. Presiding over the 22nd meeting of the provincial cabinet at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat, Mr Bugti said that despite similar or higher numbers of such cases in other provinces, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the issue in Balochistan had been politically exploited for years without any serious effort to find a lasting solution. The chief minister stressed that from Feb 1 onw­ards, no enforced disappearance would take place under the authority of the state or the government. He maintained that the new legislation would help dispel allegations of enforced disappearances and counter negative propaganda directed at Pakistan. The chief minister said that security forces in Balochistan often operate in grey zones and conduct intelligence-based operations where suspects are detained for investigation. However, he added, the new legal framework would ensure transparency and accountability. Balochistan cabinet okays detention rules, witness protection bill Mr Bugti clarified that if individuals were abducted by terrorist groups or went into hiding on their own, the responsibility could not be attributed to the state. He noted that courts and relevant commissions already existed to examine claims of enforced disappearance, but allegations were often amplified without verification to fuel anti-state narratives. To address this, the cabinet approved the rules for the Balochistan Prevention of Detention and De-radicalisation Act, 2025. Under the law, designated centres have been established where suspects will be investigated under the supervision of authorised police officers, along with counselling aimed at countering extremism and anti-state indoctrination. Families of those under investigation will be informed within 24 hours, allowed visitation and provided medical facilities. No individual will be shifted outside these centres. During the meeting, the provincial cabinet also approved the Balochistan Witness Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2025. Mr Bugti said that in the past, the absence of an effective witness protection mechanism had led to extremely low conviction rates in terrorism and serious criminal cases. Under the new reforms, witnesses will testify through faceless courts, with their identities kept fully confidential, a measure expected to significantly improve convictions. The cabinet expressed satisfaction over merit-based recruitments conducted through online testing in the Finance Department and decided to gradually digitalise recruitment processes across all provincial departments. Among other decisions, the cabinet approved the abolition of the Religious Affairs Department, with staff to be adjusted in other departments, the creation of two new divisions (Pishin and Koh-i-Suleman), administrative realignment of Ziarat with Loralai, and the establishment of Municipal Committee Karbala in Pishin district. The cabinet also approved policies related to the evaluation of law officers, amendments to grant-in-aid rules for minority affairs, measures to curb child labour, the declaration of higher technical education as an essential service and verification of academic credentials of contract teachers. The chief minister directed the Chief Minister’s Inspection Team to initiate verification of degrees, warning that FIRs would be registered against holders of fake credentials, starting from Nasirabad and Dera Bugti. Education-related decisions included adopting the national curriculum as part of the provincial syllabus from the academic year 2026-27, launching the Chief Minister Academic Excellence Programme and hiring ad-hoc teachers for mathematics, science and English at middle, high and higher secondary levels. In the social sector, the cabinet approved the Balochistan Protection and Promotion of Reproductive Health Rights Bill, 2026, aimed at improving maternal and child health, expanding access to family planning services and safeguarding basic reproductive health rights.

      "title_orig": "HISTORY: THE FORGOTTEN MASSACRE OF MULTAN",
      "summary_orig": "Illustration by Sarah Durrani On January 2, 1978, Gen Ziaul Haq’s regime ordered security forces to open fire at workers striking at Colony Textile Mills, Multan, allegedly killing 133 people. No first information report (FIR) was registered, no civilian trial was held and, aside from a military inquiry whose contents were never shared, a public acknowledgement of this state atrocity has never been made. Instead, what remains is a carefully managed absence from Pakistani history books. The tragedy that occurred that cold winter afternoon in Multan was a direct response to industrial workers who had emerged as a major political force in 1970s Pakistan. Following the success of the 1969 students’ and workers’ movement that led to the overthrow of Gen Ayub Khan, leftist politics had strengthened demands for more equitable wealth distribution. During the Ayub dictatorship, state loans given to a small circle of elite industrialists had propped up development statistics but, as wealth disparity dramatically increased, Pakistan’s working class was pushed to economic desperation. In January 1978, Gen Zia’s martial law regime mercilessly mowed down striking textile mill workers in the ‘City of Saints.’ Till today, the scale of the killings is disputed and no official account exists of what is widely considered the bloodiest massacre in Pakistan’s labour history… Ayub’s removal and the civil war in East Pakistan, which led to the creation of Bangladesh, forced President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to develop legislation for workers’ rights. In February 1972, his martial law government announced new labour laws for Pakistan. The military, industrialists and even the politicians who had taken their votes were all alarmed at the strength of consolidated worker power. Bhutto’s labour laws, though flawed, dramatically increased the number of labour unions registered in the country and led to regular strike actions by worker groups over fair pay. Yet the new labour reforms only existed on paper. Mere months after they came into effect, on June 7, 1972, police killed at least three workers who were protesting against delayed wages by the owners of Feroz Sultan Textile Mills at SITE, Karachi. During one of the funeral processions, police opened fire again, leading to more deaths. Bhutto showed no sympathy, saying the strikers were being manipulated by anti-Pakistan elements. When Zia took over the country, his martial law framed labour unrest as a threat to public order. This was the most violent act by the state against labourers in Pakistani history — a systematic erasure that reveals the nexus of state-capital power under martial law. Elite Capture Commemorative slab at a graveyard in Frontier Colony in Karachi for labourers killed following protests in June 1972 Understanding the massacre requires understanding who owned the mill — and their proximity to power. The Colony Group, owners of Multan Colony Textile Mills, exemplified the industrial elite that had prospered under the Ayub regime. With its business primarily in textile manufacturing, this Chinioti/ Sheikh family group had been well-established before Partition and gained considerable strength due to limited competition in the nascent state. In 1961, the Colony Group was a part of the big five industrial houses, who each held over Rs50 million — a vast fortune by 1961 standards and equivalent to approximately Rs10 billion today, adjusted for an average annual inflation rate of 8.6 percent — in assets. As with the other industrial groups, it benefitted from the establishment of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) in 1952. Naseer A. Sheikh, the eldest son of the group’s founder Mohammad Ismaeel, served on PIDC’s Board of Directors. Even after the conglomerate split into two, the Colony Naseer Group, which oversaw the mills, was the seventh richest company in Pakistan in 1970, according to economist Rashid Amjad, former vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics. Even after Bhutto started nationalisation in 1972, the Colony Naseer Group — despite losing Rs93.9 million or 49.5 percent of its assets — was the sixth richest industrial house in Pakistan. When the tragedy happened in 1978, 13,000 workers were employed at Colony Textile Mills. Media Coverage and the State Story Reporting on the events of January 2, 1978, was carefully managed. The government-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) had been given a handout, and Dawn’s front page on January 3 carried the small headline “Five killed in Multan firing.” International papers reported similar figures, with The New York Times using a United Press International (UPI) wire, stating: “Five Killed and 10 Hurt As Pakistan Police Open Fire at Strikers.” The French publication Le Monde and British daily The Guardian carried the same number. The Times of India, however, reported on January 4 that “at least a dozen people were shot dead… The death toll may be 50.” In Pakistan, the APP report framed workers as unreasonable from its opening line, claiming they “refused to accept” a mutually agreed bonus and “proceeded on illegal strike” from December 29, 1977. The APP report of the incident stated that workers had demanded a bonus of four-and-a-half-months’ pay, which the Colony Group management refused, saying as it was “not commensurate with the margin of profit.” The APP report continued that, on January 2, 1978, the labourers on strike became “unruly and rowdy and thousands of them encircled the police force and started brick-batting, resulting in injuries to eight of the policemen, including one ASI [assistant sub-inspector] and one head constable.” The report concluded that the police had to react in self-defence against a crowd that could not be managed and had turned violent. “The police was ordered to lathi-charge [baton-charge], which they did, and teargas was also used to disperse the unruly mob.” Inquiry and Discipline Memorial for slain labourers, with their graves painted red at Frontier Colony, Karachi | Photos courtesy Piler In the following days, swift administrative action was reported. The mill management announced compensation for the deceased and, within two days of the massacre, the martial law administrator (MLA) for Punjab suspended Multan’s senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chaudhry Niamatullah, assistant commissioner (AC) Jam Jan Mohammad, and the area’s station house officer (SHO), Raja Khizar Hayat. A three-member inquiry committee was also established, with Brig S.M. Ilyas, Col Naeem and Magistrate Sardar Alam, who were going to record “in camera” witness statements. A statement was also taken from Mughis Sheikh, Naseer’s younger brother, who managed the mill. On January 6, 1978, an “official clarification” was issued, in which the commissioner of Multan Division verified that those killed at Colony Textile Mills “are not more than 14.” This clarification also stated that the number of dead included those whose families had taken them to their villages, instead of the city hospital, “which resulted in their ultimate deaths, as they could not get proper medical aid” — a claim that appeared to shift blame from the shooting to delayed medical care. Additionally, it reported that the administration claimed it did not bury any bodies, with all of them handed over to their families — a claim later contradicted by witness testimonies. Even Dawn, in a restrained editorial titled ‘A tragedy in Multan’, could only express that, “It is extremely sad that this major clash should have taken place in the days of a Martial Law regime dedicated to the revival of democratic rule and social harmony.” Merely 13 days after the massacre, on January 15, martial law (ML) authorities ordered workers to return — framing it as an ‘appeal’. Maj Gen Ejaz Azim, Multan’s deputy MLA, along with other officials, visited the factory and claimed that 92 percent of workers were present and the mills were functioning. With attention having rapidly shifted to restoring production, workers were promised a bonus equivalent to three months of basic pay on February 1 and recreation allowance on May 1. However, workers were denied pay for the days they were on strike, from December 29 to January 2. ML administrators were now regularly visiting the factory and, on January 21, Maj Gen Azim addressed workers that Gen Zia himself had expressed “heartfelt sympathies” and gave “assurance that justice will be done.” BEYOND THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT Yet what the martial law administration allowed in reporting differed drastically from what those on the ground — and researchers documenting Gen Zia-era abuses — have recorded. Gen Zia was close to the Sheikh family, having served as Corps Commander Multan right before his appointment as chief of army staff. He had arrived in Multan on January 2 to attend the wedding of Mughis Sheikh’s daughter. Workers reported hearing that the bride’s dowry was 10 times the amount of the bonuses they had demanded. According to Hassan Gardezi and Jamil Rashid in Pakistan: The Roots of Dictatorship, workers had occupied the factory floor since December 29, when the strike started, preventing a lockout by the mill management. Aslam Khwaja in People’s Movement in Pakistan writes that, during the afternoon shift-change on the day of the tragedy on January 2, when workers gathered at the gate for a union meeting, police asked them to end the “illegal” strike. Meanwhile, during the wedding, Gen Zia was allegedly told that workers — having heard of his presence — had gathered in their thousands and were marching towards the event. What followed next remains shrouded in mystery, even after 48 years: large numbers killed with over 400 injured as, according to news accounts, police opened fire. Those involved in the strike and affected by the incident vehemently argue that Gen Zia ordered troops to open fire on the protesters. Mystery also surrounds the number of casualties, with figures varying drastically — from state-reported counts of 14 deaths to union claims exceeding 200. The most widely-accepted figure among researchers and labour activists is 133, collated by the Mazdoor Action Committee, which was formed by local labour organisers in the wake of the massacre. According to political activist and theorist Lal Khan, those desperately trying to escape the bullets were crushed in the ensuing stampede. When the firing began, workers’ families who lived within the mill’s residential compound came outside to get the bodies of their loved ones, but were prevented from retrieving them by law enforcement. The firing continued for three hours; by six in the evening, law enforcement had seized control. The burial site for such a large number also remains disputed, with testimonies suggesting that some victims were still alive when thrown among the dead. Testimonies available today mention two possible locations: one, a sewage drain where bodies were dumped by tractor; another, a hastily dug ditch. Multiple people in Multan, speaking to Eos on condition of anonymity, said that the bodies were buried so badly that scavenger animals picked at limbs protruding from the ground. Aftermath and Denial Soon after the tragedy, the United States Department of State lauded Gen Zia for his human rights record, particularly with reference to arbitrary arrests. In a report issued even a year after the tragedy, the US state department made no mention of the massacre. Instead, it reported that “The labour movement in Pakistan is limited by the relatively small size of the industrial sector.” The report acknowledged that “Martial Law regulations currently prohibit both strikes and political activity by unions.” Meanwhile, accounts of the true scale of the violence, contradicting the state narrative, had emerged from Multan. Urdu dailies Imroze and Mussawat had reported the firing, and the editor of Imroze Multan, Masood Ashar, was transferred to Lahore. The Karachi Workers Coordination Committee (KWCC) observed a week of mourning, and also announced that a fact-finding delegation was being sent to Multan. The Punjab chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) separately announced the formation of a five-member fact-finding committee. Labour unions across Pakistan — including the Muttahida Mazdoor Federation, the National Labour Federation and others — demanded a judicial inquiry. Journalist organisations also condemned the suppression of accurate reporting. Separately, a meeting of journalists at the Karachi Press Club on January 8 asked for a new inquiry over the police firing at workers in SITE in June 1972, which they suspected was also a cover-up. Meanwhile, ML administrators were adamant that knowledge of the event be suppressed. Intensifying pressure on workers at the textile mill, on March 12, a summary military court of Multan sentenced three labour leaders for organising a strike on February 16. Wasl Mohammad received one-and-a-half years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) and 15 lashes. Amir Ali and Abdul Khaliq received nine months RI and seven lashes and one year RI and 10 lashes respectively. No Recognition Despite the scale of the violence, the state’s grip on affairs in Pakistan was such that no FIR was filed. Outside of the military inquiry, whose contents were never shared publicly, no official account exists. The government has never articulated what exactly happened. The state has never accepted that the massacre took place. By contrast, the 1972 killings of labourers in Karachi have some recognition.

      "summary_en": "Illustration by Sarah Durrani On January 2, 1978, Gen Ziaul Haq’s regime ordered security forces to open fire at workers striking at Colony Textile Mills, Multan, allegedly killing 133 people. No first information report (FIR) was registered, no civilian trial was held and, aside from a military inquiry whose contents were never shared, a public acknowledgement of this state atrocity has never been made. Instead, what remains is a carefully managed absence from Pakistani history books. The tragedy that occurred that cold winter afternoon in Multan was a direct response to industrial workers who had emerged as a major political force in 1970s Pakistan. Following the success of the 1969 students’ and workers’ movement that led to the overthrow of Gen Ayub Khan, leftist politics had strengthened demands for more equitable wealth distribution. During the Ayub dictatorship, state loans given to a small circle of elite industrialists had propped up development statistics but, as wealth disparity dramatically increased, Pakistan’s working class was pushed to economic desperation. In January 1978, Gen Zia’s martial law regime mercilessly mowed down striking textile mill workers in the ‘City of Saints.’ Till today, the scale of the killings is disputed and no official account exists of what is widely considered the bloodiest massacre in Pakistan’s labour history… Ayub’s removal and the civil war in East Pakistan, which led to the creation of Bangladesh, forced President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to develop legislation for workers’ rights. In February 1972, his martial law government announced new labour laws for Pakistan. The military, industrialists and even the politicians who had taken their votes were all alarmed at the strength of consolidated worker power. Bhutto’s labour laws, though flawed, dramatically increased the number of labour unions registered in the country and led to regular strike actions by worker groups over fair pay. Yet the new labour reforms only existed on paper. Mere months after they came into effect, on June 7, 1972, police killed at least three workers who were protesting against delayed wages by the owners of Feroz Sultan Textile Mills at SITE, Karachi. During one of the funeral processions, police opened fire again, leading to more deaths. Bhutto showed no sympathy, saying the strikers were being manipulated by anti-Pakistan elements. When Zia took over the country, his martial law framed labour unrest as a threat to public order. This was the most violent act by the state against labourers in Pakistani history — a systematic erasure that reveals the nexus of state-capital power under martial law. Elite Capture Commemorative slab at a graveyard in Frontier Colony in Karachi for labourers killed following protests in June 1972 Understanding the massacre requires understanding who owned the mill — and their proximity to power. The Colony Group, owners of Multan Colony Textile Mills, exemplified the industrial elite that had prospered under the Ayub regime. With its business primarily in textile manufacturing, this Chinioti/ Sheikh family group had been well-established before Partition and gained considerable strength due to limited competition in the nascent state. In 1961, the Colony Group was a part of the big five industrial houses, who each held over Rs50 million — a vast fortune by 1961 standards and equivalent to approximately Rs10 billion today, adjusted for an average annual inflation rate of 8.6 percent — in assets. As with the other industrial groups, it benefitted from the establishment of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) in 1952. Naseer A. Sheikh, the eldest son of the group’s founder Mohammad Ismaeel, served on PIDC’s Board of Directors. Even after the conglomerate split into two, the Colony Naseer Group, which oversaw the mills, was the seventh richest company in Pakistan in 1970, according to economist Rashid Amjad, former vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics. Even after Bhutto started nationalisation in 1972, the Colony Naseer Group — despite losing Rs93.9 million or 49.5 percent of its assets — was the sixth richest industrial house in Pakistan. When the tragedy happened in 1978, 13,000 workers were employed at Colony Textile Mills. Media Coverage and the State Story Reporting on the events of January 2, 1978, was carefully managed. The government-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) had been given a handout, and Dawn’s front page on January 3 carried the small headline “Five killed in Multan firing.” International papers reported similar figures, with The New York Times using a United Press International (UPI) wire, stating: “Five Killed and 10 Hurt As Pakistan Police Open Fire at Strikers.” The French publication Le Monde and British daily The Guardian carried the same number. The Times of India, however, reported on January 4 that “at least a dozen people were shot dead… The death toll may be 50.” In Pakistan, the APP report framed workers as unreasonable from its opening line, claiming they “refused to accept” a mutually agreed bonus and “proceeded on illegal strike” from December 29, 1977. The APP report of the incident stated that workers had demanded a bonus of four-and-a-half-months’ pay, which the Colony Group management refused, saying as it was “not commensurate with the margin of profit.” The APP report continued that, on January 2, 1978, the labourers on strike became “unruly and rowdy and thousands of them encircled the police force and started brick-batting, resulting in injuries to eight of the policemen, including one ASI [assistant sub-inspector] and one head constable.” The report concluded that the police had to react in self-defence against a crowd that could not be managed and had turned violent. “The police was ordered to lathi-charge [baton-charge], which they did, and teargas was also used to disperse the unruly mob.” Inquiry and Discipline Memorial for slain labourers, with their graves painted red at Frontier Colony, Karachi | Photos courtesy Piler In the following days, swift administrative action was reported. The mill management announced compensation for the deceased and, within two days of the massacre, the martial law administrator (MLA) for Punjab suspended Multan’s senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chaudhry Niamatullah, assistant commissioner (AC) Jam Jan Mohammad, and the area’s station house officer (SHO), Raja Khizar Hayat. A three-member inquiry committee was also established, with Brig S.M. Ilyas, Col Naeem and Magistrate Sardar Alam, who were going to record “in camera” witness statements. A statement was also taken from Mughis Sheikh, Naseer’s younger brother, who managed the mill. On January 6, 1978, an “official clarification” was issued, in which the commissioner of Multan Division verified that those killed at Colony Textile Mills “are not more than 14.” This clarification also stated that the number of dead included those whose families had taken them to their villages, instead of the city hospital, “which resulted in their ultimate deaths, as they could not get proper medical aid” — a claim that appeared to shift blame from the shooting to delayed medical care. Additionally, it reported that the administration claimed it did not bury any bodies, with all of them handed over to their families — a claim later contradicted by witness testimonies. Even Dawn, in a restrained editorial titled ‘A tragedy in Multan’, could only express that, “It is extremely sad that this major clash should have taken place in the days of a Martial Law regime dedicated to the revival of democratic rule and social harmony.” Merely 13 days after the massacre, on January 15, martial law (ML) authorities ordered workers to return — framing it as an ‘appeal’. Maj Gen Ejaz Azim, Multan’s deputy MLA, along with other officials, visited the factory and claimed that 92 percent of workers were present and the mills were functioning. With attention having rapidly shifted to restoring production, workers were promised a bonus equivalent to three months of basic pay on February 1 and recreation allowance on May 1. However, workers were denied pay for the days they were on strike, from December 29 to January 2. ML administrators were now regularly visiting the factory and, on January 21, Maj Gen Azim addressed workers that Gen Zia himself had expressed “heartfelt sympathies” and gave “assurance that justice will be done.” BEYOND THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT Yet what the martial law administration allowed in reporting differed drastically from what those on the ground — and researchers documenting Gen Zia-era abuses — have recorded. Gen Zia was close to the Sheikh family, having served as Corps Commander Multan right before his appointment as chief of army staff. He had arrived in Multan on January 2 to attend the wedding of Mughis Sheikh’s daughter. Workers reported hearing that the bride’s dowry was 10 times the amount of the bonuses they had demanded. According to Hassan Gardezi and Jamil Rashid in Pakistan: The Roots of Dictatorship, workers had occupied the factory floor since December 29, when the strike started, preventing a lockout by the mill management. Aslam Khwaja in People’s Movement in Pakistan writes that, during the afternoon shift-change on the day of the tragedy on January 2, when workers gathered at the gate for a union meeting, police asked them to end the “illegal” strike. Meanwhile, during the wedding, Gen Zia was allegedly told that workers — having heard of his presence — had gathered in their thousands and were marching towards the event. What followed next remains shrouded in mystery, even after 48 years: large numbers killed with over 400 injured as, according to news accounts, police opened fire. Those involved in the strike and affected by the incident vehemently argue that Gen Zia ordered troops to open fire on the protesters. Mystery also surrounds the number of casualties, with figures varying drastically — from state-reported counts of 14 deaths to union claims exceeding 200. The most widely-accepted figure among researchers and labour activists is 133, collated by the Mazdoor Action Committee, which was formed by local labour organisers in the wake of the massacre. According to political activist and theorist Lal Khan, those desperately trying to escape the bullets were crushed in the ensuing stampede. When the firing began, workers’ families who lived within the mill’s residential compound came outside to get the bodies of their loved ones, but were prevented from retrieving them by law enforcement. The firing continued for three hours; by six in the evening, law enforcement had seized control. The burial site for such a large number also remains disputed, with testimonies suggesting that some victims were still alive when thrown among the dead. Testimonies available today mention two possible locations: one, a sewage drain where bodies were dumped by tractor; another, a hastily dug ditch. Multiple people in Multan, speaking to Eos on condition of anonymity, said that the bodies were buried so badly that scavenger animals picked at limbs protruding from the ground. Aftermath and Denial Soon after the tragedy, the United States Department of State lauded Gen Zia for his human rights record, particularly with reference to arbitrary arrests. In a report issued even a year after the tragedy, the US state department made no mention of the massacre. Instead, it reported that “The labour movement in Pakistan is limited by the relatively small size of the industrial sector.” The report acknowledged that “Martial Law regulations currently prohibit both strikes and political activity by unions.” Meanwhile, accounts of the true scale of the violence, contradicting the state narrative, had emerged from Multan. Urdu dailies Imroze and Mussawat had reported the firing, and the editor of Imroze Multan, Masood Ashar, was transferred to Lahore. The Karachi Workers Coordination Committee (KWCC) observed a week of mourning, and also announced that a fact-finding delegation was being sent to Multan. The Punjab chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) separately announced the formation of a five-member fact-finding committee. Labour unions across Pakistan — including the Muttahida Mazdoor Federation, the National Labour Federation and others — demanded a judicial inquiry. Journalist organisations also condemned the suppression of accurate reporting. Separately, a meeting of journalists at the Karachi Press Club on January 8 asked for a new inquiry over the police firing at workers in SITE in June 1972, which they suspected was also a cover-up. Meanwhile, ML administrators were adamant that knowledge of the event be suppressed. Intensifying pressure on workers at the textile mill, on March 12, a summary military court of Multan sentenced three labour leaders for organising a strike on February 16. Wasl Mohammad received one-and-a-half years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) and 15 lashes. Amir Ali and Abdul Khaliq received nine months RI and seven lashes and one year RI and 10 lashes respectively. No Recognition Despite the scale of the violence, the state’s grip on affairs in Pakistan was such that no FIR was filed. Outside of the military inquiry, whose contents were never shared publicly, no official account exists. The government has never articulated what exactly happened. The state has never accepted that the massacre took place. By contrast, the 1972 killings of labourers in Karachi have some recognition. The Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (Piler) erected a memorial in Frontier Colony, Karachi, and the graves of the slain workers are painted red. At Colony Textile Mills, Multan, no memorial exists. The cruelty of denial is still starkly present. Mughis Sheikh died in 2024 and former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani paid condolences to the family. Meanwhile, workers from January 2, 1978, still await justice and recognition. Yet on Pakistan’s 75th independence anniversary in 2022 , Punjab’s Labour and Human Resource Department awarded Colony Textile Mills a “Best Employer Award.” This shows that, to this day, state and elite interests remain the same. But there is a way to dispel this notion: by making public the sealed military inquiry and convening an independent investigation to finally establish what really transpired that day.
