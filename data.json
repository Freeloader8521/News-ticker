      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi apologised to the people of his province on Monday, saying that PTI workers had taken to the streets of their own accord. His statement comes against the backdrop of protests at multiple places by PTI activists in KP. The party workers have blocked entry and exit points to the province, resulting in inconveniences for the people and KP being cut off from the rest of the country. The protests began on Friday, simultaneously with sit-ins by opposition parliamentarians and Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan leaders in Islamabad, over PTI founder Imran Khan’s health. When KP CM was asked today about what would be the next line of action for PTI workers, he said: “We have not given any line of action to the workers. The workers have come out on their own. Our strategy was just for the parliamentarians.” He said the plan devised for parliamentarians was to stage a “peaceful sit-in” outside the Parliament in Islamabad. “But, unfortunately, some of us were stopped at the KP House, some at the Parliament Lodges and some at the Parliament House.” He again reiterated that “no official call” had been given to party workers for the protest, and they had taken to the streets of their own accord. “They have shut down KP,” he acknowledged, apologising to the people of the province. He said the PTI was facing a hard time, with its leader jailed and facing health issues. “The [PTI] workers might have acted emotionally, but you [the people] please have patience. You have voted for the PTI, and you love Imran Khan. So if you have faced difficulties for two or three days for his sake, I apologise. Please wait a little more, and the situation will get better,” Afridi said.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran said on Monday that the United States’s position on Iran’s nuclear programme “has moved towards a more realistic one”, a day ahead of a second round of US-Iranian talks in Geneva . Tehran’s foreign minister arrived in Geneva for the new round of indirect negotiations with the US, as the Revolutionary Guards began military drills in the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping lane for oil and gas. The two sides recently resumed indirect talks , mediated by Oman, after US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month. A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. “A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the US position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one,” said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei, the official IRNA news agency reported. According to Tehran, talks mediated by Oman will be held on Tuesday in Switzerland. Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including Iran’s ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region. The war games being conducted by the Guards, the ideological arm of the military, aim to prepare it for “potential security and military threats” in the Strait, Iranian state TV said. Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic waterway through which about 20 per cent of global oil passes, as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday, “We’re hopeful there’s a deal”. “The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.” Meanwhile, Iran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, wrote on X that he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, “for deep technical discussion”. Grossi later confirmed the meeting on X, calling the conversation with Araghchi “in-depth” ahead of Tuesday’s “important negotiations”. Protest crackdown Araghchi is also set to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as other international officials, Iran’s foreign ministry said. “I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal. What is not on the table: submission before threats,” Araghchi added on X. Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday. The latest talks follow repeated threats from Trump of military action against Tehran, first over Iran’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, and then more recently over the country’s nuclear programme. The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies. On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “ best thing that could happen ”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure. His remarks came before demonstrations outside Iran against its authorities swept a number of cities, including in the US, over the weekend. ‘Viable’ deal Iran’s deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy. “If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement,” said Majid Takht-Ravanchi. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran’s ability to enrich more. The whereabouts of Iran’s stockpile of around 400 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to 60 per cent remains unknown, with inspectors having last seen it in June.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The opposition decided on Monday to extend its sit-in at the Parliament House till Tuesday — one of the two court-mandated days for meeting incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan — to “see the government’s response” to their call for allowing access to the former premier. Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the Supreme Court’s intervention last week led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which said only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye. This prompted a strong response from opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP), which began a sit-in at the Parliament House for the fulfilment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination. The protest, which began on Friday, entered its fourth day today, with TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai saying that it would continue till Tuesday. He shared this information with Dawn hours after a medical report was released following Imran’s examination at the Adiala jail on Sunday. “We have gone through Imran Khan’s medical report, but we will not be satisfied unless his family and personal physicians are allowed to meet him,” he said, adding that the opposition had asked for Imran’s cousin Dr Nosherwan Barki and other family physicians to be provided access to him. He also reiterated the opposition’s demand for shifting Imran to Shifa International Hospital, claiming: “We got a commitment from [Interior Minister] Mohsin Naqvi, [Parliamentary Affairs Minister] Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and [Prime Minister’s Assistant on Political Affairs] Rana Sanaullah that Imran Khan will be moved to the hospital.” But, he continued, the government sent a team to the Adiala jail instead for Imran’s medical examination. “The government deviated from its commitment,” he claimed. Earlier in the day, routes to the Parliament House, which were blocked ahead of the sit-in on Friday, were cleared. Speaking to Dawn in the morning, Yousafzai said it was a surprising step that all the routes had been cleared. “First of all, we are going to have breakfast after four days, as previously we were eating only dates and biscuits and were being forced to drink tap water. It has been decided to merge the sit-in at the Parliament lodges with the one at Parliament House,” he had added. The opposition’s sit-in was initially held at three places, including the Parliament House, led by TTAP head Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. The protest outside the Parliament Lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, KP CM Sohail Afridi led the demonstration. The sit-in at the KP House was also ongoing on Monday night, in which KP Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sohail Afridi has also been participating. Speaking to the media there, he stressed that getting medical treatment under the supervision of his personal physicians and in the presence of his family was Imran’s constitutional right. “Imran Khan is not an ordinary prisoner. He is a former prime minister and the leader of a major political party,” Afridi said, adding that barring the PTI founder’s family and personal physicians from meeting him was increasing “apprehensions”. He stressed that the health of Imran Khan was a matter “beyond politics and must be treated accordingly”. If Imran’s medical report released today was accurate, “there is no justification for denying access to his personal doctors and family”, he said. On Sunday, a team of doctors examined the PTI founder at Adiala Jail and left the premises after around an hour, sources said. The party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital. “We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party. “We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad,” he told Dawn .",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday said that the people of PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were living in the stone age, critising the province’s government for not taking steps for development in the age of technology. Addressing a laptop distribution scheme at a Gujrat university, CM Maryam highlighted that students in Punjab had access to Honhaar scholarships , laptop schemes, Parwaz Card , green buses and technical training programmes. “So there is Honhaar here, and incitement there, but this is nothing to rejoice about,” she said, adding that she was extremely upset that the “people of KP were still living in the stone age”. Maryam stated: “They do not know what development is. They do not realise that Honhaar scholarships also exist if one does not have the resources for their child’s studies. “They do not know that you must have a gadget or a laptop or an iPad or a computer in your hands if you are to meet global standards in today’s age.” Indirectly noting that the PTI had been in power in KP for the past “13 years”, she said the public there “does not even know what development is”. The chief minister quipped that the KP government’s response to every need was that it was providing them “awareness”. Maryam emphasised that blocking major roads in KP did not affect the businesses in Punjab but rather the economic activity of KP itself. During her address, Maryam also recalled the time when her mother Kulsoom Nawaz was hospitalised due to cancer in 2017 and 2018 , as well as when her father and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif was ill during his imprisonment in 2019. Noting that Nawaz was in his 70s when he was jailed, the Punjab CM said, “He got sick after multiple heart attacks and his platelets dropped. He had cardiac pain [but] such a joke was made out of his ailment.” She continued: “When my father and I were in jail, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and her disease was ridiculed so much; it was even said that she was not sick and it is all a drama.” Maryam then recalled that Kulsoom was on a ventilator in a London hospital when certain individuals “ entered the ICU through deception by wearing doctors’ uniforms to verify whether it was true or false”. “When my mother passed away, my father said, ‘One has to die to prove their innocence here’,” she said, adding that she was in a jail cell when Nawaz informed her about Kulsoom’s death. The PML-N leader then played some old video clips of ex-premier Imran Khan from when he was in power. In the clips, the PTI founder threatened to get the TV and air conditioner removed from the prisons of the PML-N leadership. Maryam asserted: “I am swearing by God that till today, neither I nor Nawaz Sharif or Shehbaz Sharif even thought of removing his AC or shutting off his food and TV. “In fact, Nawaz Sharif said one day that he (Imran) has one AC, give him two ACs as he should not face any problems.” She further said she was the “first woman” to be locked in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) jail and a cell had to be vacated for her as they did not have a dedicated women’s prison. The Punjab CM then played another video of ex-PM Imran, wherein he commented on the “long list” of health issues Nawaz was facing. “You can have differences on policies and policies, but you cannot turn political disagreements into personal enmities,” Maryam emphasised. “My children, you must never do this,” she told the audience, referring to the actions taken by the PTI government of jailing PML-N leadership and “making fun” of the ailments. “The time circles back, but my father was telling me at dinner the other day to never wish bad for even one’s political opponents,” she said. “You all must not do what he or his party is doing,” the politician stressed. “Those who are ill, we pray that God may give them recovery soon,” she added. Speaking on Imran’s current health issues , Maryam said, “The kind of facilities and the doctors he needs are being provided to him, and I am telling you this on oath that no one wishes ill for him.” She called for lies, accusations, incitement, vandalism and fitna to be “thrown out” of politics.",

The statement comes days after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that Imran had only 15pc vision left in his right eye, prompting the apex court to form a medical team to examine him before February 16 (today). Subsequently, a team of five doctors arrived at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday, where the ex-premier is incarcerated, and carried out a detailed eye examination, took blood samples and checked his blood pressure. However, the PTI rejected the check-up conducted without his family and personal physicians. Addressing Bar Association Ferozewala in Punjab’s Shahdara on Monday, Tarar referred to the “latest report that had to be submitted” regarding Imran’s health. The minister added that he discussed it with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan and the “relevant” individuals before coming to the bar association. Tarar stated: “They said thanks to God, the examination was carried out again on the Supreme Court’s order and there is no such thing about 35 or 25 [per cent]. “If he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine and the other eye is 6/6. There is nothing as such to worry about.” According to the Cleveland Clinic, having 6/6 vision or 20/20 vision means you see the world with normal clarity and sharpness. Before commenting on Imran’s health, Tarar stressed the need to “pay attention to our national issues”. “We took difficult financial decisions, but the fruits of those can be seen now,” he stated, asserting that Pakistan was now “performing way better economically”. The law minister stressed that political stability was crucial for economic stability. “There is a lot of noise these days that what is about happen and what has been done to the PTI founder,” he noted. Addressing the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, Tarar said it was the “first time that a government was taking official measures to deprive the citizens of their rights”. He then referred to the blockades of major roads and KP’s entry and exit points by PTI protests, which have cut off the province from the rest of the country. “Article 15 [of the Constitution] allows freedom of movement, but the blockage of motorways and GT Road on the official level is unconstitutional,” the law minister pointed out. He expressed the hope that the PTI would “rectify” the situation itself after looking at the latest report. “Otherwise, the federal government will have to take some action,” Tarar warned. He further said it was the responsibility of PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, to “ensure that the KP government adheres to the Constitution”. Imran’s physician urges authorities to allow access Meanwhile, Imran’s long-time personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf released a video statement, saying that last night he spoke on the telephone to the two Islamabad-based eye doctors who were treating the ex-premier for his eye condition. He said he asked his colleague, Dr Khurram Azam Mirza, a Lahore-based retinal specialist, to join the phone call. Dr Yusuf said that the phone call lasted 40 minutes, during which the doctors provided a background of when they first examined Imran, what his symptoms were, details of the treatment prescribed and what the future treatment plan. “Their latest assessment was yesterday afternoon … they told us that, in their view, Imran had shown significant improvement as a result of treatment and his vision had improved significantly as well,” he said. “I would be extremely happy if I was able to confirm that this was the case. Unfortunately, because I have not seen him myself and have not been able to participate in his care or talk to him, I am unable to either confirm or deny the veracity of what we have been told,” he said. Dr Yusuf appealed to the authorities to allow him or Dr Faisal Sultan, ideally both of them, and physicians nominated by Imran’s family to examine the ex-premier and participate in his care. He also called for Imran to be treated at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, saying that it was “appropriately equipped and of a suitable standard” for treating the PTI founder. CRVO in Imran’s right eye Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family. Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 10, last week submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living conditions in the prison. In his report, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”. Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6/6 vision in both eyes”. While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying. A medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC. It stated that a qualified ophthalmologist from Pims conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala jail of Imran and a “diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made”. This was then followed by Imran undergoing medical treatment at Pims. The ex-premier’s family and the PTI have been demanding that he be moved to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital for a comprehensive check-up, with the opposition even staging a sit-in at Parliament House for the past four days.",

      "summary_orig": "My travelogue has had a recent makeover. The itinerary now insists on including clean bathrooms, feeding areas, and a prospective diaper change station. Even though these recent life developments had me apprehensive to venture back out into the world, I slowly started to identify and appreciate how family-friendly most cities in the world had become when I was not paying attention. It was a bit like that car spotting phenomenon. You know the one where, when you notice a particular brand and model of a car, they start to appear everywhere. Similarly, once I braved back out into the world, I started to realise how much the world had to offer to travelling parents with children. It’s still a work-in-progress, but at least it was much better than what my fears had me convinced. As the first international travel location, my personal preference was to start with a place that was already familiar. I could not look past Thailand. On a global scale, when you do the math for budget, accommodation, food and shopping and build a travel itinerary, I think anyone in any stage in life would find it hard pressed to find a better alternative to Thailand. When you add children to the mix, it becomes even more appealing. Firstly, let’s tackle where to go in Thailand. Bangkok or one of the islands, or both? I would recommend Bangkok as the first stop to ease into the holiday season with modern facilities and an endless supply of 7-Elevens for any need at any hour of the day. A couple of days to get your bearings before you shoot off to your island holiday. Although any number of island combinations could work as your first holiday, my recommendation includes two options. One for families with really young children and zero energy to plan or think. Another option for families on the path to recovery is some off the off-the-beaten-track adventures. Let’s go! BKK + Phuket Let’s face it, Bangkok has a reputation. If a certain portrayal in the Hangover movie is to be believed, what would have been its entertaining and exciting prospect pre-children would now terrorise the same adults and make them want to stay away. In my opinion, though, the movie underestimates Bangkok’s diversity and capability to segregate trouble and keep it tied to specific locations only. Most of this city actually offers a safe passage to most on a quick stopover, as also indicated by female solo travellers, marking it as one of the safer cities that can be enjoyed on your own. I place tremendous value on female and marginalised lenses on travel, especially when it comes to safety. With that in mind, let’s scope out the general must-sees! Wherever you start in Bangkok, and I do hope you can find a suitable accommodation as close to the Nana MRT as possible, as most attractions pan out from that area. I would start my day by purchasing an MRT ticket, get off at Asok and make my way to Terminal 21, a more spread-out shopping mall. The various exits also offer additional walking time while staying within air-conditioned zones, an important requirement on your first day, to acclimatise. The food options inside the mall are also varied and include some of the best hygienic dessert options. If you are like me and cannot walk inside a mall without some kind of bubble, boba or sago drink in hand, then look no further and head straight to YenlyYours in Terminal 21. This is an absolute mango heaven! Besides its smoothies and floats, the dessert options include mango sticky rice, of course, but also the lesser-promoted “treasures” such as mango mochi, mango cheese tart, and mango crepe. Once you have checked mango off your list, move on to Pier 21 for a pad Thai with prawn wrapped in egg. If you are a pram-pushing daredevil, by all means tick off the mandatory locations such as Khao San Road, the Floating Market and Arab Street; all the more power to you! However, if you would like to play it safe on your first trip while continuing to partake in the best of the city, I would suggest an alternate route to old BKK. Rattanakosin is the historic heart of Bangkok. Most people associate it with all the Wats or temples it has to offer, but for me, this is where the real hidden charm of Bangkok lies, like the old parts of most cities, I suppose, being the source of origin. The bank of the Chao Phraya is magical, and the cafes and restaurants lining this part of the city are unforgettable. Each restaurant has a history and old photographs you can peruse while you eat. A full day spent in this part of Bangkok, traversing between the many Wats, ferried across in one of the canal boats and ending the day, watching the sunset from the Eagle Nest rooftop, can easily make one forget about the chaos of the city centre. Once you and your baby have recovered from the flight, it’s time for island hopping! A scenic view from a beach in Phuket.  — Mike Swigunski / Unsplash via The Daily Star Phuket I chose Phuket because, whilst there are plenty of other secluded islands that can offer an experience a thousand times better than here, it is the sheer convenience of Phuket that I find unmatchable. Here, you don’t have to forego the natural beauty to satisfy comfort. Nearly all resorts are built to attract families with children. You can choose any number of resorts along that coastline, whether it be Centara, Marriott, or Holiday Inn, suiting your budget; you are guaranteed a world within a world. With a variety of children’s activities offered through the kids’ clubs, several splash pools and most restaurants catering to children, some offering freshly prepared meals specific to toddlers, whilst tired mummies are whisked away for the perfect foot massage or backrub next to the ocean, this is the family holiday we all deserve. Whilst I have been busy blowing Phuket’s horn, the memory of another island begs to be mentioned. This is Koh Lanta, where I had once disappeared to during a challenging work assignment and had left after a couple of days feeling like a new person. This island feels like being cradled into nature’s arms like no other, ushering in peace, tranquillity and safety. Please look it up if that’s the need of the hour. Otherwise, the newly reenergised army of parents, look this way with your slightly older kids, for an adventure away to Chiang Mai! Wat Chiang Man, the oldest temple in Chiang Mai, Thailand. —  Cheese Yang / Unsplash via The Daily Star Chiang Mai Head to the Elephant Parade with your kiddy entourage and learn the story about the father and son duo, who brought this place into existence when they fell in love with a certain baby elephant called Mosha during their holiday in Thailand. Have you heard of cocoon farms, no? Then your next stop should be to the Thai Silk Village for a hands-on workshop on silk weaving. A visit to Chiang Mai is not complete without at least a day spent at Baan Kang Wat, a tucked away art village, yes, guilty as charged — also in the Old Town streets of Chiang Mai. Every inch of this place is Instagram-worthy and one of the best family day outs you can have. While the kiddos can enjoy a painting workshop, you can take your tired feet across for a cup of joe and a slice of cake at Graph. If you happen to peek inside one of the art studios, coffee in hand, some of the artists might let you watch as they work. If you are anything like me, an out-and-out urban parent, Chiang Mai also offers a wonderful opportunity at glamping! You have heard me right, this is the newest stage in your camping journey, for those who are taken by the idea without being equipped with the logistics (and let’s face it, the guts!) that camping demands. Once you have had your fair share of café hopping, night markets and kayaking adventures, you might want to end your trip by taking a stroll to the Thapae Gate of the Old City Walls to take to the shores of the Ping River to watch thousands of people release their krathongs or paper-based lanterns into the water. Alternatively, arrange for a day-trip to Nong Bua Pra Chao Luang lotus lake to watch thousands do the same, but in this case, releasing the lanterns into the sky, and totally for free!

      "summary": "My travelogue has had a recent makeover. The itinerary now insists on including clean bathrooms, feeding areas, and a prospective diaper change station. Even though these recent life developments had me apprehensive to venture back out into the world, I slowly started to identify and appreciate how family-friendly most cities in the world had become when I was not paying attention. It was a bit like that car spotting phenomenon. You know the one where, when you notice a particular brand and model of a car, they start to appear everywhere. Similarly, once I braved back out into the world, I started to realise how much the world had to offer to travelling parents with children. It’s still a work-in-progress, but at least it was much better than what my fears had me convinced. As the first international travel location, my personal preference was to start with a place that was already familiar. I could not look past Thailand. On a global scale, when you do the math for budget, accommodation, food and shopping and build a travel itinerary, I think anyone in any stage in life would find it hard pressed to find a better alternative to Thailand. When you add children to the mix, it becomes even more appealing. Firstly, let’s tackle where to go in Thailand. Bangkok or one of the islands, or both? I would recommend Bangkok as the first stop to ease into the holiday season with modern facilities and an endless supply of 7-Elevens for any need at any hour of the day. A couple of days to get your bearings before you shoot off to your island holiday. Although any number of island combinations could work as your first holiday, my recommendation includes two options. One for families with really young children and zero energy to plan or think. Another option for families on the path to recovery is some off the off-the-beaten-track adventures. Let’s go! BKK + Phuket Let’s face it, Bangkok has a reputation. If a certain portrayal in the Hangover movie is to be believed, what would have been its entertaining and exciting prospect pre-children would now terrorise the same adults and make them want to stay away. In my opinion, though, the movie underestimates Bangkok’s diversity and capability to segregate trouble and keep it tied to specific locations only. Most of this city actually offers a safe passage to most on a quick stopover, as also indicated by female solo travellers, marking it as one of the safer cities that can be enjoyed on your own. I place tremendous value on female and marginalised lenses on travel, especially when it comes to safety. With that in mind, let’s scope out the general must-sees! Wherever you start in Bangkok, and I do hope you can find a suitable accommodation as close to the Nana MRT as possible, as most attractions pan out from that area. I would start my day by purchasing an MRT ticket, get off at Asok and make my way to Terminal 21, a more spread-out shopping mall. The various exits also offer additional walking time while staying within air-conditioned zones, an important requirement on your first day, to acclimatise. The food options inside the mall are also varied and include some of the best hygienic dessert options. If you are like me and cannot walk inside a mall without some kind of bubble, boba or sago drink in hand, then look no further and head straight to YenlyYours in Terminal 21. This is an absolute mango heaven! Besides its smoothies and floats, the dessert options include mango sticky rice, of course, but also the lesser-promoted “treasures” such as mango mochi, mango cheese tart, and mango crepe. Once you have checked mango off your list, move on to Pier 21 for a pad Thai with prawn wrapped in egg. If you are a pram-pushing daredevil, by all means tick off the mandatory locations such as Khao San Road, the Floating Market and Arab Street; all the more power to you! However, if you would like to play it safe on your first trip while continuing to partake in the best of the city, I would suggest an alternate route to old BKK. Rattanakosin is the historic heart of Bangkok. Most people associate it with all the Wats or temples it has to offer, but for me, this is where the real hidden charm of Bangkok lies, like the old parts of most cities, I suppose, being the source of origin. The bank of the Chao Phraya is magical, and the cafes and restaurants lining this part of the city are unforgettable. Each restaurant has a history and old photographs you can peruse while you eat. A full day spent in this part of Bangkok, traversing between the many Wats, ferried across in one of the canal boats and ending the day, watching the sunset from the Eagle Nest rooftop, can easily make one forget about the chaos of the city centre. Once you and your baby have recovered from the flight, it’s time for island hopping! A scenic view from a beach in Phuket.  — Mike Swigunski / Unsplash via The Daily Star Phuket I chose Phuket because, whilst there are plenty of other secluded islands that can offer an experience a thousand times better than here, it is the sheer convenience of Phuket that I find unmatchable. Here, you don’t have to forego the natural beauty to satisfy comfort. Nearly all resorts are built to attract families with children. You can choose any number of resorts along that coastline, whether it be Centara, Marriott, or Holiday Inn, suiting your budget; you are guaranteed a world within a world. With a variety of children’s activities offered through the kids’ clubs, several splash pools and most restaurants catering to children, some offering freshly prepared meals specific to toddlers, whilst tired mummies are whisked away for the perfect foot massage or backrub next to the ocean, this is the family holiday we all deserve. Whilst I have been busy blowing Phuket’s horn, the memory of another island begs to be mentioned. This is Koh Lanta, where I had once disappeared to during a challenging work assignment and had left after a couple of days feeling like a new person. This island feels like being cradled into nature’s arms like no other, ushering in peace, tranquillity and safety. Please look it up if that’s the need of the hour. Otherwise, the newly reenergised army of parents, look this way with your slightly older kids, for an adventure away to Chiang Mai! Wat Chiang Man, the oldest temple in Chiang Mai, Thailand. —  Cheese Yang / Unsplash via The Daily Star Chiang Mai Head to the Elephant Parade with your kiddy entourage and learn the story about the father and son duo, who brought this place into existence when they fell in love with a certain baby elephant called Mosha during their holiday in Thailand. Have you heard of cocoon farms, no? Then your next stop should be to the Thai Silk Village for a hands-on workshop on silk weaving. A visit to Chiang Mai is not complete without at least a day spent at Baan Kang Wat, a tucked away art village, yes, guilty as charged — also in the Old Town streets of Chiang Mai. Every inch of this place is Instagram-worthy and one of the best family day outs you can have. While the kiddos can enjoy a painting workshop, you can take your tired feet across for a cup of joe and a slice of cake at Graph. If you happen to peek inside one of the art studios, coffee in hand, some of the artists might let you watch as they work. If you are anything like me, an out-and-out urban parent, Chiang Mai also offers a wonderful opportunity at glamping! You have heard me right, this is the newest stage in your camping journey, for those who are taken by the idea without being equipped with the logistics (and let’s face it, the guts!) that camping demands. Once you have had your fair share of café hopping, night markets and kayaking adventures, you might want to end your trip by taking a stroll to the Thapae Gate of the Old City Walls to take to the shores of the Ping River to watch thousands of people release their krathongs or paper-based lanterns into the water. Alternatively, arrange for a day-trip to Nong Bua Pra Chao Luang lotus lake to watch thousands do the same, but in this case, releasing the lanterns into the sky, and totally for free!

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least two people were killed and 17 others injured in a powerful explosion near Miryan Police Station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Monday. According to a statement by the police, the blast occurred when a time bomb planted in a motorcycle detonated. A child was among those killed in the explosion. Police sources said the blast took place near shops located in front of the station. Although police personnel remained unharmed, civilians in the vicinity were caught in the blast. Several of the injured are reported to be in critical condition. Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) spokesperson, Muhammad Noman Khattab, stated that the victims were brought to District Headquarters Hospital and Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital. Rescue 1122 officials said emergency teams promptly reached the scene and moved the bodies and injured to nearby hospitals. Following the incident, a heavy contingent of the Bannu police reached the scene, along with the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) and the Quick Response Force (QRF). Police and security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation, added the police statement. Evidence is being collected and an investigation has been initiated. The BDS team also engaged in clearing the affected site “to ensure timely and effective prevention of any possible further threat”, the police statement said. Meanwhile, Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan visited the hospital and enquired after the injured, it said. Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security forces coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence. In January, two boys were injured in an explosion in the Domel area of Bannu, one of whom succumbed to his injuries after two weeks. Earlier that month, the former nazim of Domel, Fida Muhammad Khan Wazir, was injured in a bomb blast outside his office.",

      "summary_orig": "Accused Bondi Beach killer Naveed Akram appeared in an Australian court via video link Monday, in his first public hearing since the nation’s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades. Akram and his father, Sajid, allegedly attacked a Hanukkah celebration in December. Sajid was shot and killed by police during the attack. Akram has been charged with terrorism, 15 counts of murder, dozens of counts of causing wounds to a person with intent to kill and planting explosives. He appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison, according to a statement from the court and local media. The timeline of evidence was also discussed, the court said. The accused wore a green jersey during the hearing, which dealt mostly with technical matters such as suppressing the identification of some victims, local media said. He reportedly spoke only one word — “yeah” — when asked by the judge whether he had heard a discussion about the extension of suppression orders. Akram will next appear in court on March 9. Speaking outside the court, Akram’s lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was being held in “very onerous conditions”, national broadcaster ABC said. He also said it was too early to say whether Akram would plead guilty. The mass shooting sparked national soul-searching about antisemitism, anger over the failure to shield Jewish Australians from harm and promises to stiffen gun laws . ‘Tactical’ training Police and intelligence agencies are also facing difficult questions about whether they could have acted earlier. Naveed Akram was flagged by Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019, but he slipped off the radar after it decided that he posed no imminent threat. Police documents released following the attack said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting. They said the suspects “meticulously planned” the attack for months, releasing pictures showing them firing shotguns and moving in what they described as a “tactical manner”. The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State terrorist group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said. They made a nighttime reconnaissance trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed. And a few weeks before the Bondi Beach attack, the pair returned to Sydney from a four-week trip to the southern Philippines.",
