      "summary_orig": "Five cops were injured after terrorists launched a late-night attack on a police checkpost in Shaikh Landak area located within the Havaid police jurisdiction in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu, it emerged on Friday. A statement released by the spokesperson for the regional police officer, Kashif Nawaz, said Fitna al Khawarij terrorists attacked the post late on Thursday night. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The statement said that police personnel showed courage, bravery and acted in a timely manner, managing to repel the attack. “As a result of the effective and vigorous retaliatory fire by the police, the terrorists suffered heavy casualties,” the statement said. It said that the exchange of fire continued for three hours, adding that reports suggested that several terrorists had been killed and injured. It added that armed tribesmen and members of the peace committee backed police personnel in the gunfight with the terrorists. It added that during this process, five cops sustained “minor injuries” and were taken to the hospital for medical treatment. The statement said that on the instructions of Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan, additional personnel reached the scene and surrounded the area. It said that the Bannu DIG and District Police Office (DPO) Yasir Afridi praised the efforts of the police, and the courage and bravery of the people in the area. The statement went on to say that the Bannu DPO later visited the injured cops at the hospital. “Bannu police have once again proven that it stands as a strong wall in front of the enemies of peace. The war against terrorism will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated,” the statement quoted him as saying. The development came as the situation remained tense in the area on Thursday after at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground during a football match. Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents follow the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. In October, Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the country over three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.",

      "summary_orig": "• US outlet Axios reports two-star general would lead proposed International Stabilisation Force • Foreign Office says no decision yet to send troops to Gaza KARACHI: The Trump administration is planning to appoint an Amer­ican two-star general to command the proposed International Stabi­li­sation Force (ISF) for Gaza, US outlet Axios reported on Thursday, citing two US officials and two Israeli officials. A United Nations Security Council resolution, adopted on Nov 17, authorised a Board of Peace and countries working with it to establish a temporary ISF for Gaza. US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz, who visited Israel this week, told PM Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials that the Trump administration is going to lead the ISF and appoint a two-star general as its commander, Axios said. The White House and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment, and the news agency could not independently verify the report. President Donald Trump told rep­o­rters on Wednesday that an annou­ncement about which world leaders will serve on the Gaza Board of Peace should be made early next year. The resolution, drafted by the US, described the Board of Peace as a transitional administration “that will set the framework, and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza in line with Trump’s 20-point peace plan to end the war with Hamas. Israel and Hamas agreed in October to the first phase of a Trump-brokered hostage and ceasefire deal. The agreement marked a major step forward for efforts to end the two-year war in Gaza in which more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed. Under the deal, Hamas handed over prisoners seized in the deadly attacks that started the assault. Both, however, have repeatedly accused each other of violating the truce. Both sides remain far apart on major issues, including Hamas’ disarmament, the governance of post-war Gaza and the composition and mandate of an international security force in the enclave. The US president has also been working to expand the Abraham Accords, an initiative from his first term that aims to normalize diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab nations. Trump initially pursued talks with Iran over its nuclear programme. Israel had launched an aerial war on Iran on June 13 and pressed Trump to join in. He did on June 22, bombing Iranian nuclear sites. He then pressed Israel and Iran to join a ceasefire that Qatar mediated. Pakistan’s stance Separately, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also addressed the creation of the ISF. During his weekly press briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed that while the situation in Gaza was a key topic of discussion during a recent visit by the President of Indonesia, Pakistan had made no commitment to join the ISF so far. “This is a sovereign decision of any country,” the spokesperson said. “As far as Pakistan is concerned, such a decision has not been taken as yet.” The spokesperson also recalled a recent conversation between Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, where Gaza was a primary topic. The two had strongly condemned Israel’s unilateral plan to restrict the Rafah crossing for the exit only of Gaza residents, deeming it a clear violation of the peace plan and a move that undermines humanitarian access,the spoksperson said. Members of the eight-nation Muslim bloc have already expressed “deep concern” over Israeli statements about opening the Rafah Crossing in only one direction.

      "summary_orig": "A view of the place where the school stood in North Waziristan.—Dawn MOHMAND/NORTH WAZIR­ISTAN: At least eight suspected militants were killed and four others injured in two drone strikes carried out by the security forces in Mohmand district, while a school was blown up by unidentified militants in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil on Wednesday night. The drone strikes occurred at night on December 10, targeting Alingar, a remote village of Mohmand district near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. No police posts or government installations are present in the area. However, a police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the intelligence-based operation involved two separate drone attacks that killed over eight militants. “The strikes were precise and aimed at a gathering of militants,” the source said, adding that surveillance and verification efforts were ongoing to ascertain the exact number of casualties and identities of those killed. Primary school blown up in Mir Ali; major portion of building destroyed The area remains under heightened security, with forces conducting searches to prevent any retaliatory actions. There was no official word, either from the district administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), about the incident. School blown up Separately, in North Waziristan, unidentified attackers blew up a government primary school in the Khushali area in Mir Ali, putting the education of more than 600 children in jeopardy and spreading fear across the locality. Officials said that unknown attackers had planted explosives inside the school building and detonated them at night. The blast, which was heard miles away, destroyed a significant portion of the school building. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far. Education department officials confirmed that more than 600 students were enrolled in the institution, which served as the only functional primary school in the area. Authorities said the remaining sections of the building had been cordoned off, while an emergency plan for alternate learning arrangements was under consideration. Local elders and parents expressed deep concern, calling attacks on educational institutions “a direct assault on the future of children”. “This school was the only beacon of hope for our children. Its destruction has shocked the entire community,” an area elder said. The incident comes weeks after Cadet College Wana in the Lower South Waziristan district came under a terrorist attack. In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat partially damaged the building. Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Shewa tehsil of North Waziristan district. Published in Dawn, December 12th, 2025",

Its destruction has shocked the entire community,” an area elder said. The incident comes weeks after Cadet College Wana in the Lower South Waziristan district came under a terrorist attack. In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat partially damaged the building. Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Shewa tehsil of North Waziristan district. Published in Dawn, December 12th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Pakistan ‘hopeful but realistic’ as over 1,000 scholars seek ‘necessary measures’ to discourage cross-border movement of fighters • FO says Afghan Taliban have failed to comply with past commitments, reiterates demand for written assurances ISLAMABAD: Amid concerns by Pakistan regarding the use of Afghan soil by militants to launch attacks inside the country, over 1,000 Afghan clerics recently passed a resolution apparently aimed at discouraging the flow of militancy from its territory to neighbouring states. The resolution, adopted by leading Afghan clerics, pledges that their country’s soil will not be used against other countries. In case of violations, the “Islamic Emirate has the right to take necessary measures against them”, it said, noting that Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada had not permitted any Afghan national “to travel abroad for military activity, so if anyone violates this… The Islamic Emirate must take necessary measures to prevent such people”. The resolution, though welcomed by Pakistan, elicited only cautious optimism, given the Taliban’s track record on militant groups. Terming it a “positive development”, the Foreign Office reiterated its demand for written assurances from the interim Afghan government that its soil would not be used against Pakistan. The document, described as a significant development by experts in Pakistan and Afghanistan, comes from independent clerics, without any formal endorsement from the Taliban government, nor does it explicitly name Pakistan. However, it does say that whoever would “conduct military operations beyond Afghanistan’s borders would be considered a rebel against the state”. This would also be considered “as a violation of the emir’s orders” and would be a punishable offence, the resolution said. But it remains unclear who would enforce such a punishment, as the group of religious scholars who have issued it have no legally binding authority. However, the timing of the declaration seems significant, coming at a time when Islamabad is asking Kabul to rein in militants, particularly the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), who it blames for perpetrating terror attacks in the country. Pakistan has asked Kabul to issue a decree — in the name of supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada — to stop such incursions; a demand that was reiterated during a series of negotiations in Qatar, Turkey and Saudi Arabia over the past few months. However, according to officials privy to the meetings, the Taliban had asked Pakistan to approach their own scholars for such an edict. Afghan religious scholar Sheikh Faqirullah Faeq, who was present at the Kabul University gathering, termed the resolution “very significant” and appeared hopeful about its outcome. He said all senior clerics of major religious schools participated in the day-long meeting of the clerics, adding that there were 34 major jihadi seminaries in Afghanistan and all participated in the event. “Teachers have influence on those Taliban who go outside the country to fight. Some people say certain circles go to Pakistan or Gaza and other areas. The supreme leader does not want a neighbour to have problems because of us, and I hope this resolution will work,” Sheikh Faeq told Dawn. FO’s ‘cautious optimism’ In the absence of official backing, it is unclear how it will be enforced — a concern also echoed by the Foreign Office. “If the leadership of the Afghan Taliban regime or certain segments of Afghan society realise the gravity of the matter that their soil is being used not just by the banned TTP/FAK/FAH but also by their own nationals to perpetrate terrorism in Pakistan, such realisation is positive,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said during his weekly briefing. “One important aspect is that commitments made in the past by the Afghan Taliban regime have not been fulfilled. This is exactly why, during the talks held with the mediation efforts of our brotherly countries, Pakistan insisted on written assurances from the Afghan side,” the spokesperson said. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, however, told the clerics’ gathering in Kabul on Thursday that the interim government had the right to stop anyone using Afghan soil for militant activities in other countries. “If anyone violates this, ulema favour action against them,” he said while alluding to the resolution. He said it was obligatory for all Muslims in Afghanistan to obey the resolution. ‘Positive development’ Despite expressing concern about its impact, the resolution is being seen as a positive development by observers in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan’s former special representative for Afghanistan Asif Durrani, in a brief message sent to Dawn , said the timing of the resolution was important. “One has to look at the timing of the resolution when everything seems to be frozen,” he said, adding that the document was “clearly intended” to convey a message to Pakistan regarding reconciliation. “Hopefully, the TTP, which owes allegiance to the Taliban supreme leader…will now submit to the collective wisdom of the Afghan Taliban ulema and surrender arms,” he said, asking the government of Pakistan to welcome the resolution. Analyst and journalist Sami Yousafzai said the move would be a positive one for Pakistan, which has repeatedly asked for an Afghan ‘fatwa’ or edict. “Implementation would be a little difficult. But it would work if the Taliban leaders opt for punishment, arrest and jail those Afghans who join the Pakistani groups,” he told Dawn . He said Afghans’ participation in attacks in Pakistan has increased, especially of the Afghans from Logar and Maidan Wardak provinces — both provinces are located near the capital Kabul. “So, the Taliban are also worried over the growing number of Afghans participating. This is a good beginning and a positive message to Pakistan,” he said, adding that the Afghan Taliban’s intelligence can monitor the movement of their own people. According to the FO spokesperson, Pakistan will adopt a ‘wait-and-see’ policy to evaluate this document, since the Taliban had failed to live up to their promises in the past.

      "title_orig": "‘Fomenting political agitation’: what’s next for embattled former spymaster?",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The announcement of a 14-year sentence for ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed has reignited speculation about his alleged role in fomenting unrest in the country, especially after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) hinted at a broader and more serious plot, involving unnamed political actors. While the ISPR statement focused on his conviction under military laws, it was the final paragraph that drew the most attention. “Involvement of the convict in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with,” the statement said, offering no details. The language implied linking Faiz Hameed and unnamed politicians to a wider effort to engineer unrest. The reference marked the latest in a series of military statements since last year, signalling suspicion and hinting at an alleged nexus between him and political elements, opposed to the government. In a statement issued on Aug 15, 2024, the ISPR noted that “further investigations of certain retired officers and their accomplices for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests are continuing.” A separate statement released at the time of Hameed’s detention alleged that “multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post retirement have also been established,” though it did not elaborate. Days later, the ISPR disclosed that Hameed was being investigated for alleged involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots , during which military buildings and monuments were vandalised. “During the process, involvement of Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed (retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading to multiple incidents including, but not limited to May 9, 2023, for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,” the statement had then said. Accusations and suspicions This is certainly not the first time that Hameed has been accused of political maneuvering, both pre and post-retirement. He came into the limelight for his role as a guarantor in the 2017 Faizabad agreement , a controversial deal betw­een the government and TLP protesters that ended a weeks-long sit-in. While the PTI was in power, Hameed quickly made room for himself in the then-PM’s kitchen cabinet. By some accounts, he became quite close to both Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi. Then, in 2020, ex-PM Nawaz Sharif had publicly accused Hameed and his former boss, Gen Qamar Bajwa, of orchestrating the three-time premier’s ouster. The most direct accusation came during a rally in Gujranwala: “Gen Faiz, this is done with your hands and you need to answer,” Mr Nawaz had roared. Although speculation was rife about his influence on the PTI and its political machinations, there was no direct evidence to substantiate this. Subsequently, in 2022, a viral video showed the now-retired Faiz Hameed at an event, with a PTI leader praising him and inviting him to enter politics. The former general, however, had denied having any plans to enter politics, saying on TV, “I will not join politics after the two-year bar nor afterward.” Then came the case of his brother Najaf Hameed, who was arrested on corruption and bribery charges in March 2024 after a court rejected his request for bail. Anti-corruption officials apprehended the former naib tehsildar from court premises in Rawalpindi and sent him to Adiala jail on a 14-day judicial remand. The case against him, registered with the Anti-Corruption Establishment in Chakwal, includes charges of bribery, misuse of authority, and causing losses to the national exchequer. Many alleged that he had became a powerful figure in the region during his brother’s tenure as the ISI chief. May 9 role? Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, speaking in a television interview soon after Hameed’s arrest last year, said he remained “deeply involved” in political developments after leaving service in November 2022. “After his retirement, the political events that unfolded had Faiz’s involvement. Knowing him, he never hesitates to stir things up, especially someone like him who wielded immense power and then had to step back,” Mr Asif then said. About his potential involvement in the May 9 riots, Mr Asif had then said the “evidence and circumstances” pointed toward his participation, possibly as a “strategic adviser.” “He might have provided logistics and used his experience to guide actions aimed at causing greater damage,” Mr Asif then said, adding, “While I can’t say this with absolute certainty, the evidence and circumstances suggest his involvement.” Although the ISPR has avoided naming any political party or leader, its repeated references to actions taken “at the behest of and in collusion with political elements” have been widely interpreted as alluding to jailed former prime minister Imran Khan. The military has not said when the separate investigations mentioned in the statement would conclude, nor whether additional charges will be brought against the former intelligence chief.

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: The announcement of a 14-year sentence for ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed has reignited speculation about his alleged role in fomenting unrest in the country, especially after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) hinted at a broader and more serious plot, involving unnamed political actors. While the ISPR statement focused on his conviction under military laws, it was the final paragraph that drew the most attention. “Involvement of the convict in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with,” the statement said, offering no details. The language implied linking Faiz Hameed and unnamed politicians to a wider effort to engineer unrest. The reference marked the latest in a series of military statements since last year, signalling suspicion and hinting at an alleged nexus between him and political elements, opposed to the government. In a statement issued on Aug 15, 2024, the ISPR noted that “further investigations of certain retired officers and their accomplices for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests are continuing.” A separate statement released at the time of Hameed’s detention alleged that “multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post retirement have also been established,” though it did not elaborate. Days later, the ISPR disclosed that Hameed was being investigated for alleged involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots , during which military buildings and monuments were vandalised. “During the process, involvement of Lt. Gen. Faiz Hameed (retd) in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading to multiple incidents including, but not limited to May 9, 2023, for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,” the statement had then said. Accusations and suspicions This is certainly not the first time that Hameed has been accused of political maneuvering, both pre and post-retirement. He came into the limelight for his role as a guarantor in the 2017 Faizabad agreement , a controversial deal betw­een the government and TLP protesters that ended a weeks-long sit-in. While the PTI was in power, Hameed quickly made room for himself in the then-PM’s kitchen cabinet. By some accounts, he became quite close to both Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi. Then, in 2020, ex-PM Nawaz Sharif had publicly accused Hameed and his former boss, Gen Qamar Bajwa, of orchestrating the three-time premier’s ouster. The most direct accusation came during a rally in Gujranwala: “Gen Faiz, this is done with your hands and you need to answer,” Mr Nawaz had roared. Although speculation was rife about his influence on the PTI and its political machinations, there was no direct evidence to substantiate this. Subsequently, in 2022, a viral video showed the now-retired Faiz Hameed at an event, with a PTI leader praising him and inviting him to enter politics. The former general, however, had denied having any plans to enter politics, saying on TV, “I will not join politics after the two-year bar nor afterward.” Then came the case of his brother Najaf Hameed, who was arrested on corruption and bribery charges in March 2024 after a court rejected his request for bail. Anti-corruption officials apprehended the former naib tehsildar from court premises in Rawalpindi and sent him to Adiala jail on a 14-day judicial remand. The case against him, registered with the Anti-Corruption Establishment in Chakwal, includes charges of bribery, misuse of authority, and causing losses to the national exchequer. Many alleged that he had became a powerful figure in the region during his brother’s tenure as the ISI chief. May 9 role?

      "summary_orig": "The government may consider banning social media platforms if they do not cooperate with authorities, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said on Thursday. The social media platform X, which around 4.5 million people in Pakistan use, was blocked in February 2024, around 10 days after the general elections. Speaking on Dawn News programme “Doosra Rukh,” Barrister Malik, responding to a question about a possible ban on incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s X account, said “investigations are ongoing.” He added that while the government has contacted X, the platform has shown the least cooperation compared to other social media networks. Criticising X, the minister said the platform should not operate with double standards. “Posts related to Palestine are removed, and accounts blocked, within 24 hours. Here, we are talking about a matter of terrorism,” he said. He further noted that the government has issued reminders to social media platforms and warned that those that fail to cooperate or coordinate could face a ban, similar to actions taken by Brazil. “Brazil’s courts had issued orders, which were then accepted, and a fine of $5.2 million was paid. All content taken out of context was removed,” Barrister Malik said. X had 22 million users in Brazil before it was blocked on August 30 by Brazilian Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes for failing to comply with a series of court orders aimed at combatting disinformation. Barrister Malik said that today the government again issued a reminder, emphasising that it had already warned that these platforms are being used for terrorism, misinformation, and disinformation. “We have asked them to open offices here in Pakistan, but there has been no response. Some social media platforms are cooperating well, but X is cooperating the least,” he added. Earlier, on October 4, the minister said that investigations regarding Imran’s X account were ongoing and that contact with the platform was underway. He had said that any measures regarding a potential block of Imran’s account would be disclosed once further evidence comes to light. According to an October post on his official X account, Imran was also quizzed in prison by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials about his “anti-state” tweets, critical remarks on foreign policy and other topics. A month before that, in September, a petition was filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment. The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.",

      "summary_orig": "Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Sohail Afridi was denied permission to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for the 10th time on Thursday by the Adiala jail administration, while party leaders remain divided over the continuation of prolonged sit-ins outside the jail, warning that they could adversely affect the incarcerated leader. Politi­cal temperatures rose further a day earlier, as Rawalpindi police sought a legal opinion on the question of registering an FIR against PTI leaders and supporters over a protest outside Adiala jail, even as the party moved a privilege motion in the National Assembly over alleged use of force against its workers, and voiced alarm at reports of Imran Khan’s possible transfer to another prison. The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil. Some party leaders believe token protests should continue outside Adiala jail, warning that a halt could give the “powers that be” an excuse to create a “scene” and potentially transfer Imran to another facility. A senior party leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were differing opinions within the party. “One group favors prolonged sit-ins, believing they will put pressure on the government and the powers that be. The other group believes a token protest outside the jail should be held before dispersing,” he added. When asked about the rationale behind the token protest, a PTI MNA said there were concerns that the “powers that be” might create a scene outside Adiala Jail, such as orchestrating a blast or staging a false-flag operation, to allege that an attempt had been made to break into the facility and free Imran Khan. “After that, the government will be able to convince the international community that it was necessary to shift Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to somewhere else. We don’t want to give the government any such excuse,” he explained. Another leader who belongs to Punjab said that for the last three months, workers and leaders from Punjab were regularly reaching the prison. “Our attendance is marked in Lahore and sometimes in Kallar Kahar. Each MPA or leader who brings four people with him in a car spends Rs50,000 to Rs60,000, as they usually reach Lahore or other parts of Punjab the next day. Peshawar, however, is less than two hours away, so leaders and workers can easily travel from there and return. Despite this, people from Punjab have dominated the crowds every time. The KP chief minister arrives at Adiala Jail with only a few people; he does not even bother to bring his full cabinet,” he claimed. He added that in several meetings of the parliamentary party, some members suggested that workers should stage a token protest outside Adiala Jail and then disperse. “Everyone knows that we will not be allowed to meet Khan sahab, so we should record the protest and save our energies for the right time,” he suggested. Another MNA claimed that ever since Aleema Khanum took control of the party’s social media operations, online trolling targets anyone who speaks with logic or suggests a practical approach to securing Imran’s release. “On the other hand, it is also a fact that our workers are arrested while Aleema is not, despite non-bailable warrants having been issued for her. We have received messages from certain quarters that if we ‘calm down’, meetings with Khan sahib may be allowed in a few weeks. However, some individuals appear more interested in self-projection,” he claimed. “It is a fact that earlier this week, while Aleema Khanum was holding a sit-in, around 20 of our vehicles were damaged, and police seized the keys of several others. As a result, even those cars that were not damaged could not be driven away by party leaders,” he claimed. “There are some people who reach the sit-in for ratings as they are active on social media,” he added. He further said that in the past, Mashal Yousafzai, after meeting Imran and Bushra Bibi, had conveyed that they had instructed her to end the protests outside Adiala jail and stage demonstrations outside the Islamabad High Court instead. “A written directive was also issued in this regard, but later Aleema Khanum met Khan sahab and claimed he had not given any such instructions, after which the protests outside Adiala jail resumed,” he added. Central Information Secretary PTI Sheikh Waqas Akram, while talking to Dawn , admitted that the decision was made to stop protests outside the prison. “However, when Aleema Khanum announced that she would hold the protest outside Adiala jail, the party decided to stand along with her. She is the sister of Imran Khan, and we will stand by her,” Waqas explained. Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, speaking to Dawn , dismissed reports of internal rifts within the party as “disinformation.” “There can be differences of opinion, that is the beauty of a political party. In the last parliamentary party meeting, it was unanimously decided that all decisions will be taken by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and the entire party will follow his lead,” he said. CM KP Sohail Afridi again barred from meeting Imran Meanwhile, Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Sohail Afridi was denied permission to meet Imran for the 10th time on Thursday. Although he arrived at Adiala Jail, the police informed him that the meeting could not be allowed. Speaking to media persons, Mr Afridi said that it was strange that an elected CM was not being allowed to meet his party’s founding chairman despite court orders to the contrary. He questioned the state on the message being sent to PTI and Imran Khan’s sisters, who were peacefully protesting but were dispersed using water cannons. He asked whether the intention was to suggest that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was not considered part of Pakistan. He warned that both the federal and Punjab government leadership would face consequences once the PTI returned to power at the Centre. Afridi said that efforts had been underway for the past three years to “minus Imran” , but all such attempts had failed. He added that the government and the “powers that be” should engage in talks with Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, as Imran had authorised them to represent him in negotiations. Replying to a question about Faiz Hameed’s sentencing, Afridi said it was an “internal matter of the institution”. Early on Wednesday morning, authorities used water cannons to disperse protesters, including the sisters of the PTI founder, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier. The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration. The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”.",

When asked about the rationale behind the token protest, a PTI MNA said there were concerns that the “powers that be” might create a scene outside Adiala Jail, such as orchestrating a blast or staging a false-flag operation, to allege that an attempt had been made to break into the facility and free Imran Khan. “After that, the government will be able to convince the international community that it was necessary to shift Imran Khan from Adiala Jail to somewhere else. We don’t want to give the government any such excuse,” he explained. Another leader who belongs to Punjab said that for the last three months, workers and leaders from Punjab were regularly reaching the prison. “Our attendance is marked in Lahore and sometimes in Kallar Kahar. Each MPA or leader who brings four people with him in a car spends Rs50,000 to Rs60,000, as they usually reach Lahore or other parts of Punjab the next day. Peshawar, however, is less than two hours away, so leaders and workers can easily travel from there and return. Despite this, people from Punjab have dominated the crowds every time. The KP chief minister arrives at Adiala Jail with only a few people; he does not even bother to bring his full cabinet,” he claimed. He added that in several meetings of the parliamentary party, some members suggested that workers should stage a token protest outside Adiala Jail and then disperse. “Everyone knows that we will not be allowed to meet Khan sahab, so we should record the protest and save our energies for the right time,” he suggested. Another MNA claimed that ever since Aleema Khanum took control of the party’s social media operations, online trolling targets anyone who speaks with logic or suggests a practical approach to securing Imran’s release. “On the other hand, it is also a fact that our workers are arrested while Aleema is not, despite non-bailable warrants having been issued for her. We have received messages from certain quarters that if we ‘calm down’, meetings with Khan sahib may be allowed in a few weeks. However, some individuals appear more interested in self-projection,” he claimed. “It is a fact that earlier this week, while Aleema Khanum was holding a sit-in, around 20 of our vehicles were damaged, and police seized the keys of several others. As a result, even those cars that were not damaged could not be driven away by party leaders,” he claimed. “There are some people who reach the sit-in for ratings as they are active on social media,” he added. He further said that in the past, Mashal Yousafzai, after meeting Imran and Bushra Bibi, had conveyed that they had instructed her to end the protests outside Adiala jail and stage demonstrations outside the Islamabad High Court instead. “A written directive was also issued in this regard, but later Aleema Khanum met Khan sahab and claimed he had not given any such instructions, after which the protests outside Adiala jail resumed,” he added. Central Information Secretary PTI Sheikh Waqas Akram, while talking to Dawn , admitted that the decision was made to stop protests outside the prison. “However, when Aleema Khanum announced that she would hold the protest outside Adiala jail, the party decided to stand along with her. She is the sister of Imran Khan, and we will stand by her,” Waqas explained. Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, speaking to Dawn , dismissed reports of internal rifts within the party as “disinformation.” “There can be differences of opinion, that is the beauty of a political party. In the last parliamentary party meeting, it was unanimously decided that all decisions will be taken by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, and the entire party will follow his lead,” he said. CM KP Sohail Afridi again barred from meeting Imran Meanwhile, Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Sohail Afridi was denied permission to meet Imran for the 10th time on Thursday. Although he arrived at Adiala Jail, the police informed him that the meeting could not be allowed. Speaking to media persons, Mr Afridi said that it was strange that an elected CM was not being allowed to meet his party’s founding chairman despite court orders to the contrary. He questioned the state on the message being sent to PTI and Imran Khan’s sisters, who were peacefully protesting but were dispersed using water cannons. He asked whether the intention was to suggest that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was not considered part of Pakistan. He warned that both the federal and Punjab government leadership would face consequences once the PTI returned to power at the Centre. Afridi said that efforts had been underway for the past three years to “minus Imran” , but all such attempts had failed. He added that the government and the “powers that be” should engage in talks with Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, as Imran had authorised them to represent him in negotiations. Replying to a question about Faiz Hameed’s sentencing, Afridi said it was an “internal matter of the institution”. Early on Wednesday morning, authorities used water cannons to disperse protesters, including the sisters of the PTI founder, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier. The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration. The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”.",

      "summary": "Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Sohail Afridi was denied permission to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for the 10th time on Thursday by the Adiala jail administration, while party leaders remain divided over the continuation of prolonged sit-ins outside the jail, warning that they could adversely affect the incarcerated leader. Politi­cal temperatures rose further a day earlier, as Rawalpindi police sought a legal opinion on the question of registering an FIR against PTI leaders and supporters over a protest outside Adiala jail, even as the party moved a privilege motion in the National Assembly over alleged use of force against its workers, and voiced alarm at reports of Imran Khan’s possible transfer to another prison. The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil. Some party leaders believe token protests should continue outside Adiala jail, warning that a halt could give the “powers that be” an excuse to create a “scene” and potentially transfer Imran to another facility.

There is growing, at least somewhat bipartisan unease in Washington over the administration’s escalating military posture in the region. Trump has accused Venezuela of facilitating drug trafficking, and increased the US military presence in the Caribbean to a level not seen in decades. The administration has also conducted a campaign of bombings of alleged drug boats, killing more than 80 people so far. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "The Supreme Court (SC) on Thursday stayed trial proceedings against rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts until their pending appeals were decided by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The court issued the directives as a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and comprising Justice Salahuddin Panwhar and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, heard Imaan’s appeal seeking to set aside the IHC’s Dec 1 order refusing to grant interim relief by staying the trial in the case. Imaan and her husband Abdul Hadi Mohammad Ali — who are facing a trial under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) — had moved an application in the SC requesting the urgent hearing of their appeal against the IHC’s refusal to grant interim relief. The petitioners have already filed a criminal revision before the IHC challenging the trial proceedings on grounds of due process violations under the CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in their absence. During today’s SC proceedings, Justice Kakar, while dictating the order, said, “We expect the IHC to decide on the fate of the petition after providing a full opportunity of hearing to both parties.” The order stayed the trial court proceedings, which were scheduled to resume on Dec 15 by Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka. Imaan and her husband were represented by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi whereas Additional Attorney General (AAG) Rana Asadur Rehman opposed the maintainability of the appeal. During the hearing, Justice Kakar observed that it was common practice for the plaintiff to devise their own strategies to fight the case, but the court would neither belittle nor undermine the trial court judge. Meanwhile, Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsas also attended the proceedings, which caused a lot of chatter on social media. Responding to a journalist who termed the presence of the ambassador as a “breach of diplomatic norms”, Imaan said, “Who is going to explain to this genius that diplomats routinely observe court proceedings — that is not equivalent to them taking a position on any case. “This is a standard practice but it’s very clear where the pressure is coming from to malign the ambassador,” she said. The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under Peca. The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan says terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses ‘gravest threat’ to national security, sovereignty",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday that terrorism emanating from Afghan soil posed the “gravest threat” to the country’s national security and sovereignty. Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad made the remarks while addressing a debate in New York on the situation in Afghanistan. In his statement, he highlighted Islamabad’s concerns about security, humanitarian, and socio-economic challenges emerging from neighbouring Afghanistan. Briefing the UNSC on Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, the ambassador said Pakistan had maintained consistent engagement with the Afghan Taliban, conducting high-level visits, facilitating humanitarian relief, supporting the transportation of goods, and announcing trade and transit concessions. Despite these efforts, he said, threats persisted, creating mounting security challenges for Pakistan and the wider region. “Afghanistan is once again a safe sanctuary for terrorist groups and proxies, with devastating consequences and mounting security challenges for its immediate neighbours, particularly Pakistan, and the region and beyond.” He said Afghan authorities were failing to take concrete measures against terrorist groups, adding that Pakistan had witnessed a surge in militant attacks that were planned, financed and orchestrated using Afghan soil under their watch. “Just this year alone, we have lost close to 1,200 lives to terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Since 2022, more than 214 Afghan terrorists, including suicide bombers, have been neutralised in Pakistan during counter-terror operations,” he said. “Terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses the gravest threat to Pakistan’s national security and sovereignty,” the envoy said, adding that terrorist groups, including the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al-Qaeda, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), and the Majeed Brigade, enjoyed “safe haven” in the neighbouring country. He said Pakistan had successfully thwarted multiple infiltration attempts by TTP and BLA terrorists from across Afghanistan, confiscating caches of military grade equipment left behind by international forces in Afghanistan. “These efforts have had a human cost, with huge sacrifices by our valiant security forces and civilians,” he said. “Elements within the Taliban rank and file are supporting these terrorist groups and allowing them safe passage to operate with impunity and free will. There is also credible evidence of collaboration among these terrorist groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists, and coordinated attacks against Pakistan using the Afghan soil,” he said. “And not surprisingly, one detractor in the region, opportunist, and spoiler, has moved fast to intensify its sponsorship of terrorist activity through material, technical and financial support, to terrorist groups and proxies active against Pakistan from Afghan soil,” he added, without taking any names. Ambassador Ahmad also urged the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to strengthen efforts to prevent illicit arms trade and provide an objective assessment of border security, emphasising that cross-border terrorism was the primary issue behind border clashes between the two countries. He also highlighted Pakistan’s efforts to engage with the Afghan Taliban, including recent talks held in Doha and Istanbul. He expressed gratitude to the governments of Qatar and Türkiye for facilitating dialogue with the Afghan Taliban and called for concrete, verifiable action by them against terrorist groups. He warned that failure to do so would result in Pakistan taking “all necessary defensive measures” to protect its citizens and sovereignty. Ambassador Ahmad also highlighted Pakistan’s decades-long role in hosting Afghan refugees. He told the UNSC that millions of Afghans had been welcomed over the past four decades despite Pakistan’s own constraints. “With conflict now ended, we expect that Afghans will now return to their country of origin in a dignified, phased and orderly manner,” he said. The envoy said Pakistan would continue to extend all possible assistance to the Afghans but also called on the international community to “shoulder its responsibility”. He also noted Pakistan’s visa regime, saying that it allowed Afghans to enter the country legally for purposes such as education, health, business, and family visits. He highlighted that more than 536,000 medical visas have been issued since September 2023. The envoy stressed that Pakistan sought a peaceful, stable, interconnected, and prosperous Afghanistan — one that was at peace with itself and its neighbours. He cautioned that bilateral engagements should not be used by countries with negative agendas to destabilise the Pakistan–Afghanistan border or the wider region. “No country desires peace and stability in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. No country has suffered from the consequences of decades of conflict more than Pakistan,” he said. Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to work for peace in Afghanistan, emphasising that lasting stability could only be achieved through sincere dialogue with the Afghan Taliban, respect for international obligations, and strengthened regional cooperation. He called upon the international community to remain engaged, provide humanitarian support, and assist in fostering a security environment conducive to long-term development and prosperity in Afghanistan and the region. Recent reporting provides a stark backdrop to Pakistan’s warnings at the UNSC. A report by US watchdog Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has confirmed that billions of dollars’ worth of American-supplied weapons, military equipment, and security infrastructure left behind during the 2021 US withdrawal now form the backbone of the Afghan Taliban’s security apparatus. Parallel assessments by UN monitoring teams and investigative reporting by the Washington Post indicate that some of these weapons have already reached the TTP, strengthening a group responsible for escalating attacks inside Pakistan. A UN panel also reported that the Taliban continue to provide logistical and operational support to the TTP, reinforcing Islamabad’s concerns about safe havens for terrorists and cross-border militancy.",
