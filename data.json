      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Sunday lost their blockbuster clash with arch-rivals India by 61 runs, being bowled out for 114 in Colombo. With the win against Pakistan, India made it to the Super Eight. Pakistan, however, will have to beat Namibia in their last group-stage match on February 18 to qualify for the next round. After the match, criticism of the national team’s performance flooded social media, coming from former players and cricketing icons. Former Pakistan player and commentator Ramiz Raja called the match “a bit of a disaster — especially batting”. “India have been fielding [the] same bowling attack against Pakistan since last two or three years, and every time [the] batsmen have been woefully ordinary,” he said in a post on X, adding that there was no growth. Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Mohammad Yousuf took aim at Shaheen Shah Afridi, Babar Azam and Shadab Khan, saying that “time’s up” for them. “Pakistan’s T20 squad needs new performers, not empty wins against weaker sides,” he said. Former opener Ahmed Shahzad called Pakistan’s performance “pathetic cricket” and said it was the “sad story of Pakistan cricket. Same old faces, same old results. Please don’t fool the nation anymore.” However, he noted that there was still time to bring in some positive change by bringing in Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Nafay and Salman Mirza. “They should be playing,” he added. Pakistan player Sohaib Maqsood criticised Pakistan’s bowling, calling it “by far the reason for today’s defeat”. “It’s not a 180 [run] pitch, even 140 could have been tough to chase on this pitch,” Maqsood said on X. He added that Pakistan prepared on similar pitches against Australia at home before [the] World Cup, noting that “Agha won all the tosses and batted first. Why [choose] to bowl first today?” Former England captain Michael Vaughan opined that India “seem to intimidate Pakistan on the cricket field”. “They (India) are so much better in all facets of the game and [have] such a better mentality of coping with the huge occasion,” he said. Indian commentator Harsha Bhogle stated that Pakistan’s cricket administration put far too much pressure on the team. “You could see that in how tentative they were,” he wrote on X. More to follow.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Vienna on Sunday for his two-day tour of Austria, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. “The prime minister and the Pakistani delegation were warmly welcomed upon arrival at the Vienna International Airport, and a contingent of the Austrian Armed Forces presented a salute,” the statement read. Earlier in the day, the Foreign Office said the premier was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and one of his aides. The government’s official X account shared a video earlier in the day of the premier and his delegation departing for Vienna from PAF Base Lahore. In its statement , the Foreign Office (FO) noted that the trip marked “the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria in over three decades, the last having been undertaken by the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1992”. PM Shehbaz is undertaking the visit at the invitation of Austrian Chancellor Christian Stocker. The two leaders will hold bilateral meetings at the Federal Chancellery in Vienna and “co-chair a meeting of prominent business leaders aimed at enhancing the volume of investment between the two countries”, the government post said. “The prime minister’s official visit to Austria will add new dimensions to the bilateral relations between the two countries,” the statement added. The premier will also attend and address the Pakistan-Austria Business Forum, which will be organised by the Austrian Economic Chamber (WKO). Additionally, during the two-day visit, PM Shehbaz is also expected to meet International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. In September 2025, Grossi acknowledged the country’s steady progress and close cooperation with the agency, observing that Pakis­tan’s nuclear power programme was advancing “at a good pace”. PM Shehbaz will also address a United Nations event on the theme of “Sustainable Development: The Path to Global Peace and Prosperity.” He is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi. The visit marks 70 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, the FO noted in its press release. It added that the two leaders “will take stock of the entire gamut of bilateral relations”. “Pakistan and Austria enjoy cordial and friendly relations, underpinned by shared values of dialogue, cooperation, an international order based on the principles of the UN Charter, multilateralism, and respect for international law,” FO said.",

      "title_orig": "Medical team leaves Adiala Jail after examining Imran Khan, PTI rejects inspection",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A team of doctors examined PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Sunday and left the premises after around an hour, sources said, as the party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”. On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday). Although government figures on Saturday had hinted that Imran would soon be taken to a hospital, no such development had occurred till Sunday afternoon. At 3:45pm, however, Imran’s sister Noreen Khanum said on X that an “ambulance has reached Adiala jail to move Khan sahib to a hospital”. “But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib ’s personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she added. According to sources, Adiala’s jail superintendent, however, dismissed the development as a “rumour”, saying that Imran was only being examined and not being taken anywhere yet. “The medical team will examine Imran’s eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the jail superintendent was quoted as saying by the sources. At about 5:30pm, sources said that the eye examination, carried out by a team of five doctors, was completed. “A detailed eye examination and blood sampling were carried out, while his blood pressure was also checked,” they said. “Senior doctors continued the medical examination for an hour,” they said, adding that the medical team was able to start the examination after waiting for two-and-a-half hours. They said that the team brought eye examination equipment with them and that their report is “likely to be compiled soon”. Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family. On the other hand, shortly after the eye examination was completed, the PTI refused to accept the inspection, saying that without the presence of the PTI family and Imran’s personal doctors, the government’s stance was “deemed malicious”. “Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan’s eye in Adiala Jail. The government’s claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the PTI said in a post on X. “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership. In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan’s family. “And the family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan’s personal doctors are present during the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification.” Aleema demands Imran’s treatment as per personal doctors’ advice Earlier in the day, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said the party would not accept any medical board formed without the approval of the PTI founder’s personal doctors. Aleema referred to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry’s post from Saturday, which announced that a medical board would be set up. She added, “Secondly, we are hearing in the news that Imran Khan is to be taken to Al Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi. “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment WITHOUT the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.” The former prime minister’s sister affirmed: “We do NOT accept any medical board they set up and control! We do NOT accept any reports or results they manufacture.” She added that the family was “extremely worried as to why they are resisting the selection of specialists advised” by Imran’s personal doctors. “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan’s personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan’s family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?” Aleema wondered. Earlier on Sunday, Imran’s longtime personal physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, issued a joint video statement , reiterating that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad,” read the post accompanying their statement. ‘Will continue sit-in to pressure govt’ Meanwhile, the sit-in by the main opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) at Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health entered its third day on Sunday. The alliance had announced staging the sit-in until the ex-premier was taken to a hospital of his personal doctors’ choice. Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital. “We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party. “We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn . He said that the government representatives, throughout the day on Sunday, remained in contact with the PTI and TTAP leadership but could not give a proper response that the demands had been approved. TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, while talking to Dawn , said that the sit-ins were being held at all three places, i.e. in the Parliament house, outside the Parliament lodges and at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, where the KP chief minister has been staging a sit-in. “It is unfortunate that even water and food are not being allowed to reach the Parliament House. We have been eating dates and biscuits. Mineral water has been consumed, so now parliamentarians have been drinking tap water,” he claimed. Yousafzai said that the strikes will be continued till the outcome. “History is in the making”, he said. Earlier in the day, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan shared visuals of himself, TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Qaiser and Senator Faisal Javed, among others, sitting at Parliament House. A TTAP leader, wishing not to be named, told Dawn that things have become more confusing rather than being streamlined. “Last night we were informed that Imran Khan will be shifted to Shifa International Hospital [in Islamabad], but a demand was made that doctors in the medical board be changed, as including doctors of our choice will give a message that the government has gone on the back foot. “[Therefore,] we decided to show flexibility and gave names of a few more doctors, and there was an understanding that we will not reveal their names in the media,” the TTAP leader said. He added: “However, today we have been getting messages that first we should call off the sit-in and then Imran Khan will be shifted to the hospital and a medical board will be announced. How can we call off the sit-in without implementation of our demands?” he asked. Replying to a question, the leader said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — who is staging a sit-in at KP House in the capital — also contacted government representatives to make it clear that the situation could go out of his control if the issue was not resolved soon. He added that the government representatives told them that the interior minister was in Sri Lanka, while the National Assembly and Senate chairs were also abroad, making it “difficult to decide” for the authorities. In the evening, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) issued a statement, saying that Allama Nasir Abbas was in bad health and that a delegation of parliamentarians had arrived at Parliament House to deliver food to TTAP lawmakers. “Delivering food to parliamentarians is not allowed,” he said. “Female members are also inside, concern has grown.” He added that the delegation was at the door but was not allowed to enter the premises. “An atmosphere of fascism and oppression has been imposed on the country … The public mandate is being insulted,” Abbas added. “The leadership of the party that won 180 seats is in jail … it is unjust to give power to those with fewer seats.” ‘Inhumane, blatant violation of constitutional values’ Earlier, the TTAP said today was the “third consecutive day that access to food, water, and medicines has been blocked for the protesters encamped inside Parliament House”. “This action is not only inhumane but a blatant violation of fundamental democratic and constitutional values,” it added. The alliance further alleged that access to medicines was blocked for Senator Abbas, terming it an “extreme and condemnable act”. “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression,” the statement read. The TTAP stated that its leadership was firm on its demands, adding: “History bears witness that yazidi (tyrannical) tricks, sieges and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands. Such tactics only add to the record of cruelty; they cannot silence the voice of truth.” The TTAP reiterated its “clear demand” that Imran be provided full medical facilities at Islamabad’s Al-Shifa International Hospital, emphasising that providing quality medical facilities to a prisoner was the state’s responsibility, “not a favour”. The alliance vowed that it would not be “cowed by tactics of oppression, coercion and siege”. HRCP calls for ‘uninterrupted access’ to treatment The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “grave concern over reports regarding the deteriorating health of prisoners affiliated with the PTI, particularly” Imran and former Punjab health minister Yasmin Rashid. In a statement, the HRCP urged the interior ministry, the Punjab Home Department and the relevant prison authorities to ensure that “all such inmates are allowed immediate, independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to prescribed treatment”. “Their condition must be verified with transparency,” the rights body stressed. It pointed out: “Denial or delay of adequate healthcare to any detainee violates legal and constitutional guarantees, including under the Prison Rules, as well as Pakistan’s human rights obligations.” Awaam Pakistan leader Dr Zafar Mirza, noting the government’s assurances and the development of Imran speaking to his sons on phone, said: “The last two days have proven the power of non-violent peaceful protest, as it has before many times in human history. “Decision to let Imran Khan speak with his sons, move him to hospital, establishment of a medical board, all this has not happened in a vacuum and for nothing.” However, Dr Mirza stressed that the former premier “still needs access to a personal physician, family, and his cases also need to be heard without politically motivated delays”. “Awaam Pakistan is fully supporting the dharna (sit-in) as we are standing with the moral principle of human right to health care, and we are standing on the right side of history,” he affirmed.",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: A team of doctors examined PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Sunday and left the premises after around an hour, sources said, as the party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”. On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday). Although government figures on Saturday had hinted that Imran would soon be taken to a hospital, no such development had occurred till Sunday afternoon. At 3:45pm, however, Imran’s sister Noreen Khanum said on X that an “ambulance has reached Adiala jail to move Khan sahib to a hospital”. “But, this is unacceptable to us without us and Khan sahib ’s personal doctors being taken into confidence,” she added. According to sources, Adiala’s jail superintendent, however, dismissed the development as a “rumour”, saying that Imran was only being examined and not being taken anywhere yet. “The medical team will examine Imran’s eyes, conduct different tests, and decide whether there is a requirement to move him to a hospital or if he can be retained in jail and continue the treatment here,” the jail superintendent was quoted as saying by the sources. At about 5:30pm, sources said that the eye examination, carried out by a team of five doctors, was completed. “A detailed eye examination and blood sampling were carried out, while his blood pressure was also checked,” they said. “Senior doctors continued the medical examination for an hour,” they said, adding that the medical team was able to start the examination after waiting for two-and-a-half hours. They said that the team brought eye examination equipment with them and that their report is “likely to be compiled soon”. Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family. On the other hand, shortly after the eye examination was completed, the PTI refused to accept the inspection, saying that without the presence of the PTI family and Imran’s personal doctors, the government’s stance was “deemed malicious”. “Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf categorically rejects the recent conduct of the government and jail administration regarding the medical examination of former prime minister Imran Khan’s eye in Adiala Jail. The government’s claim that a message was sent to the party leadership to arrive at the jail at the time of the examination is, in fact, a crude attempt to divert attention from the core issue,” the PTI said in a post on X. “This matter was never about the presence or absence of the party leadership. In such sensitive and delicate medical matters, the constitutional, moral, and legal right to make decisions belongs to Imran Khan’s family. “And the family cannot make an informed decision until Imran Khan’s personal doctors are present during the examination. Therefore, inviting the party leadership symbolically has neither any moral rationale nor any legal justification.” Aleema demands Imran’s treatment as per personal doctors’ advice Earlier in the day, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said the party would not accept any medical board formed without the approval of the PTI founder’s personal doctors. Aleema referred to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry’s post from Saturday, which announced that a medical board would be set up. She added, “Secondly, we are hearing in the news that Imran Khan is to be taken to Al Shifa Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi. “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment WITHOUT the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.” The former prime minister’s sister affirmed: “We do NOT accept any medical board they set up and control! We do NOT accept any reports or results they manufacture.” She added that the family was “extremely worried as to why they are resisting the selection of specialists advised” by Imran’s personal doctors. “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan’s personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan’s family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?” Aleema wondered. Earlier on Sunday, Imran’s longtime personal physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, issued a joint video statement , reiterating that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad,” read the post accompanying their statement. ‘Will continue sit-in to pressure govt’ Meanwhile, the sit-in by the main opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) at Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health entered its third day on Sunday. The alliance had announced staging the sit-in until the ex-premier was taken to a hospital of his personal doctors’ choice. Speaking to reporters on Sunday afternoon, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital. “We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party. “We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn . He said that the government representatives, throughout the day on Sunday, remained in contact with the PTI and TTAP leadership but could not give a proper response that the demands had been approved. TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, while talking to Dawn , said that the sit-ins were being held at all three places, i.e. in the Parliament house, outside the Parliament lodges and at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, where the KP chief minister has been staging a sit-in. “It is unfortunate that even water and food are not being allowed to reach the Parliament House. We have been eating dates and biscuits. Mineral water has been consumed, so now parliamentarians have been drinking tap water,” he claimed. Yousafzai said that the strikes will be continued till the outcome. “History is in the making”, he said. Earlier in the day, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan shared visuals of himself, TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Qaiser and Senator Faisal Javed, among others, sitting at Parliament House. A TTAP leader, wishing not to be named, told Dawn that things have become more confusing rather than being streamlined. “Last night we were informed that Imran Khan will be shifted to Shifa International Hospital [in Islamabad], but a demand was made that doctors in the medical board be changed, as including doctors of our choice will give a message that the government has gone on the back foot. “[Therefore,] we decided to show flexibility and gave names of a few more doctors, and there was an understanding that we will not reveal their names in the media,” the TTAP leader said. He added: “However, today we have been getting messages that first we should call off the sit-in and then Imran Khan will be shifted to the hospital and a medical board will be announced. How can we call off the sit-in without implementation of our demands?” he asked. Replying to a question, the leader said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — who is staging a sit-in at KP House in the capital — also contacted government representatives to make it clear that the situation could go out of his control if the issue was not resolved soon. He added that the government representatives told them that the interior minister was in Sri Lanka, while the National Assembly and Senate chairs were also abroad, making it “difficult to decide” for the authorities. In the evening, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) issued a statement, saying that Allama Nasir Abbas was in bad health and that a delegation of parliamentarians had arrived at Parliament House to deliver food to TTAP lawmakers. “Delivering food to parliamentarians is not allowed,” he said. “Female members are also inside, concern has grown.” He added that the delegation was at the door but was not allowed to enter the premises. “An atmosphere of fascism and oppression has been imposed on the country … The public mandate is being insulted,” Abbas added. “The leadership of the party that won 180 seats is in jail … it is unjust to give power to those with fewer seats.” ‘Inhumane, blatant violation of constitutional values’ Earlier, the TTAP said today was the “third consecutive day that access to food, water, and medicines has been blocked for the protesters encamped inside Parliament House”. “This action is not only inhumane but a blatant violation of fundamental democratic and constitutional values,” it added. The alliance further alleged that access to medicines was blocked for Senator Abbas, terming it an “extreme and condemnable act”. “Prioritising any political disagreement over human compassion and medical needs is the worst form of oppression,” the statement read. The TTAP stated that its leadership was firm on its demands, adding: “History bears witness that yazidi (tyrannical) tricks, sieges and oppression have never suppressed movements, nor forced those standing firm on the right side to back down from their demands. Such tactics only add to the record of cruelty; they cannot silence the voice of truth.” The TTAP reiterated its “clear demand” that Imran be provided full medical facilities at Islamabad’s Al-Shifa International Hospital, emphasising that providing quality medical facilities to a prisoner was the state’s responsibility, “not a favour”. The alliance vowed that it would not be “cowed by tactics of oppression, coercion and siege”. HRCP calls for ‘uninterrupted access’ to treatment The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “grave concern over reports regarding the deteriorating health of prisoners affiliated with the PTI, particularly” Imran and former Punjab health minister Yasmin Rashid. In a statement, the HRCP urged the interior ministry, the Punjab Home Department and the relevant prison authorities to ensure that “all such inmates are allowed immediate, independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to prescribed treatment”. “Their condition must be verified with transparency,” the rights body stressed. It pointed out: “Denial or delay of adequate healthcare to any detainee violates legal and constitutional guarantees, including under the Prison Rules, as well as Pakistan’s human rights obligations.” Awaam Pakistan leader Dr Zafar Mirza, noting the government’s assurances and the development of Imran speaking to his sons on phone, said: “The last two days have proven the power of non-violent peaceful protest, as it has before many times in human history. “Decision to let Imran Khan speak with his sons, move him to hospital, establishment of a medical board, all this has not happened in a vacuum and for nothing.” However, Dr Mirza stressed that the former premier “still needs access to a personal physician, family, and his cases also need to be heard without politically motivated delays”. “Awaam Pakistan is fully supporting the dharna (sit-in) as we are standing with the moral principle of human right to health care, and we are standing on the right side of history,” he affirmed.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the United States that delivers economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying on Sunday, days before a second round of talks between Tehran and Washington. Iran and the US renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation. The US has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters . “For the sake of an agreement’s durability, it is essential that the US also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns,” foreign ministry deputy director for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. Iran has threatened retaliation against any US attack, but the official struck a conciliatory note on Sunday. “Common interests in the oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments, and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations,” Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers had not secured US economic interests. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made it clear that he would prefer diplomacy and a negotiated settlement. “No one’s ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we’re going to try,” Rubio said. In 2018, Trump withdrew the US from the pact that had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, and re-applied tough economic sanctions on Tehran. On Friday, a source told Reuters that a US delegation, including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday, a meeting later confirmed to Reuters by a senior Iranian official on Sunday. “Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be travelling, I think they are travelling right now, to have important meetings and we’ll see how that turns out,” Rubio said, without providing further details. While talks leading to the 2015 nuclear pact were multilateral, the current negotiations are confined to Iran and the United States, with Oman acting as mediator. Open to compromise Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signalled Iran’s readiness to compromise on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was “in America’s court to prove that they want to do a deal”. The senior official referred to the Iranian atomic chief’s statement on Monday that the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions as an example of Iran’s flexibility. However, he reiterated that Tehran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in past negotiations, with Washington viewing enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking such weapons. In June, the US joined Israel in a series of air strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear sites. The US is also stepping up economic pressure on Iran. At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the US would work to reduce Iran’s oil exports to China, Axios reported on Saturday. China accounts for more than 80 per cent of Iran’s oil exports, so any reduction in that trade would significantly lower Iran’s oil revenue.",

      "summary_orig": "BAJAUR: An additional station house officer was martyred after terrorists attacked a police station in the War Mamund tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district on Saturday night, officials said. According to a police statement, a group of terrorists attacked the police station using both light and heavy weapons. They added that personnel deployed at the station quickly acted and repelled the assault. “The police personnel successfully foiled the overnight attack of militants at the War Mamund station, but Additional SHO Gul Mahmood Din was martyred after fighting bravely,” said a senior police official who visited the area on Sunday morning with his team. The official told Dawn that all the other station personnel were safe and secure following the attack. Attacks on police personnel, law enforcement agencies, and security forces have escalated across KP and Balochistan, especially after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in November 2022. Earlier this week, at least four policemen, including an SHO, were martyred as armed terrorists attacked a police party in Paniala’s Wanda Budh area in Dera Ismail Khan, police said. According to a police statement, the incident occurred as the police party was returning after a search operation. Militants hiding in nearby forests opened fire on them, prompting the officers to return fire. Four policemen were martyred in the attack, and there were reports of as many militants being killed in the exchange of fire. 1 killed, 8 injured as mortar shell explodes Separately, in the Kardok area of Bajaur’s Salarzai tehsil, an unexploded mortar shell detonated on Sunday afternoon, killing a child and injuring eight other people, including a woman. According to initial reports and rescue sources, eight children and one woman were injured in the incident and were moved to Khar Hospital for medical treatment. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Riaz Ahmed Khan told Dawn that one of the children succumbed to their injuries, while four of the injured were referred to a Peshawar hospital for “advanced treatment”. Preliminary information suggested that the children found an unexploded mortar shell and brought it home. The shell later exploded, injuring nine people at the house. An initial investigation indicated that the incident was accidental in nature, but an investigation was launched. Local administration and security agencies cordoned off the area and began collecting evidence. Last September, at least four teenagers were killed, and two other people were injured when a mortar shell exploded in a field in Bajaur, according to police officials. Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafiq told Dawn about the incident and said that the dead and injured were transported to Khar Hospital. “Initial reports suggest that a mortar shell exploded in the field, killing the young men,” he said, adding that the deceased ranged in age between 13 and 18.",

      "summary_orig": "Gaza’s civil defence agency reported that Israeli strikes killed at least 12 people since dawn on Sunday, while a military official said the attacks were in response to ceasefire violations. Despite a US-brokered truce that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement. The civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force, said one strike hit a tent of displaced people in northern Gaza and another targeted an area in the south. Five people were killed and several were injured when an air strike targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the north, the agency said in a statement. Five more were killed and several were injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, the agency said, adding that one more was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City. The agency also said that one person was killed by Israeli gunfire in Beit Lahia in north Gaza. The Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals confirmed they had received the bodies of at least seven people. “Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack. He said the people killed there were hit as they slept. “We’ve been living under a truce for months, and they’ve still targeted us. Israel operates on this principle — saying one thing and doing another,” Askar told AFP . Funeral prayers Dozens of relatives and mourners gathered at Nasser Hospital, where the bodies of some of those killed were laid out in white shrouds. Men and women stood in prayer ahead of the funeral, facing the corpses in the hospital compound. A military official said Israeli forces attacked in response to Hamas violating the ceasefire agreement. “The violation included an identification of several armed terrorists who took cover under debris east of the yellow line and adjacent to IDF (Israeli military) troops, likely after exiting underground infrastructure in the area,” the official said. “Crossing the yellow line in the vicinity of IDF troops, while armed, is an explicit ceasefire violation, and demonstrates how Hamas systematically violates the ceasefire agreement with intent to harm the troops,” the official added. Under the terms of the ceasefire, which took effect on October 10, Israeli troops withdrew to positions behind a so-called “ Yellow Line ”, although they remain in control of more than half of the Palestinian territory. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem, in a statement on Sunday, accused the Israeli military of violating the ceasefire. “Targeting of displaced people in their tents is a serious violation of the ceasefire agreement,” Qassem said. Gaza’s health ministry says that at least 601 people have been killed since the truce began. The Israeli military says at least four of its soldiers have been killed in the same period. Media restrictions and limited access to Gaza have prevented AFP and other news organisations from independently verifying casualty figures or freely covering the fighting.",

He said the people killed there were hit as they slept. “We’ve been living under a truce for months, and they’ve still targeted us. Israel operates on this principle — saying one thing and doing another,” Askar told AFP . Funeral prayers Dozens of relatives and mourners gathered at Nasser Hospital, where the bodies of some of those killed were laid out in white shrouds. Men and women stood in prayer ahead of the funeral, facing the corpses in the hospital compound. A military official said Israeli forces attacked in response to Hamas violating the ceasefire agreement. “The violation included an identification of several armed terrorists who took cover under debris east of the yellow line and adjacent to IDF (Israeli military) troops, likely after exiting underground infrastructure in the area,” the official said. “Crossing the yellow line in the vicinity of IDF troops, while armed, is an explicit ceasefire violation, and demonstrates how Hamas systematically violates the ceasefire agreement with intent to harm the troops,” the official added. Under the terms of the ceasefire, which took effect on October 10, Israeli troops withdrew to positions behind a so-called “ Yellow Line ”, although they remain in control of more than half of the Palestinian territory. Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem, in a statement on Sunday, accused the Israeli military of violating the ceasefire. “Targeting of displaced people in their tents is a serious violation of the ceasefire agreement,” Qassem said. Gaza’s health ministry says that at least 601 people have been killed since the truce began. The Israeli military says at least four of its soldiers have been killed in the same period. Media restrictions and limited access to Gaza have prevented AFP and other news organisations from independently verifying casualty figures or freely covering the fighting.",

      "summary_orig": "Former US president Barack Obama criticised a lack of shame and decorum in the country’s political discourse, responding on Saturday for the first time to a post on Donald Trump’s social media account that depicted him and first lady Michelle as monkeys. In a wide-ranging podcast interview with left-wing political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released on Saturday, Obama also compared the actions of agents enforcing the president’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to dictatorships. The video, shared on Trump’s Truth Social account on February 5, sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting “fake outrage” only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and taking it down. Near the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas — the first Black president and first lady in US history — were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second. “The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven’t seen before…Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body,” Cohen said in the interview. “And so again, we’ve seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?” Without naming Trump, Obama responded by saying the majority of Americans “find this behaviour deeply troubling”. “There’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That’s been lost.” ‘Rogue behaviour’ Obama predicted that such messaging would hurt Trump’s Republicans in midterm elections, saying, “ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people”. Trump has told reporters he stood by the thrust of the video’s claims about election fraud, but that he had not seen the offensive clip at the end. Turning to Trump’s policies, Obama criticised his immigration crackdown in Minnesota and blasted the conduct of agents during the controversial weeks-long operation that was brought to an end this week. Obama called the behaviour of federal officers, which included two fatal shootings that sparked mounting pressure on Trump’s mass crackdown, as the sort that “in the past we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships”. Thousands of federal agents — including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — carried out weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in what the Trump administration claims were targeted missions against criminals. “The rogue behaviour of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous,” Obama said. But he added he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations. “Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organised way, citizens saying, ‘this is not the America we believe in,’ and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests,” he said. “That kind of heroic, sustained behaviour in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope. “As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this.” The aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota had triggered large protests and nationwide outrage. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was subject to a partial government shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Democrats are opposing any new DHS funding until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.",

Investors have been drawn to bullion amid global uncertainty, including market swings linked to US President Donald Trump’s shifting stance on tariffs and threats of military action against various countries. Pakistan’s stock market has also posted strong gains over the past two years, repeatedly setting new highs amid political and economic developments, lower interest rates and investor reluctance to hold US dollars. One tola gold on Jan 1, 2024, was available at Rs219,700 as compared to the current price of Rs526,962 on Saturday, reversing from a record peak of Rs572,862 on Jan 29, 2026. On Feb 13, the KSE-100 Index closed at 179,603.73 points, almost three times higher than its level of 64,661.78 points on Jan 1, 2024. Muhammad Shafi Jhakvani, vice president of the Defence and Clifton Association of Real Estate Agents (DEFCLAREA), said the prices of DHA and Clifton residential plots have increased by 25-50 per cent in different blocks and phases in the last two years followed by 25-75pc in commercial plots. Apartment prices have risen by 10-40pc. For example, the price of a three-bedroom apartment in a good vicinity of Clifton like Bath Island and Civil Lines, which was available at Rs 55-60 million in 2023-24, have now touched Rs75-80m and even higher in some projects. Similarly in DHA, the 1,500 square feet apartment’s price was Rs20,000 per sq ft (Rs30-32m), and is now around Rs28,000-30,000 per sq ft (Rs40-45m). The prices of 500- and 1000-square-yard bungalows have also gone up by 10-25pc. Normally in Pakistan and in Karachi, rental returns are 0.25pc per month and 3-4pc per annum. In residential properties, it also increases according to price hike and in some smaller units, it rises more than that because of shortage of rental inventories, he said. “Bungalow rent also soars according to rising prices but portions are in high demand because of again shortage of inventory,” Mr Shafi said. He said investors are active in Clifton commercial plots as big plots and prices have become costlier drastically in the last two years. In DHA Phase 8, the price has surged as investors have been very active since 2024. He expected new benchmarks in 2026, particularly in Phase 8 for both residential and commercial properties. Abdul Wahab Parekh, owner of Parekh Estate, said new 500-yard and 1,000-yard bungalows were increasingly being built as ground-plus-one units, often with swimming pools in the basement. A 500-yard ground-plus-one bungalow now costs Rs100-250m, depending on location, compared with Rs80-160m two years ago. A 1,000-yard ground-plus-one bungalow in DHA cost Rs130-450m, depending on the phase, compared with Rs110-350m two years ago, he said. Flat prices in various DHA phases were now around Rs20,000-35,000 per square foot compared to Rs15,000-20,000 two years ago. In Clifton, he said, a three-bedroom apartment (old or new) cost Rs25-50m, compared with Rs20-40m previously. Mr Parekh said commercial plot prices had also increased. In PECHS and on Sharea Faisal (left side towards the airport), commercial plots were priced at Rs1.5-2m per square yard, compared with Rs1-1.2m earlier. On the right side, they ranged from Rs1m to Rs1.5m compared to Rs700,000 to Rs1.2m. On Shaheed-i-Millat Road, he said, commercial plots were around Rs1.5m per square yard, up from Rs800,000 to Rs1m two years ago. He described I.I. Chundrigar Road as a slow market, with rates pegged at Rs400,000 per square foot. On the industrial side, Mr Parekh said no major new investment had arrived in Karachi in the last 50 years, with many owners dividing premises and land for non-industrial uses. Investors were shifting towards Nooriabad and Jhampir due to lower rates, he said, adding that 60-70pc of land along the Super Highway was “risky and controversial”. Mohammad Najeeb, a member of the Supreme Council of the North Nazimabad Association of Real Estate Agents (NNAREA), said the price of a 240-yard ground-plus-one house had remained more or less unchanged at Rs55-65m over the past two years, while a 400-yard ground-plus-one bungalow had risen to Rs60-70m from Rs45-50m. He said 600-yard ground-plus-one bungalows remained in the Rs70-100m range, while 1,000-yard ground-plus-one bungalows cost Rs180-200m, up from Rs140-150m two years ago. In North Nazimabad, he said, an old two-bedroom flat without a lift, generator or parking cost Rs5-7m. New flats with facilities were priced at Rs15-17.5m, up from just over Rs10m. Old three-bedroom flats were priced at Rs10-12.5m, up from Rs8-9m, while new three-bedroom units with facilities were priced at Rs17.5-35m, compared with Rs15-20m two years ago.

In a post on X, the minister said, “Imran Khan has been given the facility to talk to his sons on the phone and considering his health, it has also been decided to shift him to the hospital and form a medical board.” “The government prioritises humanitarianism and legal requirements. It is the government’s responsibility to provide facilities to every prisoner according to the law,” he said. “There should be no politics on a sensitive issue like health. PTI should avoid baseless propaganda or political point scoring. The government is fulfilling its responsibilities. Instead of politicising this issue, show national seriousness and tolerance,” he said. Shortly before Chaudhry, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that further medical treatment of Imran would be carried out by eye specialists at a specialised medical institution. “Pursuant to ongoing eye treatment of Imran Khan, further checkup and treatment will be done in a specialised medical facility by the best eye specialists. “A detailed report thereof will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” he said. The development came as parliamentarians from opposition parties, under the banners of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), continued their sit-in at Parliament House and KP House in Islamabad on Saturday for a second day, demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment. The sit-in was announced after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on Thursday that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others. PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that although he appreciated the announcement by the government, the sit-in would not be called off until Imran was moved to Shifa International Hospital and a family physician was included in the medical board. “It is unfortunate that for the first time in the history of Pakistan, Parliament was locked down,” Qaiser told Dawn . TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Yousufzai told Dawn that taking the PTI founder to the hospital was a principled stance. “We will not accept it if efforts are made to shift Imran to [the] Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. Moreover, we want a family physician in medical board,” he stated. However, another opposition leader said that it did not believe the statements by government ministers. “They have contacted us, but they have nothing in their hands and cannot take a decision. We will wait for the final outcome,” he said. In a post on X, Achakzai said that the sit-in would continue until Imran was “provided with medical facilities from eye specialists in the presence of his family and personal physician”. Separately, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, in a video posted by TTAP on X, said they had been informed that a phone call between Imran and his sons was arranged and that there was “willingness” to shift the ex-premier to Shifa International Hospital. “If it is so, then there should be no delay … why the delay?” he asked. Raja said that the delay was directly related to the “anger” of the party and its workers. ‘Parliament turned into a prison’ Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said on Saturday that Parliament House had been turned into a “prison”. “We have been inside Parliament since yesterday. We wanted to go outside but all the gates were closed,” he said in a video posted by TTAP on X. “Parliament and its premises have been turned into a prison; it is condemnable.” “We are not armed. We are standing here with nothing but our ethics and the strength of the truth,” he added. The Senate opposition leader noted that Imran, like other prisoners, had rights and that “90 per cent” of Pakistanis — both here and abroad — were expressing concerns over the PTI founder’s health. In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”. Demanding that they “be set free”, the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House. “We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”. “The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed. TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises. “On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said. According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night. Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in. PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors. She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour. We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.” She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye. Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament. “Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”. “Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”. The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released. He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked. Govt told to not escalate situation Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, flanked by former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza, warned the government to take steps before things got out of hand. They said that the government should not escalate the situation and eliminate political space for the opposition. They warned the government that it would not remain in power forever and urged it to go for dialogue and give respect to democratic principles. They also demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a hospital for medical treatment and that his family be granted access to him. They stated that the protest would continue until these demands were fulfilled. Khokhar also stated that he was prevented from taking food inside Parliament on Saturday morning and called the situation unjust. He also said that opposition leaders inside Parliament House were confined and roads leading to Parliament Lodges and KP House were blocked. Ahmad, meanwhile, demanded that Imran be provided medical treatment immediately. He claimed that direct responsibility for the situation was on the shoulders of the federal government. Reporters decry mistreatment The Parliamentary Reporters Association Pakistan (PRAP) strongly condemned the “obstacles, mistreatment, and rude behaviour faced by journalists” while covering the ongoing sit-in at the Parliament House, and demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed full access” to the premises. A joint statement issued by PRAP President M.B. Soomro, PRAP Secretary Naveed Akbar, and other office-bearers said the opposition had been staging a sit-in at Parliament House since yesterday, in which the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly (NA) and Senate, senators, and members of the NA are participating. “Covering such an important political process is the professional responsibility of journalists, and preventing them from doing so is a blatant violation of the principles of press freedom,” it said. According to the statement, “After covering the sit-in late last night, when Soomro, senior journalist Akram Abid, and other reporters reached the entrance of the Parliament House this morning, security personnel stopped them and pushed them away. “An attempt was also made to forcibly put Abid into a police van,” it said. The association expressed serious concern over the incident and said, “Preventing journalists from entering a national institution such as the Parliament House amounts to depriving them of their constitutional and professional rights. Turning the Parliament into a fortress and preventing the media from coverage reflects an undemocratic and authoritarian attitude.” It further said: “If the media is prevented from performing its duties, the timely and accurate dissemination of information to the public will be affected, which is harmful to any democratic society.” The association demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed unhindered access to the Parliament House and that effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents in the future”. The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”. KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful. “Imran Khan sahib ’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X. He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well. “Those opposing Imran Khan sahib , who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.” The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib ’s family and party,” Afridi added. “A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised. SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government. In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC. “The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted. Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”. “The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said. She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists. Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!” “Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”. “PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded. “Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.",

The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”. KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful. “Imran Khan sahib ’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X. He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well. “Those opposing Imran Khan sahib , who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.” The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib ’s family and party,” Afridi added. “A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised. SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government. In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC. “The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted. Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”. “The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said. She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists. Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!” “Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”. “PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded. “Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.",
