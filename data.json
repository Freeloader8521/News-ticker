      "summary_orig": "THE sit-in by the PTI and its allies, under the TTAP banner, over the health of their incarcerated leader Imran Khan can be seen as both a legitimate exercise in democratic agitation and a test of whether protest alone will yield meaningful political outcomes. No doubt, the right to protest is constitutionally protected and the opposition’s concerns that their leader receive timely and specialised medical care is warranted. Yet, even as it encamps outside Parliament House, a harder truth confronts the opposition. Protest is a tactic — one that politicians, including Mr Khan, have employed in the past with considerable success. But protest alone is not a strategy. It can certainly draw attention and mobilise support but it is not a substitute for sustained political engagement. Nor can it replace the arduous work of policy articulation and alliance-building that is required to convert street power into material political gains. Some of the PTI’s grievances carry weight. Concerns about due process and prison conditions resonate with many citizens who feel alienated from the system. The government should not ignore these sentiments. Democratic maturity requires listening, even to one’s fiercest critics — something that our politicians have little appetite for. It also requires restraint by the government, as heavy-handed responses will only deepen polarisation and reinforce the opposition’s narrative of victimhood. Fortunately, there have been recent signs that dialogue is not entirely doomed. For instance, a meeting earlier between the prime minister and KP chief minister suggested that channels of communication, however fragile, remain open, and that it is possible for political opponents to engage on issues that demand cooperation. This should not be underestimated and the opposition must draw the right lesson. Earlier, the opposition’s dramatic confrontations yielded results only when extra-parliamentary forces tilted the balance. Today, that dynamic is not in the opposition’s favour. In such a landscape, agitation without political engagement can become an exercise in futility. Without the magnetic presence of Mr Khan on the streets and without institutional fissures to exploit, protest on its own will not dislodge a government that retains its parliamentary strength. Such a situation does not mean retreat but rather recalibration. For instance, the opposition would need to frame clear, achievable demands not as ultimatums but constitutional rights. In the long term, however, the challenge is deeper. What is the PTI’s policy alternative on the economy or counterterrorism or social welfare? What alliances can it build across ideological lines? How does it envision institutional reform beyond personalised politics? A movement always in protest mode risks hollowing out its own capacity to remain relevant. For its part, the government must recognise that exclusion breeds instability. By addressing legitimate concerns, it can lower political temperatures and boost democratic norms.

      "summary_orig": "THE cricket world held its breath for one week when Pakistan threatened to boycott its T20 World Cup group stage fixture against India. But with back-channel talks having broken the deadlock between the stakeholders, on Sunday evening at the R. Pre­madasa Stadium, it will exhale in one collective roar. Pakistan versus India in a T20 World Cup is not merely a match; it is the fixture that keeps the sport’s heartbeat strong. Whatever the result, the game will remind millions why they fell in love with cricket in the first place. The venue itself is part of the narrative. The Premadasa Stadium has hosted many thrillers, but rarely one carrying this much baggage. Pakistan to face India today A used pitch — likely the same surface on which Zimbabwe humbled Australia on Friday — awaits the two teams. It is slow, grippy and low. In such conditions the ball holds in the surface, turns a fraction and rewards the bowler who can vary pace and trajectory. Spin, not raw pace, will decide the evening. Both sides have recognised the shift. India will lean on Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery, Axar Patel’s left-arm control and may also throw in Kuldeep Yadav’s wrist-spin — which has worried Pakistan over the past few years. Pakistan will counter with a carousel of their own: Shadab Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and, most intriguingly, the 30-year-old off-spinner Usman Tariq. Usman’s action has been the talk of the tournament. The brief pause at the crease, the low-arm sling, the ball that skids or dips — it has left batters guessing. He has already been reported twice and cleared twice. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha calls him the “trump card”. In the spin-friendly Colombo air, that card could be decisive. If Usman lands his variations on the money, even India’s middle order — Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rinku Singh — may find the boundaries suddenly distant. Yet Pakistan cannot rely on spin alone. The fast-bowling equation presents its own conundrum. Shaheen Shah Afridi remains the marquee name, the leader of the attack, the man who has delivered in big games. But the left-arm seamer Salman Mirza has been impressive in the lead-up, generating swing and hitting the deck hard. Conditions on Sunday may not offer extravagant movement, yet the temptation to play both, or to prefer Mirza’s current rhythm over Shaheen’s experience, is real. The management must decide whether sentiment or data guides the playing XI. Pakistan’s batting, meanwhile, carries familiar vulnerabilities. The top order has fired in the first two matches, with Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub providing brisk starts. But Salman Agha and former skipper Babar Azam have to make better contributions. Against India’s varied batting line-up, especially if Abhishek Sharma is fit, any collapse could prove fatal. Abhishek, the explosive left-hander, missed India’s game again Namibia with a stomach infection. He has since been cleared and insists he is fit. If he walks out at the top, the powerplay could belong to India in a hurry. Weather adds another layer of uncertainty. Colombo has been humid, and forecasts speak of a low-pressure system lingering over the Bay of Bengal. Morning and afternoon showers are possible; the evening is expected to be overcast but largely dry, with temperatures hovering around 27-28°C and humidity in the low-to-mid 70s. Political factor Off the field, the political backdrop is impossible to ignore. Only days ago Pakistan had threatened to boycott the contest in solidarity with Bangladesh after the latter’s exclusion from the tournament. Intensive negotiations in Lahore involving the International Cricket Council (ICC), the Pakistan Cricket Board and its Bangladesh counterpart produced a last-minute reversal as the ICC gave in to a few demands put forward by the PCB and the BCB. Now, fresh reports suggest that representatives of the BCB, PCB, the Afghanistan Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India may hold informal meetings on the sidelines of Sunday’s game. It remains to be seen whether those conversations yield concrete results on bilateral cricket or future tournaments. But the very fact they are happening in Colombo underlines how deeply intertwined sport and diplomacy have become. For Pakistan, the challenge is clear. They enter as slight underdogs India have won 13 of the last 16 T20I meetings yet the conditions are more even than at any recent clash. Premadasa Stadium is unlikely to be a 200-run ground on Sunday; 160-170 may be a fighting total. Discipline with the bat, control with the ball and, above all, composure under the weight of expectation will separate the two sides. The Green Shirts have the tools. Usman’s variations, the left-arm pace dilemma, a settled top order and the knowledge that they have already beaten strong sides in this tournament. But India remain the benchmark — clinical, deep and ruthless when the big moments arrive. Come Sunday evening, 35,000 spectators will pack the Premadasa, millions more will tune in across the Subcontinent and beyond, and the world will remember why this fixture still matters. Win, lose or tie, cricket will be the richer for it. The oxygen is back. Let the match begin. Published in Dawn, February 15th, 2026",

      "title_orig": "Minister says Imran to be shifted to hospital amid opposition sit-in at Parliament House",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said on Saturday that the government had decided to shift PTI founder Imran Khan to a hospital, while the opposition continued its sit-in at Parliament House over concerns regarding the ex-premier’s health. In a post on X, the minister said, “Imran Khan has been given the facility to talk to his sons on the phone and considering his health, it has also been decided to shift him to the hospital and form a medical board.” “The government prioritises humanitarianism and legal requirements. It is the government’s responsibility to provide facilities to every prisoner according to the law,” he said. “There should be no politics on a sensitive issue like health. PTI should avoid baseless propaganda or political point scoring. The government is fulfilling its responsibilities. Instead of politicising this issue, show national seriousness and tolerance,” he said. Shortly before Chaudhry, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that further medical treatment of Imran would be carried out by eye specialists at a specialised medical institution. “Pursuant to ongoing eye treatment of Imran Khan, further checkup and treatment will be done in a specialised medical facility by the best eye specialists. “A detailed report thereof will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” he said. The development came as parliamentarians from opposition parties, under the banners of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), continued their sit-in at Parliament House and KP House in Islamabad on Saturday for a second day, demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment. The sit-in was announced after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on Thursday that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others. PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that although he appreciated the announcement by the government, the sit-in would not be called off until Imran was moved to Shifa International Hospital and a family physician was included in the medical board. “It is unfortunate that for the first time in the history of Pakistan, Parliament was locked down,” Qaiser told Dawn . TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Yousufzai told Dawn that taking the PTI founder to the hospital was a principled stance. “We will not accept it if efforts are made to shift Imran to [the] Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. Moreover, we want a family physician in medical board,” he stated. However, another opposition leader said that it did not believe the statements by government ministers. “They have contacted us, but they have nothing in their hands and cannot take a decision. We will wait for the final outcome,” he said. In a post on X, Achakzai said that the sit-in would continue until Imran was “provided with medical facilities from eye specialists in the presence of his family and personal physician”. Separately, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, in a video posted by TTAP on X, said they had been informed that a phone call between Imran and his sons was arranged and that there was “willingness” to shift the ex-premier to Shifa International Hospital. “If it is so, then there should be no delay … why the delay?” he asked. Raja said that the delay was directly related to the “anger” of the party and its workers. ‘Parliament turned into a prison’ Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said on Saturday that Parliament House had been turned into a “prison”. “We have been inside Parliament since yesterday. We wanted to go outside but all the gates were closed,” he said in a video posted by TTAP on X. “Parliament and its premises have been turned into a prison; it is condemnable.” “We are not armed. We are standing here with nothing but our ethics and the strength of the truth,” he added. The Senate opposition leader noted that Imran, like other prisoners, had rights and that “90 per cent” of Pakistanis — both here and abroad — were expressing concerns over the PTI founder’s health. In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”. Demanding that they “be set free”, the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House. “We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”. “The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed. TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises. “On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said. According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night. Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in. PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors. She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour. We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.” She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye. Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament. “Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”. “Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”. The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released. He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked. Govt told to not escalate situation Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, flanked by former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza, warned the government to take steps before things got out of hand. They said that the government should not escalate the situation and eliminate political space for the opposition. They warned the government that it would not remain in power forever and urged it to go for dialogue and give respect to democratic principles. They also demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a hospital for medical treatment and that his family be granted access to him. They stated that the protest would continue until these demands were fulfilled. Khokhar also stated that he was prevented from taking food inside Parliament on Saturday morning and called the situation unjust. He also said that opposition leaders inside Parliament House were confined and roads leading to Parliament Lodges and KP House were blocked. Ahmad, meanwhile, demanded that Imran be provided medical treatment immediately. He claimed that direct responsibility for the situation was on the shoulders of the federal government. Reporters decry mistreatment The Parliamentary Reporters Association Pakistan (PRAP) strongly condemned the “obstacles, mistreatment, and rude behaviour faced by journalists” while covering the ongoing sit-in at the Parliament House, and demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed full access” to the premises. A joint statement issued by PRAP President M.B. Soomro, PRAP Secretary Naveed Akbar, and other office-bearers said the opposition had been staging a sit-in at Parliament House since yesterday, in which the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly (NA) and Senate, senators, and members of the NA are participating. “Covering such an important political process is the professional responsibility of journalists, and preventing them from doing so is a blatant violation of the principles of press freedom,” it said. According to the statement, “After covering the sit-in late last night, when Soomro, senior journalist Akram Abid, and other reporters reached the entrance of the Parliament House this morning, security personnel stopped them and pushed them away. “An attempt was also made to forcibly put Abid into a police van,” it said. The association expressed serious concern over the incident and said, “Preventing journalists from entering a national institution such as the Parliament House amounts to depriving them of their constitutional and professional rights. Turning the Parliament into a fortress and preventing the media from coverage reflects an undemocratic and authoritarian attitude.” It further said: “If the media is prevented from performing its duties, the timely and accurate dissemination of information to the public will be affected, which is harmful to any democratic society.” The association demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed unhindered access to the Parliament House and that effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents in the future”. The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”. KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful. “Imran Khan sahib ’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X. He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well. “Those opposing Imran Khan sahib , who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.” The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib ’s family and party,” Afridi added. “A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised. SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government. In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC. “The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted. Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”. “The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said. She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists. Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!” “Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”. “PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded. “Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.",

We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.” She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye. Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament. “Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”. “Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”. The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released. He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked. Govt told to not escalate situation Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, flanked by former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza, warned the government to take steps before things got out of hand. They said that the government should not escalate the situation and eliminate political space for the opposition. They warned the government that it would not remain in power forever and urged it to go for dialogue and give respect to democratic principles. They also demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a hospital for medical treatment and that his family be granted access to him. They stated that the protest would continue until these demands were fulfilled. Khokhar also stated that he was prevented from taking food inside Parliament on Saturday morning and called the situation unjust. He also said that opposition leaders inside Parliament House were confined and roads leading to Parliament Lodges and KP House were blocked. Ahmad, meanwhile, demanded that Imran be provided medical treatment immediately. He claimed that direct responsibility for the situation was on the shoulders of the federal government. Reporters decry mistreatment The Parliamentary Reporters Association Pakistan (PRAP) strongly condemned the “obstacles, mistreatment, and rude behaviour faced by journalists” while covering the ongoing sit-in at the Parliament House, and demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed full access” to the premises. A joint statement issued by PRAP President M.B. Soomro, PRAP Secretary Naveed Akbar, and other office-bearers said the opposition had been staging a sit-in at Parliament House since yesterday, in which the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly (NA) and Senate, senators, and members of the NA are participating. “Covering such an important political process is the professional responsibility of journalists, and preventing them from doing so is a blatant violation of the principles of press freedom,” it said. According to the statement, “After covering the sit-in late last night, when Soomro, senior journalist Akram Abid, and other reporters reached the entrance of the Parliament House this morning, security personnel stopped them and pushed them away. “An attempt was also made to forcibly put Abid into a police van,” it said. The association expressed serious concern over the incident and said, “Preventing journalists from entering a national institution such as the Parliament House amounts to depriving them of their constitutional and professional rights. Turning the Parliament into a fortress and preventing the media from coverage reflects an undemocratic and authoritarian attitude.” It further said: “If the media is prevented from performing its duties, the timely and accurate dissemination of information to the public will be affected, which is harmful to any democratic society.” The association demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed unhindered access to the Parliament House and that effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents in the future”. The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”. KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful. “Imran Khan sahib ’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X. He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well. “Those opposing Imran Khan sahib , who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.” The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib ’s family and party,” Afridi added. “A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised. SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government. In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC. “The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted. Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”. “The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said. She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists. Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!” “Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”. “PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded. “Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said on Saturday that the government had decided to shift PTI founder Imran Khan to a hospital, while the opposition continued its sit-in at Parliament House over concerns regarding the ex-premier’s health. In a post on X, the minister said, “Imran Khan has been given the facility to talk to his sons on the phone and considering his health, it has also been decided to shift him to the hospital and form a medical board.” “The government prioritises humanitarianism and legal requirements. It is the government’s responsibility to provide facilities to every prisoner according to the law,” he said. “There should be no politics on a sensitive issue like health. PTI should avoid baseless propaganda or political point scoring. The government is fulfilling its responsibilities. Instead of politicising this issue, show national seriousness and tolerance,” he said. Shortly before Chaudhry, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that further medical treatment of Imran would be carried out by eye specialists at a specialised medical institution. “Pursuant to ongoing eye treatment of Imran Khan, further checkup and treatment will be done in a specialised medical facility by the best eye specialists. “A detailed report thereof will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” he said. The development came as parliamentarians from opposition parties, under the banners of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), continued their sit-in at Parliament House and KP House in Islamabad on Saturday for a second day, demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment. The sit-in was announced after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on Thursday that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others. PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that although he appreciated the announcement by the government, the sit-in would not be called off until Imran was moved to Shifa International Hospital and a family physician was included in the medical board. “It is unfortunate that for the first time in the history of Pakistan, Parliament was locked down,” Qaiser told Dawn . TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Yousufzai told Dawn that taking the PTI founder to the hospital was a principled stance. “We will not accept it if efforts are made to shift Imran to [the] Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. Moreover, we want a family physician in medical board,” he stated. However, another opposition leader said that it did not believe the statements by government ministers. “They have contacted us, but they have nothing in their hands and cannot take a decision. We will wait for the final outcome,” he said. In a post on X, Achakzai said that the sit-in would continue until Imran was “provided with medical facilities from eye specialists in the presence of his family and personal physician”. Separately, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, in a video posted by TTAP on X, said they had been informed that a phone call between Imran and his sons was arranged and that there was “willingness” to shift the ex-premier to Shifa International Hospital. “If it is so, then there should be no delay … why the delay?” he asked. Raja said that the delay was directly related to the “anger” of the party and its workers. ‘Parliament turned into a prison’ Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said on Saturday that Parliament House had been turned into a “prison”. “We have been inside Parliament since yesterday. We wanted to go outside but all the gates were closed,” he said in a video posted by TTAP on X. “Parliament and its premises have been turned into a prison; it is condemnable.” “We are not armed. We are standing here with nothing but our ethics and the strength of the truth,” he added. The Senate opposition leader noted that Imran, like other prisoners, had rights and that “90 per cent” of Pakistanis — both here and abroad — were expressing concerns over the PTI founder’s health. In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”. Demanding that they “be set free”, the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House. “We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”. “The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed. TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises. “On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said. According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night. Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in. PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors. She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour.

On February 6, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Police clashed with Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) workers outside the Sindh Assembly on Saturday. Footage aired on television showed police using tear gas, with workers running while covering their faces. The JI had announced that it would stage a sit-in outside the Sindh Assembly on Feb 14 to protest what it described as the Sindh government’s “failure to address Karachi’s issues” and alleged interference in the city’s institutions. Speaking on Geo News , Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that police and the provincial government were in contact with the party’s administration since 4pm, telling them that they may protest but not enter the Red Zone. “They were strictly forbidden from entering the Red Zone, but despite that, JI party workers entered the Red Zone, pelted stones at the police, and also tried to enter the assembly,” Memon stated. He added that police were forced to use tear gas and arrest workers. “You cannot enter the Red Zone under [Section] 144; the JI entering like this is a violation of the law,” the minister asserted. “No one will be allowed take the law into their own hands.” Asked about comments by JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, maintaining that the protesters were peaceful, Memon questioned why they had to come to the assembly when it was closed. The minister claimed that the only reason they wanted to enter the assembly was to vandalise it. “We’ve been in contact with them since 4pm, but they violated the agreement by entering the Red Zone and then pelted stones at the police. This kind of behaviour will not be tolerated from anyone,” Memon said. In a statement, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said that it had already been stated that permission would not be given to march toward Sindh Assembly. “Police were pelted with stones; we were forced to take this step,” he said. “Nobody is allowed to violate the law … taking the law into your own hands is absolutely not permitted,” he said. The Sindh home minister appealed to the public to remain peaceful and not become an instrument of those who wanted to spread chaos. Sindh Government Spokesperson Aqraba Fatima issued a statement encouraging the JI and all political parties to protest peacefully and within the ambit of the law. “Security concerns arise due to crowds in sensitive areas,” she was quoted as saying, adding that the JI need to act responsibly. The spokesperson added that the authorities have been in contact with the party so that the situation does not drag on. “Civil life being affected under the guise of protest is not acceptable in any way,” Fatima added. “The government believes in dialogue and the Jamaat-i-Islami is expected to cooperate positively.” She added that political activities should not affect Karachi’s routine and that peace in the metropolis is a shared responsibility. ‘Police attacked peaceful protesters with batons’ Meanwhile, the JI chief took to X and said that the “entire country is witnessing the fascism” of the PPP, attaching videos and photos of police action against the protesters. “Using tear gas on peaceful citizens and attempting to stop the sit-in at the Sindh Assembly is proof of the Sindh government’s failure and desperation,” he stated. JI provincial lawmaker Muhammad Farooq told reporters that police shelled and attacked peaceful protesters with batons, accusing the governing PPP of “fascism”. “We were coming to demand Karachi’s right to live,” he asserted. “The PPP arrested several Jamaat-i-Islami workers, which is an undemocratic act. Release the missing and arrested workers immediately.” The MPA said that the demonstrators were not heading towards a “palace” and that the people of Karachi “are not courtiers”. “When we pay taxes, the rulers enjoy their luxuries. The PPP provincial government is stripping the people of Karachi of their right to live,” Faroq asserted. “The PPP provincial government is not even allowing us to protest in accordance with the Constitution.” Calling the PPP a “product of authoritarianism which promotes fake democracy”, Farooq alleged that the United Nations had placed a ban on tear gas shells, which the police were using.",

      "summary_orig": "Five European countries — including Britain, France and Germany — accused Russia of “poisoning” opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison in 2024 using a “rare toxin”, on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. “The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin,” the countries said in a joint statement, following “analyses of samples” from his body. The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence. The epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America was found in samples and “highly likely resulted in his death”, the European states said. “Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death,” the UK foreign office added in a statement. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now “science-proven” that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered. “Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband,” Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference. “I was of course certain that it was a murder … but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts,” Navalnaya added. Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning. “Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice,” UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement. The countries said they had reported Russia to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog — the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons — over the finding. “We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons,” the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention. Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering. The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin’s inner circle.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for nationalist leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister. Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms. Tarique Rahman, chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in a car on his way to the mosque to attend Friday prayer, as results project BNP’s victory in the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday. His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia , served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.

Muhammad Yunus, Chief Advisor of the interim government of Bangladesh, shows his ballot as he arrives to vote inside a polling station during the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission. ‘Verdict of the people’ Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”. But a day later, he conceded defeat. “In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement. “We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.” Shafiqur Rahman, the emir of Jamaat-i-Islami Bangladesh, attends a press conference following the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”. The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties. China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP. International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been “credible”. The International Republican Institute noted that while “election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile”. ‘Successful’ Jamaat’s Rahman said his party “will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account”. Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told AFP that the vote had been a success. “It was by far the best election,” he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres. “People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it,” he said on Saturday. “If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court.” A man reads an English daily newspaper at a store, the morning after the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place. Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists. Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina. “With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics,” he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation.” Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule. Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence. Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced “daunting challenges”, including “boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process”. ‘History that has seen both challenges and cooperation’ The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Saturday said it looked forward to improved ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. In a post on X, the party thanked President Asif Ali Zardari for his “warm congratulations and thoughtful message“. The BNP noted that while Islamabad and Dhaka share a complex history marked by both challenges and cooperation, “yet our peoples have continued to value dialogue, respect, and regional engagement”. Expressing optimism about the future, the party said it “remained hopeful that the two nations would further strengthen constructive ties, expand economic collaboration, and enhance people-to-people contacts in the years ahead”. It added that “closer cooperation could contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia.”",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Saturday said the riverine (katcha) areas of Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur districts had been “100 per cent cleared” of dacoits during security operations carried out over the past few weeks. “It was a no-go area for the state, police, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), and other agencies. The writ of the state and its authority have been restored in the area,” she said while addressing a high-level meeting following the successful operation in the riverine areas. Briefing on the operation, she said it was launched in three phases. “The first phase was launched at the end of December, in which ground operations were integrated with aerial surveillance. It targeted multi-pronged criminal activity.” “In the second phase, we cordoned off major criminal strongholds, including Mach, Katcha Rajwani, and Katcha Karachi, and brought them under control,” she said. She further said: “The third phase was the surrender phase, which continued from January 7 to February 13, during which more than 500 dacoits and criminals surrendered, including high-profile gang leaders.” Maryam shared further details of the criminal gangs, mentioning the names of “Umrani, Sikhani, Dolani, Bingyani, Lathani, and Inder,” who surrendered in the third phase of the operation. She noted that 34 criminals who surrendered had Rs10 million in bounties on their heads. CM Maryam also shared details of arms recovered during the operation, including grenade launchers, sub-machine guns, shotguns, and pistols. The Punjab chief minister also thanked Sindh Police and the government of Sindh for the successful operation, noting that law enforcement personnel “faced challenges in the tri-border areas” connecting Punjab with Balochistan and Sindh. She added that the successful operation would not have been possible without the active participation of the Sindh Police and the Sindh government. Further elaborating on the operation, she said, “Latest technology, including drones, night-vision cameras, and quad-dopters, were used in the operation. Every movement of criminals was not only digitally monitored but also tracked through aerial intelligence assets.” She added that this left the criminals with “no chance to hide or run away.” “The Punjab government deployed 1,700 personnel for the operation, with armoured personnel carriers and bullet-proof vehicles to ensure their safety.” The chief minister noted that the operation was successful because “LEAs, intelligence agencies, the police department, and the provincial government acted as one unit.” “It was a coordinated and synchronised effort,” added Maryam. The chief minister further said, “No casualty was reported in the multi-pronged operation.” “From a zone of fear, it has now become a zone where there is rule of law, the writ of the state, and the authority of the state,” she added. She thanked and congratulated former Punjab inspector general of police, Dr Usman Anwer, who “played a great role” in the operation. Speaking about the police force in border areas, she said, “For the first time in 78 years, 53 women from the tribal areas of Dera Ghazi Khan were recruited and joined the border police.” Maryam further described it as an “unprecedented achievement that we have to maintain”, adding that the government was planning a development package for the area and had established a committee for the purpose. Last month, Sindh police launched an operation against riverine bandits. Since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters have taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested, Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: An Indian national has pleaded guilty in a US federal court to plotting the assassination of Sikh activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York, the US Justice Department said on Friday. Prosecutors said Nikhil Gupta , 54, admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with the failed plot. He entered the plea on February 13 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 29. According to the Justice Department, Gupta acted at the direction of an Indian government employee identified as Vikash Yadav , who was employed by India’s Cabinet Secretariat, which oversees the country’s foreign intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Yadav remains at large. Former Indian intelligence officer Vikash Yadav who has been charged by the US for allegedly directing a foiled plot to murder a Sikh separatist and Indian critic in New York City, at an unknown location, in this undated handout image released on October 17. — Reuters/File The department said that in May 2023, Yadav recruited Gupta to arrange the killing of Pannun, a US citizen and lawyer who advocates for an independent Sikh state known as Khalistan. Gupta contacted a person he believed to be a criminal associate, who was in fact working with US law enforcement. That individual introduced him to an undercover officer posing as a hitman. Prosecutors said the conspirators agreed on a $100,000 payment for the killing, and about $15,000 was paid in advance. The plot was disrupted before any attack took place. In a statement, US Attorney Jay Clayton said Gupta believed he could target someone in the United States “simply for exercising their American right to free speech,” but would now face justice. An FBI official described the case as an example of “transnational repression”. The case comes amid wider tensions between India and Western governments over alleged threats against Sikh separatists abroad. Canada has separately accused India of involvement in the 2023 killing of another Sikh leader outside a temple in British Columbia — allegations New Delhi has denied. Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic in June 2023 and later extradited to the United States.",
