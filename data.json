      "summary_orig": "PARIS: More than 150 European ex-diplomats and lawmakers on Wednesday urged France’s foreign minister to retract “inaccurate” comments about a UN expert on Palestinians rights who he wants to resign. France and Germany have called for Francesca Albanese to step down over remarks in which she referred to a “common enemy of humanity” after criticising “most of the world” and the media for enabling Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza. Critics and Israel have accused the UN Special Rapporteur of referring to Israel as a “common enemy”, while Albanese has denounced this as a “manipulation” and “completely false”. In response to a question about the comments, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Feb 11 told parliament she should step down. In an open letter, the former diplomats criticised what they called “the use of inaccurate and manipulated elements to discredit a holder of an independent UN mandate”. They called on Barrot to “retract his inaccurate statements about Ms Albanese and correct them.” “This controversy must not divert attention from the massacres of civilians, nor from the humanitarian crisis and the massive human rights violations taking place in Gaza,” said the signatories. The letter, written in French, was signed by mostly former foreign ministers and diplomats from the Netherlands. More than a dozen current members of parliament and senators from Europe were also among the signatories, along with a former foreign minister of South Africa. Columbia University activist A US immigration judge has blocked the deportation of a Palestinian graduate student who helped organize protests at Columbia University against Israel’s war in Gaza, according to US media reports. Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested by immigration agents last year as he was attending an interview to become a US citizen.

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: “There is no news of my son, whether [he is] alive or dead. I have been on the roads for 14 years… I have grown old, and people have to hold my hand while disembarking from a vehicle. But I protest here so that I get justice.” These are the words of the late Bibi Houri, immortalised in a brief clip that has been circulating on social media since her demise. Since 2012, when her son went missing in Balochistan, Bibi Houri had been a regular fixture at demonstrations staged by relatives of missing persons. Despite her advanc­­ed years, she would sit from dawn to dusk at the protest camps, pining for her son Gul Mohammad Marri and hoping for his safe recovery. The widow, in her 70s, who broke with societal norms by coming out of her home and seeking justice — on the roads, in court, and at police stations — breathed her last on Tuesday. Septuagenarian had been campaigning for her missing son’s recovery since 2012 “She used to come to the missing persons’ camp along with her missing son’s daughter — even on Eid,” recalled Nasrullah Baloch, chairman of Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP). Bibi Houri — also known af­­fectionately as ‘ Amma Hou­­ri ’ — hailed from Kohlu, a district dominated by the Marri tribe in eastern Balochistan. After the end of the fourth Baloch insurgency, which was fought predominantly by Marri Baloch tribesmen, her family went to Afghanistan along with the other Marri tribesmen. Upon their return, they settled in New Kahan, on the outskirts of Quetta, near the Hazarganji area. “After his cousin, Dr Moh­a­mmad Akbar Marri, went mis­­sing in 2010, Gul Moham­mad started struggling for his safe release because (Dr Marri’s) children were too young to come out,” recalls Nasrullah Baloch. “Instead, he himself beca­­me a missing person within two years.” An activist who used to participate in demonstrations alongside the septuagenarian told Dawn that Bibi Houri came into the media limelight in 2023, when several Baloch families staged a long march to Islamabad. At the time, the families of the missing — comprising mo­­stly women and children — were dealt with unsympathetically, being subjected to baton-charges and water cannons after they reached the capital. Besides Islamabad, the eld­erly Bibi Houri attended public meetings and protests in Mastung, Quetta, and Dalba­ndin, among other places. She would stand among the cro­wd, holding her son’s photo while calling for the recovery of all missing persons. “There are many women like Bibi Houri who search for their sons, brothers or husbands & sometimes die without ever knowing whether they are alive or dead,” journalist Munizae Jahangir wrote on X. “Houri worried for her son Marri’s children who are growing up without a father, she said she was old but she braved the rain & the unforgiving sun for them,” she wrote in her epitaph. Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari also lamented on X that there was no one to pursue Bibi Houri’s legal case following the imprisonment of her daughter, Imaan Mazari-Hazir, who had been handling it.

Upon their return, they settled in New Kahan, on the outskirts of Quetta, near the Hazarganji area. “After his cousin, Dr Moh­a­mmad Akbar Marri, went mis­­sing in 2010, Gul Moham­mad started struggling for his safe release because (Dr Marri’s) children were too young to come out,” recalls Nasrullah Baloch. “Instead, he himself beca­­me a missing person within two years.” An activist who used to participate in demonstrations alongside the septuagenarian told Dawn that Bibi Houri came into the media limelight in 2023, when several Baloch families staged a long march to Islamabad. At the time, the families of the missing — comprising mo­­stly women and children — were dealt with unsympathetically, being subjected to baton-charges and water cannons after they reached the capital. Besides Islamabad, the eld­erly Bibi Houri attended public meetings and protests in Mastung, Quetta, and Dalba­ndin, among other places. She would stand among the cro­wd, holding her son’s photo while calling for the recovery of all missing persons. “There are many women like Bibi Houri who search for their sons, brothers or husbands & sometimes die without ever knowing whether they are alive or dead,” journalist Munizae Jahangir wrote on X. “Houri worried for her son Marri’s children who are growing up without a father, she said she was old but she braved the rain & the unforgiving sun for them,” she wrote in her epitaph. Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari also lamented on X that there was no one to pursue Bibi Houri’s legal case following the imprisonment of her daughter, Imaan Mazari-Hazir, who had been handling it.

      "summary": "QUETTA: “There is no news of my son, whether [he is] alive or dead. I have been on the roads for 14 years… I have grown old, and people have to hold my hand while disembarking from a vehicle. But I protest here so that I get justice.” These are the words of the late Bibi Houri, immortalised in a brief clip that has been circulating on social media since her demise. Since 2012, when her son went missing in Balochistan, Bibi Houri had been a regular fixture at demonstrations staged by relatives of missing persons. Despite her advanc­­ed years, she would sit from dawn to dusk at the protest camps, pining for her son Gul Mohammad Marri and hoping for his safe recovery. The widow, in her 70s, who broke with societal norms by coming out of her home and seeking justice — on the roads, in court, and at police stations — breathed her last on Tuesday. Septuagenarian had been campaigning for her missing son’s recovery since 2012 “She used to come to the missing persons’ camp along with her missing son’s daughter — even on Eid,” recalled Nasrullah Baloch, chairman of Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP).

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA: Two days of peace talks in Geneva between Ukraine and Russia ended on Wednesday without a breakthrough, with Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelensky accusing Moscow of stalling US-mediated efforts to end the four-year-old war. Ukraine has faced repeated pressure from US President Donald Tru­mp to agree to a deal that could mean painful concessions, as Russ­ian forces pound its power grid and slowly advance on the battlefield. As the delegations met for a second day at a hotel in the Swiss city, under the mediation of US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Zelensky had called the first day “difficult”. “We can state that Russia is trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage,” he wrote on X. No date for talks to resume Moments after his statement, the delegations broke off the talks and said they would meet again in the future, without providing a date. Russia’s chief negotiator, former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, described the talks as “difficult, but business-like”. Medinsky — whom Ukrainian officials have accused of engaging in history lectures rather than substantive talks — spoke with the Ukrainians for nearly two hours after formal talks ended, according to a representative of Kyiv’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov. A spokesperson for Zelensky said the formal part of the talks had addressed territory in Ukraine’s east and the fate of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, both sticking points since the beginning of the process. Moscow wants Ukraine to cede the roughly 20pc of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian forces have been unable to conquer — something Kyiv has repeatedly rejected. Kyiv, meanwhile, wants Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to be operated by the US and Ukraine, which Russia has said is unacceptable. Pressure from Trump Tuesday is the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion , which has killed hundreds of thousands, driven millions from their homes, and ravaged Ukrainian cities, towns and villages. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians. Trump has twice suggested in recent days that it is up to Kyiv to make sure a deal is agreed quickly. He had told reporters on Monday: “Ukraine better come to the table fast. That’s all I’m telling you.” In an interview with the US news outlet Axios , Zelensky was quoted as saying that it was “not fair” that Tr­u­mp kept publicly demanding con­­c­essions from Ukraine, not Russia. Zelensky also said any plan requiring Ukraine to give up territory that Russia had not captured in the east would be rejected if put to a referendum. “I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision,” Zelensky was quoted as saying. The Geneva meeting follows two rounds of US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi that made no breakthrough. Both Zelensky and Umerov have made a point of repeatedly thanking the US for its mediation in recent weeks. Zelensky has expressed concern that US Congressional mid-term elections in November could draw Washington’s attention away from efforts to end Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two. Kyiv is also seeking strong US-backed security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks in the event of a peace deal. US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll and Brigadier General Michael Adamski took part in three-way military negotiations on Wednesday, according to a US official. Published in Dawn, February 19th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday that recognition of Israel by Pakistan was “not on the cards at all” as he highlighted the country’s support for the Palestinian cause. The minister made the remarks in an interview with France 24 . The comments come as the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, led by US President Donald Trump, will be held in Washington on February 19. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar will be attending the meeting. In the interview, Asif was asked about Pakistan’s decision to join the Board of Peace and if the country would contribute troops for a military force in Gaza. “I don’t see any problem in that. It all depends on what sort of terms of reference are drafted for that peace force,” he said, highlighting that Pakistan was a part of UN peacekeeping missions. “So we have that experience. Palestine is a cause that is very close to our hearts. We have been demonstrating solidarity with them for many, many, many decades,” he said. He said that Pakistan had supported the cause of Palestine on countless international forums. “So this is something worth attempting. This is a good opportunity. Let’s hope it brings us closer to the two-state solution in the Middle East,” he said. The interviewer then pointed out that many Muslim countries had normalised ties with Israel and asked whether this was on the table for Pakistan. “No, not yet. You know, I do not see this option even being considered by Pakistan. Maybe, in the future, when there is a total paradigm shift and two states are established and Palestinians have the right of self-determination, their own homeland,” he said. “At the moment, it is not on the cards at all,” he said. ‘India waging proxy war’ The minister was then asked about the security situation in the country, including the attack at an imambargah in Islamabad . In response, Asif said that there were almost “all franchises of terrorism” in neighbouring Afghanistan, which he attributed to the “non-seriousness” of the Afghan Taliban government. He said that the Afghan Taliban was providing terrorists safe haven on their soil. “Nothing can happen from across the border from Afghanistan … any attack in Pakistan, it has the blessings of the Afghan government,” he said. Asked about Pakistan’s strikes in Afghanistan, the minister said, “We always have that option and we can exercise that option. We won’t hesitate.” He further said that if terrorist outfits were operating from Afghan soil, the responsibility lay with Kabul’s rulers. Asked about India, the minister highlighted the military conflict between Pakistan and India in May 2025. “Our air force practically decimated whatever attempt they were making to invade Pakistan. So now they are waging a proxy war against Pakistan,” he said. “Delhi and Kabul and all these terrorist outfits are on the same page,” he said. He said that friendly countries had attempted to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul but “these attempts did not produce any results”. He said that the Afghan Taliban had accepted that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) was operating from their territory. “They indirectly said that they had no control over them. We told them that allow us to deal with them … they accepted their responsibility verbally, but whatever we agreed upon … they are not ready to give it in writing,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "An Indian university has been asked to vacate its stall at the country’s flagship artificial intelligence (AI) summit after a staff member was caught presenting a commercially available robotic dog made in China as its own creation, two government sources said. “You need to meet Orion. This has been developed by the Centre of Excellence at Galgotias University,” Neha Singh, a professor of communications, told state-run broadcaster DD News this week in remarks that have since gone viral. But social media users quickly identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, sold by China’s Unitree Robotics for about $2,800 and widely used in research and education globally. The episode has drawn sharp criticism and has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on India’s artificial intelligence ambitions. The embarrassment was amplified by IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw, who shared the video clip on his official social media account before the backlash. The post was later deleted. The stall remained open to visitors as of Wednesday morning with university officials fielding questions from media about accusations of plagiarism and misrepresentation. Galgotias has yet to receive any communication about being kicked out from the event, a representative at the booth said. ‘Truly embarrassing’ The silver mechanical dog — a model sold by Chinese startup Unitree —appeared at a booth run by the private Galgotias University at this week’s AI Impact Summit in New Delhi. Following online uproar over the professor’s claim in a televised interview, Galgotias said that while it did not build the machine, “what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies”. “You need to meet Orion,” the professor told an Indian TV reporter as the dog performed tricks such as waving at the camera and springing up on its hind legs. “This has been developed by the centres of excellence at the Galgotias University,” she said, touting the institution’s investments in artificial intelligence technology. “As you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes… it’s quite naughty also,” she said. In a statement posted on social media platform X, the university said: “Let us be clear — Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed.” The “recently acquired” Unitree robodog is a “classroom in motion” and “our students are experimenting with it, testing its limits”, it said. India’s Congress opposition party used the incident to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is hosting nearly 20 world leaders and dozens more national delegations at the five-day summit. “The Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own,” the party wrote in a post on X. “This is truly embarrassing for India,” it added, calling the incident “brazenly shameless”. The TV reporter who had conducted the interview, Tapas Bhattachary, urged viewers to take a broader perspective. “If one out of hundreds of exhibitors wasn’t being upfront about their innovation, I would not give up on the entire India’s youth who are very innovative,” Bhattachary said.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) announced on Wednesday it would end its days-long sit-in at Parliament House over ex-premier Imran Khan’s health concerns. However, it reiterated the demand being voiced by Imran’s family to grant the PTI founder access to his personal physicians and allow jail meetings with his relatives. Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas — flanked by National Assembly counterpart Mehmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja — addressed the media in Islamabad after a Supreme Court hearing concerning Imran’s cases. “Thanks to God, there is a minor improvement compared to the situation before, when the vision had gone completely — just a little bit,” Abbas told reporters. However, he criticised the government for “not taking on board” Imran’s family or personal doctors. The senator reiterated that Imran’s longtime physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, should be allowed to examine the PTI founder. Stressing that the opposition members would be glad to know about even the slightest improvement in Imran’s condition, Abbas said, “Therefore, as the month of Ramazan is also beginning, we will end our sit-in that we were staging in the parliament. “And in the next stage, we can take different measures as TTAP and we will do so as we have time,” he added. “If our rulers want to solve this issue, which has been raised across the world and the world has voiced concerns, then witnessing [is necessary],” Abbas said, calling for Imran’s personal physicians to be granted access to Imran. “When Imran Khan sahib has said he has concerns, then it means there are concerns,” the Senate opposition leader emphasised, calling for the ex-premier’s jail meetings with his sisters. “Whatever their demands are, which will satisfy them, should be taken,” he said, calling on the public to pray for Imran’s prompt recovery. Abbas also termed the demand by Imran’s family to have him treated at Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital as “genuine”, noting that there were independent and competent doctors there who were not subordinate to any government medics. Recalling the “extremely worrying” earlier reports of vision loss in Imran’s right eye, Abbas noted that the Adiala jail staff had not taken timely action to provide medical care to Imran. “This was a crime. God-willing, we are about to approach the court about this,” he announced. The senator stressed that the objective of the TTAP sit-in was to ensure that the “government does not commit any more mistakes”. “People across Pakistan — whether opponents or critics — were worried.” Claiming that Parliament House’s gates were shut, Abbas alleged that the parliament was “made a jail”. “Our MNAs were confined in the [Parliament] Lodges. The friends from KP were confined in the KP House,” he said, adding that cases under terrorism charges were filed against TTAP members. Abbas further said that Achakzai had vowed to go on a hunger strike if the reports of “Imran completely losing his eyesight” had turned out to be true. Earlier in the day, the TTAP leadership — including Achakzai, Abbas, Gohar and Raja — reached the SC to show solidarity with Imran during the hearing of his cases. “They may announce further strategy regarding the protest and will also address the crackdown on PTI supporters,” TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai had told Dawn . The TTAP also shared a video of Achakzai inside the SC premises and speaking to Imran’s sister Aleema Khan. Ahead of the SC hearing, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi met with Imran’s three sisters — namely Aleema, Noreen Niazi and Uzma Khanum. “A detailed discussion was held on Imran Khan’s health, judicial matters, other affairs and the challenges being faced in these,” the PTI said. SC again denies Latif Khosa meeting with Imran Meanwhile, the SC again denied PTI leader Latif Khosa a meeting with Imran, as the court indefinitely adjourned multiple cases concerning the ex-premier. A three-member bench, headed by Justice Hashim Khan Kakar and including Justices Salahuddin Panhwar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim, resumed hearing a set of petitions regarding the PTI founder. When the bench took up the matter of Imran’s eligibility to contest polls, Khosa requested that a meeting be arranged between him and the jailed party founder. To this, Justice Kakar replied, “You have taken away the power of taking suo motu notice from us. How can we order a meeting in a criminal case?” Justice Panhwar also questioned how the bench could issue directives in a case that was not fixed before it. Therefore, the bench dismissed Khosa’s request for a meeting. At one point, Justice Kakar told Khosa “not to speak about political matters while standing in the court”. “Speak on politics in the parliament,” the judge remarked. He added, “Now that you have said such things, tickers will also be aired about this and vlogs will also be made.” The SC then issued a notice to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and adjourned the hearing for an indefinite period. During his conversation with Justice Kakar about an old judgment that he had cited, Khosa brought up the matter of PTI’s intra-party elections. At this, ostensibly referring to Gohar, the judge acknowledged, “A big, living PTI chairman is sitting before us.” The appeals against Imran’s acquittal in the cipher case were adjourned without any proceedings as the prosecutor general informed the bench that the detailed order of the case had not been submitted. The prosecutor general sought more time to submit the detailed order. Here, Barrister Salman Safdar, who had appeared as Imran’s lawyer, informed the SC that he had not been issued a notice in the case. Justice Kakar observed that the court could issue a notice to him, but noted that the appeal’s maintainability was yet to be decided. Separately, the SC also indefinitely adjourned Imran’s appeal against a Rs10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during his time as the Punjab chief minister. Imran’s lawyer stated he had challenged the additional sessions court hearing the case, contending that the district and sessions courts have the authority to conduct the trial. The court then issued a notice to PM Shehbaz’s counsel Mustafa Ramday. KP CM announces ‘Free Imran Khan Force’ In yet another attempt to secure Imran’s release from jail, CM Afridi announced the formation of a “Free Imran Khan Force” for a “peaceful” movement. Addressing a press conference outside the SC, Afridi emphasised that a “public movement has now become unavoidable after persistent violations of court directives”, according to a PTI post on X. The KP CM said the “Free Imran Khan Force” will offer memberships for youth from across the country and would include professionals, members from the Insaf Students Forum (ISF), as well as the PTI’s youth, women and minority wings. “The Free Imran Khan Force will wage a completely peaceful struggle. After his release, Imran Khan will himself dissolve the force,” CM Afridi was quoted as saying. The chief minister elaborated that the membership cards would be ready within four to five days, with youth from Peshawar taking oaths after Eidul Fitr. TTAP ‘demands’ full medical access for Imran In the early hours of Wednesday, the TTAP also shared a list of five “immediate and unconditional demands”. The first was immediately granting Imran “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Yusuf and Dr Sultan, so “they could conduct a medical examination independently”. The alliance further asked for certified copies of Imran’s medical tests, diagnostic reports, X-rays, scans and laboratory results to be shared with his personal physicians. The TTAP also demanded that the PTI founder’s personal doctors be “given full authority to formulate their independent medical opinion without the presence or pressure of the government’s medical board”. It further sought “regular and continuous follow-up examinations” of the PTI founder by his personal physicians. Lastly, the TTAP demanded that, for transparency and accountability, the government clarify in writing why “any obstruction or delay occurred in the provision of treatment, diagnosis, and medical facilities”, and also provide assurance that such negligence will not be repeated in the future. The TTAP stressed that any kind of “delay, excuses or staged actions” would be unacceptable. “The matter of Imran’s health is not political, but a requirement of human and constitutional responsibility,” it added. Family members and senior party leaders have repeatedly attempted to meet him at Adiala jail in recent weeks, but most visits have been blocked by authorities. The SC’s intervention on February 10 allowed PTI lawyer Salman Safdar to meet Imran, with the ex-premier telling the counsel he had “ 15 per cent ” vision left in his right eye. This followed a “ medical procedure ” that Imran underwent on the night of January 24. A report prepared by a team of doctors who visited Imran on February 15 stated that, unaided, Imran’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left. However, the PTI founder’s family and the opposition alliance rejected the report and demanded that Dr Yusuf and family members be allowed regular and confidential access to monitor his condition. The TTAP framed their sit-in as a push against the government’s alleged negligence and lack of transparency regarding Imran’s treatment. More to follow",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) announced on Wednesday it would end its days-long sit-in at Parliament House over ex-premier Imran Khan’s health concerns. However, it reiterated the demand being voiced by Imran’s family to grant the PTI founder access to his personal physicians and allow jail meetings with his relatives. Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas — flanked by National Assembly counterpart Mehmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja — addressed the media in Islamabad after a Supreme Court hearing concerning Imran’s cases. “Thanks to God, there is a minor improvement compared to the situation before, when the vision had gone completely — just a little bit,” Abbas told reporters. However, he criticised the government for “not taking on board” Imran’s family or personal doctors. The senator reiterated that Imran’s longtime physicians, Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan, should be allowed to examine the PTI founder. Stressing that the opposition members would be glad to know about even the slightest improvement in Imran’s condition, Abbas said, “Therefore, as the month of Ramazan is also beginning, we will end our sit-in that we were staging in the parliament. “And in the next stage, we can take different measures as TTAP and we will do so as we have time,” he added. “If our rulers want to solve this issue, which has been raised across the world and the world has voiced concerns, then witnessing [is necessary],” Abbas said, calling for Imran’s personal physicians to be granted access to Imran. “When Imran Khan sahib has said he has concerns, then it means there are concerns,” the Senate opposition leader emphasised, calling for the ex-premier’s jail meetings with his sisters. “Whatever their demands are, which will satisfy them, should be taken,” he said, calling on the public to pray for Imran’s prompt recovery.
