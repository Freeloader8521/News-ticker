      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: The Washington Post said on Saturday its CEO and publisher Will Lewis was leaving effective immediately, just days after the storied newspaper owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos made drastic job cuts that angered readers. Though newspapers across the United States have been facing brutal industry headwinds, Lewis’s management of the outlet was sharply criticised by subscribers and employees alike during his two-year tenure as he tried to reverse financial losses at the daily. Lewis, who is English, has been replaced by Jeff D’Onofrio, a former CEO of social media platform Tumblr who had joined the Post as chief financial officer last year, the paper announced. In an email to staff shared on social media by one of the newspaper’s reporters, Lewis said it was “the right time for me to step aside.” A statement from the Post said only that D’Onofrio was succeeding Lewis “effective immediately”. Hundreds of Post journalists — including most of its overseas, local and sports staff — were let go in the sweeping cuts announced on Wednesday. The Post did not disclose the number of jobs being eliminated, but The New York Times reported approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off. The paper’s entire Middle East roster was let go as was its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent as the war with Russia grinds on. Sports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports , was suspended, local media reported. Hundreds turned out Thursday at a protest in front of the paper’s headquarters in downtown Washington. Newspapers across the country have cratered under falling revenues and subscriptions as they compete for eyeballs with social media, and as internet revenue pales in comparison to what print advertising once commanded. However, national papers like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have managed to weather the storm and come out financially solid — something the Post , even with a billionaire backer, has failed to do.

      "title_orig": "Agriculture: Computerising Sindh’s land records",
      "summary_orig": "The record of his agricultural land means a lot to a farmer, especially the owner of a small or medium-sized farm. It involves multiple stages within the provincial Board of Revenue (BoR) department before a grower is able to lay their hands on their land’s record. Since most landholdings are owned by small and medium-sized farmers, speedy access to their land records remains cumbersome for many in Sindh. Though Sindh’s revenue records were scanned over the past decade, procedures for mortgaging farmland, accessing passbooks, issuing sales certificates for land, and obtaining farm credit remained unchanged. This procedure still primarily revolves around the Tapedar (land record keeper) and the Mukhtiarkar (officer handling land disputes and mutation). For many growers, access to agricultural credit from banks was affected by this process, which needs simplification. Although People’s Service Centres (PSCs) were established in Sindh soon after the formation of the PPP government in 2008, the services mentioned above were not handled at these centres. They, instead, dealt with the provision of a computerised copy of form-VII, a principal document for agricultural land, form-II for urban land, and mutation of urban property records through sub-registrars. After the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December 2007, revenue records were lost in arson attacks that occurred in many districts at the time. This necessitated the scanning and storage of all records, as well as the entry of new records, in the Board of Revenue (BoR) data bank under the Provincial Record Cell (PRC). This automation project was termed the Land Administration and Revenue Management Information System (LARMIS). A farmer is considered lucky if he is able to meet all formalities in one go; otherwise, multiple institutional visits, loss of time, and financial costs to attain land documents are his fate The Sindh High Court had also intervened in the matter, considering the importance of land revenue records to ensure elimination of tampering, interpolation and forgery in official paperwork; an otherwise common phenomenon. This set the tone for the automation process. Later, BoR linked PRC to LARMIS while introducing e-stamps to eliminate the use of fake stamps — an infamous practice. This would result in a financial loss to the government’s kitty. Past and present revenue officials claim that the introduction of e-stamps has helped control the use of fake stamps and tampering, and has also contributed to revenue generation. Sub-registrars sit in PSCs to handle mutations in the registries of urban property and to issue computer-generated copies of forms. According to District Manager PSC of Hyderabad, Ghulam Ali, land deeds/registries have been linked with Nadra and the Federal Board of Revenue for biometric verification and property valuation, respectively. “Human intervention has been reduced through this procedure. Pictures of sellers and buyers, as well as the inspector of the sub-registrar’s office, are taken to make sure who is dealing with every single property,” he informed. However, by and large, PSCs have not served the farming community. According to farmers, PSCs don’t deliver services under one roof. Transfer, sale, and purchase of farmlands, as well as mortgaging and loan assistance procedures, are still manually processed. Farmers must still visit post offices to get passbooks. They must approach the Tapedar, Mukhtiarkar, and assistant commissioner at the taluka level before they can obtain the necessary BoR land documents. A farmer is considered lucky if he can meet all formalities in one go; otherwise, multiple visits, wasted time, and financial costs are his fate. Farmers have to chase revenue officials across different offices to get petty issues related to their property resolved if they intend to buy/sell land, or mortgage property to obtain farm credit. “Sindh as a province doesn’t have a proportional share in the disbursement of farm credit. Difficulties in getting BoR land documents when they are needed the most are the primary reason why we fail to get a loan,” said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, President of Sindh Abadgar Board. He explained this affects the cash flow, and farmers remain unable to use inputs as required for any major cash crop,” he contended. “Things are much better in Punjab. There, farmers can easily access farm credit because the entire bank documentation process can be completed under one roof, and the bank handles their documentation directly to extend loans quickly. But in Sindh, we face the decades-old cumbersome processes,” he said. Punjab established its Punjab Land Records Authority (PLRA) in 2017; this is not the case in Sindh. The Director General-led PLRA is a body that operates within the Punjab BoR. “No manual dealings of records are done by BoR staff any longer. Services centres are established at the tehsil level here, where computerised land record management for farmers is done,” said the deputy director of one such service centre in a Punjab district. According to Khalid Mehmood Khokhar, President of the Pakistan Kissan Ittehad, the entire record has not only been computerised, but it also provided at the tehsil level. “We face a problem of a different nature — the menace of illegal gratification,” he said. The Sindh government initially partnered with the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) to automate and computerise revenue records. It has established its own body, Sindh Information Technology Company (SITC), headed by Zainul Abiden Shah as of late. A Sindh BoR official involved in the automation process noted that a pilot project approved by the Sindh cabinet is underway in two districts. The project, in collaboration with the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Sukkur, is being executed in three dehs — two in Matiari and one in the Sukkur district. Officials hope it will be completed in the next couple of months, and then replicated in other parts of the province to simplify overall land management. “The pilot project will enable BoR to see what kind of issues are emerging during the trial, which will be accordingly fixed to make the system safe and sound. We plan to redesign the dynamics of revenue record automation and issue passwords to each farmer for land records to access them,” he said. Sindh has around 6,090 dehs of 138 talukas in 30 districts. The problem of non-existent infrastructure at the taluka level was a major impediment for the government. Learnings in this pilot project would help the government tackle the problems efficiently.

This would result in a financial loss to the government’s kitty. Past and present revenue officials claim that the introduction of e-stamps has helped control the use of fake stamps and tampering, and has also contributed to revenue generation. Sub-registrars sit in PSCs to handle mutations in the registries of urban property and to issue computer-generated copies of forms. According to District Manager PSC of Hyderabad, Ghulam Ali, land deeds/registries have been linked with Nadra and the Federal Board of Revenue for biometric verification and property valuation, respectively. “Human intervention has been reduced through this procedure. Pictures of sellers and buyers, as well as the inspector of the sub-registrar’s office, are taken to make sure who is dealing with every single property,” he informed. However, by and large, PSCs have not served the farming community. According to farmers, PSCs don’t deliver services under one roof. Transfer, sale, and purchase of farmlands, as well as mortgaging and loan assistance procedures, are still manually processed. Farmers must still visit post offices to get passbooks. They must approach the Tapedar, Mukhtiarkar, and assistant commissioner at the taluka level before they can obtain the necessary BoR land documents. A farmer is considered lucky if he can meet all formalities in one go; otherwise, multiple visits, wasted time, and financial costs are his fate. Farmers have to chase revenue officials across different offices to get petty issues related to their property resolved if they intend to buy/sell land, or mortgage property to obtain farm credit. “Sindh as a province doesn’t have a proportional share in the disbursement of farm credit. Difficulties in getting BoR land documents when they are needed the most are the primary reason why we fail to get a loan,” said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, President of Sindh Abadgar Board. He explained this affects the cash flow, and farmers remain unable to use inputs as required for any major cash crop,” he contended. “Things are much better in Punjab. There, farmers can easily access farm credit because the entire bank documentation process can be completed under one roof, and the bank handles their documentation directly to extend loans quickly. But in Sindh, we face the decades-old cumbersome processes,” he said. Punjab established its Punjab Land Records Authority (PLRA) in 2017; this is not the case in Sindh. The Director General-led PLRA is a body that operates within the Punjab BoR. “No manual dealings of records are done by BoR staff any longer. Services centres are established at the tehsil level here, where computerised land record management for farmers is done,” said the deputy director of one such service centre in a Punjab district. According to Khalid Mehmood Khokhar, President of the Pakistan Kissan Ittehad, the entire record has not only been computerised, but it also provided at the tehsil level. “We face a problem of a different nature — the menace of illegal gratification,” he said. The Sindh government initially partnered with the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) to automate and computerise revenue records. It has established its own body, Sindh Information Technology Company (SITC), headed by Zainul Abiden Shah as of late. A Sindh BoR official involved in the automation process noted that a pilot project approved by the Sindh cabinet is underway in two districts. The project, in collaboration with the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Sukkur, is being executed in three dehs — two in Matiari and one in the Sukkur district. Officials hope it will be completed in the next couple of months, and then replicated in other parts of the province to simplify overall land management. “The pilot project will enable BoR to see what kind of issues are emerging during the trial, which will be accordingly fixed to make the system safe and sound. We plan to redesign the dynamics of revenue record automation and issue passwords to each farmer for land records to access them,” he said. Sindh has around 6,090 dehs of 138 talukas in 30 districts. The problem of non-existent infrastructure at the taluka level was a major impediment for the government. Learnings in this pilot project would help the government tackle the problems efficiently.

      "title": "Agriculture: Computerising Sindh’s land records",
      "summary": "The record of his agricultural land means a lot to a farmer, especially the owner of a small or medium-sized farm. It involves multiple stages within the provincial Board of Revenue (BoR) department before a grower is able to lay their hands on their land’s record. Since most landholdings are owned by small and medium-sized farmers, speedy access to their land records remains cumbersome for many in Sindh. Though Sindh’s revenue records were scanned over the past decade, procedures for mortgaging farmland, accessing passbooks, issuing sales certificates for land, and obtaining farm credit remained unchanged. This procedure still primarily revolves around the Tapedar (land record keeper) and the Mukhtiarkar (officer handling land disputes and mutation). For many growers, access to agricultural credit from banks was affected by this process, which needs simplification. Although People’s Service Centres (PSCs) were established in Sindh soon after the formation of the PPP government in 2008, the services mentioned above were not handled at these centres. They, instead, dealt with the provision of a computerised copy of form-VII, a principal document for agricultural land, form-II for urban land, and mutation of urban property records through sub-registrars. After the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December 2007, revenue records were lost in arson attacks that occurred in many districts at the time. This necessitated the scanning and storage of all records, as well as the entry of new records, in the Board of Revenue (BoR) data bank under the Provincial Record Cell (PRC). This automation project was termed the Land Administration and Revenue Management Information System (LARMIS). A farmer is considered lucky if he is able to meet all formalities in one go; otherwise, multiple institutional visits, loss of time, and financial costs to attain land documents are his fate The Sindh High Court had also intervened in the matter, considering the importance of land revenue records to ensure elimination of tampering, interpolation and forgery in official paperwork; an otherwise common phenomenon.

      "summary_orig": "• Opposition claims Modi surrendered to Trump over Epstein files • Growers fears the disastrous impact of the agreement; nationwide protests set for Feb 12 NEW DELHI: Indian farmers on Monday slammed a new US trade deal as “a surrender to multinational agricultural giants”, calling for the commerce minister’s resignation as Congress accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of capitulating to US President Donald Trump over the “Epstein files ” release. Congress leaders claimed an Indian minister, a businessman and individuals close to the prime minister were mentioned in the files, along with Modi. According to a report in The Hindu , the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) demanded Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s immediate resignation as soon as he explained the details of the bilateral pact. Leaders of the union representing apple and cotton growers said any relaxation on the import of cotton would be disastrous for the economies of Jammu and Kashmir, Him­­­­achal Pradesh, Mah­ar­ashtra and Gujarat. Talking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday, SKM leaders called the framework for the interim agreement on bilateral trade a “total surrender” to America’s agriculture sector. They cited the inclusion of dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits in the joint statement. The leaders warned that the animal feed market would be completely monopolised by US companies. SKM leaders urged farmers across the country to join protest demonstrations on Feb 12 and to support a general strike of workers as a “befitting reply to the anti-people Modi government”. The leaders said Goyal’s claim that the agriculture and dairy sectors were excluded from the agreement was incorrect. “Dairy products are part of the FTAs signed with the UK, New Zealand and European Union and the fresh revelations have undoubtedly proved the Commerce Minister is consciously propagating falsehood and betraying the farmers and the entire people,” the SKM statement said. “SKM considers the role of Commerce Minister as a traitor and demands his immediate resignation.” The organisation demanded that Prime Minister Modi desist from signing the India-US Free Trade Agreement or face “massive pan-India united mass struggles”. Farmers’ leaders highlighted tariff disparities, noting that US tariffs on Indian goods rose from zero in 2023-24 to 18pc, while Indian tariff rates on US agriculture products dropped from between 30pc and 150pc to zero. They said this would make Indian agriculture hang by the noose of US MNCs. The SKM also questioned Goyal’s position that the animal husbandry sector had requested imported feed. The group said poultry groups were the ones demanding feed based on maize and soybean to reduce minimum support prices for domestic crops. “We have heard that the animal feed in US may contain non-vegetarian items too. Why does the government want our cows to eat non-vegetarian food?” asked Rakesh Tikait, a prominent SKM leader. The statement also targeted the ruling party’s ideological parent organisation. “The RSS had been claiming no import of milk of animals fed with meat. That was a non-tariff barrier,” the statement said. “Now, the RSS has been made to eat its own claim by ‘Master’ Donald Trump and they have cowed down completely.” M.Y. Tarigami, leader of the Apple Farmers Federation of India and a Jammu and Kashmir lawmaker, said the trade deal would devastate regional economies. “We have been facing problems in apple cultivation due to lack of marketing facilities and climatic challenges,” Tarigami said. “Farmers in both the states are already in distress. This announcement will be a huge setback for apple and tree nut growers.” “In a state like Jammu and Kashmir, where there are no other economic avenues such as industry, the only source of income was cultivation of apples and dry fruits,” Tarigami added. “The Union government does not care about farmers here and is working for their masters in the United States.” Protesting against the government’s lack of transparency regarding the deal, the Congress party on Friday displayed a poster reading “Trap Deal” at the main entrance of the Parliament complex. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that President Trump pressured Modi into signing the deal because of the Epstein files. “The truth is that over the past few days, Narendra Modi has been troubled because matters related to him have come up in the Epstein files. After that, Narendra Modi surrendered before Trump and struck a trade deal,” Kharge said. “He sacrificed the country’s farmers. Modi is making our people poor and making America’s farmers rich.” Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "PM’s Aide Rana Sanaullah speaks during the Asma Jahangir Conference.—X/KenRoth • PM aide’s contention that ‘innocents may get caught up’ in the wake of action following terror attacks prompts heckling, walkout • Dr Malik, Akhtar Mengal stress need for political, not military-based solutions LAHORE: At a charged discussion about the situation in Balochistan, PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah ignited controversy when he implied that innocent civilians were bound to get caught up in the fallout of attacks such as the ones witnessed across the province on Jan 31. The PM’s aide was speaking during a session, titled ‘Is There a Political Will to Solve the Crisis in Balochistan’, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The minister was part of a distinguished panel, which also incl­uded BNP-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, and was moderated by Mujahid Barelvi. The controversy reared its head when Mr Sanaullah was responding to points raised by the other speaker regarding the treatment meted out to the people from Balochistan. Referring to demands such as the abolition of checkpoints from across the province, he said that this could not happen unless terrorism and violence were rooted out. “If incidents like Jan 31 happen, then security forces will take act­ion, and there is a possibility that some of the people taken into custody could be innocent,” he said. This prompted a reaction from the audience, and some — like rights activist Sheema Kermani — got up from her seat and began to heckle the minister. He responded by chiding the hecklers, saying that their refusal to listen to him had ‘exposed them’. Ms Kermani then walked out of the venue, with many people following suit. Speaking to Dawn outside the hall, she said: “Asma Jahangir must be turning in her grave”. “Asma’s name is a symbol for people’s rights, for resistance, defiance and justice. If in this conference, you give a platform to such people who justify state violence, then we will not sit and hear it… If [Asma] had been here, she herself would have walked out and wouldn’t have let such persons speak.” ‘Political people’ Earlier, in his remarks, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch termed insurgency and enforced disappearances as the two major issues facing the province, which did not seem to have a solution. “Whenever I go to my area, four or five people come [up to me] daily, complaining about a missing person.” The state and political leadership should find a solution to these issues, he demanded. “If you deal with Balochistan as a security issue, then conditions would get worse by the day. If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested. “For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted. He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’. Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances. He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award. ‘Military solution to a political issue’ At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions. Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan. However, he regretted that this and subsequent pacts were not implemented. He also referred to past periods of conflict, including operations under different governments, the killing of Nawaz Akbar Bugti and the issue of enforced disappearances, which he said had deeply affected many families, including his own. He also criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined, while expressing concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties. He also referred to jailed human rights lawyers and activists, Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying that they had been jailed for 17 years over a mere tweet, while those who had harmed the country and looted had not spent a single day behind bars, or were accorded A or B class prison facilities. Sanaullah’s response Responding to these grievances, Mr Sanaullah said nothing could be done about the past, as it could not be changed. “Right now Balochistan had two crises, one is being represented by Akhtar Mengal and Dr Malik, and the other side being Bashir Zaib and his accomplices,” he said, referring to one of the leaders of the banned BLA. “In my view, both these crises have different solutions and different demands. We are making a mistake by taking them as one.” He also maintained that enforced disappearances and violence in Balochistan started simultaneously, calling it a ‘chicken and egg story’, adding that they would also end together, just as they had started.

      "summary_en": "PM’s Aide Rana Sanaullah speaks during the Asma Jahangir Conference.—X/KenRoth • PM aide’s contention that ‘innocents may get caught up’ in the wake of action following terror attacks prompts heckling, walkout • Dr Malik, Akhtar Mengal stress need for political, not military-based solutions LAHORE: At a charged discussion about the situation in Balochistan, PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah ignited controversy when he implied that innocent civilians were bound to get caught up in the fallout of attacks such as the ones witnessed across the province on Jan 31. The PM’s aide was speaking during a session, titled ‘Is There a Political Will to Solve the Crisis in Balochistan’, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday. The minister was part of a distinguished panel, which also incl­uded BNP-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, and was moderated by Mujahid Barelvi. The controversy reared its head when Mr Sanaullah was responding to points raised by the other speaker regarding the treatment meted out to the people from Balochistan. Referring to demands such as the abolition of checkpoints from across the province, he said that this could not happen unless terrorism and violence were rooted out. “If incidents like Jan 31 happen, then security forces will take act­ion, and there is a possibility that some of the people taken into custody could be innocent,” he said. This prompted a reaction from the audience, and some — like rights activist Sheema Kermani — got up from her seat and began to heckle the minister. He responded by chiding the hecklers, saying that their refusal to listen to him had ‘exposed them’. Ms Kermani then walked out of the venue, with many people following suit. Speaking to Dawn outside the hall, she said: “Asma Jahangir must be turning in her grave”. “Asma’s name is a symbol for people’s rights, for resistance, defiance and justice. If in this conference, you give a platform to such people who justify state violence, then we will not sit and hear it… If [Asma] had been here, she herself would have walked out and wouldn’t have let such persons speak.” ‘Political people’ Earlier, in his remarks, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch termed insurgency and enforced disappearances as the two major issues facing the province, which did not seem to have a solution. “Whenever I go to my area, four or five people come [up to me] daily, complaining about a missing person.” The state and political leadership should find a solution to these issues, he demanded. “If you deal with Balochistan as a security issue, then conditions would get worse by the day. If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested. “For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted. He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’. Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances. He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award. ‘Military solution to a political issue’ At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions. Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan.

      "summary_orig": "• Partial shutdown in Peshawar, complete shutter-down in Quetta • Markets in Lahore, Islamabad remain open • Roads blocked in Karachi ‘to deter protests’ • Torch rally outside Faisal Mosque scuttled due to ‘road closures, arrests’ • PTI leaders hail public response; Punjab CM claims ‘zero’ strike in Punjab LAHORE / ISLAMABAD / PESHAWAR / QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lah­ore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections. A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported from Quetta. The PTI, a part of the TTAP, had announced a strike for Sunday to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, which it alleges were marred by rigging. The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives. In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers. Despite the alleged arre­sts of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, former senator Mushtaq Ahmed, and other TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhu­nzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site. Mr Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.” Mr Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown on party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located. QUETTA: Supporters of Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan block a road to protest alleged rigging in the February 8, 2024 general elections.—PPI However, police did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker. Mixed response In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. PTI workers from across the city gathered at Hash­tnagri Bazaar from where they took out a protest. Upon reaching the historic Chowk Yadgar, the rally’s venue, the procession converted into a public gathering, which was addressed by the PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan and others. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. Meanwhile, daily life in Karachi and other parts of Sindh remained largely unaffected on Sunday. How­ever, police blocked many roads across the city, especially in the areas leading to the Karachi Press Club and the Election Commission of Pakistan, to thwart any protest by the opposition alliance. All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. In Punjab, markets in Lah­ore exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with rou­tine traffic movement obse­rved. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival, which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. Meanwhile, most markets in Islamabad and Rawalpindi remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Strike in Balochistan Meanwhile, a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again, a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike. PTI leader Asad Qaiser also congratulated the nation on the “successful” observance of Feb 8 as a “black day”. Talking to Dawn , he claimed that at a number of places, including Swabi, “powers that be forced people to open their shops and also threatened transporters that strict action will be taken if they do not bring their vehicles on the road”. On the other hand, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.” Imtiaz Ali and Imran Ayub in Karachi also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2026",

PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike. PTI leader Asad Qaiser also congratulated the nation on the “successful” observance of Feb 8 as a “black day”. Talking to Dawn , he claimed that at a number of places, including Swabi, “powers that be forced people to open their shops and also threatened transporters that strict action will be taken if they do not bring their vehicles on the road”. On the other hand, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.” Imtiaz Ali and Imran Ayub in Karachi also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to boycott the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15. The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion. After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that. Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told Dawn that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan. They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.” The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source. They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.” The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.” Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings. Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport. Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said. The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter. Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting. Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials. The high-level visits come a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced. The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland. Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the ICC rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka. After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo. In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”. It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of. “The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated. A government source told Dawn at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh. “The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added. Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue. It was reported earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses. Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown . Pakistan, who edged out the Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate. Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Police repulsed an attack by unidentified militants, who targeted a police checkpoint in the Passani village located on the outskirts of Peshawar, officials said. Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmed told Dawn that “the militants attacked a police post  and an exchange of fire also took place, but the policemen, deployed at the facility, retaliated, forcing the militants to escape.” The CCPO added that the situation was “under control”. No casualties or injuries were reported as a result of the attack; however, the nature of the attack and physical losses are yet to be ascertained. On November 26, unidentified persons blew up a gas pipeline in Hameed Khan Machine area, some five miles south of the police post in Passani. Residents said that an explosion had triggered a fire from the pipeline.

      "summary_orig": "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s coalition swept to a historic election win on Sunday, paving the way for promised tax cuts that have spooked financial markets and military spending aimed at countering China. The conservative Takaichi, Japan’s first female leader who says she is inspired by Britain’s “Iron Lady” Margaret Thatcher, was projected to deliver as many as 328 of the 465 seats in parliament’s lower house for her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP alone sailed past the 233 seats needed for a majority less than two hours after polls closed, on track for one of its best-ever election results. With her coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, Takaichi now has a supermajority of two-thirds of seats, easing her legislative agenda as she can override the upper chamber, which she does not control. Winter election brings blizzard of votes “This election involved major policy shifts — particularly a major shift in economic and fiscal policy, as well as strengthening security policy,” Takaichi said in a television interview as the results rolled in. “These are policies that have drawn a great deal of opposition … If we have received the public’s support, then we truly must tackle these issues with all our strength.” A voter pets a dog outside a polling station during the general election, in Uonuma, Niigata Prefecture, Japan on Feb 8, 2026. — Reuters Takaichi, 64, called the rare winter snap election to capitalise on her buoyant personal approval ratings since she was elevated to lead the long-ruling LDP late last year. Voters have been drawn to her straight-talking, hardworking image, but her nationalistic leanings and emphasis on security have strained ties with Japan’s powerful neighbour China, while her promises of tax cuts have rattled financial markets. Residents trudged through snow to cast their ballots, with record snowfall in some parts snarling traffic and requiring some polling stations to close early. It was only the third post-war election held in February, with elections typically called during milder months. Outside a polling station in the town of Uonuma in the mountainous Niigata prefecture, 54-year-old teacher Kazushige Cho braved below-freezing temperatures and deep snow to cast his vote for Takaichi’s LDP. “It feels like she’s creating a sense of direction — like the whole country is pulling together and moving forward,” Cho said. But Takaichi’s election promise to suspend an 8 per cent sales tax on food to help households cope with rising prices has rattled investors concerned about how the nation with the heaviest debt burden among advanced economies will fund the plan. Takaichi said on Sunday she would speed up consideration of the sales tax cut while focusing on fiscal sustainability. “Her plans for the cut in the consumption tax leave open big question marks about funding and how she’s going to go about making the arithmetic add up,” said Chris Scicluna, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe in London. Backed by Trump, bashed by China The head of Japan’s top business lobby Keidanren, Yoshinobu Tsutsui, welcomed Takaichi’s win as restoring political stability. “Japan’s economy is now at a critical juncture for achieving sustainable and strong growth,” he said. The LDP, which has ruled for almost all of Japan’s postwar history, had lost control of both houses in elections over the past 15 months under Takaichi’s predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba. Takaichi has managed to turn around the party’s fortunes by striking a chord with younger voters. She has even sparked a “ sanakatsu ” craze, roughly translated as “Sanae-mania”. Her handbag and the pink pen she scribbles notes with in parliament have been in high demand. US President Donald Trump last week gave Takaichi his “total endorsement” and said he would host her at the White House next month. China will also be parsing the result. Weeks after taking office, Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with Beijing in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, the democratic island claimed by China. China responded with several countermeasures, including urging its citizens not to travel to Japan. Taiwan President Lai Ching-te was one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate Takaichi, saying he hoped her victory would “bring a more prosperous and secure future for Japan and its partners in the region”. Takaichi’s strong mandate could accelerate her plans to bolster Japan’s defences, further angering Beijing, which has cast her as attempting to revive its militaristic past. Japan’s Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi told TV stations on Sunday evening that he wanted to push ahead with policies to strengthen Japan’s defence while pursuing dialogue with China. “Beijing will not welcome Takaichi’s victory,” said David Boling, principal at the Asia Group, a firm that advises companies on geopolitical risk. “China now faces the reality that she is firmly in place — and that its efforts to isolate her completely failed.”",

The policeman, identified as Constable Zahidullah Wazir, was martyred on the spot, while his father, Ghulam Nabi, and brother, Waheed, sustained serious injuries. All three belonged to the Shakai tehsil of Upper South Waziristan District. “The martyred police constable was the brother of Muhammad Jan Wazir, a political moharrir of the district administration, Lower South Wazirista,” Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Wana Circle, Asghar Ali Shah, told Dawn. “The condition of the injured persons is critical; however, they are being provided immediate medical treatment.” Following the incident, the unidentified assailants managed to flee the scene. Police rushed to the area soon after receiving information, cordoned off the locality, and collected evidence, they said. The injured persons and the body of the martyred police constable were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) Wana, where medical treatment of the injured was underway. DSP Shah added that the police have formally initiated an investigation to determine the nature and motives of the attack. He clarified that the family of political Moharrir Wazir had “no personal enmity with anyone, and initial evidence suggested that the incident was an act of terrorism.” Over the past year, the law and order situation in Lower and Upper South Waziristan as well as North Waziristan, has remained highly volatile, causing serious concern among local tribes. Tribal elders have stated that frequent incidents have created fear and insecurity among the population. According to police reports, incidents of bomb blasts, targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom, killings of civilians, and attacks on police and security forces’ check posts have intensified in the three tribal districts of KP, posing serious threats to overall peace and stability in the region. The situation gradually worsened since November 2022, when the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government and vowed to target security personnel, police and personnel of law enforcement agencies.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR/QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lahore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections. The PTI — a part of the TTAP — had announced a strike today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024 general elections , which it alleges were marred by rigging . The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives . A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported in Quetta. In Lahore, all major markets remained closed, primarily due to Sunday and the ongoing Basant festival . In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers. Despite the alleged arrests of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmed, as well as TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site. Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown against the party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located. However, police sources did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker. Speaking to the media, Abbas criticised the Punjab government for “supporting Basant and dance parties” in the wake of the Islamabad imambargah attack . Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had cancelled her Basant-related activities following the incident. “The law enforcement agencies failed badly to provide security to the masses, and that is why such a huge number of people lost their lives,” Abbas added. Meanwhile, Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.” He asserted that the movement will soon gain further momentum and stated that the whole nation was worried about PTI founder Imran Khan’s health. In his remarks, Ahmed termed Pakistan’s possible participation in the upcoming meeting of the United States-led Board of Peace as “unfortunate”. Yousafzai claimed that the shutter-down strike was successful in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and interior Sindh. “However, it was partially successful in Punjab, Karachi and Hyderabad,” he acknowledged. Earlier in the day, the TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar , Abbottabad , Balakot , Haripur , Bajaur , Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat ; Sindh’s Hyderabad , Mirpurkhas , Umerkot , Badin and Nawabshah ; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin , Mianwali , Muzaffargarh ; and Balochistan’s Quetta , Chaman , Zhob , and Kuchlak . It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat , as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad , Qila Saifullah , Chaman and Pishin . KP In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call. PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders. PTI’s chapter arranged a gathering at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue prior to the event, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops. PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana had said party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar. All the district chapters across the province were to arrange events, according to Khatana. In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests. PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found. Sindh All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town , North Nazimabad , Landhi , Shah Faisal Colony , Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently. In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent. “Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.” He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.” Punjab In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”. However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival , which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level. Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers on Saturday, alleging harassment of families during search operations. Islamabad, Rawalpindi Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops. “We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said. People shop at the H-9 Sunday bazaar in Islamabad on Feb 8, 2026. — Ikram Junaidi Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday. “I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said. However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses. “When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said. “No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented. PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities. A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended. However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual. Balochistan A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin in Quetta, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again , a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — which is headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah. In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital. In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”. In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road. In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai . Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said . PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. “It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added. Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”. He highlighted that the people voted for PTI in support of its founder, Imran Khan despite “months-long oppression and snatching the electoral symbol”. He further said, “On that dark evening, the wolves who looted the votes of those young people and of the entire nation across the country, they negated the very existence of millions of human beings.” Meanwhile, KP CM Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for what he called a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike. In a social media post on X, he wrote: “I thank all Pakistanis for once again sending a clear message today to those who robbed them of their mandate that we stood with Imran Khan, we are standing with him today, and we will continue to stand with him. “Across Pakistan, people participated wholeheartedly in the shutter-down and wheel-jam strike, which is both encouraging and also fearsome for our opponents,” he claimed. “Today, Pakistanis once again rejected the imposed group and those who brought them to power,” the KP CM said. Furthermore, he said that “each small or big event holds great importance” in the opposition’s movement for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, and for the restoration of an independent judiciary. “We must neither abuse nor resort to bullets. We must continue our peaceful struggle within the framework of the Constitution and the law, so that no one gets an excuse to open fire,” CM Afridi said. He reiterated the PTI’s allegation that its supporters were fired upon during the Nov 26, 2024 protest in Islamabad. “Yet even today, Pakistanis are fearless and are not stepping back from any sacrifice,” the chief minister said, hailing the supporters’ courage. On the other hand, CM Maryam said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.” Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the public had “rejected the politics of incitement and division”, quipping that the “wheel-jam [strike] itself was jammed”. “The public is tired of protest politics and the PTI’s call was badly dismissed. There is hustle and bustle despite a Sunday,” he said on X. Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam also asserted that the public rejected the TTAP’s call for a wheel-jammed and shutter-down strike. “The people of KP have realised how long they can keep believing the false narrative that has been pushed for the last 13 years,” he said in a statement. Muqam said the people of KP wanted progress, peace and development. He claimed this was the first time he had seen a chief minister calling for businesses to be shut down. On Saturday, PTI leader Asad Qaiser had told Dawn the party had neither postponed nor cancelled its protest programme in the wake of the Islamabad attack. “The day will be observed as a National Day of Mourning and, at the same time, protests will be held across the country against rigging in the general election,” he said. Qaiser said the party would hold protests and a shutter-down strike “with the masses” against the alleged electoral manipulation. Additional input from Irfan Raza, Imtiaz Ali",

      "summary_en": "LAHORE/ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR/QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lahore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections. The PTI — a part of the TTAP — had announced a strike today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024 general elections , which it alleges were marred by rigging . The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives . A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported in Quetta. In Lahore, all major markets remained closed, primarily due to Sunday and the ongoing Basant festival . In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers. Despite the alleged arrests of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmed, as well as TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site. Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown against the party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located. However, police sources did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker. Speaking to the media, Abbas criticised the Punjab government for “supporting Basant and dance parties” in the wake of the Islamabad imambargah attack . Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had cancelled her Basant-related activities following the incident. “The law enforcement agencies failed badly to provide security to the masses, and that is why such a huge number of people lost their lives,” Abbas added. Meanwhile, Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.” He asserted that the movement will soon gain further momentum and stated that the whole nation was worried about PTI founder Imran Khan’s health. In his remarks, Ahmed termed Pakistan’s possible participation in the upcoming meeting of the United States-led Board of Peace as “unfortunate”. Yousafzai claimed that the shutter-down strike was successful in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and interior Sindh. “However, it was partially successful in Punjab, Karachi and Hyderabad,” he acknowledged. Earlier in the day, the TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar , Abbottabad , Balakot , Haripur , Bajaur , Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat ; Sindh’s Hyderabad , Mirpurkhas , Umerkot , Badin and Nawabshah ; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin , Mianwali , Muzaffargarh ; and Balochistan’s Quetta , Chaman , Zhob , and Kuchlak . It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat , as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad , Qila Saifullah , Chaman and Pishin . KP In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest. A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”. He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call. PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders. PTI’s chapter arranged a gathering at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue prior to the event, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops. PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana had said party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar. All the district chapters across the province were to arrange events, according to Khatana. In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests. PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found. Sindh All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday. He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed. But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.” Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district. The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town , North Nazimabad , Landhi , Shah Faisal Colony , Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently. In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent. “Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.” He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.” Punjab In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”. However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival , which was in its last day. The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops. PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level. Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers on Saturday, alleging harassment of families during search operations. Islamabad, Rawalpindi Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city. While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar. Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops. “We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said. People shop at the H-9 Sunday bazaar in Islamabad on Feb 8, 2026. — Ikram Junaidi Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday. “I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said. However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses. “When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said. “No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented. PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities. A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended. However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual. Balochistan A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin in Quetta, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic. Mobile internet services have been suspended again , a Dawn correspondent reported. Workers of the PTI and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — which is headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — staged demonstrations in some areas of the city. Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads. In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far. Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades. Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic. The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm. A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic. Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held. Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah. In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital. In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”. In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road. In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai . Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said . PTI hails public ‘response’ In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”. He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike. “It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added. Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”. He highlighted that the people voted for PTI in support of its founder, Imran Khan despite “months-long oppression and snatching the electoral symbol”. He further said, “On that dark evening, the wolves who looted the votes of those young people and of the entire nation across the country, they negated the very existence of millions of human beings.” Meanwhile, KP CM Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for what he called a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike. In a social media post on X, he wrote: “I thank all Pakistanis for once again sending a clear message today to those who robbed them of their mandate that we stood with Imran Khan, we are standing with him today, and we will continue to stand with him. “Across Pakistan, people participated wholeheartedly in the shutter-down and wheel-jam strike, which is both encouraging and also fearsome for our opponents,” he claimed. “Today, Pakistanis once again rejected the imposed group and those who brought them to power,” the KP CM said. Furthermore, he said that “each small or big event holds great importance” in the opposition’s movement for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, and for the restoration of an independent judiciary. “We must neither abuse nor resort to bullets. We must continue our peaceful struggle within the framework of the Constitution and the law, so that no one gets an excuse to open fire,” CM Afridi said. He reiterated the PTI’s allegation that its supporters were fired upon during the Nov 26, 2024 protest in Islamabad. “Yet even today, Pakistanis are fearless and are not stepping back from any sacrifice,” the chief minister said, hailing the supporters’ courage. On the other hand, CM Maryam said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.” Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the public had “rejected the politics of incitement and division”, quipping that the “wheel-jam [strike] itself was jammed”. “The public is tired of protest politics and the PTI’s call was badly dismissed.

      "summary_orig": "Recognition of Iran’s right to enrich uranium is key for nuclear talks with the United States to succeed, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Sunday. American and Iranian diplomats held indirect talks in Oman on Friday, aimed at reviving diplomacy amid a US naval buildup near Iran and Tehran’s vows of a harsh response if attacked. “Zero enrichment can never be accepted by us. Hence, we need to focus on discussions that accept enrichment inside Iran while building trust that enrichment is and will stay for peaceful purposes,” Araqchi said. Iran and the US held five rounds of nuclear talks last year, which stalled mainly due to disagreements over uranium enrichment inside Iran. In June, the US attacked Iranian nuclear facilities at the end of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Tehran has since said it has halted enrichment activity, which the US views as a possible pathway to nuclear bombs. Iran says its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes. A diplomat in the region briefed by Iran told Reuters on Friday that Tehran was open to discussing the “level and purity” of enrichment as well as other arrangements, as long as it was allowed to enrich uranium on its soil and would be granted sanctions relief in addition to military de-escalation. “Iran’s insistence on enrichment is not merely technical or economic (…) it is rooted in a desire for independence and dignity,” Araqchi said. “No one has the right to tell the Iranian nation what it should or should not have.” The minister also said that Iran’s missile programme, which the US would like to include in negotiations, had never been part of the agenda. President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on Sunday that talks with the US were a “step forward” and that Tehran wanted its rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be respected. The date and venue of the next round of talks will be determined in consultation with Oman and might not be Muscat, Araqchi said.",

President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on Sunday that talks with the US were a “step forward” and that Tehran wanted its rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be respected. The date and venue of the next round of talks will be determined in consultation with Oman and might not be Muscat, Araqchi said.",

      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday issued renewed warnings about the threats to global peace due to “terrorist organisations operating in Afghanistan”, and criticised the Taliban regime’s policies, which he said created conditions “similar to or worse than pre-9/11”. He made the remarks in a statement thanking world leaders for showing solidarity with Pakistan over the recent attack on an imambargah in Islamabad , which killed 36 people and injured more than 160. The militant group Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for the attack. In a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, Zardari reiterated the Pakistani nation’s resolve to combat terrorism and violent ideology. “Pakistan has long maintained that terrorism cannot be confronted by a single country in isolation,” he was quoted as saying. Citing Pakistan’s experience, he said in the statement that whenever “terrorist groups are allowed space, facilitation or impunity beyond national borders, the consequences are borne by innocent civilians all over the world.” Under such a context, he continued, certain neighbouring countries had become partners in crime by allowing terrorist elements to operate against Pakistan from their soil, while some not only finance them directly but also provide them with technical and military means. “This is a reality that has shaped the regional developments in recent years. Pakistan takes strong exception to the situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime has created conditions similar to or worse than pre-9/11, when terror organisations posed threats to global peace, ending in the 9/11 tragedy,” the statement quoted him as saying. The Sept 11, 2001 , attacks, also known as 9/11, refer to a series of coordinated plane hijackings by the armed Al Qaeda group, which claimed almost 3,000 lives. Zardari also accused India of “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening not only Pakistan but also the regional and global peace.” Following Friday’s mosque attack in Islamabad, government officials, including the Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, had also blamed “Indian-backed proxies” for carrying out the attack. President Zardari appreciated the international community for expressing solidarity with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism. “Pakistan is humbled by the strong and sincere outpouring of support and solidarity from world leaders, governments and international organisations,” he said in the statement. “The messages of sympathy and solidarity had brought comfort to the people of Pakistan and strength to the families who mourned.” Islamabad has reiterated that Afghanistan’s soil has been continuously used by terrorists against Pakistan and urged the Taliban regime to rein in the terror groups’ operations in its land to target civilians and military personnel in Pakistan.",
