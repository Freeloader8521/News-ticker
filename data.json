According to Daegu’s Dalseo Police Station on Monday, the family of a 34-year-old man surnamed Yang filed a missing person report after losing contact with him two days earlier. Yang had left Korea on Oct. 9, telling his family he would spend “two to three weeks in Cambodia to pay off borrowed money.” Before boarding his flight to Phnom Penh, he sent a photo of his ticket and remained in touch during his first two days abroad. “He messaged us that he’d arrived at his accommodation and was heading to the office the next morning,” Yang’s father said.

      "summary_orig": "THE political crisis in KP doesn’t seem to be headed for a quick resolution. And perhaps, Imran Khan is aware of this as is the ‘other side’. The decision to change the chief minister did not come out of the blue. It had been evident for some time that the PTI and Khan were growing disillusioned with Ali Amin Gandapur. And the reasons were many — his ‘failure’ to get any concessions for Khan; allegations of corruption and misgovernance; and unhappiness of the party (leadership as well as workers) with him. The rumours about what he was getting wrong kept growing. That Khan was aware of this was obvious. More than once he had sent messages for Gandapur to visit him, to discuss governance matters, such as the budget or increasing terrorism within the province. But for some time now, the chief minister had been a no-show at Adiala. He wasn’t getting the permission was the reply from Peshawar. But it seems that matters came to a head at the recent jalsa in Peshawar . It was a lacklustre affair by some accounts, lending credence to reports of the growing unpopularity of the party in the province and the disillusionment of the workers with the provincial government. Social media footage of participants expressing their anger when Gandapur took to the stage was widely shared. The incident rattled Gandapur who hot-footed it to Adiala, where the doors opened smoothly for him. That he left as abruptly as he had turned up confirmed the rumours that his visit had not gone well. Gandapur left it to Barrister Saif to tell the press how he was still Khan’s blue-eyed boy, though his blistering attack on Aleema Khan later told a different story. When the announcement came from Adiala about the change of guard, however, the focus was on the growing militancy and the chief minister’s inability to separate his government from the centre’s policy. That this may not be the entire story is also possible. The trial in jail of Khan in the case called Toshakhana 2 continues at breakneck speed and there are few doubts which way it is headed. There are very little chances of relief from the higher courts. It is assumed that after all the convictions have been secured, access to him will become even more limited. In these circumstances, there is little incentive for Khan to let KP cooperate with the centre, especially as the PTI’s rank and file is also unhappy. It could be a case of using one arrow for two targets. If the new CM chooses the path of resistance it will further complicate KP’s security situation. But more than Gandapur’s ‘sacking’, it was the nomination of his successor that upped the temperatures. The party in KP welcomed Sohail Afridi but the rest of the political system reacted differently. The information minister at the centre did a press talk condemning the decision, adding that it would not be allowed. Others from the ruling party gave similar statements, as hushed whispers of governor’s rule or a splintering of the PTI in KP did the rounds. Overnight, the nominee was accused of being an associate of Murad Saeed (one of the few PTI stalwarts still on the run), a Taliban sympathiser, involved in smuggling or worse. The least of his sins and perhaps the only relevant one was his lack of experience. But the criticism against him grew more ludicrous. The governor continued to throw up legal herrings from not having received the resignation to expressing fears about the authenticity of Gandapur’s signatures. For good measure, he also went and met Maulana Fazl; that they probably did a high five over their local rival’s exit is an image one can only conjure up mentally. The official images were serious and without any outcome. All of this was also seen in conjunction with the press conference by the DG ISPR in Peshawar. While the talk was about the security situation, politics crept in. It seemed to some that it was aimed at the PTI and its governance in the province and how that was linked to the deteriorating security situation. In this environment, it’s hard to raise questions about the need for such press conferences so let’s just move on to politics. By Monday morning, the election for the new chief minister went ahead far more smoothly than expected. The opposition boycotted the exercise; the number of votes cast for the new chief minister showed the PTI remained intact in the provincial assembly. But none of this indicates a smooth ride from hereon. As mentioned, Khan, and by extension the PTI, has little incentive to allow smooth cooperation with the centre; this provides no relief to the PTI people behind bars and neither does it help with the growing discontent among KP residents vis-à-vis militancy and military operations. On the other hand, the establishment is also in a bind. It has not been able to dent Khan’s popularity, especially in KP. But more importantly, it seems for the second time, it has toyed with and abandoned the idea of installing a non-PTI chief minister (for now). This is not simply because of the numbers game; it is more due to the concern over the reaction there. Unlike Balochistan, the powers that be still worry about the people’s sentiment in KP. While the former can be given a completely puppet government with no legitimate voice, there is less willingness to be this indifferent to public sentiment in KP. This was probably at play in 2024 and might just have been at play in recent days. But if the new chief minister follows a path of resistance, as he is expected to, it will make the security situation in KP complicated. And if he goes the way of Gandapur, the PTI and Khan will be under pressure again to stir things up. Indeed, short of rapprochement between Khan and the centre, the multiple crises in KP will not witness any change for the better. The province, and by extension the rest of the country, is in for a rough ride. The writer is a journalist. Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

It could be a case of using one arrow for two targets. If the new CM chooses the path of resistance it will further complicate KP’s security situation. But more than Gandapur’s ‘sacking’, it was the nomination of his successor that upped the temperatures. The party in KP welcomed Sohail Afridi but the rest of the political system reacted differently. The information minister at the centre did a press talk condemning the decision, adding that it would not be allowed. Others from the ruling party gave similar statements, as hushed whispers of governor’s rule or a splintering of the PTI in KP did the rounds. Overnight, the nominee was accused of being an associate of Murad Saeed (one of the few PTI stalwarts still on the run), a Taliban sympathiser, involved in smuggling or worse. The least of his sins and perhaps the only relevant one was his lack of experience. But the criticism against him grew more ludicrous. The governor continued to throw up legal herrings from not having received the resignation to expressing fears about the authenticity of Gandapur’s signatures. For good measure, he also went and met Maulana Fazl; that they probably did a high five over their local rival’s exit is an image one can only conjure up mentally. The official images were serious and without any outcome. All of this was also seen in conjunction with the press conference by the DG ISPR in Peshawar. While the talk was about the security situation, politics crept in. It seemed to some that it was aimed at the PTI and its governance in the province and how that was linked to the deteriorating security situation. In this environment, it’s hard to raise questions about the need for such press conferences so let’s just move on to politics. By Monday morning, the election for the new chief minister went ahead far more smoothly than expected. The opposition boycotted the exercise; the number of votes cast for the new chief minister showed the PTI remained intact in the provincial assembly. But none of this indicates a smooth ride from hereon. As mentioned, Khan, and by extension the PTI, has little incentive to allow smooth cooperation with the centre; this provides no relief to the PTI people behind bars and neither does it help with the growing discontent among KP residents vis-à-vis militancy and military operations. On the other hand, the establishment is also in a bind. It has not been able to dent Khan’s popularity, especially in KP. But more importantly, it seems for the second time, it has toyed with and abandoned the idea of installing a non-PTI chief minister (for now). This is not simply because of the numbers game; it is more due to the concern over the reaction there. Unlike Balochistan, the powers that be still worry about the people’s sentiment in KP. While the former can be given a completely puppet government with no legitimate voice, there is less willingness to be this indifferent to public sentiment in KP. This was probably at play in 2024 and might just have been at play in recent days. But if the new chief minister follows a path of resistance, as he is expected to, it will make the security situation in KP complicated. And if he goes the way of Gandapur, the PTI and Khan will be under pressure again to stir things up. Indeed, short of rapprochement between Khan and the centre, the multiple crises in KP will not witness any change for the better. The province, and by extension the rest of the country, is in for a rough ride. The writer is a journalist. Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "THE barely two-year-old Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly is once again in the throes of a constitutional crisis. The controversy this time around is about who is actually at the helm of the province? The saga began with the resignatio n of Ali Amin Gandapur as the chief minister, which is yet to be ‘formally accepted’ by Governor Faisal Karim Kundi. Despite this unresolved status, the provincial assembly went ahead to pick his replacement, a young lawmaker from Khyber, Sohail Afridi. So, are there currently two chief ministers in the province, or not even one? Disparate legal opinions and the politics surrounding the CM’s election compound the matter, especially as the province is reeling from a significant rise in terrorist activities. At the heart of the crisis is Governor Kundi, who has refused to consider Mr Gandapur’s two resignation letters delivered to him on October 8 and 11. Having sat on the letters for days, Mr Kundi has now summoned Mr Gandapur for a personal hearing to ascertain the “authenticity of alleged resignation” on October 15. Some legal experts say Gandapur still chief executive, others insist province ‘has no chief minister’ As Mr Kundi was in Karachi, Ali Amin Gandapur responded to him on the assembly’s floor on Monday and reiterated his resignation. Subsequently, KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati ruled that the governor was not the appointing authority, nor did he have the authority to force an unwilling chief minister to remain in office. “I rule that pursuant to the resignation by Mr Gandapur, and election for the post of KP chief minister is being lawfully conducted on this day, October 13, 2025 in accordance with the Constitution and rules of the KP Assembly,” Mr Swati stated. This followed the election of Mr Afridi as the new chief executive of the province. It is likely that Mr Kundi will not administer the oath to the new CM, evident by his decision to ‘approve’ the resignation tendered by Mr Gandapur. And without the oath, Mr Afridi remains a CM-elect and out of office. However, the PTI has already approached the PHC chief justice to appoint someone to administer the oath to the CM-elect under Article 255 of the Constitution. This move is similar to the one by the opposition in KP when it had sought the PHC intervention for the oath to its lawmakers on reserved seats. Speaking to Dawn , Shumail Ahmed Butt, a lawyer and former KP advocate general, told Dawn that there was no chief minister in KP at present. He said Mr Gandapur has resigned while his successor has not taken oath, adding that the constitutional posts cannot be assumed without taking oath. Mr Butt said that Mr Afridi’s election was legitimate. Besides, the assembly proceedings cannot be challenged in court, he said. However, according to Mr Butt, the governor does have the power to verify the resignation. He said the PTI could approach the PHC if the governor refused to administer the oath. Ali Gohar Durrani, a PHC lawyer, however, disagreed with his colleague. He said Mr Gandapur was still the KP CM. “As long as Mr Afridi does not take the oath of his office, Mr Gandapur will remain the chief minister,” he said. He said the CM’s election was legal and valid, as the governor did not have the power to decline the CM’s resignation. “Mr Kundi’s actions are illegal and in violation of the Constitution,” he said. About the PTI’s move to approach the PHC, he said the ruling party had jumped the gun. “Unless the governor declines to administer the oath, the PTI cannot approach the PHC,” he said. Amir Javed, ex-advocate general of KP, claimed that Mr Afridi’s election was illegal. “When the province has a sitting CM and his cabinet, then how can another person be elected as the CM?” Mr Javed questioned. Zainab Shahid, however, said there was no legal provision to seek the governor’s assent for the resignation. The lawyer told Dawn.com : “There is no legal or constitutional provision requiring the governor of KP’s assent for the former CM resignation to become effective.”  “As per Article 130(8), the only requirement is that the CM resigns ‘by writing under his hand addressed to the governor’. The former CM has done so twice,” she added. Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

Some legal experts say Gandapur still chief executive, others insist province ‘has no chief minister’ As Mr Kundi was in Karachi, Ali Amin Gandapur responded to him on the assembly’s floor on Monday and reiterated his resignation. Subsequently, KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati ruled that the governor was not the appointing authority, nor did he have the authority to force an unwilling chief minister to remain in office. “I rule that pursuant to the resignation by Mr Gandapur, and election for the post of KP chief minister is being lawfully conducted on this day, October 13, 2025 in accordance with the Constitution and rules of the KP Assembly,” Mr Swati stated. This followed the election of Mr Afridi as the new chief executive of the province. It is likely that Mr Kundi will not administer the oath to the new CM, evident by his decision to ‘approve’ the resignation tendered by Mr Gandapur. And without the oath, Mr Afridi remains a CM-elect and out of office. However, the PTI has already approached the PHC chief justice to appoint someone to administer the oath to the CM-elect under Article 255 of the Constitution. This move is similar to the one by the opposition in KP when it had sought the PHC intervention for the oath to its lawmakers on reserved seats. Speaking to Dawn , Shumail Ahmed Butt, a lawyer and former KP advocate general, told Dawn that there was no chief minister in KP at present. He said Mr Gandapur has resigned while his successor has not taken oath, adding that the constitutional posts cannot be assumed without taking oath. Mr Butt said that Mr Afridi’s election was legitimate. Besides, the assembly proceedings cannot be challenged in court, he said. However, according to Mr Butt, the governor does have the power to verify the resignation. He said the PTI could approach the PHC if the governor refused to administer the oath. Ali Gohar Durrani, a PHC lawyer, however, disagreed with his colleague. He said Mr Gandapur was still the KP CM. “As long as Mr Afridi does not take the oath of his office, Mr Gandapur will remain the chief minister,” he said. He said the CM’s election was legal and valid, as the governor did not have the power to decline the CM’s resignation. “Mr Kundi’s actions are illegal and in violation of the Constitution,” he said. About the PTI’s move to approach the PHC, he said the ruling party had jumped the gun. “Unless the governor declines to administer the oath, the PTI cannot approach the PHC,” he said. Amir Javed, ex-advocate general of KP, claimed that Mr Afridi’s election was illegal. “When the province has a sitting CM and his cabinet, then how can another person be elected as the CM?” Mr Javed questioned. Zainab Shahid, however, said there was no legal provision to seek the governor’s assent for the resignation. The lawyer told Dawn.com : “There is no legal or constitutional provision requiring the governor of KP’s assent for the former CM resignation to become effective.”  “As per Article 130(8), the only requirement is that the CM resigns ‘by writing under his hand addressed to the governor’. The former CM has done so twice,” she added. Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

The PA is keen that tax revenues withheld by the Israeli government are released, since this is preventing salary payments and undermining its liquidity, in violation of the Oslo accords. Israel has also threatened not to renew next month the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws, which allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks.

      "summary_orig": "• Taliban foreign minister claims omission of women journalists from his first media interaction was ‘unintentional’ • UN terms Afghan restrictions on women ‘gender apartheid’ • India’s Ministry of External Affairs denies any role in Friday’s press interaction at Afghan embassy A PICTURE is worth a thousand words — and the image splashed across Indian newspapers on Monday, showing female journalists seated prominently in the front row at the Taliban foreign minister’s press conference in Delhi, perfectly embodies that sentiment. The conference — Amir Khan Muttaqi’s second press event at the Afghan embassy within 48 hours — was convened following widespread outrage over the exclusion of female journalists from his initial briefing on Friday, BBC News reported. Mr Muttaqi said at Sunday’s conference that the exclusion was unintentional and not “deliberate”. “With regard to the [Friday’s] press conference, it was on short notice and a short list of journalists was decided, and the participation list that was presented was very specific. “It was more a technical issue… Our colleagues had decided to send an invitation to a specific list of journalists and there was no other intention apart from this,” he added. The UN has described the situation in Afghanistan as a form of “gender apartheid, ” where women and girls are barred from secondary and higher education, prohibited from visiting parks and gyms, and face growing restrictions on employment. The Taliban government also enforces strict dress codes and limits their freedom of movement. The Taliban, who regained power in 2021, maintain that they uphold women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law. However, Western diplomats say the severe restrictions on women have hindered the group’s efforts to gain international recognition. The curbs on women’s freedoms are widely regarded as the harshest in the world. Mr Muttaqi had arrived in India on Thursday for a week of high-level talks with the government from Russia, the only country so far to fully recognise their government. New Delhi has not officially recognised Afghanistan’s de facto rulers but, like several other countries, continues to maintain limited diplomatic engagement — operating a small mission in Kabul and providing humanitarian assistance to the country. The visit is viewed as a significant step in strengthening ties between the two sides — offering the Taliban a boost in their pursuit of international recognition, while allowing India to advance its strategic and security objectives. On Friday, Mr Muttaqi met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would reopen its embassy in Kabul which was shut after the Taliban returned to power in 2021. The press event later in the day was attended by around 16 male reporters while female journalists were turned away from the embassy gates. India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) clarified that it “had no role” in organising the press interaction, noting that it took place at the Afghan embassy. However, the exclusion of female journalists on Indian soil sparked strong criticism from politicians and media circles, who faulted the government for allowing it.  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that by permitting the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “sending a message to every woman in India that she is too weak to be defended.” Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Dozens arrested, several injured as armoured vehicles, water cannon used to disperse charged crowd • Police say inspector martyred; around 50 cops badly injured in violent clashes • Conflicting reports emerge about fate of TLP chief; IGP says Saad Rizvi ‘not in custody’ • Second-tier leaders call on TLP supporters to converge on Lahore for protest on 17th LAHORE: The fate of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi remained shrouded in mystery after law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religious party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes , widespread chaos and dozens of arrests. The operation, which began around 3:30am, quickly spiralled into one of the most serious confrontations between police and TLP in recent months, continuing for nearly six hours. According to officials, some 1,500 police personnel in full anti-riot gear, supported by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons, surrounded the protest camp along the GT Road. By morning, authorities said they had detained hundreds of demonstrators, though exact figures remained unclear. There was, however, a significant discrepancy in casualty reports, with local media reporting a few deaths and dozens of injuries, while social media was rife with exaggerated claims. Nevertheless, Punjab Police confirmed the death of Inspector Shehzad Nawaz, who they said was shot during the operation. Local media reports said that at least four people, including the police officer, had been killed and 56 others injured. Unverified social media posts, however, claimed the toll among TLP supporters was far higher, with some alleging “dozens if not hundreds” of deaths — claims dismissed by Punjab’s police chief, Dr Usman Anwar, as “baseless rumours” and “a conspiracy to evoke public sympathy”. Adding to the uncertainty were unverified reports about the fate of Saad Rizvi, which spread rapidly across social media and WhatsApp groups on Monday. Several posts alleged that Mr Rizvi had been shot and was in critical condition, while other accounts claimed that he had been taken into custody. Interestingly, despite its active online presence, the TLP’s official accounts and spokespersons remained conspicuously silent on the matter, neither confirming nor denying rumours about their leader’s condition or whereabouts. Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that TLP chief Saad Rizvi had not been arrested, nor injured in Monday morning’s clashes. Ripples across the country By mid-morning, the unrest had spread to several other parts of the country. In Lahore, hundreds of TLP supporters took to the streets, blocking key intersections and damaging vehicles in protest at what they called a “brutal crackdown”. In Burewala, five police officers, including a deputy superintendent, were injured when TLP activists clashed with local law enforcers. In Faisalabad, demonstrators blocked the Chenab Chowk for nearly two hours, forcing the Government College University Faisalabad to postpone its scheduled examinations. Further south, dozens of protesters obstructed the national highway at Mian Channu for half an hour, while in Bahawalnagar, TLP members blocked the Bahawalnagar–Head Sulemanki Road near Minchinabad, prompting another round of arrests and the registration of criminal cases under multiple charges. In Karachi, similar scenes played out as TLP activists organised protests in North Karachi and New Karachi to denounce the police action in Punjab. Fear and uncertainty gripped the city as demonstrators blocked major thoroughfares and clashed with police. West Zone deputy inspector general Irfan Ali Baloch said protesters had set up sit-ins at 4-K Chowrangi and Sindhi Hotel, where they blocked roads and attacked police with stones, injuring two constables. “The police responded with tear gas and arrested five of them,” he told Dawn. “The situation was brought under control and traffic resumed.” Late on Monday night, Mufti Wazeer Ahmad Rizvi, a member of the TLP’s Majlis-e-Shura (executive committee), released a video message urging party supporters to end their agitation, clear all roads, and await further instructions. “We will announce our next strategy soon,” he said. Wazir Ahmad Rizvi, the group’s Balochistan emir, also called on protesters to disperse and converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar shrine on Oct 17. Stalled negotiations Explaining why an operation was launched against TLP workers, senior police officials said the crackdown had initially been halted after reports of renewed negotiations between the government and the TLP leadership. However, the talks quickly broke down. “The TLP’s demands were completely unreasonable,” said a senior Punjab police officer involved in the operation. “They wanted security forces withdrawn from the entire route to Islamabad and insisted that all arrested workers be released unconditionally.” According to the official, two rounds of talks were held between the early hours of Tuesday and Saturday night, but no progress was made. When the protesters began to march towards Islamabad despite repeated warnings, police deployed anti-riot units to block their advance. The situation escalated when “armed men among the protesters opened fire on police”, critically injuring Inspector Nawaz. ‘State brutality’ Following the heavy-handed government response, JUI-F’s leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman condemned the government’s use of force against Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists. Describing the operation as “state brutality”, Maulana asserted that the right to peaceful protest is fundamental for every citizen, criticising the government’s violent crackdown on TLP demonstrators as unacceptable. Maulana suggested that the government could have resolved the issue through dialogue rather than resorting to force. However, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif expressed a different perspective on the events, calling the protests “an insult to religion”. “Forming armed groups in the name of religion, blocking roads and holding the public hostage is an insult to religion. For two years, tyranny and a festival of blood were played out in Gaza, yet no one remembers any protests. When the ceasefire happened there, the protests began. The time has come to stop holding our society hostage… through violence in the name of religion,” he wrote on X.

Stalled negotiations Explaining why an operation was launched against TLP workers, senior police officials said the crackdown had initially been halted after reports of renewed negotiations between the government and the TLP leadership. However, the talks quickly broke down. “The TLP’s demands were completely unreasonable,” said a senior Punjab police officer involved in the operation. “They wanted security forces withdrawn from the entire route to Islamabad and insisted that all arrested workers be released unconditionally.” According to the official, two rounds of talks were held between the early hours of Tuesday and Saturday night, but no progress was made. When the protesters began to march towards Islamabad despite repeated warnings, police deployed anti-riot units to block their advance. The situation escalated when “armed men among the protesters opened fire on police”, critically injuring Inspector Nawaz. ‘State brutality’ Following the heavy-handed government response, JUI-F’s leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman condemned the government’s use of force against Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists. Describing the operation as “state brutality”, Maulana asserted that the right to peaceful protest is fundamental for every citizen, criticising the government’s violent crackdown on TLP demonstrators as unacceptable. Maulana suggested that the government could have resolved the issue through dialogue rather than resorting to force. However, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif expressed a different perspective on the events, calling the protests “an insult to religion”. “Forming armed groups in the name of religion, blocking roads and holding the public hostage is an insult to religion. For two years, tyranny and a festival of blood were played out in Gaza, yet no one remembers any protests. When the ceasefire happened there, the protests began. The time has come to stop holding our society hostage… through violence in the name of religion,” he wrote on X.

      "summary_orig": "• Trump, China offer to mediate; Russia welcomes ‘stabilisation’ of situation • FO tells Kabul to ‘mind own business’ after Mujahid’s comment on TLP protests • Cross-border trade, travel remain suspended ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Pakistan’s defence minister termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism. On Monday, troops stood on high alert, with border crossings closed for trade and travel after deadly clashes over the weekend. Fighting between the two sides erupted after Pakistan supposedly undertook an operation against militant hideouts along the  Afghan border. Speaking on Geo News , Defence Min­ister Khawaja Asif said that as of today, there are ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”. The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.” Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained. At least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side late on Saturday night. Mediation offers For his part, US President Donald Trump appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, saying he was ‘good at making peace’. “I hear there’s a war now going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel. “I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. You know, I’m doing another one, because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace,” he said. China, which shares borders with both Pakistan and Afghanistan, also expressed willingness to play a constructive role in improving relations between the two neighbours. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday voiced deep concern over the latest clashes, and similar sentiments were also shared by Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday called on Kabul and Islamabad to exercise restraint. “According to the incoming information, the situation is stabilising. We welcome this process,” it stated. ‘Mind your own business’ On the other hand, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is on a visit to New Delhi, said Afghanistan did not wish to fight with anyone and all its other neighbours were happy with Kabul. “War is not a solution to problems. There is a need for dialogue. This has been our policy,” Muttaqi told reporters in the Indian capital. But in an uncharacteristic comment about domestic politics, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid criticised Pakistan’s use of force against Tehreek-i-Labbaik protesters. Reacting sharply, the Foreign Office asked the Afghan spokesperson “to prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside [your] jurisdiction”. “The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters.” While the exchange of fire between the two countries ceased on Monday, all entry points have been “closed since Saturday following the unprovoked attacks by the Afghan Taliban forces,” a senior Pakistani security official told Reuters. Another official said there were a few incidents of exchange of small arms fire on Sunday night, but the overall situation was calm. This view was echoed by Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayat­ullah Khowarazmi, who said the “current situation” on the border was normal. However, cross-border trade remained suspended on Monday. Loaded vehicles, including containers and trucks, are stuck on both sides of the border. Besides fresh fruit and vegetables, they are carrying imports and exports and transit trade goods and causing millions of rupees of losses to the two countries as well as traders,” said Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, senior vice president of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.— Agencies / with input from Baqir Sajjad Syed Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday night issued a strongly-worded statement telling Afghanistan to focus on issues pertinent to itself and not to interfere in Islamabad’s internal affairs. The FO was responding to a statement by Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid slamming the police crackdown on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). The TLP, which began its protest march in Lahore on Friday, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. On Monday, police and law enforcement agencies launched an early-morning operation to disperse the protesters, who were encamped in Muridke. The clashes left a police officer and four civilians dead, including three TLP workers. Mujahid issued a statement earlier today in which Kabul expressed its condolences and said it was “profoundly saddened” by the violence and deaths and noted that the demonstrations were carried out “in accordance with the country’s legal framework”. “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and to the entire nation of Pakistan, and we wish a swift recovery to those who have been wounded,” Mujahid’s statement read. “We urge the Pakistani government and its ruling authorities to cease any further acts of violence against their people and to pursue resolution through dialogue and mutual understanding.” In response, the FO took to X and acknowledged the statement, urging Kabul to “prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside their jurisdiction”. “The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters,” the FO wrote. It also urged Kabul to abide by its obligations to the international community under the Doha Process and to “not allow its land to be used for terrorism against other countries”. “Besides, the regime should focus on [the] formation of an inclusive and truly representative government, instead of engaging in baseless propaganda,” the FO concluded.",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump especially thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and “my favourite” Field Marshal Asim Munir on Monday for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza, among many other world leaders. Trump was addressing a ceremony following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas at the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt. He also invited PM Shehbaz to deliver a special address at the ceremony. Taking the podium, PM Shehbaz thanked Trump and the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal. “Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity.” ’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team. And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East.“ PM Shehbaz said he wanted to salute Trump for his “exemplary [and] visionary leadership”. View this post on Instagram “You are the man this world needed the most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything [and] went out of the way to stop seven and today eight wars,” he added. The premier also thanked the Qatari emir for his efforts in securing peace in Gaza and the wider region, along with the efforts of the Turkish, Saudi and Emirati leadership. “Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened.” “Similarly, here in this part of the world in the Middle East, Mr president, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words.” Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.” PM meets other leaders PM Shehbaz earlier reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for peace in the region and solidarity with the people of Palestine as he met world leaders in Egypt. Two years of Israeli bombardment in the Palestinian enclave have claimed more than 67,000 lives, with the continuing to rise as more bodies are recovered. Last month, US President Trump had mediated a truce with the help of eight Muslim nations between Hamas and Israel and paved the way for the end of genocide in Gaza through a 20-point plan . Last week, Hamas and Israel had signed an agreement to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of Trump’s initiative to end the conflict. Yesterday, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said that the summit was the result of the diplomatic efforts that began on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th Session in New York last month. PM Shehbaz arrived in Egypt earlier today to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. The premier arrived at the Congress Centre to participate in the summit and was received upon arrival by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi. The prime minister met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting marked a rare moment of convergence between the two Caucasus nations and underscored the broader international commitment to de-escalation in the Middle East. The prime minister also held bilateral discussions with prominent global leaders, including King Abdullah II of Jordan, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud. The premier also met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who thanked Pakistan for its “unwavering political and diplomatic support’’. Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the Gaza ceasefire, and PM Shehbaz lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Palestinian people. During these meetings, PM Shehbaz emphasised the urgent need for coordinated international efforts to restore peace in the region. He highlighted Pakistans consistent stance on the Palestinian issue, reaffirming Islamabads unwavering diplomatic and moral support for the Palestinian people. “Our position is rooted in justice and humanity,” he said. “Pakistan will continue to stand by the Palestinian cause and support all peaceful initiatives aimed at ending violence and ensuring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.” The meetings also included discussions on broader regional stability, strengthening multilateral cooperation, and promoting dialogue to resolve long-standing conflicts. He later met Trump, who also arrived in Egypt to attend the signing ceremony and met world leaders as he welcomed them. View this post on Instagram Earlier, PM Shehbaz hailed the peace plan a “crucial step towards lasting peace in the Middle East”. “Grateful to our co-hosts, President El Sisi and President Trump. We would not have seen this moment without President Trump’s outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment,” PM Shehbaz said on X. “It took his single-minded pursuit of peace to end the needless killing and destruction,” he said. PM Shehbaz added that the ceremony marked the “closing of a genocidal chapter, one that the international community must ensure is never repeated anywhere again”. He said the “brave and resilient” Palestinian people deserve to live in a free Palestine, “with pre 1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as their capital city”. Trump, along with Sisi, will chair the summit set to be attended by world leaders, including the head of the United Nations. The gathering in the Red Sea resort town will bring together “leaders from more than 20 countries”, Sisi’s office had said. It will seek “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security”. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain will also attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, according to their offices. The European Council will be represented by its president, Antonio Costa, a spokesperson said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II is also expected to attend, according to state media. Israel and Hamas, however, will not attend the summit. “No Israeli official will attend,” Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told AFP yesterday. Similarly, Hamas confirmed it will not participate directly. Hossam Badran, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told AFP that the Palestinian group “will not be involved.” He noted that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous negotiations.",

      "summary_orig": "PTI MPA Sohail Afridi on Monday was elected the new chief executive of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and despite prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur. KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, who pushed ahead with the election despite the opposition walkout, announced that the three opposition candidates — Maulana Lutfur Rehman of JUI-F, Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP — all received zero votes. Noting that three members of the assembly were out of the country, he announced that Afridi had won the election after securing 90 votes, prompting chants in favour of the PTI leader to ring out in the assembly hall. Afridi had needed to secure at least 73 votes in the 145-strong KP Assembly to win the election. Out of a total of 53 opposition members, 51 walked out of the assembly on the call of the opposition leader; the remaining two were not present for the session. Meanwhile, leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah said they did not accept Afridi as the new chief minister. “The PTI is interpreting the law as per their understanding, we are doing it according to our understanding. There are grey areas and now the court has to decide,” he told Dawn.com , adding that the opposition would knock on the doors of the courts. He further contended that there were now “two chief ministers” in the province as Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted. It should be mentioned that while Gandapur has submitted two separate resignations to Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, both have been returned over “disparate signatures”. Kundi has summoned Gandapur on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter. Speaker sends summary to governor Separately, Speaker Swati posted on X that he had “formally sent the summary to the KP governor for [the] oath-taking”. Have no greed for the seat, will vacate it if directed to do so: Afridi Before announcing the results, KP Assembly Speaker Swati, in a message to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said that “KP still holds the forces dear because soldiers are out there defending the province and continue to make sacrifices”. Despite that, institutions can not be allowed to run parliament, he said. “The parliament is the representative jirga of the province’s people,” he added. Afridi then proceeded to deliver an emphatic speech in which he expressed his admiration of and loyalty to party founder Imran Khan. Speaking in the assembly, Afridi said that he was grateful to Imran for choosing someone who was a mere worker, belonged to a middle-class family and did not have familial links to politics. “And neither Bhutto, Zardari nor Sharif are attached to my name,” he thundered. He further said that he belonged to the tribal districts and was proud of his background. He said that a particular mindset had prevailed about tribal districts and its people over the past 78 years. “This mindset dictates that the people of tribal areas are only there to die, that tribal areas should always be far behind.” He further said that Imran was aware of the deprivation faced by the tribal districts. “However many times I thank [Imran], it is not enough,” he said. He further said that the tribal districts were ecstatic over the decision to field him as the new chief minister, and were thanking Imran and the party. “As is the vision of my leader Imran, one does not become a leader by writing Sharif or Bhutto or Zardari with their name,” he said. Afridi also extended his gratitude to Gandapur, saying that no one in the party had ever hesitated when it came to making sacrifices. “Ali bhai , the grace with which you tendered your resignation … I laud you for that.” Calling himself a “champion of politics of protest”, he said that he had nothing to lose. “No cars, no bungalows, no riches and no greed for the seat. The day my leader tells me to vacate the seat, I will kick it to the side.” He also said that there were reports that Imran, who is currently incarcerated, was being shifted without consultation with his family and the party. “I make this announcement, that if he is shifted without consultation, we will jam the whole country.” During his speech, Afridi also stated that military operations were not the “solution to terrorism” and called on the federal government to engage in dialogue, and involve the people of the province and the government in devising a solution. He recalled that he and his fellow party members had been raising alarm over terrorism for a long time, but “no one paid us any attention”. “In fact, we were accused of lying,” he added. “And today, they are conducting operations,” he said. Questioning the efficacy of military operations, Afridi asked, “Despite 14,000 intelligence-based operations, why has there been no decrease in terrorism? “My people are still internally-displaced persons (IDPs), their homes have been uprooted and they are dying,” he said, noting that “it is clear that military operations are not the solution”. He stressed that any policy concerning counter terror measures and Afghanistan had to take the people of the province into account. “They are kicking out our Afghan brothers and sisters — people who have been here for 40-50 years,” he said while referring to the repatriation of Afghan refugees. He also vowed to speak to the Centre about the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), stating, “I will ask why people who are merely asking for their rights have been treated in such a way.” PTI congratulates Afridi Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan congratulated Afridi on winning the election. “I hope the next step of taking oath takes place and the transition is completed smoothly. I pay strong tribute to the outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur. And I congratulate Afridi for his election,” he said. PTI leader Omar Ayub also congratulated Afridi, saying: “Our struggle for ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi ’ shall continue as per the vision and instructions of PM Imran Khan. Gratitude to former CM Ali Amin Khan Gandapur sahib for his unflinching support and efforts to make the transfer of power smooth,” he said. PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser also extended his “heartfelt congratulations” to Afridi. “Today marks an important milestone in the political history of Pakistan. It is a testament to the fact that Imran Khan has provided an opportunity for hardworking, talented and ideological workers from the youth and middle class to reach positions of leadership,” Qaiser said. “Afridi started his political struggle with student politics and with continuous hard work, perseverance and the spirit of serving the people … His election undoubtedly reflects the vision of Imran Khan, who is keen to bring forward a new, courageous and people-oriented leadership,” he said, adding that he was confident new avenues of progress, prosperity and transparent governance would open under the leadership of Afridi. PTI MNA Junaid Akbar expressed gratitude that all members of the provincial assembly were “standing with Imran Khan” and were united. “Only one member is outside the country,” Akbar said. “I pay tribute to all the members of the provincial assembly who have kept Imran Khan, the workers and themselves in their hearts and have not succumbed to any pressure or greed,” he said. Opposition decries ‘unconstitutional procedure’; speaker pushes ahead Prior to the election, Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah had spoken in the assembly and termed the election as “unconstitutional”. During his speech, he held up a copy of the Constitution and said: “According to this Constitution, the procedure is that first your resignation is accepted. Then the administration denotifies the cabinet.” He said the cabinet had not been denotified and Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted by the governor. “In the presence of an existing chief minister, the election of a new chief minister is unconstitutional. So we will not become a part of this unconstitutional procedure,“ he asserted. He also questioned the need for making the issue controversial. “If you already have the numbers, then why not wait a few days and have it be done constitutionally?” He reiterated that the process was “unconstitutional” and said that the opposition was staging a walkout as “it did not want to be a part of this”. Following the walkout, KP Assembly Speaker Swati said that Gandapur had sent his resignation to the governor twice and also announced the same in his speech in the assembly. Swati said that while some people wished for Afridi to not become the new chief minister, the Constitution did not function according to people’s wishes. “The chief minister of a province is a constitutional office holder in terms of Article 130. Clause eight of this article provides for tendering of a resignation by the chief minister under his hand … I rule that an election for the post of chief minister of KP is being lawfully conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the rules of the assembly,” he said. Speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah addressed the controversy and said: “Our stance is, and we think it to be absolutely correct, that the speaker should not have called the provincial assembly session until the resignation was accepted.” He also criticised Afridi for his speech, saying it did not befit a chief minister or a provincial assembly. Criticising Afridi’s view on military operations, he said the PTI should act as a political party if it wanted the state and institutions to engage with it democratically and politically. Sanaullah questioned how could a provincial government function if it did not cooperate or work together with the federal government, saying Afridi’s speech was akin to “mutiny”. He added that the Centre would try to prevent the situation from deteriorating but if Afridi’s conduct “remains as per his speech, then I don’t think he can conduct himself as the head of a provincial government in accordance with the Constitution and law”. Gandapur gives ‘advance congratulations’ to Afridi At the outset of the session, Gandapur gave his “advance congratulations” to Afridi as the treasury benches thumped their desks. He assured them that the PTI’s fight for justice would continue under the leadership of party founder Imran Khan. He expressed pride at the fact that he had submitted his resignation on October 8 on the directives of Imran. He also called for allowing the democratic process to continue and to refrain from putting any obstacles in this regard. He further said that everything he had done as the provincial chief executive was a part of record and could be examined. “A government can only succeed, a province can only succeed if it is self sustainable. Unfortunately, when our government came into power, we only had enough money for salaries for 18 months. But I am proudly saying right now that we have Rs280 million in the treasury,” he said. He further said that his government provided more than what it allocated under the Annual Development Programme. He stated that under Imran’s vision, he had provided funds to all constituencies. “In the end, I would like to say that we have a movement, a struggle and that struggle is not limited to Imran Khan. The sacrifice that he is making right now, he is doing it for the good of the nation. We stand with him and will continue to do so,” he said. He also called for addressing the challenges the province was facing, saying that the law and order situation was more important than engaging in a war of words. “We have to move forward  and focus on these challenges,” he said. KP governor returns Gandapur’s resignation over ‘disparate’ signature Separately, the controversy around Gandapur’s resignation took another turn on Sunday night after Governor Kundi returned two separate letters submitted by the former over “disparate signatures” and summoned him on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter. In a post on social media platform X, Kundi said that the chief minister’s resignation had been “returned with observation”. He also shared a letter addressed to Gandapur, wherein he stated that two resignation letters had been received by the Governor House on October 8 and October 11, both of which had “disparate and unalike signatures”. “Since I am out of city, and intend to return to Peshawar on the ever of October 15, therefore, you are advised to visit Governor House on October 15 at 3pm so that the authenticity of the alleged resignations could be verified and the matter is settled as per the mandate of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he said. Meanwhile, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X and said: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.” He further stated that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”. On October 8, Gandapur said he had resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role. The letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape , with the Governor’s House denying having ever received it. On October 11, Kundi had stated that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he had added. A day earlier, a parliamentary delegation of PTI had met Kundi at his residence in Islamabad. The delegation included Asad Qaiser, Atif Khan, Junaid Akbar and others. PTI representatives had sought support from the PPP to ensure democratic values during the election for the chief minister. They said the PPP had always claimed that it gave value to the democratic norms. Kundi had stated that Gandapur’s resignation would be accepted as per constitutional requirements. He had also stressed the need for joint efforts to ensure peace and the public services in the province.",

The day my leader tells me to vacate the seat, I will kick it to the side.” He also said that there were reports that Imran, who is currently incarcerated, was being shifted without consultation with his family and the party. “I make this announcement, that if he is shifted without consultation, we will jam the whole country.” During his speech, Afridi also stated that military operations were not the “solution to terrorism” and called on the federal government to engage in dialogue, and involve the people of the province and the government in devising a solution. He recalled that he and his fellow party members had been raising alarm over terrorism for a long time, but “no one paid us any attention”. “In fact, we were accused of lying,” he added. “And today, they are conducting operations,” he said. Questioning the efficacy of military operations, Afridi asked, “Despite 14,000 intelligence-based operations, why has there been no decrease in terrorism? “My people are still internally-displaced persons (IDPs), their homes have been uprooted and they are dying,” he said, noting that “it is clear that military operations are not the solution”. He stressed that any policy concerning counter terror measures and Afghanistan had to take the people of the province into account. “They are kicking out our Afghan brothers and sisters — people who have been here for 40-50 years,” he said while referring to the repatriation of Afghan refugees. He also vowed to speak to the Centre about the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), stating, “I will ask why people who are merely asking for their rights have been treated in such a way.” PTI congratulates Afridi Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan congratulated Afridi on winning the election. “I hope the next step of taking oath takes place and the transition is completed smoothly. I pay strong tribute to the outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur. And I congratulate Afridi for his election,” he said. PTI leader Omar Ayub also congratulated Afridi, saying: “Our struggle for ‘ Haqeeqi Azadi ’ shall continue as per the vision and instructions of PM Imran Khan. Gratitude to former CM Ali Amin Khan Gandapur sahib for his unflinching support and efforts to make the transfer of power smooth,” he said. PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser also extended his “heartfelt congratulations” to Afridi. “Today marks an important milestone in the political history of Pakistan. It is a testament to the fact that Imran Khan has provided an opportunity for hardworking, talented and ideological workers from the youth and middle class to reach positions of leadership,” Qaiser said. “Afridi started his political struggle with student politics and with continuous hard work, perseverance and the spirit of serving the people … His election undoubtedly reflects the vision of Imran Khan, who is keen to bring forward a new, courageous and people-oriented leadership,” he said, adding that he was confident new avenues of progress, prosperity and transparent governance would open under the leadership of Afridi. PTI MNA Junaid Akbar expressed gratitude that all members of the provincial assembly were “standing with Imran Khan” and were united. “Only one member is outside the country,” Akbar said. “I pay tribute to all the members of the provincial assembly who have kept Imran Khan, the workers and themselves in their hearts and have not succumbed to any pressure or greed,” he said. Opposition decries ‘unconstitutional procedure’; speaker pushes ahead Prior to the election, Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah had spoken in the assembly and termed the election as “unconstitutional”. During his speech, he held up a copy of the Constitution and said: “According to this Constitution, the procedure is that first your resignation is accepted. Then the administration denotifies the cabinet.” He said the cabinet had not been denotified and Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted by the governor. “In the presence of an existing chief minister, the election of a new chief minister is unconstitutional. So we will not become a part of this unconstitutional procedure,“ he asserted. He also questioned the need for making the issue controversial. “If you already have the numbers, then why not wait a few days and have it be done constitutionally?” He reiterated that the process was “unconstitutional” and said that the opposition was staging a walkout as “it did not want to be a part of this”. Following the walkout, KP Assembly Speaker Swati said that Gandapur had sent his resignation to the governor twice and also announced the same in his speech in the assembly. Swati said that while some people wished for Afridi to not become the new chief minister, the Constitution did not function according to people’s wishes. “The chief minister of a province is a constitutional office holder in terms of Article 130. Clause eight of this article provides for tendering of a resignation by the chief minister under his hand … I rule that an election for the post of chief minister of KP is being lawfully conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the rules of the assembly,” he said. Speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah addressed the controversy and said: “Our stance is, and we think it to be absolutely correct, that the speaker should not have called the provincial assembly session until the resignation was accepted.” He also criticised Afridi for his speech, saying it did not befit a chief minister or a provincial assembly. Criticising Afridi’s view on military operations, he said the PTI should act as a political party if it wanted the state and institutions to engage with it democratically and politically. Sanaullah questioned how could a provincial government function if it did not cooperate or work together with the federal government, saying Afridi’s speech was akin to “mutiny”. He added that the Centre would try to prevent the situation from deteriorating but if Afridi’s conduct “remains as per his speech, then I don’t think he can conduct himself as the head of a provincial government in accordance with the Constitution and law”. Gandapur gives ‘advance congratulations’ to Afridi At the outset of the session, Gandapur gave his “advance congratulations” to Afridi as the treasury benches thumped their desks. He assured them that the PTI’s fight for justice would continue under the leadership of party founder Imran Khan. He expressed pride at the fact that he had submitted his resignation on October 8 on the directives of Imran. He also called for allowing the democratic process to continue and to refrain from putting any obstacles in this regard. He further said that everything he had done as the provincial chief executive was a part of record and could be examined. “A government can only succeed, a province can only succeed if it is self sustainable. Unfortunately, when our government came into power, we only had enough money for salaries for 18 months. But I am proudly saying right now that we have Rs280 million in the treasury,” he said. He further said that his government provided more than what it allocated under the Annual Development Programme. He stated that under Imran’s vision, he had provided funds to all constituencies. “In the end, I would like to say that we have a movement, a struggle and that struggle is not limited to Imran Khan. The sacrifice that he is making right now, he is doing it for the good of the nation. We stand with him and will continue to do so,” he said. He also called for addressing the challenges the province was facing, saying that the law and order situation was more important than engaging in a war of words. “We have to move forward  and focus on these challenges,” he said. KP governor returns Gandapur’s resignation over ‘disparate’ signature Separately, the controversy around Gandapur’s resignation took another turn on Sunday night after Governor Kundi returned two separate letters submitted by the former over “disparate signatures” and summoned him on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter. In a post on social media platform X, Kundi said that the chief minister’s resignation had been “returned with observation”. He also shared a letter addressed to Gandapur, wherein he stated that two resignation letters had been received by the Governor House on October 8 and October 11, both of which had “disparate and unalike signatures”. “Since I am out of city, and intend to return to Peshawar on the ever of October 15, therefore, you are advised to visit Governor House on October 15 at 3pm so that the authenticity of the alleged resignations could be verified and the matter is settled as per the mandate of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he said. Meanwhile, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X and said: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.” He further stated that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”. On October 8, Gandapur said he had resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role. The letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape , with the Governor’s House denying having ever received it. On October 11, Kundi had stated that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he had added. A day earlier, a parliamentary delegation of PTI had met Kundi at his residence in Islamabad. The delegation included Asad Qaiser, Atif Khan, Junaid Akbar and others. PTI representatives had sought support from the PPP to ensure democratic values during the election for the chief minister. They said the PPP had always claimed that it gave value to the democratic norms. Kundi had stated that Gandapur’s resignation would be accepted as per constitutional requirements. He had also stressed the need for joint efforts to ensure peace and the public services in the province.",

      "summary_orig": "Former Pakistan Test batter Wazir Mohammad passed away on Monday at the age of 95, according to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). According to ESPNCricinfo , the right-hander was born in Junagadh in 1929, and his siblings included renowned cricketers Hanif, Mushtaq and Raees Mohammad. “One of the four Mohammad brothers to represent Pakistan in Test cricket, he featured in 20 matches for his country from 1952 to 1959,” the PCB wrote in a post on X, extending its condolences. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi expressed his condolences to Mohammad’s family in a statement, paying tribute to the batter’s services to Test cricket. “Wazir Mohammad was a good batsman and an extremely refined human being,” Naqvi was quoted as saying, offering prayers for the family. ‘A guiding light’ In Pakistan’s early days, a group of brothers used to play cricket in the compound of a temple at Karachi’s Haji Camp. All five of them, who had migrated to the city from Junagadh in India, were right-handed batters and each highly talented, but the eldest brother wished for one of them to be a left-hander. “One fine day, he told me, ‘We don’t have a left-hander in our family, why don’t you become one?’“ former Pakistan Test player Sadiq Mohammad narrated to Dawn.com about his brother Wazir on Monday. “And then I did,” continues Sadiq. “I used to get five chances while others got only one. ‘Bat left-handed hamesha (always),’ he would say.” The oldest member of Pakistan’s first-ever Test team, that was the level of respect Wazir demanded as not only a brother, but also later on in his short but celebrated cricket career. A lower-order batter himself, he went on to play 20 Tests for Pakistan between 1952-59. His 801 runs at a meagre average of 27.62 in Tests is a classic case of statistics being untruthful, with his 40.40 in 160 First Class matches fighting his case. One of the standout achievements of Wazir’s career, in fact, remains his four-hour-long unbeaten knock of 42 in the 1954 Oval Test, which became Pakistan’s maiden win in England. His century partnership with the country’s first Test captain, Abdul Hafeez Kardar, in 1956-57 got Pakistan their first win against Australia. Wazir was also the national side’s only century-maker in the 1957-58 win against the West Indies, Pakistan’s maiden against the then great side. “He scored that against a star-studded West Indies bowling attack featuring Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith,” Sadiq said. “He was such a strong personality and he had waited for the opportunity to save Pakistan. He was a very organised cricketer.” Sadiq added how Wazir’s immense knowledge of the laws of the game made him a trusted associate for Kardar. “Wazir bhai had a big impact [on Pakistan cricket] as he knew all laws of the game,” he said. “He guided Kardar on numerous occasions when the captain had any confusion about the rules.” As per ESPNCricinfo , in the Kingston Test of 1957-58, when Garry Sobers made the record score of 365, the crowd stormed the ground. A patch of the pitch was damaged to the extent that a crater developed. The West Indian declaration arrived at the same time, meaning Pakistan had an awkward 90 minutes to bat that day. Wazir told Kardar to tell the umpires that, as per the laws of the game, the wicket was not suitable for batting since the wear and tear was not due to natural reasons. The umpires initially showed reluctance to accept Pakistan’s viewpoint, but eventually, after consulting the rule book, they agreed. As an elder brother, Sadiq said, Wazir was a guiding light. “He used to calm us down, he taught us how, when and when not to take panga (fight) with opponent players. And if we did, he guided us [on] how to handle it.” Wazir also served as an advisor to the PCB after his retirement before moving to the United Kingdom. His cricketing aptitude and grip over the game’s laws may have been an effect of his disciplined lifestyle. “He was a very disciplined person; from his childhood till he fell ill recently, he used to sleep as early as nine in the night,” Sadiq said.",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump told the Israeli parliament on Monday that the ceasefire he helped broker in the Gaza conflict had ushered in the “historic dawn of a new Middle East”. “And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity,” he said. “This is not only the end of a war … This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.“ Trump’s lightning visit to Israel came ahead of a summit in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh co-chaired by the American president, who has declared the conflict in Gaza “over”. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel is due to release nearly 2,000 Palestinians held in its jails. Addressing the Israeli parliament, Trump called the agreement that brought about a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the captives held by Hamas a triumph as he thanked mediators from the Arab and Muslim world. “Let me also convey my tremendous appreciation for all of the nations of the Arab and Muslim world that came together to press Hamas to set the hostages free and to send them home,” Trump said in remarks before the Israeli parliament. “We had a lot of help, we had a lot of help from a lot of people that you wouldn’t suspect, and I want to thank them very much for that. It’s an incredible triumph for Israel and the world to have all of these nations working together as partners in peace.“ The address to the Israeli parliament was briefly interrupted as two Israeli lawmakers were expelled. Ayman Odeh held a sign that read “Recognise Palestine”, while Ofer Cassif also attempted to raise a sign, leading to their removal, Times of Israel reported . “That was very efficient,” Trump quipped as the MPs were quickly taken out. The US president had paused as a Knesset staff member audibly ordered the expulsion of Cassif after an apparent protest. Trump hailed an end to a “painful nightmare” after two years of fighting in Gaza during his address. “From October 7 until this week, Israel has been a nation at war, enduring burdens that only a proud and faithful people could withstand,” he said. “For so many families across this land, it has been years since you’ve known a single day of true peace … The long and painful nightmare is finally over,” the US president added. “The forces of chaos that have plagued the region are totally defeated,” he said. Trump also said he wanted a peace deal with Iran, after the US joined Israel in striking the Islamic republic’s nuclear sites during a brief war earlier this year. “They got it from one side, from the other, and you know it would be great if we could make a peace deal with them,” Trump said of Iran. “Would you be happy with that? Wouldn’t it be nice, I think. Because I think they want to. “ Trump ‘greatest friend’ Israel has had in White House: Netanyahu Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel could pursue new “peace treaties” with Arab and Muslim countries in the Middle East and beyond. “Under your leadership, we can forge new peace treaties with Arab countries in the region and Muslim countries beyond the region,” Netanyahu said, adding that “no one wants peace more than the people of Israel”. He described Trump as the “greatest friend” Israel has ever had in the White House. “Donald Trump is the greatest friend that the state of Israel has ever had in the White House. No American president has ever done more for Israel,” Netanyahu said in parliament before Trump’s address to lawmakers. Israel has said it does not expect all of the dead hostages to be returned today. Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is also due to return the bodies of the 27 captives who died or were killed in detention, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in 2014 during a previous Gaza conflict. Among those Israel was due to release in exchange are 250 security detainees, while about 1,700 were detained by the Israeli army in Gaza during the conflict. ‘Nothing looks the same’ in flattened Gaza In Gaza, too, the ceasefire has brought relief, but with much of the territory flattened by fighting, the road to recovery remains long. “I returned to Sheikh Radwan with my heart trembling,” 38-year-old Fatima Salem told AFP after she returned to her neighbourhood in Gaza City. “My eyes kept searching for landmarks I had lost — nothing looked the same, even the neighbours’ houses were gone. “Despite the exhaustion and fear, I felt like I was coming back to my safe place. I missed the smell of my home, even if it’s now just rubble. We will pitch a tent next to it and wait for reconstruction.” Trump’s visit to the Middle East aims to celebrate his role in brokering last week’s ceasefire and hostage release deal — but comes at a precarious time as Israel and Hamas negotiate what comes next. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One at the start of the “very special” visit, Trump brushed off concerns about whether the ceasefire would endure. “I think it’s going to hold. I think people are tired of it. It’s been centuries,” he said of the fighting. “The war is over. Okay? You understand that?” the US president added. Final details Trump announced in late September a 20-point plan for Gaza, which helped bring about the ceasefire. Negotiators were still wrangling late on Sunday over the final arrangements for the exchanges, with two Hamas sources telling AFP the group was insisting that Israel include seven senior Palestinian leaders on the list of those to be released. Israel has previously rejected at least one of those names. After visiting Israel, Trump will head to Egypt, where he and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will co-host a summit of world leaders to back his plan to end the Gaza conflict and promote Middle East peace. While Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas is due at the summit, Netanyahu’s office said the Israeli premier will not attend due to the start of a religious holiday. In Egypt, Trump will be looking to resolve some of the huge uncertainty around the next phases of the peace plan, including Hamas’s refusal to disarm and Israel’s failure to pledge a full withdrawal from the devastated territory. Trump insisted he had “guarantees” from both sides and other key regional players about the initial phase of the deal, and the future stages. A new governing body for devastated Gaza — which Trump himself would head under his own plan — would be established “very quickly”, he added. Under the plan, as Israel conducts a partial withdrawal from Gaza, it will be replaced by a multi-national force coordinated by a US-led command centre in Israel. Hamas urged Trump and the mediators of the Gaza deal today to ensure Israel does not resume operations in Gaza. “We call on all mediators and international parties to continue monitoring Israel’s conduct and to ensure it does not resume its aggression against our people in Gaza,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said. Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 67,869 people. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands buried under the rubble.",

      "summary_en": "United States President Donald Trump told the Israeli parliament on Monday that the ceasefire he helped broker in the Gaza conflict had ushered in the “historic dawn of a new Middle East”. “And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity,” he said. “This is not only the end of a war … This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.“ Trump’s lightning visit to Israel came ahead of a summit in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh co-chaired by the American president, who has declared the conflict in Gaza “over”. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel is due to release nearly 2,000 Palestinians held in its jails. Addressing the Israeli parliament, Trump called the agreement that brought about a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the captives held by Hamas a triumph as he thanked mediators from the Arab and Muslim world. “Let me also convey my tremendous appreciation for all of the nations of the Arab and Muslim world that came together to press Hamas to set the hostages free and to send them home,” Trump said in remarks before the Israeli parliament. “We had a lot of help, we had a lot of help from a lot of people that you wouldn’t suspect, and I want to thank them very much for that. It’s an incredible triumph for Israel and the world to have all of these nations working together as partners in peace.“ The address to the Israeli parliament was briefly interrupted as two Israeli lawmakers were expelled. Ayman Odeh held a sign that read “Recognise Palestine”, while Ofer Cassif also attempted to raise a sign, leading to their removal, Times of Israel reported . “That was very efficient,” Trump quipped as the MPs were quickly taken out. The US president had paused as a Knesset staff member audibly ordered the expulsion of Cassif after an apparent protest. Trump hailed an end to a “painful nightmare” after two years of fighting in Gaza during his address. “From October 7 until this week, Israel has been a nation at war, enduring burdens that only a proud and faithful people could withstand,” he said. “For so many families across this land, it has been years since you’ve known a single day of true peace … The long and painful nightmare is finally over,” the US president added. “The forces of chaos that have plagued the region are totally defeated,” he said. Trump also said he wanted a peace deal with Iran, after the US joined Israel in striking the Islamic republic’s nuclear sites during a brief war earlier this year. “They got it from one side, from the other, and you know it would be great if we could make a peace deal with them,” Trump said of Iran. “Would you be happy with that?
