      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Police on Saturday submitted a report in the Lahore High Court (LHC) detailing the security plan for the upcoming three-day Basant festival. Basant will be celebrated in Lahore from February 6-8, following the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025, that ended a suspension of the festival after almost two decades. The report identified areas of concern for the 2026 festival, based on data from the last decade, and urged full implementation of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025. It stated that registration of every kite and spool of string is mandatory through a QR code and there would be zero tolerance for glass, chemical-coated, or metallic wire. According to the report, Lahore has been divided into red, yellow, and green zones, while officials will continuously monitor kite-flying activities through drones, social media, and control rooms. It also warned that strict action will be taken against aerial firing, drinking, and illegal activities on rooftops. The report stated that it would be mandatory for motorcycle riders to wear a helmet and prohibited their entry into red zones without a safety antenna installed. On January 6, the LHC sought reports from the Inspector General of Police and the Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) regarding security and safety arrangements being taken for the festival. Justice Malik Awais Khalid heard a petition filed by Judicial Activism Panel (JAP) through Advocate Azhar Siddique questioning the alleged failure of the government and the police to make security arrangements for Basant under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.",

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar expressed his hope for peace and stability in Iran on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said. According to a post by the FO on X, Dar spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in a phone call in which the two diplomats discussed the current situation in Iran and the wider region. Dar “expressed hope for peace and stability, and both sides agreed to continue bilateral consultations on matters of mutual interest”, the statement added. On Thursday, Pakistan had expressed hope at the United Nations Security Council for an early normalisation of the situation in Iran, which saw its largest demonstrations in years, challenging the country’s government. Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds. Protests have taken place across Iran in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions. US President Donald Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters. However, monitors reported that the protests have subsided after a crackdown by security forces, while Trump declared that he had decided not to attack the country. Meanwhile, the same day, FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said that instability in neighbouring Iran did not suit Pakistan, underscoring that calm and stability in Iran were directly linked to Pakistan’s own interests. He also said that Pakistan was engaging with Washington on the issue of tariffs being imposed on countries conducting trade with Iran. Earlier this week, Iran’s envoy to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, met the chairman of the National Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem, where he expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its support. He said it had been given “wholeheartedly”, stressing that the country needed moral and political support, rather than material assistance.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States has announced the launch of the second phase of President Donald Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, shifting focus from ceasefire implementation to demilitarisation, technocratic governance and reconstruction. In a social media post, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said that the high-profile ‘ Board of Peace ’ unveiled on Friday was a move “from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction”. Witkoff said the initiative marks a decisive move toward stabilising the war-ravaged territory, declaring: “Today, on behalf of President Trump, we are announcing the launch of Phase Two… moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction.” He said the plan will establish “a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in Gaza, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza,” and begin “the full demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorized personnel.” Warning Hamas of consequences for non-compliance, Witkoff added: “The United States expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations, including the immediate return of the final deceased hostage… Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.” Witkoff said the initial stage had produced significant results, noting that “Phase One delivered historic humanitarian aid, maintained the ceasefire, returned all living hostages and the remains of twenty-seven of the twenty-eight deceased hostages.” He also expressed gratitude to regional mediators, saying Egypt, Turkey and Qatar played “indispensable” roles in advancing the agreement. ‘Board of Peace’ unveiled Earlier Friday, the White House said it has formed an executive panel tasked with implementing the plan, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff, Jared Kushner, World Bank President Ajay Banga and former British prime minister Tony Blair, among others. The panel will supervise portfolios ranging from governance and regional diplomacy to reconstruction financing and investment mobilisation. According to the White House statement, the broader ‘Board of Peace’ will provide strategic oversight, coordinate international resources, and ensure accountability during Gaza’s transition from conflict to development. The US also plans to deploy an international stabilisation force and appoint a high representative to coordinate governance, security and reconstruction efforts in Gaza under the transitional framework. The announcement comes amid continuing tensions on the ground, with Hamas still refusing to disarm and yet to return the remains of the final hostage — a key requirement of the first phase. Although the ceasefire achieved in October has reduced large-scale hostilities, it has been punctuated by sporadic clashes and airstrikes, leaving the outlook for lasting peace uncertain. President Trump described the newly formed board as “the greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled,” according to a social media post announcing the initiative. Analysts say the coming weeks will test whether Washington can translate the ambitious blueprint into tangible progress on governance, security and reconstruction in Gaza, as negotiations over demilitarisation and political transition intensify.",

      "summary_orig": "Protests in Iran have subsided after a crackdown by security forces amid an internet blackout, monitors said Friday, a week after the start of the largest demonstrations in years challenging the country’s government. Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of Iran’s late shah, however, said he was confident the Islamic republic would fall and called for intervention, though the threat of new military action by the United States against Iran has appeared to have receded for the time being. In posts to social media on Friday, Pahlavi announced a fresh coordinated demonstration, calling for Iranians to “raise your voices in anger and protest with our national slogans” on the weekend. Protests sparked by economic grievances started with a shutdown in the Tehran bazaar on December 28 but turned into a mass movement demanding the removal of the clerical system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 revolution. People started pouring into the streets in big cities from January 8 but authorities immediately enforced a shutdown of the internet that has lasted over a week and activists say is aimed at masking the scale of the crackdown. The “brutal” repression has “likely suppressed the protest movement for now”, said the US-based Institute for the Study of War, which has monitored the protest activity. But it added: “The regime’s widespread mobilisation of security forces is unsustainable, however, which makes it possible that protests could resume.” Pahlavi also told a news conference in Washington on Friday that “The Islamic republic will fall – not if, but when.” “I will return to Iran,” he said. ‘Give Iran a chance’ Monitor Netblocks said that the “total internet blackout” in Iran had now lasted over 180 hours, longer than a similar measure that was imposed during 2019 protests. Amnesty International said this was being backed up by the use of heavily armed patrols and checkpoints to crush “the nationwide popular uprising in Iran” with security forces visible in the streets. Trump, who backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war against Iran in June, had not ruled out new military action against Tehran and made clear he was keeping a close eye on if any protesters were executed. But a senior Saudi official told AFP on Thursday that Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman led “a long, frantic, diplomatic last-minute effort to convince President Trump to give Iran a chance to show good intention”. While Washington appeared to have stepped back , the White House said Thursday that “all options remain on the table for the president”. Attention had focused on the fate of Erfan Soltani, a 26-year-old protestor who rights activists and Washington said was set to be executed as early as Wednesday. The Iranian judiciary confirmed Soltani was under arrest but said he had not been sentenced to death and his charges meant he did not risk capital punishment. Rights groups have estimated up to 20,000 people have been arrested. Security officials cited by the Tasnim news agency on Friday said around 3,000 people were arrested. ‘All Iranians united’ The US Treasury on Thursday announced new sanctions targeting Iranian officials including Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme Council for National Security. Russian President Vladimir Putin meanwhile held telephone talks with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in what the Kremlin described as “efforts to facilitate de-escalation”. Despite the internet shutdown, new videos from the height of the protests, with locations verified by AFP, showed bodies lined up in the Kahrizak morgue south of Tehran, as distraught relatives searched for loved ones. At the UN Security Council in New York, Iranian-American journalist Masih Alinejad, invited to address the body by Washington, said “all Iranians are united” against the clerical system in Iran. Iran’s representative at the meeting, Gholamhossein Darzi, accused Washington of “exploitation of peaceful protests for geopolitical purposes. “",

Towards this end, fully armed Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are harassing everyone who is not white. Refusing to adhere to any constitutional constraints, they are dragging out black and brown children from high schools, employees from stores and travellers from airports and taking them to detention centres even if they are US citizens. In Minneapolis, where a white woman Renee Good was killed as a result of this frenzy, ICE agents were going into Somali-American neighbourhoods and pulling out entire families for detention. It is no surprise then that this week, the State Department tweeted that it would “pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates. The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people”. Following this, the list of countries was released, with the implicit allegation that those applying for immigration from these states were dependent on public benefits after arriving in the US, i.e., they were using Medicaid, food stamps, housing assistance and other programmes designed for indigent Americans. No statistical evidence was provided to substantiate the claim that immigrants from these countries were more likely than others to use public benefits. In fact, the administration doesn’t have to provide proof. The first Trump administration (2017-2021) weaponised the ‘public charge’ rule to scrutinise the likelihood of arriving immigrants using public benefits, making it hard for applicants to obtain Green Cards — in line with the Trumpian stance that immigrants were a general scourge. However, the following Biden administration restored the rule to what it had been before 2016. Last November, the administration again proposed a new draft of the rule which states: “The 2022 regulations are not the best implementation of the statute, inconsistent with congressional intent, unduly restrictive, and hamper DHS’s [Department of Homeland Security] ability to make accurate, precise and reliable determinations of whether certain aliens are likely at any time to become a public charge”. Rescinding the rule would give immigration officers a freer hand to decide on immigrants’ use of public benefits in line with the government’s position that these should not encourage immigration. The agony over visas does not matter to Trump’s administration. The State Department is tasked with enforcing this new understanding of the public charge rule and the 75 countries now face an indefinite pause in the processing of applications. Given that the Trump project is so inherently tied up with Christian nationalism and white supremacy, this shouldn’t be a surprise. In effect, it’s a moratorium on brown and black people immigrating because of family ties. Even spousal visas, which have historically been exceptions, are included in the pause. Those applying for non-immigrant visas are exempt, which means that people applying for B tourist visas, F student visas, J exchange visitor visas and H and L employment-based visas will have their applications processed and visas issued. However, these categories are subject to other hindrances (such as the high fee for H-1B visas). A number of countries are also subject to a travel ban , which means their citizens cannot obtain a US visa un­­der any circumstances. Undoub­te­d­­ly, this pause is going to pro­ve a significa­­nt obstacle to those who have been seeking US immigrant visas. Those who have rec­ently married a US citizen and are waiting for their visas to be processed, or parents who are awaiting Green Cards, face uncertainty. With many cases filed, people are left in limbo. None of this international agony matters to the Trump administration. If anything, the stricter the rules it imposes on non-white immigrants, the happier it imagines its white supremacist MAGA base will be. Trump’s inability to revive the economy or create jobs, both of which were core promises of his poll campaign, mean that he has to take harsh actions involving immigrants in the hope that it will satisfy his increasingly annoyed voter base. And, midterm elections are coming up this year, with early indications that a strong anti-Trump sentiment will cause the Republican to lose the House and Senate and end the carte blanche that Trump now enjoys.

      "summary_orig": "THE withdrawal of the US from 66 international organisations has not been noticed enough given the focus on President Donald Trump forcibly arresting the Venezuelan president, claiming to govern his country and then openly threatening to annex Greenland. In fact, the Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act bill has also been tabled. Nato members are struggling to find the right words to respond to the US and to President Trump who seems not to care even if Nato members ask him to remove bases and nuclear warheads from their territories. The intervention spree is spreading well beyond the Monroe Doctrine, although this doctrine should have been discarded after the 1945 UN Charter as it was contradicting politically what was being committed legally. The direction where US policies were heading was correctly read by Russia and China a decade ago well before Trump’s first tenure when in a surprise move both the states in 2016 came out with a Joint Declaration on International Law against unilateralism. More recently, the biggest operational signalling was made when the US Department of Defence was renamed the Department of War through Executive Order 14347. Anyone with an interest in international law would have rightly conjectured that the Trump administration’s legal team was preparing internally and externally for something unusual. The UN Charter had established a new norm against war, declaring it illegal, and replacing the word with the legal term ‘use of force’, which, too, is allowed only in self-defence. Thus the erstwhile Department of War became the Department of Defence in 1947 to comply with the Charter’s prohibition, also indicating that from then on, force would only be used in defence — even if anticipatory defence. Thus the Trump administration’s decision to rename it last year was deliberate — a warning of sorts about what was to come in the days ahead — in open defiance of the Charter’s prohibition of acts of aggression or attempts to occupy a foreign land through a declared war. That has regrettably happened in the case of Venezuela, and is happening in the case of Greenland. It is likely to happen in Iran , and Canada has been threatened as well. Hence Greenlanders, Danes, Europeans and the rest of the leaders are at a loss and trying to figure out how they should respond to a violation of a norm that each of the 195 world states willingly and voluntarily agreed to, implemented, acted upon, relied upon and fully believed in for over seven decades. It had been so fundamental and central to global peace and security that no state dare construe it otherwise. As if this weren’t enough, President Trump’s memorandum dated Jan 7, 2026, directs the executive branch to start taking steps to withdraw from 66 international bodies. Global governance institutions are not passive or symbolic arenas; they are places where deliberations take place, where norms are shaped, which are gradually transformed into binding frameworks. When the US withdraws, it does not remove itself from the effects of global rules; instead, it removes itself from the leadership of the process by which those rules are written and interpreted. The most immediate consequence of the US withdrawal is the creation of a strategic vacuum. China, Russia and other important developing countries have shown a sustained preference for remaining inside multilateral institutions. When the US exits, it allows alternative visions of the global order to gain legitimacy. From the perspective of US competitors then, the American withdrawal is not a setback but an opportunity. When the US exits, it effectively hands over agenda-setting power, reduces contestation, and allows alternative visions of the international order to gain legitimacy. Here, it opens up no less a serious opportunity for coordinated developing countries’ blocs, such as the G77 or the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, that can increase their influence when a major agenda-setter withdraws. These legal platforms offer opportunities to developing countries to come together and steer these bodies perhaps even better. Those who keep a track of international politics and law recall how despite US reservations, developing countries negotiated the well-known 1982 Law of the Sea Convention that regulated the traditional freedom of the high seas. Mining control over minerals, platinum, rare earths, and other material in the deep seabed, despite objections from the US, was conferred on the International Seabed Authority by the developing countries. Another example where developing states found their way was the establishment of the International Criminal Court through the Rome Statute. It is still openly opposed by the US. Yet it is established, has handed down 11 convictions after lengthy trials, issued around 60 arrest warrants, and there are 12 investigations ongoing. Apart from that, there are numerous examples of how several international treaties and frameworks have been finalised and continue to function despite reservations from the US. The long-term costs of withdrawal from international bodies are cumulative and may be invisible in the short term to the Trump administration. By withdrawing, the US does not shield itself from these developments; it merely loses the ability to shape them at an early stage. Historically, American influence has rested not only on material power but also on its capacity to convene allies, bridge divides between developed and developing states, and steer multilateral outcomes. Re-entry, when it occurs, rarely restores previous influence automatically; it often requires concessions and a rebuilding of credibility. Speaking to the BBC last week, I had stated that the norm of non-intervention is actually being solidified even more despite its breach by the Trump administration at present. Notice how the entire world, all regions, all states representing diverse civilisations have stood up in protest. The norm against war, against non-intervention is not merely a law laid down in 1945; it represents a multi-civilisational maturity achieved after thousands of years of bloodshed and infighting for territorial gains. It’s not regional hegemony at stake only but a civilisational loss that every state raising voice against the Trump administration’s actions is trying to prevent.

The long-term costs of withdrawal from international bodies are cumulative and may be invisible in the short term to the Trump administration. By withdrawing, the US does not shield itself from these developments; it merely loses the ability to shape them at an early stage. Historically, American influence has rested not only on material power but also on its capacity to convene allies, bridge divides between developed and developing states, and steer multilateral outcomes. Re-entry, when it occurs, rarely restores previous influence automatically; it often requires concessions and a rebuilding of credibility. Speaking to the BBC last week, I had stated that the norm of non-intervention is actually being solidified even more despite its breach by the Trump administration at present. Notice how the entire world, all regions, all states representing diverse civilisations have stood up in protest. The norm against war, against non-intervention is not merely a law laid down in 1945; it represents a multi-civilisational maturity achieved after thousands of years of bloodshed and infighting for territorial gains. It’s not regional hegemony at stake only but a civilisational loss that every state raising voice against the Trump administration’s actions is trying to prevent.

      "summary_orig": "Military-to-military ties between Pakistan and the United States appear to be strengthening, marked by renewed joint training, major defence sales and unusually warm rhetoric from President Donald Trump towards Pakistan’s military leadership. According to a statement issued by the US Central Command (Centcom), American and Pakistani troops this week concluded joint training at Pakistan’s National Counter-Terrorism Center in Pabbi. “This week, US and Pakistan Army Soldiers completed training at Pakistan’s National Counter-Terrorism Center during Exercise Inspired Gambit, which focused on combined infantry skills and tactics, and counterterrorism operations. Training exercises like this between the US and Pakistan strengthen our long-standing defense ties,” the statement said. The exercise comes amid broader signs of re-engagement between the two defence establishments. In December, the United States approved the sale of advanced technology and upgrade packages for Pakistan’s F-16 fighter aircraft, a deal valued at approximately $686 million. The approval followed regional tensions after Pakistan and India fought a brief but intense five-day conflict in May 2025. Pakistan is believed to operate 70 to 80 F-16s, including upgraded Block-15 aircraft, former Jordanian jets, and newer Block-52+ models. US officials have long described the F-16 programme as a cornerstone of bilateral military cooperation. Political signaling from Washington has also drawn attention. President Trump has repeatedly praised Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, referring to him publicly as his “ favourite field marshal ”. In a year-end news briefing on December 31, Trump said that Pakistani leaders had credited him with preventing a wider catastrophe following the India-Pakistan conflict. “The head of Pakistan and a highly respected general — he is a field marshal — and also the prime minister of Pakistan said that President Trump saved 10 million lives, maybe more,” Trump said. During the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit on the Middle East in October 2025. Trump also acknowledged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who was standing behind him, before again referring to Munir. These remarks marked at least the tenth instance since June that Trump, who returned to the White House in January for a second term, publicly praised Pakistan’s army chief. In June 2025, Trump hosted Field Marshal Munir at the White House for a lunch meeting — the first time a sitting US president formally received the head of Pakistan’s army. The meeting took place amid worsening disagreement with India over Trump’s repeated claim that he personally halted the May conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Analysts say Washington’s renewed focus on the Middle East, particularly Gaza and Iran, combined with the performance of Pakistan’s air force during the May conflict with India, encouraged the United States to improve its ties with Pakistan’s defence establishment. Pakistan has also signalled its willingness to participate in a US-led international stabilisation force for Gaza, a controversial proposal advanced by Trump, further underlining Islamabad’s interest in closer security cooperation. Pakistan was once a key US ally and was designated a major non-NATO ally following the September 11, 2001, attacks. Relations frayed in subsequent years, as US officials accused Islamabad of duplicity during the US-led war on terror. But early in his second term, Trump struck a markedly different tone. Addressing a joint session of Congress in March, he publicly thanked Pakistan for arresting one of the alleged perpetrators of the Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport in August 2021, which killed 13 US service members. Recent military exercises, arms sales and high-level engagement suggest that defence ties between Washington and Islamabad are entering a new, more pragmatic phase.",

      "summary_orig": "• SCO, Pakistan condemn ‘external interference’, sanctions; Munich Security Conference rescinds Iran invitation • US bolsters regional presence • Smuggled Starlink devices used to bypass Tehran’s internet blackout MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday moved to mediate the escalating crisis involving Iran on Friday, holding separate telephone calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in an effort to “quickly de-escalate tensions”. The Kremlin stated that Putin during both phone calls expressed Moscow’s willingness to “continue its mediation efforts and to promote constructive dialogue with the participation of all interested states”. Pezeshkian briefed Putin on Tehran’s efforts to stabilise the situation, blaming the US and Israel for fomenting unrest. The two men confirmed their commitment to a 20-year strategic partnership agreement signed last year, which includes joint economic projects, it added. Meanwhile, fears of an immediate US attack have retreated slightly since President Donald Trump noted killings were easing, however, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt noted the president was keeping “all of his options on the table”. The US has redirected an aircraft carrier and its strike group toward Iran. The USS Abraham Lincoln is carrying fighter jets, guided missile destroyers and at least one attack submarine. The Israeli spy chief was also expected to meet White House envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday. On the ground in Iran, a deadly state crackdown appears to have broadly quelled protests for now. While state media reported more arrests on Friday, residents in Tehran noted the capital had been quiet since Sunday. Munich conference scraps invite Amid the crackdown, the Munich Security Conference withdrew its invitation to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi for its upcoming forum. “In light of current events, the Munich Security Conference will not be maintaining these invitations,” organisers said in a statement. Diplomatic reactions varied globally. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) condemned external interference and blamed Western economic pressure for the instability. On the other hand, Pakistan urged the UN Security Council to uphold international law regarding non-interference. Ambassador Asim Ahmad, the permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, warned that unilateral actions would only deepen the crisis. “We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure,” Ahmad said, calling Iran a “brotherly country” and urging all parties to resolve differences through peaceful means. Starlink behind the scenes Elon Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink satellite service has emerged as a primary tool for Iranian dissidents to bypass state-imposed internet blackouts following a violent crackdown on protests, according to activists and researchers. The network, which uses thousands of low-orbit satellites to beam internet to terminals the size of a pizza box, has become a crucial lifeline for demonstrators. Digital rights groups estimate 50,000 terminals have been smuggled into Iran, defying a law that bans the unlicensed technology. As Iran attributes the country’s tensions to foreign involvement, the extensive scale of this Starlink network implies that it may be receiving sophisticated external support. Given the difficulty of transporting large quantities of restricted hardware across Iran’s tightly controlled borders, the logistics mirror the capabilities of foreign intelligence services; however, no official link has been con­fi­rmed.

While state media reported more arrests on Friday, residents in Tehran noted the capital had been quiet since Sunday. Munich conference scraps invite Amid the crackdown, the Munich Security Conference withdrew its invitation to Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi for its upcoming forum. “In light of current events, the Munich Security Conference will not be maintaining these invitations,” organisers said in a statement. Diplomatic reactions varied globally. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) condemned external interference and blamed Western economic pressure for the instability. On the other hand, Pakistan urged the UN Security Council to uphold international law regarding non-interference. Ambassador Asim Ahmad, the permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, warned that unilateral actions would only deepen the crisis. “We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure,” Ahmad said, calling Iran a “brotherly country” and urging all parties to resolve differences through peaceful means. Starlink behind the scenes Elon Musk-owned SpaceX’s Starlink satellite service has emerged as a primary tool for Iranian dissidents to bypass state-imposed internet blackouts following a violent crackdown on protests, according to activists and researchers. The network, which uses thousands of low-orbit satellites to beam internet to terminals the size of a pizza box, has become a crucial lifeline for demonstrators. Digital rights groups estimate 50,000 terminals have been smuggled into Iran, defying a law that bans the unlicensed technology. As Iran attributes the country’s tensions to foreign involvement, the extensive scale of this Starlink network implies that it may be receiving sophisticated external support. Given the difficulty of transporting large quantities of restricted hardware across Iran’s tightly controlled borders, the logistics mirror the capabilities of foreign intelligence services; however, no official link has been con­fi­rmed.

      "summary_orig": "• PTI senators slam ban on meetings with Imran • Law minister says jail superintendent responsible for meetings, denies solitary confinement claim ISLAMABAD: Senators on Fri­day called for keeping tabs on the use of social media platforms by children under 18, with the chair proposing a special committee to develop safeguards in consultation with relevant ministries. The issue was raised through a calling-attention notice moved by Senators Falak Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Aimal Wali Khan, Saadia Abbasi and Dilawar Khan. Presiding over the sitting, Senator Sherry Rehman said some checks were needed and suggested forming a special committee comprising representatives of the ministries of information technology, interior, education and law, along with parliamentary parties and provincial governments. She said the final decision would rest with Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani. Speaking on the notice, Senator Naz said most platforms were designed for adults and warned that children’s exposure to inappropriate content could make them vulnerable to online harassment, exploitation and dangerous trends. She referred to last year’s killing of Sana Yousaf , a 17-year-old TikToker, and said such incidents underscored the risks of unmonitored social media use for minors. She called for a comprehensive legal framework and urged the government to introduce mandatory age verification, parental supervision and other protective measures. She also demanded restrictions on the use of TikTok, Instagram, VPNs and similar tools by children below 18. “The matter is serious in nature and immediate and serious steps should be taken to prevent children from further dangers of social media,” she said, seeking a briefing from the IT ministry on existing laws and a future action plan. Senator Fawzia Arshad said social media had become a serious concern for parents and required a collective response. She stressed the need for counselling in educational institutions to guide children and discourage harmful online behaviour. “The age between 16 and 18 is very vulnerable and fragile,” she said, adding that the problem could worsen without proper guidance. She also said civics and moral development were insufficiently covered in the curriculum. Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry described the matter as a national issue and said it should be referred to the relevant standing committee. He said the issue was not limited to the IT ministry and involved the ministries of education and interior as well. He called for coordination among stakeholders to propose curriculum changes and appropriate restrictions for underage users in line with international practices. “This is not a challenge for Pakistan but an international issue,” he said. The minister said law enforcement and cybercrime institutions, including the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), should be engaged in efforts to address the issue. “There is a need for a national debate to find a solution to save the underage children from the dangers (of social media),” he said. Senator Sherry Rehman noted that Australia had introduced legislation to restrict social media use for children under 16, but said she was not in favour of blanket bans. Describing social media as an educational tool as well, she said the Senate should consider all aspects and proceed “judiciously”. PTI protest Separately, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers criticised what they described as a continued ban on meetings with the party’s founder Imran Khan, alleging violations of court orders. Speaking on a point of order, PTI parliamentary leader Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had been kept in solitary confinement for the past two months, calling it the “worst form of torture” prohibited under the Constitution, domestic laws and international human rights conventions. He alleged that the jail authorities were effectively punishing the couple without trial, arguing that prolonged detention under harsh prison conditions amounted to punishment in itself. The cases against them were being used as political tools, he said. Senator Zafar rejected the government’s assertion that meetings were not allowed because visitors made political statements, saying this could not justify the denial of fundamental rights. “Legal rights cannot be suspended on political grounds,” he said. He told the House that, despite being legal counsel for Mr Khan, he was not being allowed to meet his client, describing this as a violation of the sanctity of the lawyer-client relationship and a denial of the right to legal defence. PTI Senator Falak Naz also said Mr Khan had been kept in solitary confinement and that no one had been allowed to meet him for the past two months. Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the jail superintendent had the authority to schedule meetings based on conduct. He pointed out that Adiala Jail fell under the jurisdiction of the Punjab government and that the federal government had no authority to issue directions in this regard. The minister rejected the opposition’s claim that Mr Khan was being kept in solitary confinement. Separately, the House also discussed reports of tree cutting in Chitral, with Senator Naz alleging that the timber mafia continued illegal felling. Senator Sherry Rehman said Chitral had “turned brown from green” over the past two decades, adding that the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change would take up the issue in its next meeting. Senator Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said forestry was a provincial subject but noted that the federal government could write to the provincial authorities. Published in Dawn, January 17th, 2026",

      "title_orig": "Trump threatens tariffs on countries that don’t back Greenland takeover plan",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said Friday he may impose trade tariffs on countries that don’t support his plans to take over Greenland, part of the territory of Denmark. “I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,” Trump said at a health roundtable at the White House. “I may do that,” added Trump. Trump compared the possible Greenland tariffs to those that he threatened on France and Germany last year over the price of pharmaceutical products. The threat is the latest pressure tactic by Republican Trump as he steps up his bid to acquire the autonomous Arctic island , a goal that he has threatened to achieve by military means if necessary. Trump claims the United States needs mineral-rich Greenland and has accused Greenland of not doing enough to ensure its security against rivals Russia and China. European nations have in recent days shown their support for North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation (Nato) ally Denmark and Greenland over Trump’s escalating threats, including by sending troops to the strategic territory. The foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland visited the White House on Wednesday for talks to defuse the issue , but said afterwards that they remained in “fundamental disagreement” with Trump. But the United States, Denmark and Greenland had agreed to set up a working group to continue talks every two to three weeks on the issue, the White House said on Thursday. US congress members visit Denmark to support Greenland A bipartisan US Congress delegation began a visit to Copenhagen on Friday to voice support for Denmark and Greenland after Trump threatened to take over the Arctic island, an autonomous Danish territory. The two-day visit comes alongside a European show of support in the form of a military reconnaissance mission to Greenland. The 11 congressmen and women were to hold talks with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen. The group arrived at the Danish employers’ association Dansk Industri around midday for discussions with business leaders. They were due later to meet members of the Danish parliament, over which the Greenlandic flag was raised on Friday in a show of unity. “We are showing bipartisan solidarity with the people of this country and with Greenland. They’ve been our friends and allies for decades,” Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told reporters. “We want them to know we appreciate that very much. And the statements being made by the president do not reflect what the American people feel,” he added of Trump. An AFP reporter in Copenhagen saw a large black van leave Frederiksen’s office shortly before noon on Friday, but her office declined to confirm whether the meeting had taken place. The delegation’s visit follows a meeting in Washington on Wednesday at which Danish representatives said Copenhagen and Washington were in “fundamental disagreement” over the future of Greenland. In Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, residents welcomed the show of support. “(US) Congress would never approve of a military action in Greenland. It’s just one idiot speaking,” a 39-year-old union representative told AFP . “If he does it, he’ll get impeached or kicked out. If people in Congress want to save their own democracy, they have to step up,” said the union rep, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump claims the United States needs mineral-rich Greenland and has criticised Denmark for, he says, not doing enough to ensure its security. The US president has pursued that argument, despite strategically located Greenland — as part of Denmark — being covered by NATO’s security umbrella. Military personnel were more visible in Nuuk on Friday, according to an AFP journalist, days after Denmark said it was beefing up its defence on the island. “I don’t think troops in Europe impact the president’s decision-making process, nor does it impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing. Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen retorted that a US acquisition of Greenland was “out of the question”. The European troop deployment in Greenland for a military exercise is aimed at “sending a signal” to “everyone”, including the United States, that European countries are determined to “defend (their) sovereignty”, French armed forces minister Alice Rufo said. Britain, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have announced the deployment of small numbers of military personnel to prepare for future exercises in the Arctic. “A first team of French service members is already on site and will be reinforced in the coming days with land, air and maritime assets,” French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday. Large demonstrations are planned across Denmark and Greenland on Saturday to protest against Trump’s territorial ambitions. Thousands of people have taken to social networks to say they intend to take part in the protests organised by Greenlandic associations in Nuuk and Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg and Odense. In addition to Durbin, the US delegation included Democratic senators Chris Coons, Jeanne Shaheen and Peter Welch, as well as Republicans Lisa Murkowski and Thom Tillis. Democrats from the House of Representatives in the delegation are Madeleine Dean, Steny Hoyer, Sara Jacobs, Sarah McBride and Gregory Meeks.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Friday said PTI leaders were seeking dialogue with the government, but jailed party founder Imran Khan opposed the move even as the party remained firm on its call for protests on February 8. In December, the PTI had denied dialogue with the government until “ensuring a level-playing field” was provided to the party through its ongoing “street movement” — an agitation campaign against the government. Speaking during Geo News ’s programme Naya Pakistan with Shahzad Iqbal , Sanaullah said that the government had been in contact with PTI leaders for dialogue, stating that “several of them are in favour of negotiations with the government.” “Whenever politicians come to the table for talks, problems get solved, and a way gets paved,” he said. Sanaullah reiterated that many PTI leaders were in favour of dialogue, but  “whenever they meet us, they say that the PTI founder is not in favour of any sort of dialogue with the government,” he added. He further said that PTI’s arrangement, speeches, and mobilisation efforts for the upcoming protest on Feb 8 indicated that they were “standing firm on their decision and wouldn’t step back as per the government’s assessment”. “However,” he added, “the PTI leaders think that if they get to meet Imran, they could convince him to postpone the protest and initiate dialogue with the government.” When asked about the meeting of PTI leaders with Imran, Sanaullah said: “They have gone too far now; any initiation of dialogues or meeting with Imran Khan can be possible only after Feb 8.” “They are preparing for the protest at full throttle, so meeting them before that would not be possible,” he said. The former interior minister also implied that the government would deal with the protests “administratively”, and PTI would emerge “unsuccessful”. He advised the PTI to “play its role” in the parliamentary processes and return to the committee proceedings from which they had abstained. Earlier, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar had said that no dialogue could be held with the government until it allowed meetings with Imran. It further maintained that it would not engage in negotiations with the government, as the stance it followed was in line with the directions passed on by Imran. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have killed 12 terrorists and effectively thwarted their attempt to create a hostage situation in Balochistan’s Kharan district during multiple operations, the military’s media wing said in a statement. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR),  on January 15, “approximately fifteen to twenty Indian-sponsored terrorists of Fitna Al Hindustan carried out multiple terrorist activities in Kharan City, District Kharan.” The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. It said that during the operations, “terrorists attacked [the] City Police Station, National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited.” They also looted Rs3.4 million from the banks. “Security forces effectively responded and engaged the terrorists, prompting them to retreat. During the ensuing clearance operation, twelve terrorists were sent to hell in three different engagements,” the ISPR said. “Terrorists’ design to create a hostage situation at the police station was also effectively thwarted.” It added that a sanitisation operation is underway in the surrounding areas of Kharan to eliminate any other terrorists. “A relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision “Azm-e-Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” it said. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. On January 6, ISPR Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared during a press conference that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025. Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas. On January 13, the ISPR said four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district.",

      "summary_orig": "Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori on Friday criticised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi for “inciting acts of vandalism and road blockades ” during his recent visit to Karachi, which he said led to “losses worth billions of rupees”. Afridi visited Karachi and other cities of Sindh last week as part of the PTI’s renewed anti-government agitation campaign called the “ street movement ”. The chief minister decried the treatment meted out to him by the Sindh government during his visit, alleging that the police tried to stop his motorcade and PTI supporters from staging a peaceful protest at Mazar-i-Quaid. The Sindh government denied the allegations, stating that the Jinnah Ground was under the control of the Centre, so it was not entitled to issue a no-objection certificate to the party. Speaking to reporters in Karachi, Governor Tessori said that the PTI had “turned the whole country upside down, but the agitation was confined to social media and had no value on the ground.” Referring to KP CM’s Karachi visit, Tessori said, “You must come here, we will welcome you again, but come with positive work to do”. He suggested that CM Afridi should meet with traders and industrialists and ask them to invest in his province instead of mobilising people to take to the streets. “If you talk about establishing new industries, expanding inter-provincial trade, the future of people, giving health and educational opportunities, people will definitely welcome you,” Tessori said. “However, incendiary political narrative, incitement to vandalism, blockades, causing trouble to people — these things will not be welcomed.” The governor added that putting this city to a halt caused losses worth billions of rupees, because “Karachi is the financial and economic hub of Pakistan,” he stated. “For God’s sake, don’t do this,” Tessori pleaded. He reminded the chief minister that Pakistan was now at the centre of the “global lens”, making progress through diplomatic efforts. “Why don’t you understand that we are a triumphant nation and the time has come to pull ourselves out of the problems we have been facing for the last 70 years,” he said. He said that repeating the incidents of May 9 — when PTI supporters staged violent nationwide protests, vandalising state-owned institutions and military installations following Imran Khan’s arrest — at this stage would be “equivalent to a foreign conspiracy and a foreign agenda.” “We have to provide educational opportunities because I believe that ignorance is the biggest reason for terrorism,” the governor said. Speaking in favour of the armed forces and calling the chief minister out for criticising them, Tessori said that politicians might disappoint the nation, but the army would never do that. “Didn’t we see what happened on May 10 ?” he questioned. Tessori added that the world was praising the Pakistani Army and acknowledging the country’s defence capabilities, but the PTI was doing the opposite. “Rather than lauding your army, you started abusing it.” “Is there any country or leader in the world who talks against his own army?” He was referring to Imran’s recent social media comments against the leadership of the armed forces on the X platform, in response to which the Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations had called him a “ national security threat ”. “There are countries where presidents can be picked up, and their armies can’t do anything”, Tessori said, “but India couldn’t even seize an inch of land of Pakistan because of our army.” “Politicians may disappoint you, but not your army.” He accepted that the country was facing economic difficulties, though the world was handing orders to Pakistan’s defence industries to manufacture aircraft. “Our economy will improve by this,” he stated. Further criticising the PTI, Governor Tessori said that Karachi city gave the PTI a president, Arif Alvi, who was a citizen of this city. “Tell me how many projects he gave to Karachi,” he asked. “Karachi gave the MNA seat to Imran Khan, but he hadn’t even spent a night in this city.” “Tell us what your performance was?” he asked. “How many industries had he [Imran] inaugurated in Karachi?” “What have you done for Pashtuns, Balochs, Sindhis, Urdu-speaking, and other communities in this city?” he questioned. “But you made speeches to incite violence like May 9.” “Name a single project,” he challenged. “Even if some time is given to you now, you still can’t do anything.” Governor Tessori added that PTI could only incite innocent people on social media and sold them a narrative that had neither rendered them any favour nor could it now. “We have to choose whether we want to strengthen our country economically and educationally, or go after the people who would just make you chant slogans and hold flags,” he stated.",

      "summary_orig": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that his country’s relations with Pakistan are “genuinely mutually beneficial” and that Moscow maintains close relations with Islamabad. “We maintain close cooperation with Pakistan, a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the largest regional organisation in terms of economic, technological, and human potential. Russia-Pakistan relations are genuinely mutually beneficial,” the Embassy of Russia in Pakistan quoted President Putin as saying on X. The statement came as Pakistan’s Ambassador to Russia, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, formally presented his credentials to President Putin during a ceremony held on Thursday at Moscow’s Grand Kremlin Palace, according to the Pakistani Embassy in Russia . In recent years, Pakistan and Russia have significantly strengthened their economic ties, driven by mutual necessity. Following Western sanctions related to the Ukraine conflict, Moscow turned toward new energy outlets, while Islamabad simultaneously sought more affordable fuel sources to reduce national import expenses. This diplomatic shift culminated in 2023, when Pakistan officially integrated Russian crude oil into its energy portfolio. Last month , Finance Mini­ster Muhammad Aur­a­ngzeb said Islamabad and Moscow were in talks regarding a new potential oil-sector agreement. Pakistan, which imports 70 per cent of its crude oil, is mainly dependent on Russian crude exports. Despite this, Pakis­tan has enjoyed lower tariffs from Washington and close relations with its current administration, even as India recently saw a punitive 25pc tariff impo­sed on its goods. In November last year — as Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev visited Islamabad to participate in the 10th Russia-Pakistan Intergovernmental Commission — the two countries reaffirmed their resolve to deepen bilateral cooperation in diversified trade, energy, business-to-business engagements and social sectors like health and education.",
