      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Thursday condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the Gaza Sumud flotilla, demanding the immediate release of the detained activists, including former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, and urging accountability for Israel’s “repeated violations of international law”. On Wednesday, the aid-carrying flotilla said Israeli forces were intercepting its latest bid to reach Gaza, and that 13 of its vessels had been intercepted so far by Israel, while 30 were still en route to reach the coast of Gaza. The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. In a post on X during the early hours of Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said, “Pakistan strongly condemns the dastardly attack by Israeli forces on the 40 vessel Samud Gaza flotilla, carrying over 450 humanitarian workers from 44 countries. We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release.“ “Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he said, adding that peace must be given a chance and humanitarian aid must reach those in need. “This barbarity must end. Peace must be given a chance, and humanitarian aid must reach those in need,” the premier said. Separately, the Foreign Office (FO) also strongly condemned the attack, stating: “The unlawful detention of international activists onboard the flotilla constitutes yet another flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law by Israel, and endangers the lives of innocent civilians.” Calling it a deliberate attempt to obstruct humanitarian relief in the Palestinian enclave, the FO said: “This reprehensible act is part of Israel’s ongoing pattern of aggression and its illegal blockade of Gaza, which has caused immense human suffering and deprivation for over two million Palestinians.” It demanded the “immediate release of all humanitarian workers and activists on board the flotilla”, urging Israel to respect international law. The FO also called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its “repeated violations of international law”. “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support and solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” it added. Flagrant violation of international law: FM Dar Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called Israel’s attack on the Global Sumud Flotilla “a flagrant violation of international law”, demanding the release of the arrested activists. “Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detention of international activists in flagrant violation of international law. We demand an immediate ceasefire, lifting of the blockade, swift release of activists and unhindered aid to Gaza,“ he wrote on X. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also condemned the attack, praying for the “safe return of all those aboard the [Sumud] Gaza Flotilla.” “We strongly condemn the Israeli attack on these peaceful people carrying humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. Israeli barbarity must end,” the minister said in a post on X. Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmed on board flotilla arrested Ex-senator and Jamat-i-Islami leader Mushtaq Ahmad, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, was arrested by Israel after Israeli forces boarded the vessel, according to advocacy group Pak-Palestine Forum. In a post on X, the group said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.” The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate, Syed Uzair Nizami, was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.” Former senator Faisal Javed Khan took to X to pray for Khan’s safety, saying “let us all condemn the aggression by Israel that has been unleashed upon these peaceful humanitarians, who sought only to deliver aid and amplify the cry for justice.” Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir took to X to laud the “courage” of the activists on board the flotilla. “They are carrying nothing but courage in their hearts and aid in their ships,” he said, noting that the Israel Defense Force (IDF) has become “emboldened by the failure and cowardice of the global community.” “Our only hope is ordinary citizens of the world,” he added. The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military. It said on X that it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”. Israel has blocked similar attempts previously as well. In June, aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) after violent protests left three policemen dead a day earlier, urging citizens to remain peaceful and instructing law enforcement agencies to show restraint. A three-day strike paralysed AJK under a communications blackout after talks between the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) , the AJK government, and federal ministers collapsed over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats, sparking rival protests and violence. On Wednesday, AJK PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq and Federal Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry invited the JAAC for fresh dialogue. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior has also convened an important meeting in Islamabad on Thursday (today) to consider steps to defuse the situation. “The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful,” the Prime Minister’s Office posted on X. “He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.” PM Shehbaz, according to the statement, has also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters. “The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers. Expressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter. “The prime minister has directed immediate assistance to the families affected by the demonstrations,” read the statement. “At the government level, to find a peaceful resolution to the issue, the prime minister has decided to expand the negotiation committee.” The committee includes Senator Rana Sanaullah, Federal Ministers Sardar Yusuf, Ahsan Iqbal, former President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Masood Khan, and Qamar Zaman Kaira. Furthermore, PM Shehbaz directed that the negotiation committee immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues. “The prime minister has appealed to the members and leadership of the JAAC to cooperate with the government’s negotiation committee. “The committee will send its recommendations and proposed solutions to the Prime Minister’s Office without delay so that steps can be taken for the immediate resolution of the issues.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: While security forces put militants on the back foot in September, the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024. If this trend continues, the current year may turn out to be one of the deadliest in decades. This is the crux of two reports, issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), about militant violence in the country over the past month. According to PICSS, militant violence dropped significantly in Sept 2025, with both the number of attacks and militant capacity showing sharp declines compared to the record levels seen in Aug. The PICSS Militancy Database recorded 69 militant attacks in Sept — a 52 per cent reduction from August’s 143. These attacks resulted in 135 deaths and 173 injuries, whilst militants abducted at least 27 people. The fatalities included 61 security personnel, 20 militants, and 54 civilians. Amongst the injured were 74 security personnel and 99 civilians. Compared with August, the number of martyred security personnel declined by 16pc, militant fatalities by 66pc, and civilian deaths by 17pc, reflecting a notable decrease in lethality. If current trends continue, think tanks warn 2025 may be the ‘deadliest year’ in decade in terms of militant violence KP remained the most affected province, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. In mainland KP, 25 attacks caused 33 deaths — 20 security personnel, nine militants, and four civilians — whilst 42 people were injured. Militants kidnapped nine individuals, while security forces carried out 22 operations, killing 88 militants, though five personnel lost their lives and five militants were arrested. In the tribal districts (erstwhile Fata), 20 militant attacks claimed 21 lives — six security personnel, three militants, and 12 civilians — and injured seven. Militants also abducted four people, while security forces conducted 18 operations in these districts, killing 83 militants. However, 24 civilians also lost their lives during these actions. In Balochistan, 21 attacks claimed 79 lives — 33 security personnel, eight militants, and 38 civilians — and injured 122 others, including 37 security personnel and 85 civilians. Militants abducted 14 people. Security forces responded with seven major operations, killing 26 militants and arresting 10. Sindh experienced three attacks that killed two security personnel and injured two civilians. According to CRSS’s report, Pakistan witnessed an over 46pc surge in overall violence in its security landscape for the third quarter of 2025, with at least 901 fatalities and 599 injuries — amongst civilians, security personnel, and outlaws — resulting from 329 incidents of violence. “In just three quarters, 2025 has proven nearly as deadly as all of 2024, with 2,414 fatalities recorded compared to the entire tally of 2024 (2,546). With an entire quarter still remaining, this indicates that 2025 is on course to surpass last year’s toll. If the current trend continues, 2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade,” the report stated. Published in Dawn, October 2nd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "IN September 2023, 22-year-old Akram (not his real name) was picked up from his home in Karachi by men in plain clothes. He was blindfolded and taken to a building where he was interrogated and tortured for several days. The interrogators demanded that he confess to crimes and links with criminal gangs. Akram was then taken to a police station. There, a police officer told him to pay up or else a criminal case would be registered against him. Neither Akram nor his family could afford the bribe. The officer lodged an FIR implicating him for murder and terrorism. Soon after, Akram was charged with murder under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) and convicted for life by an anti-terrorism court. During the trial, the prosecution did not allege, let alone present, any evidence to show links between Akram and terrorist activity. On appeal, the Sindh High Court set aside Akram’s conviction on the basis that the prosecution’s evidence against him was insufficient. The high court also noted that the prosecution failed to establish any motive for terrorism. Akram’s story is similar to that of many others convicted under the ATA. State actors use both illegal means — enforced disappearance — and the legal process under the ATA to imprison mostly poor young men who have no proven connection to any terrorist activity. The recent anti-terror amendment covers an impermissibly broad and vague range of activities. The ATA was enacted in 1997 because legislators at the time believed that regular criminal procedures could not cope with the problem of terrorism. They enacted a special law with weaker due process guarantees and harsher penalties compared to regular proceedings under the Penal and Criminal Procedure Codes. For example, the ATA permits remand to an investigating authority for interrogation for up to 30 days at a time, in contrast to the Criminal Procedure Code , which permits remand for a maximum of 15 days. The ATA also permits the federal government to issue lists of “proscribed persons” suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. These “proscribed persons” are subjected to draconian surveillance and restrictions on their movement. Vague and over-broad provisions in the ATA itself, as well as its misuse, have rendered the law an ineffective tool against terrorism. Law enforcement and courts have misinterpreted the ATA since it was passed to cover crimes that should not be deemed terrorism. In 2020, a seven-member bench of the Supreme Court observed that courts have consistently interpreted as terrorism crimes driven by personal motives rather than political or ideological goals. The Supreme Court clarified that a crime, however heinous, should not be deemed terrorism only because its effect is to create fear and insecurity in society at large. The primary motivation behind that act must be to create terror in wider society. The Supreme Court declared that the definition of terrorism contained in the ATA 1997 is “too wide” and this “puts an extra and unnecessary burden” on special anti-terrorism courts. It recommended that parliament replace the existing definition with a “more succinct definition bringing it in line with the international perspectives of that offence”. Rather than address these problems with the law and its implementation, our legislators continue to expand the scope of the ATA and the powers that it confers on law enforcement. A recent amendment to the ATA allows the authorities to preventively detain a person for three months without charge if they believe the per­son is “concerned” with any offence under the Act related to the “security or defence of Pak­istan” or “public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta, or the maintenance of supply or services …” Preventive detention, used against persons anticipated to commit subversive activity must be used very sparingly and be circumscribed by strong, rigorously enforced procedural protections. Renowned civil liberties lawyer and scholar David Cole maintains that preventive detention should only be used against those engaged in armed conflict against the state. Even terrorist acts outside armed conflict should be treated as crimes and subject to all due process requirements of criminal prosecution. Pakistan’s Constitution permits preventive detention in certain circumstances. The preventive detention provisions in Article 10 of Pakistan’s Constitution are similar to that of India’s constitution. When members of India’s constituent assembly objected to the draft provision allowing preventive detention, the justification provided by the chief framer of India’s constitution, B.R. Ambedkar, was telling: “We do not know how the situation in this country will develop what would be the circumstances which would face the country …. whether the people and parties in this country would behave in a constitutional manner in the matter of getting hold of power, or whether they would resort to unconstitutional methods for carrying out their purposes.” The rationale behind the permitting of preventive detention, therefore, was to address the risk of constitutional subversion in a newly independent country. The recent ATA amendment covers an impermissibly broad and vague range of activities. It permits preventive detention for persons “concerned with” criminal activities (target killings, kidnappings and extortion) that would not fall in the category of terrorism let alone the even narrower set of acts amounting to subversion of the constitutional order or armed conflict. While the amendment is almost guaranteed to enable due process violations, it will not deter terrorism. A similar amendment was made to the law in 2014, which lapsed in 2016. Parliament has now reintroduced preventive detention without any evidence that the earlier provision helped curb terrorism. An even more recent amendment to the ATA by the Balochistan Assembly that effectively permits secret trials for some suspects is further evidence that the state wants to undermine due process through anti-terror laws. The stories of Akram and many others imprisoned under ATA illustrate that rather than preserve the rule of law, anti-terror laws in Pakistan are used as an extension of the state’s extrajudicial acts to further state repression.

The ATA also permits the federal government to issue lists of “proscribed persons” suspected of involvement in terrorist activities. These “proscribed persons” are subjected to draconian surveillance and restrictions on their movement. Vague and over-broad provisions in the ATA itself, as well as its misuse, have rendered the law an ineffective tool against terrorism. Law enforcement and courts have misinterpreted the ATA since it was passed to cover crimes that should not be deemed terrorism. In 2020, a seven-member bench of the Supreme Court observed that courts have consistently interpreted as terrorism crimes driven by personal motives rather than political or ideological goals. The Supreme Court clarified that a crime, however heinous, should not be deemed terrorism only because its effect is to create fear and insecurity in society at large. The primary motivation behind that act must be to create terror in wider society. The Supreme Court declared that the definition of terrorism contained in the ATA 1997 is “too wide” and this “puts an extra and unnecessary burden” on special anti-terrorism courts. It recommended that parliament replace the existing definition with a “more succinct definition bringing it in line with the international perspectives of that offence”. Rather than address these problems with the law and its implementation, our legislators continue to expand the scope of the ATA and the powers that it confers on law enforcement. A recent amendment to the ATA allows the authorities to preventively detain a person for three months without charge if they believe the per­son is “concerned” with any offence under the Act related to the “security or defence of Pak­istan” or “public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta, or the maintenance of supply or services …” Preventive detention, used against persons anticipated to commit subversive activity must be used very sparingly and be circumscribed by strong, rigorously enforced procedural protections. Renowned civil liberties lawyer and scholar David Cole maintains that preventive detention should only be used against those engaged in armed conflict against the state. Even terrorist acts outside armed conflict should be treated as crimes and subject to all due process requirements of criminal prosecution. Pakistan’s Constitution permits preventive detention in certain circumstances. The preventive detention provisions in Article 10 of Pakistan’s Constitution are similar to that of India’s constitution. When members of India’s constituent assembly objected to the draft provision allowing preventive detention, the justification provided by the chief framer of India’s constitution, B.R. Ambedkar, was telling: “We do not know how the situation in this country will develop what would be the circumstances which would face the country …. whether the people and parties in this country would behave in a constitutional manner in the matter of getting hold of power, or whether they would resort to unconstitutional methods for carrying out their purposes.” The rationale behind the permitting of preventive detention, therefore, was to address the risk of constitutional subversion in a newly independent country. The recent ATA amendment covers an impermissibly broad and vague range of activities. It permits preventive detention for persons “concerned with” criminal activities (target killings, kidnappings and extortion) that would not fall in the category of terrorism let alone the even narrower set of acts amounting to subversion of the constitutional order or armed conflict. While the amendment is almost guaranteed to enable due process violations, it will not deter terrorism. A similar amendment was made to the law in 2014, which lapsed in 2016. Parliament has now reintroduced preventive detention without any evidence that the earlier provision helped curb terrorism. An even more recent amendment to the ATA by the Balochistan Assembly that effectively permits secret trials for some suspects is further evidence that the state wants to undermine due process through anti-terror laws. The stories of Akram and many others imprisoned under ATA illustrate that rather than preserve the rule of law, anti-terror laws in Pakistan are used as an extension of the state’s extrajudicial acts to further state repression.

      "summary_orig": "JERUSALEM: A flotilla carrying aid to Gaza said Israeli forces were on Wednesday intercepting its latest bid to break an Israeli blockade of the war-battered Palestinian territory. The Global Sumud Flotilla — around 45 vessels carrying activists and politicians including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg — left Spain last month aiming to break Israel’s blockade of the Palestinian territory, where the UN says famine has set in. “The warships are moving in to intercept the flotilla — only 81 nautical miles remain to Gaza,” said the Maghreb contingent of the Global Sumud Flotilla in a statement. French politician Marie Mesmeur and Franco-Palestinian MEP Rima Hassan also reported that their boats were being intercepted. Fleet’s naval escorts depart after Spain, Italy warn against entering ‘exclusion zone’ French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot posted on X that Israeli authorities were “currently boarding” the flotilla. Earlier, the Israeli navy warned the flotilla against entering waters under its blockade. “The Israeli Navy has reached out to the… flotilla and asked them to change course,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. “Israel has informed the flotilla that it is approaching an active combat zone and violating a lawful naval blockade.” Spain and Italy, which both sent naval escorts, had urged the ships to halt before entering Israel’s declared exclusion zone off Gaza. After a 10-day stop in Tunisia, where organisers reported two drone attacks, the flotilla resumed its journey on Sept 15. One of its main ships, the Alma, was “aggressively circled by an Israeli warship”, the group said, before another vessel, the Sirius, was subjected to “similar harassing manoeuvres”. ‘Stop now’ The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military. It said on X it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”. Israel blocked similar attempts in June and July. At around 1500 GMT on Wednesday, the flotilla said it was less than 170 kilometres from the Gaza Strip. “We sail on undeterred by Israeli threats and tactics of intimidation,” said the flotilla, which is also carrying Nelson Mandela’s grandson Mandla Mandela and Rima Hassan, a French-Palestinian European Parliament member. Spain’s digital transformation minister, Oscar Lopez, had urged the flotilla not to cross into Israel’s declared exclusion zone, extending 150 nautical miles off Gaza. “Our message to the flotilla has been clear: do not enter that zone,” he told Spanish public television, adding that Spain’s naval escort would not cross into the exclusion area. Italy, too, urged the activists to “stop now” after its frigate also halted at the 150-nautical-mile limit, broadcasting radio messages to the activists’ vessels asking them to abandon their mission. The activists said Spain and Italy’s decision was an attempt to “sabotage” their endeavours. South Africa called for “utmost restraint and caution against any unilateral actions that could escalate the situation or endanger human life”. It said the “safety, security, and physical integrity of all unarmed participants aboard the flotilla, including South African citizens, are of paramount importance”. In a joint statement, Italy and Greece appealed to Israeli authorities to “guarantee the safety and integrity of the flotilla’s participants”. Rome and Athens also urged the flotilla to “refrain from any initiative that could be exploited by those who still reject peace”. Published in Dawn, October 2nd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "ADIALA jail, officially known as Central Jail Rawalpindi, is a good 45-minute drive from Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa House, which serves as an outpost of the province in the capital. But for beleaguered KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who routinely stays here when he visits Islamabad, the meeting with his jailed party chairman after months of waiting and petitioning the Supreme Court, could not have come too soon. For six months, he weathered a storm. Not from a weak opposition — it has lost the will to throw a political challenge anyway — but from his own party, backed by an unbridled overseas social media brigade, clamouring for his head. He was called a ‘traitor’, ‘compromised’ and ‘establishment tout’. The noise reached such a fever pitch that some within his own cabinet began to wonder loudly about the prospects of replacing him. It was no secret that Aleema Khan never had any liking for the KP chief minister, but it was her media interactions outside Adiala jail that not only added to Ali Amin’s political woes, but also emboldened his critics Many in officialdom were left puzzled and wondering whether the mustachioed, long-locked strongman was indeed on his way out. “I never felt so weak,” Gandapur narrated to his jailed party leader. For months, he said, he was trolled for refusing the chairman’s orders not to present and pass the provincial budget, hold direct negotiations with the Afghan Taliban to put an end to militancy in the volatile province and, more crucially, refuse support for military operations and drone attacks in the tribal districts. The sardar from Kulachi, Dera Ismail Khan, has hardly had smooth sailing as KP’s eighteenth chief minister. For the first eight months, he was required to launch one protest march after another as the party attempted to pressure the powerful military establishment to eke out concessions for his leaders. Governance, at the time, was placed firmly on the back burner. But his political challenges became compounded after the D-Chowk fiasco last November, and were further exacerbated by subsequent events, beginning with the abortive attempt to pass the mines and minerals bill, which the party’s social media activists claimed was being sponsored by the military establishment. The chief minister had to relent, however, when his incarcerated leader conveyed his own opposition to the bill. Then came the budget. Orders from Adiala said the incarcerated leader should be consulted before it is presented to the house. Efforts were made to share the draft proposals and seek his nod, but things didn’t work out. Then came another order , ‘Don’t pass the budget’. Barrister Saif, self-acclaimed ‘Pindi boy’ and adviser to the chief minister, was dispatched to brief the leader that passing the budget was a constitutional requirement, and failure to do so would technically knock out the government. This time, Khan sahib relented. The unforgiving internet activists, however, trolled Gandapur again when the worsening security situation warranted a military response. The problem was further compounded by incidents involving drone attacks that resulted in civilian casualties. All this while, the only seemingly credible voice relaying the party leader’s views on anything political was Imran’s own sister, Aleema Khan. She, along with her two other siblings, was among the few who had permission to meet Imran. That she never had any liking for the KP chief minister was hardly a secret, but it was her media interactions outside Adiala that not only added to Ali Amin’s political woes, but also emboldened his critics. Gandapur claimed he was being pulled down by two ladies, “one who is trying to run the party and the other who is actually running the party”, and a military establishment driven by its own exigencies. The political storm was gathering, and the chief minister’s fate seemed to have been sealed when Imran’s frustration with him seemed to boil over, triggered by his “failure to stop” military operations in the province. But while he claimed he never cared what the overseas social media trolls said about him, what really mattered was what Aleema Khan was saying to the media after each tete-a-tete with Imran Khan. Being his sister, her word was treated as gospel. “It was clear to me that our messages to Khan sahib were not being delivered. He is unaware of what is happening outside… he was not only being misled, but also whatever he said was being filtered, censored, distorted and manipulated [before being relayed].” To add insult to injury, no rebuttal seemed to be forthcoming from the party chairman. With the wolves baying for blood, Gandapur’s last chance was a face-to-face with his imprisoned leader. According to the KP CM, during their meeting he laid bare what he termed “proofs” of Aleema’s manipulation to discredit him, and blatant meddling in party matters. According to Gandapur, Mr Khan listened patiently, assured him that he still believed in his (Gandapur’s) loyalty, and that he had never asked his sister to issue any rebuke on his behalf. “I would not have said what I said in my video message about Aleema Khan… [if not for]  her media interaction… I said what I said and I can prove what I said,” the CM told me. Fresh from the meeting with his leader, Gandapur confessed to feeling more relaxed and more relieved than he had been over the past six months or so. He subsequently called up two of his cabinet colleagues and told them the party leader wanted them to step down. A further reshuffle of portfolios was carried out on Wednesday, as other cabinet members, mired in corruption allegations, have been either shown the door or assigned other less important portfolios. For now, those close to CM believe he has gained the upper hand against his opponents. But the window remains very small. “He needs to seize the opportunity and do the right thing… before the gullible party chief’s mood changes again.” Published in Dawn, October 2nd, 2025",

      "summary_en": "ADIALA jail, officially known as Central Jail Rawalpindi, is a good 45-minute drive from Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa House, which serves as an outpost of the province in the capital. But for beleaguered KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who routinely stays here when he visits Islamabad, the meeting with his jailed party chairman after months of waiting and petitioning the Supreme Court, could not have come too soon. For six months, he weathered a storm. Not from a weak opposition — it has lost the will to throw a political challenge anyway — but from his own party, backed by an unbridled overseas social media brigade, clamouring for his head. He was called a ‘traitor’, ‘compromised’ and ‘establishment tout’. The noise reached such a fever pitch that some within his own cabinet began to wonder loudly about the prospects of replacing him. It was no secret that Aleema Khan never had any liking for the KP chief minister, but it was her media interactions outside Adiala jail that not only added to Ali Amin’s political woes, but also emboldened his critics Many in officialdom were left puzzled and wondering whether the mustachioed, long-locked strongman was indeed on his way out. “I never felt so weak,” Gandapur narrated to his jailed party leader. For months, he said, he was trolled for refusing the chairman’s orders not to present and pass the provincial budget, hold direct negotiations with the Afghan Taliban to put an end to militancy in the volatile province and, more crucially, refuse support for military operations and drone attacks in the tribal districts. The sardar from Kulachi, Dera Ismail Khan, has hardly had smooth sailing as KP’s eighteenth chief minister. For the first eight months, he was required to launch one protest march after another as the party attempted to pressure the powerful military establishment to eke out concessions for his leaders. Governance, at the time, was placed firmly on the back burner. But his political challenges became compounded after the D-Chowk fiasco last November, and were further exacerbated by subsequent events, beginning with the abortive attempt to pass the mines and minerals bill, which the party’s social media activists claimed was being sponsored by the military establishment. The chief minister had to relent, however, when his incarcerated leader conveyed his own opposition to the bill. Then came the budget. Orders from Adiala said the incarcerated leader should be consulted before it is presented to the house. Efforts were made to share the draft proposals and seek his nod, but things didn’t work out. Then came another order , ‘Don’t pass the budget’. Barrister Saif, self-acclaimed ‘Pindi boy’ and adviser to the chief minister, was dispatched to brief the leader that passing the budget was a constitutional requirement, and failure to do so would technically knock out the government. This time, Khan sahib relented. The unforgiving internet activists, however, trolled Gandapur again when the worsening security situation warranted a military response. The problem was further compounded by incidents involving drone attacks that resulted in civilian casualties. All this while, the only seemingly credible voice relaying the party leader’s views on anything political was Imran’s own sister, Aleema Khan.

Also, four terrorists disguised in women’s clothing were arrested in Khuzdar on Wednesday, according to the military’s media wing. According to CTD officials, an operation was conducted in the Aghbarg area on the outskirts of Quetta after a tip-off about the presence of terrorists. A CTD team cordoned off the locality, prompting armed militants to open fire. Security personnel retaliated, and an intense exchange of fire ensued for over an hour, during which automatic weapons were used. “As a result of the gun battle, 10 terrorists were killed on the spot,” a CTD spokesman said, adding that two personnel sustained injuries and were shifted to hospital. Large quantities of arms, ammunition, explosives, and other equipment were seized from the site. The slain terrorists, however, remain unidentified. Further investigation is underway. In a separate operation in Sherani district, eight terrorists were killed when security forces struck a suspected camp of the outlawed Fitna al Khwarij in the rugged Mughal Kot area. Officials confirmed that a cache of sophisticated weapons, ammunition, and equipment was recovered. Meanwhile, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 13 terrorists belonging to Fitna al Khwarij and Fitna al Hindustan — the state’s terms for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Baloch separatist outfits, respectively - were killed in Quetta and Kech on Sept 30 and Oct 1. During the Quetta operation, security forces engaged a militant hideout, resulting in the deaths of 10 “Indian-sponsored Khwarij.” Another IBO in Kech district neutralised three terrorists affiliated with Fitna al Hindustan. Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from both sites. Four held Additionally, ISPR reported that four terrorists were apprehended in Khuzdar district during an intelligence-based operation (IBO). The suspects, allegedly linked to the Indian proxy group Fitna al Hindustan, were captured while attempting to flee disguised in women’s attire. Weapons and ammunition were also seized. According to the ISPR, the arrested terrorists had been involved in multiple attacks in the region.

During the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazir, Senator Rana Sanaullah and PPP’s Navid Qamar and Ijaz Jakhrani at the NA speaker’s office, it was agreed that the matter would be taken up with PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam Nawaz. The war of words, which began over flood compensation , expanded to water rights on the Indus River, as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe. Addressing a press conference , PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira urged the CM not to fan ‘narrow nationalism’. “Differences should be kept within limits. You (Maryam Nawaz) are a woman and our sister, and our leader (Benazir Bhutto) too was a woman. Reconsider your tone.  What do you want to achieve by playing narrow nationalism… Do you want the rest to leave Punjab, and their rights to be ended?” Flanked by Usman Malik, Chaudhry Aslam Gill, and Faisal Mir, Mr Kaira said the country could not be run by a “single leader or institution”. “This country does not belong to any one person; it belongs to all of us. You (Maryam Nawaz) are not just a CM, you are also the daughter of Nawaz Sharif and the niece of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. If you say that you will not allow anyone to speak, this approach is not appropriate in any way. Reconsider this attitude,” he said. He further said the floods had caused immense damage, and the entire nation spoke with one voice on this. “Where something is wrong, we will point it out and we will protest. But when we give opinions or criticism, you start threatening. The question concerns flood management, but the response is to target the Sindh government,” he said. The PPP leader said BISP was even endorsed by the IMF. “It…provides immediate relief, and this was done before as well. If you don’t want to use BISP, fine; but in terms of transparency, BISP stands first, which is why the IMF itself directed that Rs200bn be added to it in this year’s budget. Our objections concern the relief mechanism,” he added. In response to the CM’s remarks about the canal project, he said there already existed a formula for water distribution, and the matter must be decided in the Council of Common Interests by the federal and provincial governments together. “The PPP has been unfairly blamed regarding canals.” PPP South Punjab President Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood said if the Punjab government was criticised, it was because of its failed policies that left the Seraiki belt submerged after floods. “Even in the past, there have been worse floods, yet never before were the people abandoned in such a helpless state,” he said, calling out the government for its ‘choreographed’ response. Azma’s presser On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said the PPP leaders were competing to hold press conferences against the Punjab government while claiming they were not politicising the plight of flood victims. Azma Bokhari further said that the PML-N took pride in “its popularity and public service”, and the PPP should focus on building its own support instead of such rhetoric. “Such statements make no difference, and PPP cannot stand on its own feet this way,” she added. She said this was not merely political differences but a deliberate attempt to target Punjab collectively. “Personal attacks will naturally invite a response. “You may use BISP in Sindh; we have no objection,” she said.

In response to the CM’s remarks about the canal project, he said there already existed a formula for water distribution, and the matter must be decided in the Council of Common Interests by the federal and provincial governments together. “The PPP has been unfairly blamed regarding canals.” PPP South Punjab President Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood said if the Punjab government was criticised, it was because of its failed policies that left the Seraiki belt submerged after floods. “Even in the past, there have been worse floods, yet never before were the people abandoned in such a helpless state,” he said, calling out the government for its ‘choreographed’ response. Azma’s presser On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said the PPP leaders were competing to hold press conferences against the Punjab government while claiming they were not politicising the plight of flood victims. Azma Bokhari further said that the PML-N took pride in “its popularity and public service”, and the PPP should focus on building its own support instead of such rhetoric. “Such statements make no difference, and PPP cannot stand on its own feet this way,” she added. She said this was not merely political differences but a deliberate attempt to target Punjab collectively. “Personal attacks will naturally invite a response. “You may use BISP in Sindh; we have no objection,” she said.

      "summary_orig": "PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira on Wednesday defended the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) as a “tried and tested” method for providing flood relief, while criticising what he called the “harsh tone” adopted in recent exchanges between his party and its coalition partner, the PML-N. “In the past few days, such questions have been raised that now a dialogue has begun, which, in our understanding, is not appropriate. It is neither beneficial for politics, nor for democracy,” he said at a press conference in Lahore. “And this is our [PPP’s] view, not a suggestion to anyone,” he added. The PPP and PML-N continued to engage in a war of words over flood relief, as PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserted that the BISP was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the recent floods in the country, while PML-N’s Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue. Furthermore, the tensions between the ruling coalition partners on Tuesday flared in parliament as the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest CM Nawaz’s diatribe against their party. “This is the first time that we decided to help the government without taking ministries in the government … without sharing power in the executive,” Kaira said at the press conference. “We did this so that the government, with unity, could resolve the country’s problems, and we could support it,” he added. He continued that his party would support the federal government in every possible way. “[We have] supported it on every issue, when Pakistan was at war we supported it, in assemblies we supported it, we supported legislation, we did no favour; we do not keep count of favours. We did this thinking that we must find solutions to the country’s crises. Otherwise, there were formulas for power sharing, formulas for terms … many formulas were discussed.” However, he added that the purpose was not to give the federal government “a blank cheque that whatever it does, whatever the PML-N does, we will support it“. “If our opinion proved better, they would accept it; if their views proved better, we would accept it. Otherwise, we would come to a middle ground and find a compromise, that is the method. We have tried this so far and will continue to do so.” But he regretted that in the “last few days, a two-way dialogue began and on one side of that dialogue are some colleagues of the PPP and on the other side, the Punjab government”. He said the recent floods caused immense damage, people’s homes were looted, crops destroyed, and human lives as well as livestock were lost. “Wherever there was any mistake, or where we thought there might be a better way to do the work, we gave our suggestions; if our suggestions were not accepted, we criticised [the move]; if we were not heard, we protested — this is our democratic right. And this is also the way. “If you do not accept it, if you do not want to do that, then fine, but we will tell the people of Punjab, we too are Punjabis. We will tell the people of Punjab that in our view this crisis has both immediate and long-term solutions. We will present our ways based on our experience.” Criticising CM Maryam’s remarks, he said: “Now if we give our suggestions and you do not listen and if we criticise [you], you say that you will not allow anyone to speak … and that if a finger is raised here, you will break it and you will not spare them. “We only offered ways to deal with the floods, but in response, the Sindh government was targeted. Some objections were very painful. We were accused of an electricity subsidy [and] other matters.” We know the present government is not at fault, but there are certain objections. The PPP chairman said that on the devastation caused by the floods, people must be given immediate relief, and that can be done through the BISP. That is a tried and tested method we have, and the other thing is that [you] should declare an agricultural emergency.” He continued that the BISP has now become a subject of debate; some want money to be disbursed through it, others do not. “So the cash grant under BISP is for immediate relief; it provides initial relief. And this is not the first time we have done this in 2023, 2022, 2010, 2011; such amounts were used for the flood-affected people. You did not accept that idea, that’s okay. We only give you our opinion.”",

      "summary_en": "PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira on Wednesday defended the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) as a “tried and tested” method for providing flood relief, while criticising what he called the “harsh tone” adopted in recent exchanges between his party and its coalition partner, the PML-N. “In the past few days, such questions have been raised that now a dialogue has begun, which, in our understanding, is not appropriate. It is neither beneficial for politics, nor for democracy,” he said at a press conference in Lahore. “And this is our [PPP’s] view, not a suggestion to anyone,” he added. The PPP and PML-N continued to engage in a war of words over flood relief, as PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserted that the BISP was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the recent floods in the country, while PML-N’s Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue. Furthermore, the tensions between the ruling coalition partners on Tuesday flared in parliament as the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest CM Nawaz’s diatribe against their party. “This is the first time that we decided to help the government without taking ministries in the government … without sharing power in the executive,” Kaira said at the press conference. “We did this so that the government, with unity, could resolve the country’s problems, and we could support it,” he added. He continued that his party would support the federal government in every possible way. “[We have] supported it on every issue, when Pakistan was at war we supported it, in assemblies we supported it, we supported legislation, we did no favour; we do not keep count of favours.

      "summary_orig": "Mobile networks and the internet were restored across Afghanistan on Wednesday, 48 hours after the Taliban authorities shut down telecommunications. Confusion gripped the South Asian country on Monday night when mobile phone service and the internet went down without warning, freezing businesses and cutting Afghans off from the rest of the world. The massive blackout came weeks after the government began cutting high-speed internet connections to some provinces to prevent “immorality”, on the orders of shadowy supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. AFP journalists reported on Wednesday that mobile phone signals and wifi had returned to provinces across the country, including Kandahar in the south, Khost in the east, central Ghazni, and Herat in the west. The Taliban government has yet to comment on the telecommunications shutdown. On Wednesday night, hundreds of Afghans poured onto the streets in the capital Kabul, spreading the word that the internet was back. “It’s like Eidul Azha; it’s like preparing to go for prayer,” said 26-year-old Sohrab Ahmadi, a delivery driver. “We are very happy from the bottom of our hearts.” After days of tension, Afghans celebrated by buying sweets and balloons, as drivers honked their horns, phones pressed to their ears. “The city is alive again,” Mohammad Tawab Farooqi, a restaurant manager in the city told AFP . Businesses, airports, banks closed It is the first time since the Taliban government won their insurgency in 2021 and imposed a strict version of Islamic law that communications have been cut in the country. Netblocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance, said the blackout “appears consistent with the intentional disconnection of service”. It said connectivity had slowed to one per cent of ordinary levels. A government official warned AFP minutes before the shutdown on Monday evening that the fibre optic network would be cut, affecting mobile phone services, “until further notice”. There were widespread closures of businesses, airports, and markets, while banks and post offices were unable to operate. Afghans were unable to contact each other in or out of the country, and many families stopped their children from going to school during the uncertainty. Those living in Herat and Kandahar travelled to border towns to catch signals from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan. The United Nations said on Tuesday the shutdown “left Afghanistan almost completely cut off from the outside world”, and called on authorities to restore access. Internet connections have been extremely slow or intermittent over the past weeks. On September 16, when the first internet services were first cut in northern provinces, Balkh provincial spokesman Attaullah Zaid said the ban had been ordered by the Taliban’s leader. “This measure was taken to prevent vice, and alternative options will be put in place across the country to meet connectivity needs,” he wrote on social media. “Recent studies in Afghanistan found that internet applications have badly affected the ongoing, economic, cultural and religious foundations of society,” he said.",

In the event of an attack on Qatar, the United States will “take all lawful and appropriate measures — including diplomatic, economic, and, if necessary, military — to defend the interests of the United States and of the State of Qatar and to restore peace and stability,” the order said. The agreement comes after an Israeli strike on the key US regional ally on September 9, targeting officials from Hamas who were discussing a US peace proposal to end the conflict in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Qatar’s prime minister from the White House on Monday, apologising for strikes and promising not to do so again, the United States said. Netanyahu was in Washington to meet Trump, and had until then been defiant since ordering the September 9 strikes. Qatar is a key US ally in the Gulf and hosts the largest US military base in the region at Al-Udeid, which also includes a regional headquarters for elements of US Central Command.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Asia Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final. The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Subsequently, Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup. Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team. Today, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday , Financial Express and Hindustan Times , reported that Naqvi had now apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy. Responding to an India Today post about their report on social media platform X, Naqvi stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.” He called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people. The PCB chairman slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”. “As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.” During the Asia Cup, Naqvi had previously expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” from the Indian side after Yadav seemingly politicised the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May. Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention . Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. The PCB had lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Yadav’s remarks, leading to him reportedly being fined 30 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct. Meanwhile, pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against India. Following the final, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on winning the match, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor. Naqvi had also responded to Modi’s post on X, saying: “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”. “Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he had said.",
