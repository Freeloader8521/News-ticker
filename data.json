      "summary_orig": "For nearly five months since June, police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s southern Bannu district have battled not just militants on the ground, but have also had to fend off enemy attacks from the sky. “One eye on the barrel of the gun and another on the sky,” a senior police officer in Bannu remarked. For months, militants from the adjoining tribal areas launched multiple armed quadcopter sorties to try to attack police posts and police stations. “Fifty attempts in one week,” Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed recalled. Police in Bannu said they faced more than two hundred attacks , which employed commercially available, low-cost drones weaponised by militants to target them since June. Changing tactics Militants usually employ improvised munitions during quadcopter attacks. Weapons of choice are grenades used in Russian-origin under-barrel grenade launchers, such as the GP-25, and small calibre mortar rounds. Unprepared for the deployment of quadcopters modified to drop improvised munitions on targets, the police started to deploy nets over their installations or simply installed a canopy overhead to obstruct the munitions ahead of impact. “We had to position snipers on rooftops to shoot down any approaching object,” Bannu Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Sajjad Khan said. In one instance, a drone chased a vehicle evacuating 11 policemen, one of them wounded, following an ambush in the city’s outskirts. “It was hovering and chasing,” Ebaad Wazir, the second-in-command in the Bannu police, who was driving the vehicle, recalled. Militants filmed a video of the chase, and it went viral on social media. The introduction of drone warfare by militants — the first time they have been employed against Pakistani forces — manifested a new phase and perhaps the most deadly transformation of the decades-long war that has claimed thousands of lives, both civilian and uniformed, and uprooted hundreds of thousands of others. The quadcopters, equipped with thermal imaging, are used for surveillance and dropping munitions. Militants are also adapting to changing battlefield conditions and now routinely change the frequencies on which their drones operate to try and stay one step ahead of jammers employed by security forces. Intelligence and police officials said such tactics and knowledge require training and can only come with expertise shared by seasoned terrorists. “Tactics deployed in complex suicide bombings carry telltale signs of this as well.” Officials also did not discount the presence of foreign terrorists in the region, and said they could have been a likely source of such expertise. Losing ‘the edge’ For nearly two decades until August 2021, Islamabad and its forces had the edge in terms of weaponry and tactics, although for the police, it still was an almost equal fight; close-quarters combat while armed with AK-47 rifles. All of that changed when the United States, exhausted by the seemingly unending war in Afghanistan after spending trillions of dollars, withdrew from the country and left behind $7.1 billion worth of military equipment and defence articles. According to a November 2022 report by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, among the abandoned weapons were more than 300,000 small arms — including M-4s, M-16s, M-24s and M-249s — and 48,000 pieces of specialised equipment such as night vision goggles, thermal imaging scopes, and radio surveillance equipment. “The Americans left Afghanistan in a deliberate mess,” a Pakistani security official, posted at the time in Kabul as part of the tripartite commission, recalled. It did not take long for celebrations in some circles in Pakistan to turn into nightmares. Not only did militants’ attacks increase manifold, but the lethality of their attacks also spiked. The battlefield landscape changed dramatically. Armed with US weapons with night vision and thermal capabilities, snipers shot and killed elements of security forces from as far as 1,500 metres, while steel-core 5.56 millimetre ammunition could pierce through bulletproof vests and helmets. “They were killing our men like sitting ducks,” a senior police officer said. An image of M4A1 rifles and other American equipment seized in Peshawar from January 2016. ─ Ali Akbar/File Even the military-issued G-3 rifles, chambered in the 7.62mm Nato calibre, fell short on range and efficacy compared with the US M-4s and M-16s. “They had an edge over us,” the police officer added. As casualties began to mount, with militants relishing targeting unsuspecting personnel with thermal imaging scopes and uploading the videos on the internet, policymakers began to figure out what to do next. What followed, according to senior police officers, was a process of long deliberations, interviews, and debriefings with scores of their colleagues in uniform who survived night attacks, to understand militants’ tactics and weapons used in the assaults and “reshape our tactics”. It was not long before realisation dawned: not only had militants improved their strategy and tactics, but they also had much better weaponry. “We were very late in adopting new technology,” IG Hameed acknowledged. His men were not only short on better weapons but also on trained manpower to use them. It was a race against time to procure weapons and assemble a team to use them. Soviet-era Dragunov designated marksman rifles, trusted by many soldiers and still in use, were fitted with long-range thermal scopes for better accuracy. ‘Tipping the balance’ With help from the military, efforts to procure an assortment of weapons and equipment from the international market began immediately. Billions of rupees were spent and many billions more are to be poured in by the end of the next financial year to purchase weapons and equipment to keep up with the rising behemoth of militancy. The list of the systems purchased so far includes American M-16s, M-24 sniper rifles, M-249 machine guns, light sniper rifles (LSRs), thermal weapon sights (TWS), anti-drone guns, medium and long-range surveillance and assault drones and high frequency jammers to shield armoured vehicles from roadside bombings. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police used anti-drone jamming technology during Sunday’s Ashura procession in Peshawar. — DawnNews TV Personnel are also being trained in marksmanship and special operation teams (SOTs) are being formed at the divisional level. They would later be expanded to district levels and are being armed and equipped with the latest weaponry to respond to threats and defend positions. Police and military officials say the availability of better weaponry is already having an impact on the battlefield. “We are tipping the balance”, the IG said. In Bannu, the police say they are now seeing fewer quadcopter attacks on their police stations, thanks to anti-drone guns. In the past month, five drone attacks were repulsed; one was shot down by a police sniper, while two others were made dysfunctional with anti-drone guns. Blue and White Non Profit Organization Report by Dawn The number of drone and night attacks is declining in areas where militants realise state forces have night vision and anti-drone capabilities. But as one senior police officer remarked, this was a long haul, a battle of nerves, resources and strategy. “We may be killing them, but are we killing the problem?” Header image: Pakistani Army soldiers secure the area, following a militant attack on the Frontier Constabulary (FC) headquarters in Bannu on September 2, 2025. — Reuters",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan is writing off the Afghan Taliban, with no positive expectations left: Khawaja Asif",
      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said Pakistan was writing off the Afghan Taliban and had no further positive expectations from the group, amid consistently tense relations that show no sign of abating. Earlier today, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, claimed that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country. In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. The military spokesperson rejected the allegations. Asked in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ about whether Pakistan was denying carrying out any strikes or civilian casualties during the alleged strikes, the defence minister replied: “Both things are non-existent at this time. We do react and retaliate, but [targeting] civilians is not at all our manner. We have a disciplined force that has traditions and a code of conduct; we are not a ragtag group like the Taliban, who neither have a code of conduct nor religion nor traditions.” “But you know, hope should always be present unless all limits are crossed. But today, we are completely writing them off and we have no good hope from them.” A question about the Taliban’s stated intent to retaliate according to Islamic law irked the defence minister, who asked which Islamic law the Afghan Taliban follow that requires them to live in their neighbour’s home for decades and then spill blood. “Is this some self-invented Shariah of their own? This is not the Shariah of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).” When asked about the timing of any retaliation, Asif said Pakistan’s well-wishers, including Turkey, Iran and Qatar, were urging regional peace, arguing it would benefit everyone and create jobs for all, including Afghans. He added that the Afghan Taliban were more than welcome to pursue and open up trade with India through whichever route they wanted, adding that Pakistan did not care for it. “All these goods are ultimately sold in our market.” Pushed for a response on the Taliban’s threat, the defence minister downplayed it as merely words and said it was meaningless to take them seriously or trust them. “There will be no greater idiocy than trusting them,” he added. Asif maintained that Pakistan had pursued cordial relations, adding that he himself welcomed the Afghan Taliban after they retook Kabul and made frequent visits to Afghanistan, but “I don’t think we have gained any dividends, successes, or changes in their behaviour from these visits; there has been no change in their attitude.” The defence minister reiterated that the Afghan Taliban were ultimately destroying their own country. He expressed the belief that the situation would eventually escalate to a point where regional neighbours seeking peace would intervene.. “It won’t take long; otherwise, they will be isolated and their total isolation will ultimately result in a collapse,” he added. Pak-Afghan relations Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes. Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process. Last week, the Foreign Office said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.",

Asif maintained that Pakistan had pursued cordial relations, adding that he himself welcomed the Afghan Taliban after they retook Kabul and made frequent visits to Afghanistan, but “I don’t think we have gained any dividends, successes, or changes in their behaviour from these visits; there has been no change in their attitude.” The defence minister reiterated that the Afghan Taliban were ultimately destroying their own country. He expressed the belief that the situation would eventually escalate to a point where regional neighbours seeking peace would intervene.. “It won’t take long; otherwise, they will be isolated and their total isolation will ultimately result in a collapse,” he added. Pak-Afghan relations Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes. Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process. Last week, the Foreign Office said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.",
      "title": "Pakistan is writing off the Afghan Taliban, with no positive expectations left: Khawaja Asif",
      "summary": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said Pakistan was writing off the Afghan Taliban and had no further positive expectations from the group, amid consistently tense relations that show no sign of abating. Earlier today, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, claimed that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country. In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. The military spokesperson rejected the allegations. Asked in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ about whether Pakistan was denying carrying out any strikes or civilian casualties during the alleged strikes, the defence minister replied: “Both things are non-existent at this time. We do react and retaliate, but [targeting] civilians is not at all our manner. We have a disciplined force that has traditions and a code of conduct; we are not a ragtag group like the Taliban, who neither have a code of conduct nor religion nor traditions.” “But you know, hope should always be present unless all limits are crossed. But today, we are completely writing them off and we have no good hope from them.” A question about the Taliban’s stated intent to retaliate according to Islamic law irked the defence minister, who asked which Islamic law the Afghan Taliban follow that requires them to live in their neighbour’s home for decades and then spill blood. “Is this some self-invented Shariah of their own? This is not the Shariah of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).” When asked about the timing of any retaliation, Asif said Pakistan’s well-wishers, including Turkey, Iran and Qatar, were urging regional peace, arguing it would benefit everyone and create jobs for all, including Afghans. He added that the Afghan Taliban were more than welcome to pursue and open up trade with India through whichever route they wanted, adding that Pakistan did not care for it. “All these goods are ultimately sold in our market.” Pushed for a response on the Taliban’s threat, the defence minister downplayed it as merely words and said it was meaningless to take them seriously or trust them. “There will be no greater idiocy than trusting them,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "The B-1 Lancer aka the \"Bone\" is one of three bombers currently in the US fleet, along with the B-52 and B-2, and is both the fastest and has the highest payload capacity. It can carry up to 75,000 lbs internally and 50,000 lbs externally , for a maximum theoretical payload of 125,000 lbs, about double that of a B-2 (60,000 lbs ) while also being the only one that can go supersonic. This theoretical load of 125,000 lbs is more than any other bomber in the world.* In these official artists concepts of max payload capacity from 1981, you can see its enormous payload including B-83 megaton class nuclear gravity bombs, AGM-69 SRAM nuclear ballistic missiles, and AGM-86 nuclear air launched cruise missiles (ALCM). Later on, they would also be modified to carry AGM-129 nuclear stealth cruise missiles. Today, they're being fitted with hypersonic missiles and by treaty can't carry nukes anymore. Interestingly, you can also see 38 AIM-54 Phoenix air-to-air missiles (same on the F-14 Tomcat, which could carry up to 6 AIM-54s) on the middle left. It's unclear exactly what those are for, but it's been thought to be for a defense of the GIUK gap from Soviet fighters, or perhaps to escort B-1 bombers into Soviet airspace. Later proposals, specifically the B-1R ,aimed to arm the B-1 with at least 24 AIM-120 AMRAAMs. The idea of a B-1 armed with dozens of air to air missiles is a fun thought, as they could act as a missile truck and feasibly down entire an entire squadron of enemy aircraft. A fun thought experiment would be if they gave AIM-174s to them. Should be clear, but the payload in these artists concepts can't be carried all at the same time, these are individual maximum loadouts of each weapon in 1981, when the B-1 program was being brought back as the B-1B, and the image looks like a B-1A.

      "summary_orig": "Barrick Mining Corp remains committed to its Reko Diq copper mine in Pakistan, one of the world’s largest undeveloped deposits of the metal, its interim CEO said on Tuesday after reports of a possible withdrawal. The $7 billion project in Balochistan is held in an equal partnership between the company and the government and is expected to start production by the end of 2028. Barrick’s board had raised the possibility of splitting the company’s assets, which could include an outright sale of the Reko Diq mine and the company’s African assets, Reuters reported this month, citing sources familiar with the company’s thinking. “Barrick remains committed to the Reko Diq project and to Pakistan,” Mark Hill told Reuters . Security, scale, stake Balochistan suffers frequent attacks by terrorists, making security a major concern for the mine. The project also requires a railway line upgrade to transport copper concentrate to Karachi for processing abroad. Lenders, including the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank, among others, are assembling a financing package exceeding $2.6bn. The Reko Diq project added 13 million ounces to Barrick’s gold reserves in 2024 and is expected to produce 200,000 metric tonnes of copper a year in its first phase, doubling after expansion, with projected free cash flow of more than $70bn over 37 years. Pakistan’s mineral play The remarks from Barrick underscore Reko Diq’s importance to both Pakistan and the company, with Islamabad counting on the mine to anchor its minerals strategy while the Canadian miner advances one of its largest long-term projects. Sources familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters this month that board members and some shareholders worry that exposure to riskier assets in Pakistan and Africa may be weighing on Barrick’s valuation compared with its safer North American operations, particularly in the context of any potential takeover interest. Barrick returned to Pakistan in 2022 after a years-long legal dispute was settled , and the mine has since become a flagship investment for the country as it seeks to draw more capital into its minerals sector.",

      "summary_orig": "Heavy rain caused flooding in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, swamping the tents of thousands of homeless Palestinians facing the prospect of harsh winter storms without sturdy shelter. The large majority of Gaza’s two million people were forced from their homes during Israel’s two-year ground and air onslaught in the small, crowded enclave triggered by Hamas’ October 2023 attack, with many now living in tents and other basic shelters. A ceasefire has broadly held since mid-October, but the conflict demolished much of heavily built-up Gaza, including basic infrastructure, leaving grim living conditions for most people. “This suffering, this rain — and the low-pressure weather systems haven’t even started yet. It’s only the beginning of winter, and we’re already flooded and humiliated,” Um Ahmed Aowdah said outside her tent as rain pelted down on Tuesday. “We haven’t received new tents or tarps. Our tarp is two years old and our tent is two years old — they’re completely worn out.” Displaced Palestinians shelter at a flooded tent camp, during a rainy day in Gaza City, November 25. — Reuters Amjad Al-Shawa, head of the Palestinian NGOs Network, said there was an urgent need for at least 300,000 new tents to house the roughly 1.5m people still displaced from their homes. The Palestinian Civil Defence Service said thousands of tents housing displaced families had been inundated by rainwater or damaged by torrential rainstorms over the past week. Some tents were completely washed away as floodwaters rose 40 to 50 centimetres above ground level in some areas of the coastal enclave, while a field hospital had to suspend operations due to flooding, medics and witnesses said. Displaced Palestinian children stand in flood water as they shelter at a flooded tent camp, during a rainy day in Gaza City, November 25. — Reuters The United Nations said on Monday that while it was working to bring winter supplies into Gaza, the number of trucks able to enter the enclave was limited by Israeli curbs on aid groups. Gaza authorities say Israel is not letting in as much aid as was promised under the ceasefire deal. Aid agencies say Israel is preventing many essential items from entering. Displaced Palestinians shelter under a tent next to piles of rubble, during a rainy day in Gaza City, November 25. — Reuters Israel says it is complying fully with obligations under the truce deal and does not stop any aid from entering Gaza, and that aid agencies have been inefficient in distributing it or have failed to prevent theft by Hamas.

      "summary_orig": "United States Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held talks late on Monday and Tuesday with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi as part of an intense new push by President Donald Trump’s administration to end the war in Ukraine , Driscoll’s spokesperson said. US and Ukrainian officials are trying to narrow the gaps between them over a peace plan , with core issues still unresolved and Ukraine wary of being strong-armed into accepting a deal largely on the Kremlin’s terms. “Late Monday and throughout Tuesday, Secretary Driscoll and team have been in discussions with the Russian delegation to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine. The talks are going well and we remain optimistic. Secretary Driscoll is closely synchronised with the White House … as these talks progress,” said US Army Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Tolbert, a spokesperson for Driscoll. The exact nature of the discussions was not immediately clear, and it was not known who was in the Russian delegation. A US official said that Driscoll, who has emerged as a point man for US diplomatic efforts on Ukraine, was also expected to meet Ukrainian officials while in Abu Dhabi. Underlining the high stakes for Ukraine, its capital Kyiv was hit by a barrage of missiles and hundreds of drones overnight in a Russian strike that killed at least six people and disrupted power and heating systems. Residents were sheltering underground, wearing winter jackets, some in tents. Will discuss sensitive issues with Trump: Zelensky US policy towards the war has zigzagged in recent months. A hastily arranged summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August raised worries in Kyiv and European capitals that the Trump administration might accept many Russian demands, though it ultimately resulted in more US pressure on Russia. The latest US peace proposal, a 28-point plan that emerged last week, caught many in the US government, Kyiv and Europe off guard and prompted fresh concerns that the Trump administration might be willing to push Ukraine to sign a peace deal heavily tilted toward Moscow. The plan would require Kyiv to cede more territory, accept curbs on its military and bar it from ever joining Nato — conditions Kyiv has long rejected as tantamount to surrender. The sudden push raises the pressure on Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is now at his most vulnerable since the start of the war after a corruption scandal saw two of his ministers dismissed, and as Russia makes battlefield gains. Zelensky could struggle to get Ukrainians to swallow a deal viewed as selling out their interests. He said on Monday the latest peace plan incorporated “correct” points after talks over the weekend in Geneva. “The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address. Zelensky, who could visit the US in the next few days, said the process of producing a final document would be difficult. Russia’s unrelenting attacks on Ukraine have left many sceptical about how peace can be achieved soon. “There was a very loud explosion, our windows were falling apart, we got dressed and ran out,” said Nadiia Horodko, a 39-year-old accountant, after a residential building was struck in Kyiv overnight. “There was horror, everything was already burning here, and a woman was screaming from the eighth floor, ‘Save the child, the child is on fire!’” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said an amended peace plan must reflect the “spirit and letter” of an understanding reached between Putin and Trump at their Alaska summit. Macron warns against European capitulation A group of countries supporting Ukraine, which is known as the coalition of the willing and includes Britain and France, was set to hold a virtual meeting on Tuesday. “It’s an initiative that goes in the right direction: peace. However, there are aspects of that plan that deserve to be discussed, negotiated, improved,” French President Emmanuel Macron told RTL radio regarding the US-proposed plan. “We want peace, but we don’t want a peace that would be a capitulation.” He added that only the Ukrainians could decide what territorial concessions they are ready to make. “What was put on the table gives us an idea of what would be acceptable for the Russians. Does that mean that it is what must be accepted by the Ukrainians and the Europeans? The answer is no,” Macron added. In a separate development, Romania scrambled fighter jets to track drones that breached its territory near the border with Ukraine early on Tuesday, and one was still advancing deeper into the Nato-member country, the defence ministry said. Tensions have risen along Europe’s eastern flank in recent months after suspected Russian drones breached the airspace of several Nato states.",

However, there are aspects of that plan that deserve to be discussed, negotiated, improved,” French President Emmanuel Macron told RTL radio regarding the US-proposed plan. “We want peace, but we don’t want a peace that would be a capitulation.” He added that only the Ukrainians could decide what territorial concessions they are ready to make. “What was put on the table gives us an idea of what would be acceptable for the Russians. Does that mean that it is what must be accepted by the Ukrainians and the Europeans? The answer is no,” Macron added. In a separate development, Romania scrambled fighter jets to track drones that breached its territory near the border with Ukraine early on Tuesday, and one was still advancing deeper into the Nato-member country, the defence ministry said. Tensions have risen along Europe’s eastern flank in recent months after suspected Russian drones breached the airspace of several Nato states.",

      "summary": "United States Army Secretary Dan Driscoll held talks late on Monday and Tuesday with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi as part of an intense new push by President Donald Trump’s administration to end the war in Ukraine , Driscoll’s spokesperson said. US and Ukrainian officials are trying to narrow the gaps between them over a peace plan , with core issues still unresolved and Ukraine wary of being strong-armed into accepting a deal largely on the Kremlin’s terms. “Late Monday and throughout Tuesday, Secretary Driscoll and team have been in discussions with the Russian delegation to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine. The talks are going well and we remain optimistic. Secretary Driscoll is closely synchronised with the White House … as these talks progress,” said US Army Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Tolbert, a spokesperson for Driscoll. The exact nature of the discussions was not immediately clear, and it was not known who was in the Russian delegation. A US official said that Driscoll, who has emerged as a point man for US diplomatic efforts on Ukraine, was also expected to meet Ukrainian officials while in Abu Dhabi. Underlining the high stakes for Ukraine, its capital Kyiv was hit by a barrage of missiles and hundreds of drones overnight in a Russian strike that killed at least six people and disrupted power and heating systems. Residents were sheltering underground, wearing winter jackets, some in tents. Will discuss sensitive issues with Trump: Zelensky US policy towards the war has zigzagged in recent months. A hastily arranged summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August raised worries in Kyiv and European capitals that the Trump administration might accept many Russian demands, though it ultimately resulted in more US pressure on Russia. The latest US peace proposal, a 28-point plan that emerged last week, caught many in the US government, Kyiv and Europe off guard and prompted fresh concerns that the Trump administration might be willing to push Ukraine to sign a peace deal heavily tilted toward Moscow. The plan would require Kyiv to cede more territory, accept curbs on its military and bar it from ever joining Nato — conditions Kyiv has long rejected as tantamount to surrender. The sudden push raises the pressure on Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is now at his most vulnerable since the start of the war after a corruption scandal saw two of his ministers dismissed, and as Russia makes battlefield gains. Zelensky could struggle to get Ukrainians to swallow a deal viewed as selling out their interests. He said on Monday the latest peace plan incorporated “correct” points after talks over the weekend in Geneva. “The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address. Zelensky, who could visit the US in the next few days, said the process of producing a final document would be difficult. Russia’s unrelenting attacks on Ukraine have left many sceptical about how peace can be achieved soon. “There was a very loud explosion, our windows were falling apart, we got dressed and ran out,” said Nadiia Horodko, a 39-year-old accountant, after a residential building was struck in Kyiv overnight. “There was horror, everything was already burning here, and a woman was screaming from the eighth floor, ‘Save the child, the child is on fire!’” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said an amended peace plan must reflect the “spirit and letter” of an understanding reached between Putin and Trump at their Alaska summit.

      "title_orig": "Pakistan’s atmosphere ‘almost clear’ of ash plume from volcanic eruption in Ethiopia",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s atmosphere is “almost clear” of the ash plume from a volcanic eruption in Ethiopia, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) spokesperson Anjum Nazeer Zaighum said on Tuesday, adding that the ash cloud was now present over parts of India. The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia’s Afar region about 800 kilometres northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted for several hours two days ago. The eruption sent a column of ash and smoke rising nearly 45,000 feet into the atmosphere. The dangerous ash plume from the eruption had drifted across the Red Sea and disrupted operations on one of the world’s busiest air routes. By Monday, the plume had spread east over Yemen and Oman and was tracking toward the airspace of Pakistan and India, forcing airlines to cancel flights or fly costly detours. The Met Office spokesperson said the ash plume was first detected in Pakistan about 60 nautical miles south of Gwadar around 10am on Monday. Zaigham said the ash plume remained over areas in Pakistan for around 18 to 20 hours. He added that the Met Office had issued a volcanic ash advisory for the aviation industry for the first time in Pakistan’s history following the development. “In total, three advisories were issued,” he said. “At present, it [ash plume] is present over parts of India and Pakistan’s atmosphere is almost cleared,” the spokesperson said. He also clarified that the ash plume had no environmental impact in Pakistan as it moved at altitudes above 45,000 feet and with a speed of 15 to 20 kilometres per hour. “It was too high,“ he said, adding that Pakistan would have faced environmental effects if the eruption had occurred in a country more closely located. Ash cloud over India Local Ethiopian media rep­orted that the explosion from the eruption caused tremors felt as far away as Djibouti and plunged surrounding settlements into darkness. Officials and experts described the event as one of the most extraordinary volcanic awakenings in the region’s history. There is no evidence the volcano had erupted in more than 10,000 years, scientists said. Meanwhile, airlines began cancelling flights post-noon on Monday as the ash moved across the Red Sea. Air India said it had cancelled 11 flights on Monday and Tuesday to make precautionary checks on aircraft that had flown over some locations after the eruption. Smaller peer Akasa said it had scrapped scheduled flights to Middle East destinations such as Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled during the two days. India’s Ministry of Civil Aviation said that only a few flights had been rerouted as a precautionary measure, and that the airports authority had issued a notice to all affected planes. The ash cloud is moving towards China and is expected to clear Indian skies by 7:30pm today (7pm Pakistan time), the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a statement. The Hindustan Times reported yesterday that Indian carrier IndiGo cancelled six flights, including routes originating from Mumbai and southern India. Another IndiGo flight, bound for Abu Dhabi from Kannur, was diverted to Ahmedabad. “The Pakistan airspace is shut for Indian airlines, hence the Indian airlines are expected to be impacted,” a Mumbai airport official said on Monday regarding the re-routing challenges. “We have started keeping a record of this and are monitoring the situation.” Additional input from Reuters",

      "summary_orig": "Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday strongly objected to recent legislations aimed at reducing domestic violence , protecting children from child marriages, and safeguarding transgender community’s rights. On November 13, the National Assembly also passed a bill — awaiting the Senate’s approval — to protect people against domestic violence in Islamabad. A day later, the Balochistan Assembly adopted a bill to ban child marriages with a majority, amidst a protest by opposition lawmakers, including JUI-F’s Younis Zehri. In September, the Balochistan cabinet approved the province’s first-ever transgender policy to ensure the community’s social and economic inclusion. Addressing the media in Islamabad today, the JUI-F chief said, “Some legislation has been enacted regarding the marriage of children below the age of 18 years, regarding transgenders, and regarding domestic violence.” View this post on Instagram The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025 aims to establish an effective system of protection, relief and rehabilitation of women, men, transgender persons, children and any vulnerable person against domestic violence. It provides jail terms ranging from six months to three years, and a fine of up to Rs100,000, if the offence does not fall under the Pakistan Penal Code. Speaking about child marriages, Fazl took exception to terming those under 18 as “ na-baaligh ” (minors), asking which sect’s Islamic laws stated as such. “Strengthening the law to the point that if a marriage or nikkah is done before 18, it will be called sexual abuse and will be interpreted as rape, and a punishment will be given accordingly,” he said. Pakistan is home to over 19 million child brides , with nearly 1 in 6 young women married before the age of 18, according to the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef). While Sindh and the Islamabad Capital Territory already enforce 18 as the minimum marriage age for girls, the Punjab government is also set to introduce the Child Marriage Restraint Act to set the same threshold. During his media talk, the JUI-F chief also criticised the Protection of Women Bill 2006 , which had been introduced amid opposition from religious parties during Gen Pervez Musharraf’s dictatorship, to amend widely criticised Hudood laws . He pointedly said the PPP had voted in favour of that bill, and “today as well, hindrances were being created in the way of permitted nikkah”. The PPP is in power in Balochistan, where the recent anti-child marriage bill and the transgender policy were introduced. Fazl went on to term it a “weird point” and a “joke” that, although child marriages would be considered as rape, a child born out of it would be legitimate. “And the father will be bound to pay for its expenses,” he added. It is unclear whether any of the recent legislation specified this. However, in March, the Lahore High Court ruled that a biological father was under an obligation to maintain his child even if born as a consequence of rape. On the legislation pertaining to the transgender community, Fazl sought the “justification” for individuals born as a “complete male or a complete female” being allowed to change their gender. “Perhaps, they do not even have as much freedom there in the West as we have given them here in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he claimed. The JUI-F chief said he did not “expect” such decisions from the government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his PML-N. He alleged that the new laws were being passed on an “agenda” of the United Nations. He described laws and conventions enacted by international rights bodies as “slavery”. Fazl objects to ‘lifetime perks’ under 27th Amendment During his media briefing, Fazl also “completely rejected” the recently enacted 27th Amendment , which had been assailed by other opposition parties as well. While praising the armed forces’ performance and courage during the May conflict with India, Fazl objected to the “lifetime perks” given to top military officers. “These are perhaps such unique perks that Pakistan’s democratic society does not require them at all,” the senior politician said. He urged President Asif Ali Zardari and the three services chiefs to reject the lifetime immunity offered under the 27th Amendment themselves. Fazl expressed his reservations about the PPP “playing a role in the backslide of democracy instead of raising the slogan of democracy”, as it could not block the changes that were earlier opposed during the 26th Amendment. The JUI-F chief said the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and the Supreme Court Shariat Appellate Bench’s jurisdictions were not kept in mind when drafting the 27th Amendment. He contended that appeals against FSC decisions would be marred by confusion about whether the SC would hear them or the Federal Constitutional Court .",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed on Tuesday said the perpetrators of yesterday’s suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in Peshawar were likely Afghan citizens. Investi­gators and intelligence agencies are hunting for facilitators and support networks behind the attack , which saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage. Questioned about the progress of the investigation and whether any evidence had come to the fore about the assailants being Afghan citizens, IG Hameed said: “We are saying this because, based on the evidence so far, when someone does not have a citizenship record, they are assumed to be Afghan or something similar.” He confirmed that authorities had identified the location where the terrorists spent the night before attacking the FC Headquarters. However, he added that no facilitators had been arrested so far. IG Hameed added that the CCTV footage showing their arrival was obtained and the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) was working to verify their identities. The KP police chief elaborated that the authorities were also determining the route the terrorists used to enter Peshawar. He further said that the terrorists’ motorcycle was seized and fingerprints taken from the vehicle were now part of the ongoing forensic investigation. IG Hameed highlighted that recent measures taken by the KP Police had significantly reduced terrorist incidents, and the provincial police force was being equipped with weapons, modern technology, including anti-drone systems, and bulletproof jackets and vehicles for officials and police stations. He praised the bravery of the KP Police, noting that despite operating in a stressful environment, the force continued to make sacrifices for peace in the region.",

      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry refuted allegations by the Afghan Taliban on Tuesday that Pakistan had conducted overnight strikes in Afghanistan, state media reported. The statement by the head of the military’s media wing came hours after the Afghan Taliban spokesperson accused Pakistan of attacks in Khost, Kunar and Paktika provinces. According to state broadcaster Pakistan TV , the military spokesperson refuted the claims of conducting strikes inside Afghanistan. “Pakistan Army has not attacked civilians inside Afghanistan,” it quoted him as saying. “Whenever Pakistan attacks someone, it announces it,” he said, according to local media . “In our view, there are no good and bad Taliban,” he said, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists. “The Taliban government should make decisions as a state, not as non-state actors,” said Gen Chaudhry. He also wondered how long the current set-up in Afghanistan would remain an interim one. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes. Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process. Last week, the Foreign Office said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups. Gen Faiz court martial proceedings The military spokesperson also addressed the court martial proceedings against former intelligence chief Gen (r) Faiz Hameed. “The trial is a legal matter; there should be no speculation about it. There will be an immediate announcement when the matter reaches its final conclusion.” Gen Hameed has been in custody since August 2024 and the military annou­nced the initiation of court martial proceedings on Aug 12, 2024, on the charges of violating the Army Act and misconduct filed by the owner of a private housing society. The army said in December 2024 that he was indicted by a military court on three counts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority. The case against Gen Hameed was made following a Supreme Court ruling in November 2023, which directed petitioner Moeez Ahmed Khan, owner of Islamabad’s Top City housing society , to pursue grievances thro­ugh appropriate channels, including the Ministry of Defence. Khan had alleged that a May 12, 2017, raid on his property by Pakistan Rangers and Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) officials resulted in the seizure of valuables, including gold, diamonds, and cash, under the pretext of a counter-terrorism operation. This is one of the most high-profile court martial cases in Pakistan Army’s history, as Gen Hameed is the second three-star general and the first former ISI chief to face such proceedings. Under military laws, an indictment follows a court of inquiry and a summary of evidence, which form the basis for framing cha­rges. Following his indictment, Gen Hameed will be allowed to hire legal representation.",

      "title_orig": "Suicide attack at Islamabad district court planned by TTP’s Noor Wali Mehsud, says info minister",
      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Tuesday said banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) chief Noor Wali Mehsud planned the November 11 suicide blast outside Islamabad’s Judicial Complex. The attack killed 12 people and injured 35 others, with the government saying days later that it had arrested four terrorists belonging to the TTP. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Tarar detailed the correspondence between these four facilitators and TTP commanders in Afghanistan. Displaying their pictures, Tarar identified them as the suicide bomber’s handler Sajidullah alias Sheena, Kamran Khan, Muhammad Zali and Shah Munir. The minister said Mehsud “planned this attack through his commander Daadullah”, whom Sajidullah met in 2023, 2024 and in August 2025 as well. He added that Daadullah and Sajidullah “remained in touch through an app”. Tarar identified Daadullah as a resident of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur, adding that he was currently in Afghanistan. He also played a video statement of the man he identified as Sajidullah, who the minister said arranged the suicide jacket and brought the bomber, Usman Shinwari , to the site of the attack. “He was planning this incident in collaboration with Noor Wali Mehsud’s commander Daadullah. Their target was to carry out such an act in either Rawalpindi or Islamabad,” Tarar said, highlighting that the country evaded a “major loss”. The minister said Sajidullah joined the TTP in 2015 and received training in various TTP camps across Afghanistan. He also visited the neighbouring country’s Jalalabad city in 2024. During his 2024 visit, Sajidullah met Daadullah to “plan this suicide bombing and hired two more people upon his return”, who were Zali and Khan. Then, in August 2025, Sajidullah and Zali visited Afghanistan together, Tarar said. According to the minister, they first met TTP militant Abdullah Jan alias Abu Hamza in Shigal district, where they stayed overnight, then met Daadullah in Kabul’s Arzan Qimat neighbourhood. “Daadullah conveyed the orders of Noor Wali Mehsud to them, that they have to carry out a suicide bombing in the areas of Rawalpindi, Islamabad,” Tarar said. “Once back in Pakistan, Sajidullah met with Shinwari, the suicide bomber,” who Tarar said was a resident of Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province. Detailing the correspondence between Sajidullah and Shinwari, the information minister said they scouted multiple locations but “failed to reach their target” due to security. “There is no doubt in the fact that all of this was orchestrated from Afghanistan. Daadullah is present in Afghanistan, [and] the main perpetrator, named Sajidullah, was also trained in Afghanistan.” Tarar further said that the bomber was also a resident of Afghanistan. After playing Sajidullah’s video statement, Tarar asserted, “This is very clear-cut evidence that the TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan) and the TTP jointly did this.” The minister said the four men arrested had “some role in some capacity in the suicide bombing”. He noted that the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the Intelligence Bureau (ID) had arrested them within 48 hours of the incident during a joint operation. He said a “huge racket” had been uncovered through the arrests of these four terrorists, terming it a huge success for the CTD and the IB. The PML-N leader affirmed that security and law enforcement agencies, along with the armed forces, were fully active to eliminate terrorism. Alleged terrorist details facilitating attack In the video statement played during the press conference, the man identified as Sajidullah said he went to Afghanistan in 2016, met Abu Hamza and returned to Pakistan after receiving training for a month. Sajidullah said he met with Abu Hamza during his 2023 visit to Kunar, and then days later, went to Daadullah’s hideout, who “brainwashed and forced me to take an oath of allegiance”. “Six months ago, Daadullah contacted us and told us to come to Afghanistan and told me to bring my friend along as well,“he said, adding that subsequently, he and Zali headed to Jalalabad. They met with Daadullah at his residence, where the TTP commander tasked them with transporting the suicide jacket provided by him to the bomber, according to Sajidullah’s account. “We came to Peshawar and went to Akhun Baba Graveyard,” Sajidullah said, adding that he picked the jacket from there and entrusted it to Munir to “keep it safe”. A few days later, Sajidullah continued, he was informed that a man from Afghanistan named Usman would contact him. “He stayed with me for one to two days. I said he was a guest when my family members asked about him,” Sajidullah said, adding that he later had Munir provide shelter to Usman. However, Munir also said he could not leave Usman alone with his children, and therefore, Munir’s “cousin” Zali rented a room from a man named Muhammad Ali, Sajidullah added. He further said he told the suicide bomber to arrange his accommodation on his own after 15 to 25 days had passed. Then, on November 11, the day of the blast, Sajidullah said he picked up the jacket from Munir, and both of them, along with Zali, “made [Usman] wear the jacket”.",

      "summary_orig": "Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, claimed on Tuesday that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country. In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. No official statement has been issued by Pakistan thus far. The strike was reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes. Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process. Last week, the Foreign Office (FO) said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.",

      "summary_orig": "India has issued a demarche to China after a woman from Arunachal Pradesh alleged that she was detained at the Shanghai airport by immigration officials for 18 hours, who “mocked” her and said that the territory was not part of India, according to Indian media. China says Arunachal Pradesh is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed. Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi. The woman, named Pema Wangjom Thongdok, said in yesterday’s interview to ANI that she was an Indian citizen residing in the United Kingdom for about 14 years. Thongdok said she was travelling from London to Japan’s Osaka via Shanghai on November 21, when Chinese authorities held her back for 18 hours. Detailing her “very long ordeal”, Thongdok alleged that Chinese immigration officials at the Shanghai Pudong International Airport declared her visa as “not acceptable” and her Indian passport as invalid. She further said the officials “mocked” her, saying Arunachal Pradesh was not a part of India. “You’re Chinese, you’re not Indian,” the woman quoted them as saying. “The airline staff of China Eastern and about two other immigration officers were speaking in their language and saying […] ‘Arunachal’ and laughing and calling it ‘China, not India’,” Thongdok told ANI , describing the immigration and airline staff’s behaviour as “very humiliating [and] questionable”. Frustrated by their conduct, she reached out to the Indian embassies in Shanghai and Beijing, resulting in officials intervening to help her leave the country. “We are part of India … We speak ‘ shuddh Hindi’, we don’t understand C of Chinese, we are all Indian,” Thongdok told ANI . “They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh, which they claimed is Chinese territory,” Thongdok had said on social media platform X on November 23 (Sunday), referring to Chinese immigration officials and China Eastern Airlines’ staff. On Monday, The Print quoted a source as saying that a “strong démarche was made with the Chinese side, in Beijing and in Delhi, on the same day the incident took place”. “Our consulate in Shanghai also took up the matter locally and extended the fullest assistance to the stranded passenger,” the source added, terming Thongdok’s detention based on “ludicrous grounds”. “Arunachal Pradesh is indisputably Indian territory, and its residents are perfectly entitled to hold and travel with Indian passports,“ they added, according to the publication. Other Indian publications, including Press Trust of India , Hindustan Times , The Wire and ANI , also reported the same, citing sources familiar with the matter. Following the incident, Thongdok wrote to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) and the foreign secretary, asking them to ensure that any Indian citizen does not face such a situation in the future, The Statesman reported. The incident comes as both China and India, for the past year , have been seeking to put aside differences lingering since their 2020 border standoff . Sources in India’s MEA, as per The Hindu , said that at a time when both sides were working to improve ties, such actions by the Chinese side introduced unnecessary obstructions to the process.",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday evening, directing agencies to initiate the formal process for designating certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organisations. The Muslim Brotherhood is already outlawed as a terrorist group in some countries, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. More recently, Jordan banned it in April of this year. Signed at the White House on November 24, the order specifically mentioned its chapters in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. It stated that it “sets in motion a process by which certain chapters or other subdivisions of the Muslim Brotherhood shall be considered for designation” as both foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs) under US counterterrorism laws. The directive described the Brotherhood as having developed into a “transnational network” since its founding in Egypt in 1928, with chapters across the Middle East that, according to the order, “engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilisation campaigns” that harm their regions, US citizens, and American interests. The order highlighted activities attributed to Brotherhood chapters in Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. It cited the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which led to Tel Aviv’s relentless military campaign in the Palestinian enclave, stating that the Lebanese chapter’s military wing “joined Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian factions to launch multiple rocket attacks against both civilian and military targets within Israel”. The White House document further noted that “a senior leader of the Egyptian chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood … called for violent attacks against US partners and interests”. It added that the Jordanian chapter’s leaders “have long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas”. “It is the policy of the US to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the capabilities and operations” of chapters that may be designated under this process, the order said. It also instructed agencies to act to “deprive those chapters of resources, and thereby end any threat” they posed to US nationals and national security. Implementation timeline The executive order also established a clear timeline. Within 30 days, the secretaries of State and Treasury must submit a joint report evaluating which chapters should be designated. After that, the order directed that the relevant department must, within 45 days, take “all appropriate action” to complete the designations under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood has been the subject of long-running debate within US policymaking circles. Some chapters have functioned as political parties participating in elections, while others have been accused by regional governments of supporting militant groups. Past US administrations resisted designating the organisation outright, citing its diverse branches and concerns over destabilising political consequences. Trump’s order marks the most detailed administrative mechanism yet to evaluate specific national chapters individually rather than treating the Brotherhood as a monolithic entity. Last week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is also a Republican like Trump, had designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation at the state level.",

A statement by the ISPR said that security forces conducted the IBO on Monday, based on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said. It added that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists in the area. The ISPR also said that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue with full pace to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation, saying that they were achieving “major successes” against terrorism under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam . “The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the war against terrorism,” the PM said. “We are determined to completely eradicate all kinds of terrorism from the country.” Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The latest in the string of terror incidents is a suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary’s (FC) headquarters in Peshawar yesterday morning, in which three FC men were martyred and 12 injured. The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage. The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered. According to the state-run APP , initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals.",

Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation, saying that they were achieving “major successes” against terrorism under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam . “The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the war against terrorism,” the PM said. “We are determined to completely eradicate all kinds of terrorism from the country.” Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The latest in the string of terror incidents is a suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary’s (FC) headquarters in Peshawar yesterday morning, in which three FC men were martyred and 12 injured. The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage. The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered. According to the state-run APP , initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals.",
