      "summary_orig": "Iran sees the chance of a good outcome from a third round of talks with the United States, its President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Wednesday, as a delegation left for Geneva for negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme. A senior US official said on Monday that envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner are slated to meet with the Iranian delegation, led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, in Geneva on Thursday. The two countries resumed negotiations over the long-disputed nuclear programme earlier this month as the US builds up its military capability in the Middle East ahead of possible strikes on the Islamic Republic. Iran has threatened to strike US bases in the region if it is attacked. Trump on February 19 said he was giving Tehran about 10 to 15 days to make a deal. “In relation to the talks, we see a good outlook, tomorrow in the meeting that Dr Araqchi will hold in Geneva … we have tried, with the guidance of the supreme leader, to manage this process to get out of the no war, no peace situation,” Pezeshkian said in comments carried by state media. Araqchi said on Tuesday that a deal with the US was “within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority”. Meanwhile, Witkoff told a private gathering that the Trump administration is demanding any nuclear deal with Iran should remain in effect indefinitely, Axios has reported, citing a US official and two others with knowledge of the comments. The US and Israel believe Iran aspires to build a nuclear weapon that could threaten Israel’s existence. Iran says its nuclear programme is purely peaceful, even though it has enriched uranium far beyond the purity needed for power generation, and close to what is required for a bomb. Vance’s warning Trump is pressuring the Iranian government in the wake of its violent crackdown on protesters and has amassed a large US naval presence in the region while threatening military strikes if Tehran does not reach a deal to solve a longstanding dispute over its nuclear programme. US Vice President JD Vance told Iran on Wednesday to take Washington’s threats of military action “seriously,” a day after President Donald Trump appeared to build the case for war in his State of the Union address. As US forces mass in the Middle East, Trump claimed in his speech to Congress on Tuesday that Iran was seeking to develop missiles that can strike the United States. Trump also accused Iran of having “sinister nuclear ambitions” and working to rebuild a nuclear programme that was targeted by US strikes last year. Vance told Fox News that while Trump was going to try to “accomplish it diplomatically,” the US president also had the “right” to use military action. “You can’t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,” said Vance. “The president has a number of other tools at his disposal to ensure this doesn’t happen. He’s shown a willingness to use them and I hope the Iranians take it seriously in the negotiations tomorrow because that’s certainly what the president prefers.” His comments came as the United States announced fresh sanctions targeting Iran, pressing on with what Washington calls its “maximum pressure” campaign.",

      "title_orig": "Modi addresses Knesset, says India stands ‘firmly’ with Israel after Oct 7 attack",
      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi told lawmakers in Jerusalem on Wednesday that India stands “firmly” with Israel following Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023. Modi also met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a two-day visit aimed at deepening trade and defence ties that has drawn criticism at home. “I … carry with me the deepest condolences of the people of India for every life lost and for every family whose world was shattered in the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7,” Modi said in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. “We feel your pain, we share your grief. India stands with Israel firmly with full conviction in this moment and beyond.” In his speech, Modi did not explicitly mention the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza during the more than two-year-long Israeli onslaught. But he said that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”. Modi also told Israeli lawmakers that his country’s economic growth and Israel’s leadership in technological innovation formed a “natural foundation for our forward-looking partnership”. “I see a lot of synergies in areas such as quantum technologies, semiconductors and artificial intelligence,” he added. It is Modi’s second visit to Israel as prime minister since he took office in 2014. ‘A real friendship’ Earlier on Wednesday, a red carpet was rolled out at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport and Modi was greeted with a hug by Netanyahu as he disembarked the plane. “The two leaders share a special and a personal relationship,” Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for Netanyahu’s office, said in a video posted on X. “The bond between Israel and India is a powerful alliance as we are partners in innovation, security and a shared strategic vision,” she added. Netanyahu’s office said the two right-wing leaders held a private meeting after the welcoming ceremony, with the Israeli premier hailing “a real friendship”. In a post on X, Modi described the meeting as “excellent”. “We discussed a wide range of topics aimed at deepening and strengthening the bilateral relations between our two countries,” he said. The pair “held an in-depth conversation about major developments in the region”, he added. Modi is also scheduled to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog during the visit. New Delhi has steadily expanded cooperation with Israel across the defence, agriculture, technology and cybersecurity sectors, while balancing diplomatic interests in the Middle East. Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that merchandise trade reached $3.62 billion in 2024-2025. Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Ties deepened after Hindu-nationalist leader Modi took office in 2014. Criticism at home Modi first visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year. In 2023, grand plans were unveiled in New Delhi for an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor — to link railways, ports, electricity, data networks and pipelines, including through Saudi Arabia and Israel. Those plans were stalled by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which responded with a devastating onslaught on the Gaza Strip, killing over 71,000 Palestinians. Months after his 2017 visit to Israel, Modi travelled to Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority. His current visit has sparked criticism at home. Senior Congress party figure Priyanka Gandhi — sister of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — posted on social media on Wednesday that she hoped Modi would mention the killing of “thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza” during his address to the Israeli parliament. Congress parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh said Modi will be displaying “moral cowardice” when the entire world is critical of his “dear friend” Netanyahu. He said Modi was “brazenly embracing” his Israeli counterpart, who has “reduced Gaza to rubble and dust and who is orchestrating the expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank”. “On May 20, 1960, Jawaharlal Nehru was in Gaza and met with the Indian contingent of the UN Emergency Force there,” Ramesh recalled. Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “ hexagon of alliances ” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations. India, the world’s most populous nation with 1.4 billion people, is majority Hindu, but an estimated 220 million Indians are Muslim.

      "summary_en": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi told lawmakers in Jerusalem on Wednesday that India stands “firmly” with Israel following Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023. Modi also met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a two-day visit aimed at deepening trade and defence ties that has drawn criticism at home. “I … carry with me the deepest condolences of the people of India for every life lost and for every family whose world was shattered in the barbaric terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7,” Modi said in the Knesset, the Israeli parliament. “We feel your pain, we share your grief. India stands with Israel firmly with full conviction in this moment and beyond.” In his speech, Modi did not explicitly mention the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza during the more than two-year-long Israeli onslaught. But he said that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”. Modi also told Israeli lawmakers that his country’s economic growth and Israel’s leadership in technological innovation formed a “natural foundation for our forward-looking partnership”. “I see a lot of synergies in areas such as quantum technologies, semiconductors and artificial intelligence,” he added. It is Modi’s second visit to Israel as prime minister since he took office in 2014. ‘A real friendship’ Earlier on Wednesday, a red carpet was rolled out at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport and Modi was greeted with a hug by Netanyahu as he disembarked the plane. “The two leaders share a special and a personal relationship,” Shosh Bedrosian, spokeswoman for Netanyahu’s office, said in a video posted on X. “The bond between Israel and India is a powerful alliance as we are partners in innovation, security and a shared strategic vision,” she added. Netanyahu’s office said the two right-wing leaders held a private meeting after the welcoming ceremony, with the Israeli premier hailing “a real friendship”. In a post on X, Modi described the meeting as “excellent”. “We discussed a wide range of topics aimed at deepening and strengthening the bilateral relations between our two countries,” he said. The pair “held an in-depth conversation about major developments in the region”, he added. Modi is also scheduled to meet Israeli President Isaac Herzog during the visit. New Delhi has steadily expanded cooperation with Israel across the defence, agriculture, technology and cybersecurity sectors, while balancing diplomatic interests in the Middle East. Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that merchandise trade reached $3.62 billion in 2024-2025. Full diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1992. Ties deepened after Hindu-nationalist leader Modi took office in 2014. Criticism at home Modi first visited Israel as prime minister in 2017, before Netanyahu made a reciprocal visit to India the following year. In 2023, grand plans were unveiled in New Delhi for an India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor — to link railways, ports, electricity, data networks and pipelines, including through Saudi Arabia and Israel. Those plans were stalled by Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, which responded with a devastating onslaught on the Gaza Strip, killing over 71,000 Palestinians. Months after his 2017 visit to Israel, Modi travelled to Ramallah, seat of the Palestinian Authority. His current visit has sparked criticism at home. Senior Congress party figure Priyanka Gandhi — sister of opposition leader Rahul Gandhi — posted on social media on Wednesday that she hoped Modi would mention the killing of “thousands of innocent men, women and children in Gaza” during his address to the Israeli parliament.

      "summary_orig": "Multiple PTI supporters across social media platforms were sharing a dim clip of party founder Imran Khan since February 24, 2026, claiming that it was from his latest visit to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for a second eye injection. However, the video is old from February 20, 2023, when he appeared before the Lahore High Court (LHC) for interim protective bail in a case . The iVerify Pakistan team investigated this content and determined that it is false. Imran was brought to Pims for a follow-up eye treatment on Feb 24. According to a doctor, he was brought to the hospital for a second dose of anti-VEGF intravitreal injection. Imran’s eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January 2026. His first medical procedure, which was carried out on January 24, was confirmed by the government five days later. Since then, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game , with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, of not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran, and of not allowing his personal physicians access to him. The government denies these allegations. On Feb 24, a user, who appears to be a PTI supporter based on his profile picture and past posts on X, shared a dim video of Imran with the following caption: “Imran Khan’s video of his arrival at Pims hospital has gone viral”. The post gained 180,000 views. An Indian propaganda account also shared the same video with a similar claim on X with the following caption: “Pakistani hospital: A video of Imran Khan has gone viral.” The post accumulated 190,000 views. The same video was also shared by another PTI supporter on X with a similar caption, garnering more than 60,000 views. Another user shared a screenshot from the same video with a similar claim, gaining more than 105,000 views. Another PTI supporter shared the same video and a screenshot of the video with a similar caption. Subsequently, he reshared his own video and screenshot again, gaining a total of 63,000 views. The same video with a similar claim was shared by multiple other PTI supporters on Instagram ; TikTok, as can be seen here , here , and here ; Facebook, as seen here , here , here , here , here , here and here ; and X, as seen here , here , here , here , here , here and here . They collectively gained over 270,000 views. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the health of the former prime minister and PTI founder. A reverse image search was conducted on a keyframe to trace the source of the clip, which yielded a YouTube video shared by Indian media outlet The Tribune on February 20, 2023. The video was titled: “Former Pak PM Imran Khan appears before court amid high drama, gets protective bail in one case”. The video shows the moment when Imran reached the LHC to seek protective bail in a case pertaining to an ‘attack’ on the Election Commission of Pakistan building. As can be seen in the original video referenced above, the visuals in the viral clip are identical. Imran and the individuals standing behind him are wearing the same clothes, and a person in the background can be seen wearing the same distinctive cap, confirming that the footage is from the earlier video and not from a recent visit. The same appearance with similar visuals was covered by multiple domestic mainstream media outlets such as Dawn , The Nation , Dunya News , Express Tribune and The News International . Therefore, the fact check determined that the claim that a viral video shows PTI founder Imran  from his most recent visit to Pims for a second eye injection is false.​ The clip is old and shows Imran appearing before the LHC for interim protective bail on February 2023. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

      "summary_orig": "BAJAUR: Four cops were martyred and two others were wounded when unidentified attackers opened fire at a patrol party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district on Wednesday evening. Khar Police Station House Officer Gul Zada told Dawn that the attackers targeted the Ababeel Squad — an exclusive patrolling force — at the time of Iftar near the Nawai Kallay area. The squad was on a routine patrol when unidentified attackers opened fire on them, he said, adding that four policemen died on the spot while two others were “seriously injured”. Separately, Bajaur police spokesperson Israr Khan told Dawn that the personnel were on their way to the Bajaur police lines from Inayat Kallay bazaar, with their duty hours about to end, when they were attacked. As a result, four cops — Yar Zada, Dawood Khan, Imran Khan and Siraj Khan — were martyred while Irshad Khan and Azizur Rehman were injured, he added. SHO Gul Zada said the injured policemen were immediately taken to the district headquarters hospital in Khar for treatment. Meanwhile, a police team led by senior officials immediately rushed to the site of the incident and launched a search operation to hunt down the attackers, who had fled after the shooting, Israr Khan said. The attack in Bajaur took place a day after seven police personnel were martyred in two attacks in KP, where law enforcers have increasingly come under attack in recent days. On Tuesday, six law enforcement personnel, including Deputy Superintendent of Police Asad Mehmood, were martyred in a terrorist attack on a police vehicle in Kohat district. A police officer told Dawn that the DSP, an inspector and four constables were martyred when their vehicle was ambushed near Shakardara Road while transporting two individuals for a court appearance. One of the two individuals being transported was also killed in the attack. The assailants later set the vehicle on fire. In a separate incident, a constable was martyred after unidentified men opened fire in the Mughal Khel village of Wana tehsil in Lower South Waziristan. On Monday, three Federal Constabulary men were martyred when terrorists attacked rescue teams in the Karak district. Last week, a terrorist attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in Bajaur district resulted in the martyrdom of 11 security personnel .",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The federal and provincial governments on Wednesday agreed on a joint strategy to establish peace and stability in the country. An agreement to this effect was reached during an important meeting on law and order held with Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry in the chair. The development comes amid the surge of terrorist attacks, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, carried out by Fitna Al Khawarij and Fitna Al Hindustan — state-designated names for terror outfits backed by Indian proxies. During the meeting, the Centre assured provincial governments of the provision of necessary resources and technical support to maintain law and order. “Protection of citizens’ lives and property is the state’s top priority,” Chaudhry remarked. He also praised the security forces’ role in the fight against terrorism. “The security forces remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” he said. The meeting was attended by the federal interior secretary, the provincial inspector generals (IG) of police, the provincial home secretaries, and the Islamabad chief commissioner and police chief. Talking to Dawn after the meeting, Chaudhry said the meeting also assessed the threat level following strikes by Pakistan in neighbouring Afghanistan. He said the camps and hideouts that were targeted belonged to armed groups behind the spate of recent attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad. He said the key characters behind recent terrorist incidents had been trained inside Afghanistan. He said these attacks had also been planned in the neighbouring country. He said Pakistan had conclusive evidence to prove that the recent attacks on its soil were carried out by terrorists and suicide bombers acting at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers. He said Islamabad had repeatedly urged Kabul to take verifiable steps to prevent armed groups from using Afghan soil, but that no substantive action had followed. He advised Kabul to implement the Doha agreement, which bars the use of Afghan soil for terrorist activities, in letter and spirit instead of playing in the hands of another one of Pakistan’s hostile neighbours. He said the path of peace with Pakistan was in the best interest of Afghanistan, and an essential prerequisite was bringing to an end the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan. Chaudhry said while Pakistan desired peaceful relations with all its neighbours, the security of Pakistani citizens remained its top priority, which would not be compromised. The minister said 2025 was the worst in terms of terror incidents in Pakistan and regretted that they continued to take place. He, however, said “enough was enough” and now all possible steps would be taken to stamp out terrorism through coordinated efforts by the federal and provincial governments. He said the institutional mechanism involving threat alert generation, threat assessment, and the response to deal with them was working well and had helped prevent major terror incidents across the country.",

During the meeting, the Centre assured provincial governments of the provision of necessary resources and technical support to maintain law and order. “Protection of citizens’ lives and property is the state’s top priority,” Chaudhry remarked. He also praised the security forces’ role in the fight against terrorism. “The security forces remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” he said. The meeting was attended by the federal interior secretary, the provincial inspector generals (IG) of police, the provincial home secretaries, and the Islamabad chief commissioner and police chief. Talking to Dawn after the meeting, Chaudhry said the meeting also assessed the threat level following strikes by Pakistan in neighbouring Afghanistan. He said the camps and hideouts that were targeted belonged to armed groups behind the spate of recent attacks, including a deadly suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad. He said the key characters behind recent terrorist incidents had been trained inside Afghanistan. He said these attacks had also been planned in the neighbouring country. He said Pakistan had conclusive evidence to prove that the recent attacks on its soil were carried out by terrorists and suicide bombers acting at the behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers. He said Islamabad had repeatedly urged Kabul to take verifiable steps to prevent armed groups from using Afghan soil, but that no substantive action had followed. He advised Kabul to implement the Doha agreement, which bars the use of Afghan soil for terrorist activities, in letter and spirit instead of playing in the hands of another one of Pakistan’s hostile neighbours. He said the path of peace with Pakistan was in the best interest of Afghanistan, and an essential prerequisite was bringing to an end the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan. Chaudhry said while Pakistan desired peaceful relations with all its neighbours, the security of Pakistani citizens remained its top priority, which would not be compromised. The minister said 2025 was the worst in terms of terror incidents in Pakistan and regretted that they continued to take place. He, however, said “enough was enough” and now all possible steps would be taken to stamp out terrorism through coordinated efforts by the federal and provincial governments. He said the institutional mechanism involving threat alert generation, threat assessment, and the response to deal with them was working well and had helped prevent major terror incidents across the country.",

      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Wednesday that a total of 34 terrorists were killed in separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that over the last few days, security forces had conducted a series of “high tempo, intelligence-driven operations” aimed at eliminating Indian proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. The statement said that on Feb 24, 26 terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in four separate engagements in KP, while eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were killed in an operation in Balochistan’s Sambaza. Giving a breakdown, ISPR said that the movement of a group of terrorists trying to infiltrate through the Pak-Afghan border was picked up by security forces in KP’s North Waziristan. It said troops engaged the terrorists, killing one in the process. “It is significant to highlight that the killed kharji has been identified as an Afghan national,” the statement said. It went on to say that an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted in KP’s Lakki Marwat district. During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and after an intense fire exchange, three militants were killed, it said. According to ISPR, 10 terrorists were killed in Narmi Khel in KP’s Bannu district while 12 were killed in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali. It went on to say that troops also conducted an IBO in Sambaza in Balochistan’s Zhob district. “After an intense fire exchange, eight terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Hindustan were successfully neutralised,” it said. “Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian sponsored killed khwarij and terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” it said. “The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers,” the statement said, adding that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate other terrorists. The statement concluded that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to act against terrorism at full pace. In a statement, President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for their successful operations against Fitna Al Hindustan and Fitna Al Khwarij terrorists. He said that the killing of the terrorists and the recovery of weapons reflected the professional performance of security forces. He stressed that the security forces and law enforcement agencies should continue their efforts to eradicate terrorism in line with the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam . “There should be no let-up in operations against terrorists who are active with external backing, to ensure national security and the protection of the people,” he said. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a statement, also paid tribute to Pakistan’s security forces. He further stated that Pakistan’s security forces continued to achieve battlefield successes against terrorist organisations each day. He reaffirmed that the government was determined to eliminate terrorism from the country. Earlier this week, security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during IBOs in Balochistan and KP.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The main inter-provincial highway linking Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with Punjab was reopened to traffic on Wednesday after remaining closed for several hours following a suicide attack at the Dajil checkpost in Bhakkar. The road had been sealed after a suicide attack at the inter-provincial checkpost on Tuesday evening, leaving two police officials martyred. Following the attack, authorities suspended traffic as a precautionary measure and launched a search operation. Officials said the Dera Darya Khan bridge was reopened for all kinds of traffic on Wednesday after consultations between the district administrations of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar. Traffic was restored once security clearance was completed and necessary checks were carried out. It is worth mentioning that the Dajil checkpost is at the border of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar. Traders against repeated closures The continued closure of the inter-provincial route caused significant inconvenience to travellers and transporters. Vehicles remained stranded for hours, and passengers were forced to seek alternative routes at additional expense. The disruption comes days after the same route remained blocked for several days due to protests by the PTI, which had already affected the movement of goods and people. Earlier in the day, traders in DI Khan said repeated closures had disrupted supply lines from Punjab, particularly from Lahore and other major commercial centres. President of the Markazi Anjuman-i-Tajiran, Sohail Ahmed Azmi, said the prolonged suspension of traffic was compounding the difficulties faced by the business community. He warned that with Ramazan underway and Eidul Fitr approaching, any further delay in the transportation of goods from Punjab could result in financial losses and possible shortages in local markets. Azmi had urged the regional police authorities in Bhakkar to restore traffic after conducting necessary security checks, stating that while security concerns were understandable in the aftermath of the attack, the extended closure of the highway was adding to public hardship. Punjab IG visits checkpost Meanwhile,  Punjab Inspector Genera Rao Abdul Kareem visited the checkpost and inspected the site of the explosion. During the visit, the regional police officer Sargodha and the district police officer Bhakkar briefed him about the initial findings and evidence collected from the scene. The IG directed that security be further tightened at all inter-provincial checkposts across Punjab and instructed officials to ensure strict implementation of standard operating procedures. He appreciated the morale of the personnel and said those involved in the attack would be brought to justice, adding that the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain. Senior officers, including the additional IG of the Counter-Terrorism Department, accompanied him during the visit.",

He warned that with Ramazan underway and Eidul Fitr approaching, any further delay in the transportation of goods from Punjab could result in financial losses and possible shortages in local markets. Azmi had urged the regional police authorities in Bhakkar to restore traffic after conducting necessary security checks, stating that while security concerns were understandable in the aftermath of the attack, the extended closure of the highway was adding to public hardship.

The IG directed that security be further tightened at all inter-provincial checkposts across Punjab and instructed officials to ensure strict implementation of standard operating procedures. He appreciated the morale of the personnel and said those involved in the attack would be brought to justice, adding that the sacrifices of the martyrs would not go in vain. Senior officers, including the additional IG of the Counter-Terrorism Department, accompanied him during the visit.",

      "summary": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The main inter-provincial highway linking Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with Punjab was reopened to traffic on Wednesday after remaining closed for several hours following a suicide attack at the Dajil checkpost in Bhakkar. The road had been sealed after a suicide attack at the inter-provincial checkpost on Tuesday evening, leaving two police officials martyred. Following the attack, authorities suspended traffic as a precautionary measure and launched a search operation. Officials said the Dera Darya Khan bridge was reopened for all kinds of traffic on Wednesday after consultations between the district administrations of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar. Traffic was restored once security clearance was completed and necessary checks were carried out. It is worth mentioning that the Dajil checkpost is at the border of Dera Ismail Khan and Bhakkar.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday stressed the need for reducing direct taxes “across the board” in the upcoming budget to facilitate the business community. The premier made the remarks while addressing the inaugural session of the two-day Pakistan Governance Forum 2026, which was attended by businesspersons as well. PM Shehbaz stressed the need for increasing economic growth, production, exports, investments and foreign direct investments (FDI), rather than relying on hiking taxes. He said: “I believe that in the upcoming budget — which will come a few months later — we must decrease direct taxes across the board so that businesspersons and investors are facilitated. “My entire team and I are united on this that we must reduce taxes immediately,” he said, adding that businesspeople did not pay indirect taxes. Noting that many businesspersons sitting among the audience understood the issue he was referring to, PM Shehbaz said, “You obtain the indirect tax from the consumers. But if you keep it in your pockets, then what can be a bigger injustice to the nation?” The prime minister remarked that it was akin to a carrot and stick approach, adding that in his view “there could not be bigger injustice and oppression with the public” than keeping taxes coming from consumers in their pockets, rather than paying it to the government. “This is why I want to tell you, without naming names, but I will name the industries: sugar, cement, tobacco,” PM Shehbaz stated. He noted that there was an increase of Rs36 billion in tax recovery in the sugar sector in 2025 compared to 2024, and a Rs60bn increase in the cement sector during the same period. The premier acknowledged that numerous “respected” industry leaders “honestly make payments” and pointed out that some not doing so resulted in an “unhealthy competition”. “It has to be a whole-of-government approach in which provinces, Centre, military leadership, all of us have to work together,” he emphasised. PM Shehbaz recalled that he held meetings with various business sectors to make decisions after consultations with them. He asserted, “I believe that it is not the government’s duty to run businesses, […] it is that of businesspersons. “The government’s duty is to facilitate them, to provide them whatever the government can do to support their efforts in terms of productivity, more efficiency, research and development, exports, and so forth,” he added. “There is no lack of anything; if anything is lacking, it is will,” the premier remarked. “Hard work, day and night, is required,” he said. “We do not have the luxury of time; we will have to act and act speedily if we want to regain our lost standing.” Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal also addressed the event. Power Minister Awais Leghari, Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik, IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and British High Commissioner Jane Marriot were among those present in the audience.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has boosted security and arrested dozens of suspects as it fears a rising wave of militant attacks following its air strikes in Afghanistan, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Wednesday. “Our forces are on high-alert to combat any attacks,” Chaudhry told Reuters . “You know the militants always react whenever we go after their hideouts in Afghanistan.” Pakistan carried out air strikes on targets in Afghanistan over the weekend on what it said were militant targets responsible for a spate of recent suicide bombings on Pakistani soil. Islamabad blames Kabul for allowing the fighters to use Afghanistan as a safe haven. Kabul denies the charges, saying the militancy is Pakistan’s internal problem. Pakistani and Afghan forces exchanged fire along their border on Tuesday, with each side accusing the other of initiating the clash. There have also been a number of militant attacks, including the ambush of a police vehicle in Kohat in which five officers and two civilians were killed and a suicide bombing at a checkpoint that killed two policemen. Chaudhry said the retaliatory attacks by militants proved Islamabad’s case that they had linkages in Afghanistan, adding that the forces had averted several attacks in recent weeks and arrested a number of suspects, including Afghans. Security forces have accelerated search and intelligence based operations and “have arrested dozens of suspected militants, their handlers and their facilitators,” the minister said. Multiple sources added that Pakistan’s intelligence agencies have issued alerts for a possible surge in terror attacks in Pakistan in coming days. Urban centres, markets, security forces and places of worship could be possible targets, according to the alerts, the sources said. “We have been given a strong caution about more terror attacks in our official communications. In this regard, we have almost doubled our search operations across Pakistan,” said an intelligence official. Militancy is a growing problem for Pakistan with the number of attacks rising every year since 2022, according to Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED), a global monitoring organisation. Data from ACLED shows attacks in Pakistan rose nearly fourfold to 2,425 in 2025 from 658 in 2022 and over the same period, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) attacks increased more than seven-fold to 838 from 118.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Aleema Khanum, sister of PTI founder Imran Khan, on Wednesday launched a scathing criticism of the party leadership over decisions taken for the former premier’s medical treatment and of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) over the delay in fixing his cases for hearing. A day earlier, the PTI founder was taken to the hospital for follow-up treatment of his eye ailment , which came to light in late January. However, his party took exception to the ‘secrecy’ surrounding this procedure and the complete exclusion of family members from this process. The opposition has also repeatedly demanded that cases of the incarcerated PTI founder be fixed for an early hearing. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Aleema said the health of the PTI founder was the family’s primary concern and insisted that no decision regarding his treatment should be made without their permission. Referring to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statement from February 17 regarding Imran’s health, she said the minister had publicly claimed that Imran had received medical treatment, but no one from the party leadership could confirm the nature of that treatment. In his statement, Naqvi had also accu­sed Aleema of trying to exploit her incarcerated brother’s health issues for political gains. “Why doesn’t anyone deny or confirm what treatment was carried out?” Aleema asked. She alleged that the family had recommended doctors, including Dr Asim, Dr Uzma Khan and Dr Barki, for examination at Shifa International Hospital. Still, their names were either rejected, or no response was given. She claimed the family later learned that treatment had been conducted at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) and that they were kept unaware of developments. “We were demanding treatment at Shifa International Hospital. Instead, we were sent to jail when we raised the issue,” she said. She further alleged that pressure was being exerted on government doctors and said the family would no longer communicate concerns in closed-door meetings but would raise them publicly. Aleema also questioned the silence of senior PTI lawyers and office-bearers, naming Hamid Khan, Ali Zafar, Latif Khosa and Barrister Gohar, and asked why they were not actively pursuing the founder’s cases. “Where are the senior lawyers who were given party tickets? The founder repeatedly asked them to get his cases filed,” she said. She claimed that information about meetings and medical arrangements was coming from Naqvi instead of party representatives. “Will we get information from the minister or from our own party?” she asked. Expressing frustration, she remarked that the party appeared “as relaxed as if Imran Khan has been treated,” adding that if anyone could not bear the burden of the PTI founder’s narrative, they should step aside. On the matter of the delay in cases being fixed, Aleema said the PTI founder had been coming to court for the past 13 months to pursue his cases, but hurdles were being created. “We come and sit in court for hours, but cases are not fixed,” she said, adding that on one occasion, when Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi appeared in court and attempted to speak, the chief justice left the courtroom. Aleema maintained that the “chair of justice” existed to provide relief to the people and claimed that courts elsewhere in the world did not function in such a manner. Separately, senior lawyer Salman Akram Raja told the media that court orders regarding meetings with the PTI founder were not being implemented. He added the IHC had ordered two weekly meetings — one for lawyers and one for family members — but alleged that meetings were not arranged despite the appearance of the KP chief minister. Raja further claimed that contempt petitions filed over non-compliance were not heard and that the high court had become a “closed door” for the party. He added that applications for medical examination had also not been taken up. “In one case related to [X account], the court directed that we meet the party founder and file a response. How can we file a reply without meeting him?” he questioned, alleging that proceedings continued without facilitating the meeting. Raja said the party would approach the Supreme Court if relief was not granted. KP CM also spoke to reporters, saying he had attempted to address Chief Justice Dogar in open court but was not heard. “I went to the rostrum while fasting and greeted the chief justice, but he did not respond,” he said, adding that PTI wanted to demonstrate peaceful protest rather than agitation. Meanwhile, Barrister Salman Safdar said that if bail cases were not fixed for hearing, the matter would be taken directly to the SC. Later, the IHC administration fixed an early hearing plea for Thursday. Gohar acknowledges communication gap within party leadership Separately, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan also arrived at the IHC. Addressing the media upon his arrival, Gohar said that the party leadership had decided to pursue its cases before the Supreme Court of Pakistan, and he had made an appearance there before arriving at the IHC. He acknowledged a communication gap within the party leadership but stressed that all leaders were making sincere and coordinated efforts to secure Imran’s release. The PTI chairman also congratulated the newly elected office-bearers of the Islamabad High Court Journalists Association, saying that “dynamic individuals are stepping forward” to lead the journalist community. In a conversation with IHCJA President Asad Malik and General Secretary Asif Naveed, Gohar assured the association of his party’s full support on issues facing journalists. “Wherever you encounter difficulties, we will raise our voice and extend our cooperation wherever it is required,” he said, adding that PTI would stand by the journalist community in its struggle for rights and professional freedom. He further stated that his party would raise its voice against the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA), particularly regarding concerns about restrictions on freedom of expression. Gohar maintained that the PTI would continue to advocate for journalists’ rights, especially against what he described as language restrictions imposed on media personnel, reiterating that freedom of expression is indispensable for a democratic society. He also assured journalists that the party would take up the issue of the unannounced and prolonged ban on Dawn’s advertisements in Parliament, terming it a curtailment of press freedom.",

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: Aleema Khanum, sister of PTI founder Imran Khan, on Wednesday launched a scathing criticism of the party leadership over decisions taken for the former premier’s medical treatment and of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) over the delay in fixing his cases for hearing. A day earlier, the PTI founder was taken to the hospital for follow-up treatment of his eye ailment , which came to light in late January. However, his party took exception to the ‘secrecy’ surrounding this procedure and the complete exclusion of family members from this process. The opposition has also repeatedly demanded that cases of the incarcerated PTI founder be fixed for an early hearing. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Aleema said the health of the PTI founder was the family’s primary concern and insisted that no decision regarding his treatment should be made without their permission. Referring to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statement from February 17 regarding Imran’s health, she said the minister had publicly claimed that Imran had received medical treatment, but no one from the party leadership could confirm the nature of that treatment. In his statement, Naqvi had also accu­sed Aleema of trying to exploit her incarcerated brother’s health issues for political gains. “Why doesn’t anyone deny or confirm what treatment was carried out?” Aleema asked. She alleged that the family had recommended doctors, including Dr Asim, Dr Uzma Khan and Dr Barki, for examination at Shifa International Hospital. Still, their names were either rejected, or no response was given. She claimed the family later learned that treatment had been conducted at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) and that they were kept unaware of developments. “We were demanding treatment at Shifa International Hospital. Instead, we were sent to jail when we raised the issue,” she said. She further alleged that pressure was being exerted on government doctors and said the family would no longer communicate concerns in closed-door meetings but would raise them publicly. Aleema also questioned the silence of senior PTI lawyers and office-bearers, naming Hamid Khan, Ali Zafar, Latif Khosa and Barrister Gohar, and asked why they were not actively pursuing the founder’s cases. “Where are the senior lawyers who were given party tickets? The founder repeatedly asked them to get his cases filed,” she said. She claimed that information about meetings and medical arrangements was coming from Naqvi instead of party representatives. “Will we get information from the minister or from our own party?” she asked. Expressing frustration, she remarked that the party appeared “as relaxed as if Imran Khan has been treated,” adding that if anyone could not bear the burden of the PTI founder’s narrative, they should step aside.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistanis, including tourists, travelling to the United Kingdom (UK) will now be able to do so with an e-visa, receiving confirmation by email rather than stickers in passports, according to a statement issued by the British High Commission on Wednesday. In July 2025, the UK government introduced an e-visa system for Pakistanis; however, it was limited to study or work visas. Applicants applying for general visitor visas were still required to obtain a physical visa. In the statement released on Wednesday, the high commission said visitors would continue to submit their applications online and attend a visa application centre to provide biometrics. It said that successful applicants would have a digital record of their immigration status provided through an e-visa, accessible through an online UK Visas and Immigration account. “It means applicants no longer need to attend a visa application centre a second time to collect their passport, instead holding on to it after their biometrics session,” the commission said. It said that e-visas provided a more secure way to manage immigration status and reduce the risk of lost or damaged documents. “Applicants can generate a share code to prove their visa status at borders and elsewhere. There is no change to visa processing times, eligibility criteria or conditions,” it said. The statement also quoted British High Commissioner Jane Marriott as saying that this was a “hugely exciting step” for Pakistanis travelling to the UK. “As well as being able to save time by holding on to your passport, the new share code system makes it easier than ever to demonstrate your visa status,” she said. Separately, in a video message posted on her X account on Wednesday, Marriot said that “nearly all visitors going to the UK can now use the new e-visa service when they travel”. She said that under the new system, travellers will be able to keep their passports with them as they will not be required to hand them in. She added that the “major difference is that you get to keep your passport with you and you no longer need to visit a visa centre for a second time (to pick up your passport)”. She further said that “the process and application timelines have not changed”. In 2024, the UK government had announced that the country’s immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: The Punjab government on Wednesday imposed an “immediate and complete” ban on flying drones outdoors across the province for the next 30 days, citing risk to public safety. In a notification issued by the Punjab home department, available with Dawn , a complete ban on the outside flying of drones was announced under Section 144 (6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, which is to remain in force “for a period of 30 days from the date of issuance or until withdrawn earlier”. However, the notification said that the ban did not apply to “use of small drones for coverage of indoor activities, such as in halls or marquees”. It further added that the ban was also not applicable to “drones used by intelligence and law enforcement agencies”. The home department noted that “credible reports and prevailing circumstances indicate that the increasing and unregulated use of drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) within the territorial limits of Punjab poses potential risks to public safety, security of public and private property and the maintenance of public order”. It added that drone activity also “may cause obstruction to official duties, create law and order concerns, and disturb the peaceful atmosphere of the province”. It termed the ban “essential” in ensuring the “security of the people and installations/buildings against any potential threat or untoward activity, in the larger interest of public safety, security, peace and tranquility and to avoid any untoward incident”. It is worth mentioning that a day earlier, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz approved the launch of an anti-drone unit in Punjab to combat any terrorist attack, besides directing the installation of the latest digital scanners at the province’s entry and exit points.",

      "summary_orig": "A record 129 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide in 2025, the Committee to Protect Journalists said on Wednesday, blaming Israel for two-thirds of the deaths. It was the second consecutive annual record for press deaths and the deadliest year since the CPJ began collecting data more than three decades ago. “Journalists are being killed in record numbers at a time when access to information is more important than ever,” CEO Jodie Ginsberg said in a statement. “We are all at risk when journalists are killed for reporting the news.” Over three-quarters of all the fatalities in 2025 were in conflict settings, the CPJ said in its report. More than 60 per cent of the 86 members of the press killed by Israeli fire in 2025 were Palestinians reporting from Gaza, it added. The Israeli military claims that it never “deliberately targets” journalists. The number of journalists killed in Ukraine and Sudan also increased in 2025 compared to the year before. The CPJ highlighted a rise in drones being used, with 39 cases documented, including 28 killings by Israel in Gaza and five by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Sudan. In Ukraine, four journalists were killed by Russian military drones, the highest annual number of journalist deaths in the war since 15 were killed in 2022. Journalists are increasingly vulnerable due to a persistent culture of impunity, the CPJ said, noting a lack of transparent investigations into killings. In Mexico, six journalists were killed in 2025, and all the cases remain unsolved. The Philippines saw three journalists shot dead. Others were killed following their reporting on corruption, such as a Bangladeshi reporter hacked to death by suspects linked to a fraud ring, according to the CPJ report. Similar organised crime-related deaths were recorded in India and Peru. In Saudi Arabia, prominent columnist Turki al-Jasser was executed by the state after being convicted on several charges that the CPJ likened to “spurious national security and financial crime allegations” used to punish reporters. It was the Gulf state’s first documented killing of a journalist since the 2018 death of Jamal Khashoggi.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump opened the foreign-policy portion of his State of the Union address tonight with a carefully calibrated message on Iran, stating that his “preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy” while warning he would “never” allow Tehran to acquire a nuclear weapon. The formulation, which projected readiness for talks while keeping the option of military force deliberately ambiguous, reflected his broader doctrine of “peace through strength.” US President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US on February 24, 2026. — Reuters Trump argued that a rebuilt US military and higher defence spending by Nato allies had strengthened Washington’s hand. At the same time, he asserted that Iran was developing missiles capable of reaching the United States and complained: “We haven’t heard those secret words (from Iran): ‘We will never have a nuclear weapon.’” He blamed Tehran for pursuing a “sinister nuclear program” and claimed that earlier US strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear weapons capabilities. Trump’s Tuesday night State of the Union address lasted one hour and 47 minutes — the longest before a joint session of Congress in at least six decades, according to the American Presidency Project. US President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on February 24, 2026. —AFP As American television commentators noted, the president turned the annual constitutional ritual into an extended political performance aimed at boosting his approval ratings and energising Republican voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections. Trump also briefly brought South Asia into the address, highlighting his peacemaking role in ending the May 2025 war between Pakistan and India, claiming that his efforts “saved millions” of lives by preventing the conflict from turning nuclear. “Pakistan and India … it would have been a nuclear war. Thirty-five million people, the prime minister of Pakistan said, would have died if not for my involvement,” he declared. Repeating his claim that he had halted eight wars in his first 10 months in office, he snapped at sceptics in the chamber: “Isn’t it funny? Sick people,” while glancing toward those who laughed. Despite weeks of the largest US military buildup in the Middle East in two decades, Trump did not signal whether he was prepared to order a strike on Iran. He waited more than an hour before addressing the issue and avoided any reference to the scale of American deployments in the region, underscoring a speech that, even on foreign policy, largely followed a domestic political script. Trump accused Tehran and its allies of being responsible for roadside bombings that “have killed US service members and civilians.“ He also referred to the killing of General Qasem Soleimani , saying “we took out Soleimani” and that it had a “big impact”. US Representative Al Green, Democratic from Texas, exits as he holds a sign reading “Black people aren’t apes” as US President Donald Trump delivers the State of the Union address in the House Chamber of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, on February 24, 2026. —AFP Within the same sweep of foreign affairs, he hailed what he called a “colossal victory for the security of the United States” in Venezuela and introduced Enrique Marquez, an opposition lawmaker freed from prison after the US abduction of President Nicolás Maduro, telling a relative in the gallery: “I’m pleased to inform you that not only has your uncle been released, but he is here tonight.” The address began with a campaign-style flourish — “Our nation is back: bigger, better, richer, and stronger than ever before!” — and quickly led to a sharply polarised spectacle. People wearing inflatable frog costumes gather near the White House following the “State of the Swamp,” a Democratic-led counter-programming event, and President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address in Washington, DC., US February 25, 2026. —Reuters When Trump asked those who believed “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens” to stand, Republicans rose and applauded for several minutes while Democrats remained seated, prompting him to say: “You should be ashamed of yourselves, not standing up.” Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib repeatedly shouted, “You have killed Americans!” and “You should be ashamed!” as the speech continued, while Al Green was escorted from the chamber earlier after waving a protest sign reading “Black People Aren’t Apes,” an apparent reference to a video Trump had reposted on Truth Social depicting the Obamas as apes. Trump directed much of his gaze toward the Republican side, basking in applause, but as he moved into immigration, crime, election security, and gender issues, he increasingly addressed Democrats directly, saying: “These people are crazy, I’m telling ya, they’re crazy … Democrats are destroying our country, but we’ve stopped it just in the nick of time.” Retired Navy Captain E. Royce Williams acknowledges applause after receiving the Medal of Honor from first lady Melania Trump during U.S. President Trump’s State of the Union address during a Joint Session of Congress at the US Capitol on February 24, 2026, in Washington, DC. —AFP On immigration, he renewed attacks on Somali Americans, referring to “the Somali pirates who ransacked Minnesota” and arguing that “importing these cultures through unrestricted immigration and open borders brings those problems right here to the USA, and it is the American people who pay the price”. On economic policy, he criticised a recent Supreme Court decision against his tariffs as “very unfortunate” and said the duties would remain in place under “fully approved and tested alternative legal statutes,” adding: “Congressional action will not be necessary.” Turning to prices, he blamed Democrats for inflation and told Americans: “Just hold on a little while we’re getting it down, and soon you will see numbers that few people would think were possible to achieve.” He also urged passage of the SAVE America Act , requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration, a measure Democrats have pledged to block in the Senate. At another point, Trump took aim at New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani as the “new communist mayor of New York City,” before adding in a softer aside: “I think he’s a nice guy. Bad policy, but nice guy.” Members of U.S. President Donald Trump’s family (L-R) Tiffany Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, Barron Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the State of the Union address during a Joint Session of Congress at the U.S. Capitol on February 24, 2026. —AFP For much of the evening, the visual tableau — a president speaking almost exclusively to one side of the chamber while the other jeered — mirrored the substance: an address that fused campaign mobilisation at home with selective, carefully timed signals abroad, particularly on Iran, where the decisive choice between diplomacy and force remained conspicuously unstated.",

      "summary_orig": "Muslim and European countries, including Pakistan, on Wednesday condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. A joint statement by Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Brazil, France, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Egypt, Pakistan, Luxembourg, Norway, Palestine, Portugal, Qatar, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Türkiye, United Arab Emirates, the League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation said that recent changes made by Israel to reclaim land in the occupied West Bank as “state property” are “wide-ranging” and accelerate illegal settlement activity and further entrench Israeli administration. Earlier this month, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories. The measures would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory. “These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” said the joint statement, also shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on X. “We are clear that Israel’s illegal settlements, and decisions designed to further them, are a flagrant violation of international law, including previous United Nations Security Council Resolutions and the 2024 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice.” “These latest decisions are part of a clear trajectory that aims to change the reality on the ground and to advance unacceptable de facto annexation,” added the joint statement. The statement, referring to the Trump-brokered Gaza ceasefire and the subsequent 20-point plan for Gaza, said it threatens any meaningful prospect of regional integration. “We call on the Government of Israel to reverse them immediately, to respect its international obligations, and to refrain from actions that would result in permanent changes to the legal and administrative status of the occupied Palestinian Territory,” the statement said further. According to the statement, the decisions made by Tel Aviv follow the “unprecedented acceleration” of Israel’s settlement policy and such actions amount to a “deliberate and direct attack” on the viability of a Palestinian state and the implementation of the Two-State Solution. “In that context, we reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem. We oppose any form of annexation.” The statement called upon Israel to put an end to settler violence and hold those responsible accountable. “We reaffirm our commitment to taking concrete steps, in accordance with international law, to counter the expansion of illegal settlements in Palestinian territory and policies and threats of forcible displacement and annexation.” The nations stressed the importance of preserving, in the holy month of Ramazan, the “historic and legal status quo in Jerusalem and its Holy Sites”, recognising the special role of the historic Hashemite custodianship in this regard. “We condemn repeated violations of the status quo in Jerusalem, which constitute a threat to regional stability.” Earlier, the Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported. Palestinian group Hamas also condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”. Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership.",
