      "summary_orig": "Two US National Guard soldiers were critically wounded on Wednesday after being shot in a brazen daytime attack a few blocks from the White House, with US President Donald Trump terming the incident an “act of terror”. The incident, which left two Guard members critically wounded, was “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror,” Trump said. “It was a crime against our entire nation.” He confirmed that the man taken into custody after the daylight shooting two blocks from the White House was “a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan”. The suspect had arrived in the United States in 2021 “on those infamous flights,” Trump said, referring to the evacuations of Afghans fleeing as the Taliban took over the country in the wake of the US retreat after 20 years of war. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan” under former president Joe Biden, Trump said. “We must take all necessary measures to endure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country if they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.” Later, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it had stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely. “The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission,” the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a post on X. ‘Targeted shooting’ Trump was in Florida at the time of the attack, which prompted the White House to go into lockdown as law enforcement from multiple federal and city agencies swarmed the area. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called it “a targeted shooting” by a single assailant. “That individual has been taken into custody,” she said. The shooting occurred around 2:15 pm local time, when the two soldiers — a man and a woman — were conducting what authorities described as a “high-visibility patrol”. According to DC Police Executive Assistant Chief Jeffrey Carroll, the attacker rounded a corner, raised a firearm, and “ambushed these members of the National Guard” without warning. Both soldiers were struck multiple times and rushed to local trauma centers, where they remain in critical condition. The suspect was also injured during the encounter. Carroll said investigators were still working to determine whose gunfire wounded him, but confirmed that there were no additional suspects and no ongoing threat. By evening, multiple law enforcement officials told CNN , ABC News and other outlets that the FBI believed it had identified the man in custody. Fingerprints taken at the hospital produced an initial match to a man from Washington state who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan in August 2021. The New York Times , citing people familiar with the investigation, identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, though none of the agencies involved had released the name publicly. Senior counterterrorism officials confirmed to ABC News that the FBI was examining the shooting as a possible act of international terrorism, and investigators were looking into whether the attack may have been inspired by a foreign militant group. Authorities stressed, however, that no motive had been established. Trump was the first to announce the incident publicly, writing on social media that “the animal that shot the two National Guardsmen” was also severely wounded and would “pay a very steep price”. He praised the National Guard and federal law-enforcement agencies as “truly great people”. Following the shooting, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said the president directed him to deploy an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington “immediately,” saying: “This happened just steps away from the White House. It will not stand.” A brief security lockdown was also imposed at the White House as the situation unfolded, though Trump was not in the capital at the time. “The president has been briefed,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Confusion briefly erupted when West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued — then retracted — a statement saying the two soldiers had died. His office later said the information was based on “early and conflicting reports”. Unease within Muslim communities The attack also triggered unease within Muslim communities in the US after NBC News initially reported that the FBI was treating the incident as a possible act of terrorism and that the suspect was “initially identified as an Afghan national”. “We hope this report is incorrect,” a Muslim political commentator, who declined to be named, told Dawn . “If it turns out to be true, it may trigger a strong backlash against Muslim communities across the United States.” Civil-rights groups also issued statements urging caution and warning against speculation before authorities confirmed the identity and motive. Law enforcement agencies echoed that sentiment. “The nature of the investigation may change as more information emerges,” one federal official said, emphasising that the FBI had not yet reached any definitive conclusion. National Guard personnel from several Republican-led states, including West Virginia, have been deployed in Washington since August, when Trump expanded an earlier mission aimed at combating street crime and supporting immigration enforcement initiatives. The soldiers shot on Wednesday were part of that deployment.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi on Wednesday said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had decided that its members of the national and provincial assemblies and the Senate would hold a peaceful protest outside the Islamabad High Court every Tuesday for delays in the hearing of cases against incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife. “After the peaceful protest outside the Islamabad High Court until 1pm, lawmakers will march on Adiala Jail [in Rawalpindi] along with Mr Imran’s sisters and sit outside the jail,” Mr Afridi told PTI workers during a ceremony held here to “pay tribute to the PTI workers martyred on Nov 26, 2024” in the provincial capital. He requested PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja to ensure the presence of all party members of the national and provincial assemblies and the Senate outside the high court on Tuesdays. The chief minister also urged party workers to “ensure their elected representatives are present at the protest.” “Wherever you [workers] are, make sure all your respective MNAs and MPAs are present at the peaceful protest. We’ll shame absent lawmakers afterward,” he said. The chief minister said that those, who won elections in the name of the incarcerated prime minister Imran Khan to become parliamentarians, would protest to ensure justice is dispensed to the leader facing torture in the jail. He said the party’s peaceful movement for the release of Mr Imran would continue and he himself would visit Adiala Jail on every Thursday until he met the detained leader. Mr Afridi announced that a political gathering would be held in the provincial capital on December 7. He said that Nov 26 was a painful day for PTI as its peaceful workers were fired at, martyred and wounded at D-Chowk in Islamabad. The chief minister also complained that the police fired at and killed TLP workers in Punjab’s Muridke town. “It’s a message for the entire country as powers-that-be want nobody to raise voice for rights. They do not want the supremacy of the Constitution, restoration of an independent judiciary and media,” he said. Mr Afridi claimed that the PTI chief was illegally behind bars for over 850 days, just for the sake of the people’s rights. He said that Mr Imran was waiting for people to do justice with him. “The courts were paralysed through the 26th Constitutional Amendment and the rest was done in the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Now, the 28th Constitutional Amendment is in the works and it will be followed by the 29th Constitutional Amendment,” he said. The chief minister said the PTI would continue the struggle for the release of its jailed activists and the people’s rights as allowed by the law and the Constitution. He said certain quarters wanted PTI to break the law for a crackdown, but that won’t happen. Mr Afridi said that PTI protesters remained peaceful on May 9 and Nov 26 and would remain peaceful in the future as well but would never compromise on rights. He said that party workers offered sacrifices, which wouldn’t go to waste. Published in Dawn, November 27th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "THE presidency announced that a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels and halt deforestation would be presented at COP31.—AFP/file • No mention of fossil fuel phase-out in final text • Vague promises for adaptation fund prompt call for reform • Multilateral process ‘being held hostage’, critics warn THE script played out at COP30 in Belem was no different from that of previous climate conferences — some delegates left the venue with mixed feelings, while others were outright disappointed. The conference, held in the Bra­z­i­l­ian city on the edge of the Amazon, overran its schedule and ended on Saturday, a day after its planned close. One of the outcomes at this so-called implementation COP was a cause for celebration, particularly the just transition mechanism “to enhance international coo­­peration, technical assistance, capacity-building and knowledge-sharing, and enable equitable, inclusive just transitions”. This agreement, widely celebrated by civil society as a “historic victory for people power”, came after days of protests and intense negotiations. “This outcome didn’t fall from the sky; it was carved out through struggle, persistence and the moral clarity of those living on the frontlines of climate breakdown,” said Tasneem Essop, executive director at the Climate Action Network International. “Governments must now honour this Just Transition mechanism with real action. Anything less is a betrayal of people, and of the Paris (agreement) promise,” she said. However, adaptation finance for vulnerable communities left much to be desired. The conference was supposed to reach an agreement to triple adaptation finance to $120 billion by 2030. However, the ‘mutirao’ decision — a Portuguese term for “collective efforts” — calls for efforts to “at least triple adaptation finance by 2035” without setting a baseline target, a move that does not match the level of ambition demanded by the developing countries and the civil society groups. “The refusal to commit to scaling up finance to the necessary $300 billion annually for adaptation leaves the unprepared defenceless against inevitable ruin,” said Harjeet Singh, strategic adviser at the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative. “By failing on their past commitment to double adaptation finance (to $40 billion) by 2025 and keeping the baseline of the new target vague, developed nations have attempted to diluted their responsibility, forcing the world’s most vulnerable to face the rising waters with empty hands,” he said. Fossil fuel phase-out The worst outcome was the fossil fuel phase-out, which did not even get a mention in the COP agreement despite robust support from more than 80 countries. Instead, the COP presidency announced that a roadmap to transition away from fossil fuels and halt deforestation would be presented at the next climate conference, ie COP31. The roadmap will be guided by a conference in Santa Marta in April to be co-hosted by Colombia and the Netherlands, according to Carbon Brief. COP31 will be held in Turkiye, with Australia as its president. According to CAN International, the decision to ignore the harmful impacts of fossil fuels was deeply disappointing. “Given that oil, coal and gas remain the root cause of climate breakdown, this omission represents a severe failure for COP30,” it said in a statement. Tracy Carty of Greenpeace International said the negotiations were derailed by inadequate climate finance, weak leadership from G20 nations, particularly the developed ones, and the heavy hand of fossil fuel interests. Like fossil fuels, the finance outcome was also dismal. In the absence of the US and the European Union’s focus on defence, it seems the responsibility for saving the planet has fallen to China and the developing world, said Dr Abid Suleri of the Islamabad-based Sustainable Devel­opment Policy Institute, about the reluctance of rich nations to pay for loss and damage. Calls for reform The presence of fossil fuel lobbyists and a dilute outcome also brought the wider UNFCCC process under scrutiny. Still, some hailed the mutirao text as a win for multilateralism. “COP30 has proven that the current consensus model has become a veto for vandals. We are trying to put out a planetary fire, but the UN rules allow the arsonists — the petrostates and their 1,600 lobbyists — to stand in the doorway and block the fire trucks,” Mr Singh told Dawn. He said the ‘consensus’ becomes a synonym for capitulation if a handful of countries, like Saudi Arabia and Russia, can simply erase the mention of the fossil fuel phase-out from the final text. “The multilateral process is alive, but it is being held hostage,” he added. Erika Lennon, senior attorney at the Centre for International Env­i­r­onmental Law, also called for reforms in the UN process. “Petrostates and industry lobbyists use the consensus rule to block action and ambition. We now need to reform the UNFCCC so the global majority can act, starting with conflict of interest rules and allowing majority voting,” she said. Dr Suleri agreed. He said the “polarised” conference ended in a compromise despite tall claims at the outset. “President Lula called COP30 the COP of truth; the truth, however, is hard to ignore. This COP still lacks both the money and the ambition needed to match the promises made at the start,” he added. The conference also launched the Declaration on Information Integrity on Climate Change, which establishes shared international commitments to address climate disinformation and promote accurate, evidence-based information on climate issues. This initiative aims to mobilise resources to fund research projects and investigative journalism ideas that can produce evidence in a coordinated manner, offering more inputs for better climate policies, said the Unesco Division for Digital Inclusion and Policies and Digital Transformation Director Guil­herme Canela in an email to Dawn .

      "summary_orig": "WITH the Pakistani state hardening its position against the Afghan Taliban, and the Kabul regime accusing this country of bombing its territory, the already limited space for a negotiated, peaceful settlement with Afghanistan is closing fast. On Tuesday, the Taliban said that Pakistan had bombed several Afghan provinces, allegedly causing civilian casualties. The state swiftly denied these accusations, with the military spokesperson saying Pakistan had not attacked Afghan civilians, and adding that this country announces its strikes. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who also denied hitting Afghan civilians, was blunt in his criticism of the Taliban. He said Pakistan had “no good hope from them” while noting that it would be “idiocy” to trust Kabul’s current rulers. Despite the Afghan claims, the ceasefire reached between both states last month is holding , and it is hoped matters do not escalate further. There can be little argument with the official demand that the Taliban stop TTP and other terrorists based in Afghanistan from attacking Pakistan; the state must remain vigilant to prevent violent actors from carrying out attacks in the country. But combative rhetoric and exchanges of fire between the two countries is hardly in anyone’s interest; if matters deteriorate further, it would result in a permanently hostile state on Pakistan’s western border at a time when the situation on the eastern frontier, too, is unsettled. Islamabad’s growing rift with Kabul calls for greater diplomatic efforts by this country. While Pakistan in 2021 had hailed the Taliban’s recapture of Kabul, today the government feels that it is useless to talk to them. True, the Taliban’s obduracy and denialism cannot be put aside. But Pakistani officialdom’s at times strong commentary can further alienate ordinary Afghans, undermining whatever remains of the goodwill built after decades of hosting Afghan refugees, for example. Moreover, strikes inside Afghanistan have failed to deter the TTP, as the banned terrorist outfit is getting more brazen in its attacks. It is also worth considering that closing channels with Kabul is pushing the Taliban further into the Indian embrace, which presents a fresh strategic dilemma for Pakistan. The Taliban are difficult customers, but ‘writing them off’ will not help. In the long term, it is primarily diplomacy, as well as collective regional pressure, that can address the issue of cross-border terrorism, and restore harmony to the Pak-Afghan relationship.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Wednesday declared former opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan a proclaimed offender over his repeated non-appearance in proceedings related to an October 4 protest case. During the hearing, Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra noted that despite multiple summons, Omar Ayub failed to appear before the court, prompting the judge to invoke proclamation proceedings. The court also sought complete details of his movable and immovable properties and issued directions to block his passport and Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC). The case concerns a PTI demonstration held last year, for which Mr Ayub and other senior party figures have been nominated under anti-terrorism charges. Defence, prosecution clash after Aleema Khan briefly detained for attempting to leave courtroom Earlier this year, prosecutors submitted a challan formally naming several top PTI leaders, accusing them of inciting violence and causing disruption during the protest. The court adjourned further hearings while ordering officials to complete the requirements associated with the proclamation process. Aleema briefly in custody Separately in Rawalpindi, proceedings in a different protest-related case took an unexpected turn when Aleema Khan, sister of former prime minister Imran Khan, was briefly detained by women police officers inside an Anti-Terrorism Court. Aleema, one of 11 charged with arson and obstructing government operations during a protest on 26 November last year, appeared before ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah. At the outset of the hearing, the court was informed that lawyers would be arguing on an application filed by an accused named Safai regarding the jurisdiction of the ATC over the matter. The court noted that 11 accused, including Aleema Khan, had already been indicted in the case. Prosecutor Zaheer Shah informed the court that the accused were facing charges under terrorism-related laws due to allegations of arson and encirclement during last year’s protest. During the hearing, Aleema Khan attempted to exit the courtroom. “Our lawyers are busy in the Supreme Court, we should be allowed to go,” she said. Women police officers, however, intercepted her and brought her back inside. Prosecutor Zaheer Shah insisted that the accused was “in judicial custody under Section 351” and therefore could not leave without the judge’s explicit permission. Defence lawyer Faisal Malik strongly objected, arguing that Aleema Khan had voluntarily surrendered before the court and that there was “no order to take her into custody”. He termed the police action “unacceptable” and urged the court to initiate proceedings against the officers involved. The judge, responding to the defence protests, remarked, “If you had come on time, this might not have happened”. The courtroom witnessed heated exchanges as the prosecution maintained that the accused and her lawyers were creating hurdles in the trial. Prosecutor Zaheer Shah added that eight police witnesses were present in court despite their official duties and that unnecessary delays were obstructing proceedings. Following arguments, the court allowed Aleema Khan to proceed with filing her bail bonds. Additionally, the court ordered the accused to pay Rs 10,000 each to the eight police witnesses, citing the inconvenience caused by repeated adjournment requests. During the proceedings, defence lawyers also requested that the court direct authorities to unfreeze the bank accounts of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust and Namal University, Mianwali. The prosecutor, Zaheer Shah, responded sharply. “We regret that Shaukat Khanum’s account had to be frozen due to the irresponsible behaviour of the accused,” he said. In a brief interaction with the judge, Aleema Khan said she had faith in the court and believed justice would prevail. After hearing arguments, the court accepted the defence’s request and adjourned the hearing until Dec 1. Published in Dawn, November 27th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Turkey unveiled dozens of new finds at a major archaeological site in southeast Turkey on Wednesday, giving fresh insight into an area seen as showing humanity’s transition from hunter-gatherers to settled societies more than 11,000 years ago. On a plateau overlooking the fertile plains of what is often called the “cradle of civilisation”, the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gobeklitepe and nearby Karahantepe are transforming archaeologists’ understanding of prehistoric times. Among the latest finds in Sanliurfa province is a statue with a facial expression reminiscent of a deceased individual. Archaeologists said it was a unique discovery in terms of death rituals and symbolic expression among Neolithic communities. People walk at the Karahantepe excavation site, widely regarded with Gobeklitepe as keys to understanding the birth of symbolic thought, social complexity and monumental architecture thousands of years before cities or states existed, near the southeastern city of Sanliurfa, Turkey. —Reuters It was one of some 30 artefacts revealed on Wednesday, including human and animal statues, figurines, vessels, plates, necklaces and beads including a human-shaped one. “What makes these archaeological sites unique is the way they reshape our knowledge of Neolithic history, as well as the transition to settled life,” Culture and Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy told Reuters. He said the sites, which Turkey has dubbed the Stone Mounds project, show that humanity had a far higher level of consciousness in terms of belief, rituals, social organisation and cultural production than previously assumed. Gobeklitepe is expected to attract around 800,000 visitors this year, he said, illustrating the growing recognition of the site’s importance. The ministry-led project encompasses 12 Neolithic sites of settled communities in Sanliurfa dating back to 9,500 BC, with Gobeklitepe and Karahantepe featuring the world’s oldest structures used for gathering and performance rituals. A drone view of a Karahantepe excavation site, widely regarded with Gobeklitepe as keys to understanding the birth of symbolic thought, social complexity and monumental architecture thousands of years before cities or states existed, near the southeastern city of Sanliurfa, Turkey. —Reuters Among the most striking features at the sites are oval-shaped monumental structures up to 28 metres in diameter surrounded with T-shaped limestone pillars, regarded as representations of humans, with reliefs of animals depicted on some of them. Archaeologists say one recent excavation at Karahantepe uncovered a T-shaped pillar with a human face, representing the first known depiction of a human face on such a pillar. “From nutrition to architecture, from the symbolic world to the rituals, the vast diversity of evidence obtained here bring us incredibly close to prehistoric societies,” said Necmi Karul, the head of excavations, describing the builders of the structures as skilled craftsmen. He said that until recently it was assumed that settled life started with agriculture and animal husbandry but the project indicated that these people were still hunter-gatherers but had become settled.",

Archaeologists say one recent excavation at Karahantepe uncovered a T-shaped pillar with a human face, representing the first known depiction of a human face on such a pillar. “From nutrition to architecture, from the symbolic world to the rituals, the vast diversity of evidence obtained here bring us incredibly close to prehistoric societies,” said Necmi Karul, the head of excavations, describing the builders of the structures as skilled craftsmen. He said that until recently it was assumed that settled life started with agriculture and animal husbandry but the project indicated that these people were still hunter-gatherers but had become settled.",

      "summary_orig": "The Chief Minister of India-occupied Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, on Wednesday assailed the use of religion as a criterion for student admissions at the territory’s Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Institute of Medical Excellence, according to Kashmiri media. According to the Kashmir Media Service (KMS), the institute was sanctioned 50 MBBS seats for the current academic year. Of the 50 seats, 42 were allotted to Muslim students based on merit, sparking protests from right-wing Hindu groups and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who said Hindu students should be prioritised as the institution’s funding came from donations to the Mata Vaishno Devi shrine. Speaking at the golden jubilee programme of Jamia Ziaul Uloom institute in Poonch, Abdullah said that Constitution Day “should not be reduced to a symbolic observance”. “Today, Constitution Day is being celebrated. The meaning of Constitution Day is not that we remember the Constitution for an hour … its meaning is that every day of the year, we must keep it alive,” Abdullah was quoted as saying by the Kashmir Observer . The chief executive of the occupied territory noted that the Indian constitution’s preamble grants equal status to all religions, ensures democratic rights for every citizen and guarantees protection under the law, according to the Observer’s report. It added that he expressed concern that the country was witnessing a trend where even educational institutions were being viewed through a communal lens. “Today, in one of the medical colleges, it is being said that Muslims and non-Hindus should not study here. If we set aside merit and start making decisions on the basis of religion, then where will the Constitution go?” he was quoted as saying about the rejection of the student list. On Monday, Abdullah said that when the bill to establish the university was passed, there was no mention of people being excluded from admissions based on their religion. “Where was it written?” he asked the press. “It was said that admissions will be based on merit and not religion. When admission is granted based on merit, then some people don’t like that. If they are not in favour, then they can approach the Supreme Court.” He added that admissions cannot be decided without merit and said that admitting students based on religion would violate the Indian constitution. “Will social welfare schemes be handled based on religion?” He asked. “Will ration shops ask about [the customer’s] religion? Will policemen work based on religion? “Right now, secularism remains a key part of our constitution. If you do not want to keep the nation secular, then remove that from the constitution,” he added. “You (BJP) do what you will, we’ll do what we will.” In response to a question, Abdullah reiterated, “When students will be granted admission, it will be on merit. Some students will excel, while others will be left behind. It’s nobody’s fault.” In another press talk on Tuesday, the CM said that when the college was being built, it should have been classified as a “minority institute” in order to allow admission to any one religious group. “Admissions are based on NEET (National Eligibility Entrance Test) and entrance tests, not on religion,” he reiterated. “If you don’t want Muslims to study here, then declare it a minority institute. They’ll get admission elsewhere … they’ll go to Bangladesh or Turkiye. “But, if you point the finger at Muslims and call them communal, sectarian and don’t tolerate their children, then remember this situation,” he added. “When children are ready to attend an institution like Mata Vaishno Devi, they are not concerned about the name or where the funding comes from; they want to study and become doctors,” the CM said. “Now you want them to be denied admission based on their religion.”",

      "summary_orig": "A protest and sit-in against the disappearance of a Baloch student entered its third day at Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) on Wednesday, bringing all academic activities to a halt. A protest camp was established by the Baloch Students Council (BSC) against the enforced disappearance of a sixth-semester student, Saeedullah Baloch. The BSC students had earlier reached out to students from other councils and groups to join the camp. However, fearing a larger protest campaign, the administration of QAU suspended all academic activities at the varsity. The BSC students participating in the sit-in remained wary of certain consequences and declined to disclose their names to the media. However, speakers at the protest camp said they had remained firm in their stance for the past three days and refused to remain silent. They added that these three days have shown that students cannot be intimidated when justice is denied. Mohammad Azam, brother of missing Saeedullah, said that the protest camp has become more than a protest site; it is a symbol of collective resilience. “With every hour that passes, our message grows louder, we will not accept enforced disappearances, we will not accept fear, and we will not walk away until our voices are heard,” he added. There was no official reply from the QAU administration over the situation and the continued suspension of studies on campus. However, a senior QAU official said the administration had reached out to the BSC, offering assistance and requesting that they not establish a protest camp over the enforced disappearance “But they flatly refused because the (varsity) administration was not in a position to offer any help, secondly, the BSC maintained that the protest camp was not a political activity but a demand for the recovery of a student of the university,” the official added. Saeedullah Baloch was a student of the Defence and Strategic Studies (DSS) department. The speakers at the camp highlighted that Saeedullah was forcibly taken away by unknown men in civil dress on July 8, 2025, between 7 and 7.30pm, from the Islamabad toll plaza when he and his friend were travelling to Quetta on a public bus. The protestors added that the abductors were accompanied by officials of law enforcement, and they offloaded the two from the bus. While Saeedullah’s friend was allowed to proceed on the same bus, he was taken away. The speakers, who preferred not to be named in the media, said that they were students, but they were also witnesses to illegal acts by the authorities. In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said. In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament held the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.",

In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament held the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.",

      "summary_orig": "Thousands of trade union workers across India protested on Wednesday against the government’s rollout of new labour codes , saying they would lead to corporate exploitation and erode their hard-won rights. The world’s fifth-largest economy last week implemented long-awaited labour laws that will replace colonial-era legislation and simplify a maze of confusing regulations. The overhaul consolidates 29 existing labour laws into four key codes, with the number of rules being cut from more than 1,400 to about 350, but unions say the reforms will hurt workers’ rights. Gautam Mody from the New Trade Union Initiative said workers from across all sectors were protesting on Wednesday outside factories and in many city centres. “Workers have been blindsided by the government,” he told AFP . “We want fairness, justice and equity before the law, which are being denied under the new codes.” Workers cut wooden logs using a machine at a warehouse in Varanasi, India on November 26. — AFP While the new regulations boost safety standards and mandate guaranteed social security benefits for gig workers, they also allow for longer factory shifts, make it tougher for workers to conduct strikes and easier for medium-sized firms to fire employees. A controversial key provision raises the threshold for firms that needed prior government permission for layoffs from 100 to 300 workers, which means companies with up to 300 employees can retrench staff without any approval. ‘Deceptive fraud’ The move has sparked worry among trade unions, aligned with parties opposed to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who have called it a “deceptive fraud” against the nation’s working people. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) said in a statement that the government wanted to portray these codes as “pro-worker” and “modernising”. But “in reality they constitute the most sweeping and aggressive abrogation of workers’ hard-won rights and entitlements since Independence, aimed at facilitating corporate exploitation, contractualisation and unrestrained hire-and-fire”. Modi has said the overhaul represented an opportunity to eliminate compliance-intensive labour laws, often seen as preventing the Indian economy from wooing foreign investors. He has described the changes as “one of the most comprehensive and progressive labour-oriented reforms since Independence.” Trade union members of the Communist Party of India stand beside party flags during a protest against the government’s new labour laws in Kolkata, India on November 26, 2025. — AFP India remains the world’s fastest-growing major economy , but a slowdown over the last year has left it short of the 8 per cent growth rate that most economists say is needed to create millions of well-paying jobs for its people. US President Donald Trump’s tariff blitz , partly sparked by the White House’s anger over New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, has also clouded the country’s economic outlook and raised questions over its energy security. Analysts at Nomura said in a recent note that the labour law reform was an “attempt to modernise disparate, arcane and compliance-intensive labour laws” that have emerged as one of the “major challenges to the ease of doing business”. But they added it was “part of a broader trend by the government to hasten economic reforms, especially in the wake of the 50pc Trump tariffs”.",

According to Sam Blewett and Bethany Dawson in their London Playbook briefing for Politico, the main candidates to replace him are Michael Forsyth, a rightwing Scottish secretary in the final two years of the John Major government, and Deborah Bull, a crossbencher and former Royal Opera House creative director. They reports: Labour isn’t expected to put forward a candidate as McFall’s previous political affiliation means it’s seen as another party’s turn to rule the roost, Noah [Keate] writes in to say. Forsyth has garnered support from some Labour grandees who like his traditional approach and aversion to modernization while Bull has being promoted by some female peers keen for a woman to take charge. One Tory peer described Forsyth as a “political animal” who may struggle to encourage a consensus across the chamber. A list of candidates’ register of interests and election addresses (up to 300 words) will be emailed to all peers on Dec. 1. Watch your inboxes! Transport secretary Heidi Alexander rejected a rival proposal from Arora Group, saying Heathrow’s own plans were “the most credible and deliverable option”. The Heathrow proposals involve building a 3,500-metre runway and require a new M25 tunnel and bridges to be built 130 metres west of the existing motorway. Following a comparative assessment of the remaining proposals for Heathrow expansion, the government’s view is that the Northwest runway scheme brought forward by Heathrow Airport Limited offers the most credible and deliverable option, principally due to the relative maturity of its proposal, the comparative level of confidence in the feasibility and resilience of its surface access plans, and the stronger comfort it provides in relation to the efficient, resilient and sustainable operations of the airport over the long-term.
