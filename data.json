      "title_orig": "UAE rebuffs Saudi accusations of shipping weapons to Yemen separatists as tensions flare between Gulf neighbours",
      "summary_orig": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Tuesday rejected Saudi Arabia’s accusations that it supplied weapons to a Yemeni separatist faction amid rising tensions between the two Gulf monarchies. “The shipment in question did not contain any weapons, and the vehicles unloaded were not intended for any Yemeni party,” said the UAE. Saudi Arabia also declared a UAE-backed separatist advance in Yemen a threat to the kingdom’s national security and called Abu Dhabi’s actions “highly dangerous”, as the rivalry between the Gulf monarchies boiled over into an open dispute. The strongly worded foreign ministry statement came hours after the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it had struck a United Arab Emirates weapons shipment destined for separatist forces. “The steps taken by the UAE are considered highly dangerous,” it said, adding “the Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat”. In recent weeks, separatists backed by the UAE, seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen, have made sweeping territorial gains in a lightning offensive. Experts say their successes have embarrassed Saudi Arabia, a regional heavyweight and the main backer of the internationally recognised Yemeni government. “Given the danger and escalation posed by these weapons… the coalition air forces carried out a limited military operation this morning targeting weapons and combat vehicles that had been unloaded from the two ships at the port of Al-Mukalla,” the alliance said, according to the Saudi state news agency. AFP footage of the port showed dozens of parked military vehicles and pick-ups, several of which were burnt out and smouldering as workers hosed them down. After the strikes, the leader of Yemen’s presidential council, which sits atop the Aden-based government, declared a state of emergency and cancelled a security pact with Abu Dhabi after the forces of the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized swaths of territory. The STC is also a key member of the government - a fractious patchwork of groups held together by its opposition to the Houthi rebels who control swaths of northern and western Yemen including the capital Sanaa. ‘A red line’ Saudi Arabia and the UAE - traditionally close allies who joined forces against the Houthis - have increasingly been at odds over the conflict as well as the war in Sudan. “The Kingdom expresses its disappointment by the actions taken by the brotherly United Arab Emirates, pressuring the Southern Transitional Council’s forces to conduct military operations on the southern border of the Kingdom,” the Saudi foreign ministry statement said. It called them “a threat to the Kingdom’s national security, as well as to security and stability in the Republic of Yemen and the region,” it said. Abu Dhabi denied that it was behind the separatist offensive, saying it “condemns the claims made regarding the exertion of pressure or direction on any Yemeni party to carry out military operations that affect the security of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”. A source close to the Saudi military coalition told AFP on Tuesday after the strikes that a diplomatic solution remained on the table. “The coalition was forced to do that. All diplomacy efforts met deaf ears,” said the source. “Diplomacy is still an option to stop any further escalation.” 24-hour deadline Riyadh also backed a demand from Yemen’s presidential council for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country within 24 hours, and urged Abu Dhabi to cut off military and financial support for Yemeni groups. Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, issued decrees on Tuesday announcing a 90-day state of emergency and annulling a security pact with the UAE over the separatists’ advance. The STC members of the council later rejected the decision, saying the move threatened to “drag Yemen into new confrontations”. Following the strikes, broadcasters in Saudi Arabia aired segments showing surveillance footage of the alleged Emirati ships delivering the combat equipment to the port of Mukalla in southern Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition said the ships had arrived from the UAE port of Fujairah, adding that the operation was conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law and without causing collateral damage. An official at the port said they had received an evacuation warning. ‘Unacceptable to God’ Abdullah Bazuhair, whose home overlooks the port, showed AFP the damage to his property, with windows blasted clear out of the walls and glass strewn across the floor. The strikes were “unacceptable to God” he said, adding “the children were terrified and the women frightened”. The Saudi-led coalition had warned that it would back Yemen’s government in any military confrontation with separatist forces and urged them to withdraw from recently seized territories in Hadramawt and Mahra governorates. Tuesday’s strike came days after reported Saudi air raids on separatist positions in resource-rich Hadramawt last week. A Yemeni military official said on Friday that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were massed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States Embassy in India on Tuesday warned Indian nationals of “significant criminal penalties” for illegally migrating to the US and breaking its laws. Relations between Washington and New Delhi have become strained over the course of the year, due to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between the two South Asian rivals. In a post on X, the US Embassy posted a message reading, “If you break US law, you will be punished with significant criminal penalties. The Trump Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration to the United States and protecting our nation’s borders and our citizens.” Neither the US State Department nor US missions in Pakistan or other nations, including Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar or China, have issued similar warnings. Since taking office in January this year, Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration in the US, rolling out policies and enacting mass deportations through 2025. In February, a US military aircraft carried 104 deported Indians and landed in Amritsar. Although illegal Indian immigrants have been deported home by previous US administrations, it was the first time Washington used a military aircraft for the purpose. In addition to deportations, Washington has made it harder for immigrants to obtain visas. In September, Trump ordered a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled worker visas. H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years, but extendable to six years. India’s foreign ministry said that the Trump administration’s move to increase H1-B visa fees was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy. Similarly, India’s leading trade body Nasscom said the timeline for implementing the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas for high-tech workers in the United States was a “concern”. Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump’s administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft. Around 16,000 of the visa revocations were tied to cases of driving under the influence, while about 12,000 were for assault and another 8,000 for theft. “These three crimes accounted for almost half of revocations this year,” said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. In August, a State Department spokesperson said Washington had revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small number for “support for terrorism”.",

      "summary_orig": "In the hinterlands of Australia’s historic goldfields, Vicki Plumridge jumps for joy when she digs a small golden nugget out of the earth. The retired retail worker was learning how to use her new metal detector when it started bleeping by the moss-covered ruins of a building. After Plumridge dug the nugget out of the shallow dirt with a plastic trowel, a guide estimated it was around 0.2 of a gram of gold, worth about $40 Australian Dollar ($26.58). “But to me, it’s worth a million dollars,” said the 63-year-old, who had bought the detector only a few days before. “My heart is singing.” Vicki Plumridge, 63, a retired retail worker, reacts as Peter Vanjek, 65, a Gold and Relics prospecting tour guide, tells her she has found a small gold nugget during a Gold and Relics metal detector training session in Mount Doran, Australia, November 29, 2025. —  REUTERS Plumridge’s story is becoming more common, as hobbyists flock to Australia’s 9,600 sq km “golden triangle” in the heart of Victoria state, known as one of the world’s most prospective regions for gold nuggets. Prospectors have been spurred on by record gold prices, social media, the success of TV show Aussie Gold Hunters, and a love for the outdoors, according to Reuters interviews with a dozen gold hunters. Plumridge’s detector, Minelab’s Gold Monster 2000, which she bought for Australian Dollar $2,999, sold out across the country within weeks of its October 20 launch, according to Leanne Kamp, joint owner of Lucky Strike Gold, a prospecting shop in Geelong. Damian Duke, 39, who works in construction, sifts through a scoop of soil during a Gold and Relics metal detector training session in Mount Doran, Australia, November 29, 2025. —  REUTERS “It’s a great price point, and we have seen a big jump in sales this year, partly because the gold price has got everyone’s interest,” said Kamp, who has led prospecting tours since 2007. “We get a lot of internationals. Next week we have some Germans coming. Germans love the gold. The Swiss seem to love the gold too. And we have some coming over from the US,” she said. The chance of finding nuggets on historic sites improves with each iteration of detectors, which is why there is a rush for new models as soon as they are released, she added. World’s biggest nuggets Hobbyists have flocked to 19th-century gold rush towns like Ballarat, which laid the foundation for Melbourne’s early wealth and helped make Australia one of the world’s top three gold producers. People enter a gold mine tour at Sovereign Hill, an outdoor living museum set in the Gold Rush era, in Ballarat, Australia, November 30, 2025. — REUTERS The region has yielded the world’s biggest nugget, the Welcome Stranger at 72kg, found in the 1860s, as well as the Hand of Faith, the largest nugget found with a metal detector at 27.2kg in 1980. As recently as February 2023, an amateur prospector unearthed a 4.6kg nugget in the region with a detector, according to the state government. The lure of large nuggets is one of the draws for Damian Duke, 39, who works in construction. Duke used to go prospecting with his father, who died three years ago. Now he takes his own son, Ethan. People take a horse‑drawn coach ride through Sovereign Hill, an outdoor living museum depicting the Gold Rush era, in Ballarat, Australia, November 30, 2025. — REUTERS The 11-year-old inherited his grandfather’s detector, and Duke has recently upgraded his machine, he told Reuters. “Where prices are now, you do have the chance of striking a life-changing piece of gold,“ he said. Gold has chalked up successive records this year, surging above $4,500 a troy ounce on Friday. Goldman Sachs expects prices to reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, with further gains likely if private investors continue diversifying their portfolios amid geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty. Global Phenomenon In Victoria, fossickers must buy a permit from the state government. The permit allows them to fossick using only hand tools and to keep any gold they find. Demand for the miner’s right permits, which cost Australian Dollar $28.60 each and last for a decade, has hit all-time highs, at almost 16,000 by November, from nearly 11,000 last year, according to figures from Victoria’s Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action, supplied exclusively to Reuters. In total, there are more than 100,000 active miners’ right permits in Victoria. Darren Gregoire, 62, holds a scoop of soil closer to the metal detector during a gold-prospecting tour in Maryborough, Australia, November 28, 2025. — REUTERS A dream of riches may drive people to get out, but they stay out because of the psychological benefits that come from the focus on the hunt, being outside in nature, and connecting with others, prospectors said. “It’s really good for your mental health, being out here. You take it all in, you can’t think about anything else - I love looking at all the wildflowers,” said Kelly Smith, a 50-year-old from the country town of Koondrook, who was prospecting with her partner on a training session organised by The Gold Centre in Maryborough. “You’re not guaranteed to find anything. But you’re not going to find anything at all if you don’t look.” Victoria’s latest gold rush is part of a broader phenomenon, said Ben Harvey, executive general manager of Minelab at Adelaide-headquartered Codan, which is the world’s largest maker of hand-held metal detectors. A child pans for gold at Sovereign Hill living museum in Ballarat, Australia, November 30, 2025. — REUTERS Alongside Codan’s communications division, strong detector sales in its home market of Australia, as well as in Africa and the Americas, have helped double the firm’s share price this year. In Africa, demand may be led by artisanal miners working in cooperatives to improve their standard of living, Harvey said. In Latin America, there is also recreational interest from hobbyists searching for coins and other treasures, he told Reuters in an interview. Behind the success is a push by Codan’s team of engineers to improve technology to cut down on background noise so detectorists can focus on the gold, he said. “What a prospector is looking for is, when they go out, they want to find gold, and they want to find more gold than they found last time,” he said.",

You take it all in, you can’t think about anything else - I love looking at all the wildflowers,” said Kelly Smith, a 50-year-old from the country town of Koondrook, who was prospecting with her partner on a training session organised by The Gold Centre in Maryborough. “You’re not guaranteed to find anything. But you’re not going to find anything at all if you don’t look.” Victoria’s latest gold rush is part of a broader phenomenon, said Ben Harvey, executive general manager of Minelab at Adelaide-headquartered Codan, which is the world’s largest maker of hand-held metal detectors. A child pans for gold at Sovereign Hill living museum in Ballarat, Australia, November 30, 2025. — REUTERS Alongside Codan’s communications division, strong detector sales in its home market of Australia, as well as in Africa and the Americas, have helped double the firm’s share price this year. In Africa, demand may be led by artisanal miners working in cooperatives to improve their standard of living, Harvey said. In Latin America, there is also recreational interest from hobbyists searching for coins and other treasures, he told Reuters in an interview. Behind the success is a push by Codan’s team of engineers to improve technology to cut down on background noise so detectorists can focus on the gold, he said. “What a prospector is looking for is, when they go out, they want to find gold, and they want to find more gold than they found last time,” he said.",

      "summary": "In the hinterlands of Australia’s historic goldfields, Vicki Plumridge jumps for joy when she digs a small golden nugget out of the earth. The retired retail worker was learning how to use her new metal detector when it started bleeping by the moss-covered ruins of a building. After Plumridge dug the nugget out of the shallow dirt with a plastic trowel, a guide estimated it was around 0.2 of a gram of gold, worth about $40 Australian Dollar ($26.58). “But to me, it’s worth a million dollars,” said the 63-year-old, who had bought the detector only a few days before. “My heart is singing.” Vicki Plumridge, 63, a retired retail worker, reacts as Peter Vanjek, 65, a Gold and Relics prospecting tour guide, tells her she has found a small gold nugget during a Gold and Relics metal detector training session in Mount Doran, Australia, November 29, 2025. —  REUTERS Plumridge’s story is becoming more common, as hobbyists flock to Australia’s 9,600 sq km “golden triangle” in the heart of Victoria state, known as one of the world’s most prospective regions for gold nuggets. Prospectors have been spurred on by record gold prices, social media, the success of TV show Aussie Gold Hunters, and a love for the outdoors, according to Reuters interviews with a dozen gold hunters. Plumridge’s detector, Minelab’s Gold Monster 2000, which she bought for Australian Dollar $2,999, sold out across the country within weeks of its October 20 launch, according to Leanne Kamp, joint owner of Lucky Strike Gold, a prospecting shop in Geelong. Damian Duke, 39, who works in construction, sifts through a scoop of soil during a Gold and Relics metal detector training session in Mount Doran, Australia, November 29, 2025. —  REUTERS “It’s a great price point, and we have seen a big jump in sales this year, partly because the gold price has got everyone’s interest,” said Kamp, who has led prospecting tours since 2007. “We get a lot of internationals. Next week we have some Germans coming. Germans love the gold. The Swiss seem to love the gold too. And we have some coming over from the US,” she said. The chance of finding nuggets on historic sites improves with each iteration of detectors, which is why there is a rush for new models as soon as they are released, she added. World’s biggest nuggets Hobbyists have flocked to 19th-century gold rush towns like Ballarat, which laid the foundation for Melbourne’s early wealth and helped make Australia one of the world’s top three gold producers. People enter a gold mine tour at Sovereign Hill, an outdoor living museum set in the Gold Rush era, in Ballarat, Australia, November 30, 2025. — REUTERS The region has yielded the world’s biggest nugget, the Welcome Stranger at 72kg, found in the 1860s, as well as the Hand of Faith, the largest nugget found with a metal detector at 27.2kg in 1980. As recently as February 2023, an amateur prospector unearthed a 4.6kg nugget in the region with a detector, according to the state government. The lure of large nuggets is one of the draws for Damian Duke, 39, who works in construction. Duke used to go prospecting with his father, who died three years ago. Now he takes his own son, Ethan. People take a horse‑drawn coach ride through Sovereign Hill, an outdoor living museum depicting the Gold Rush era, in Ballarat, Australia, November 30, 2025. — REUTERS The 11-year-old inherited his grandfather’s detector, and Duke has recently upgraded his machine, he told Reuters. “Where prices are now, you do have the chance of striking a life-changing piece of gold,“ he said. Gold has chalked up successive records this year, surging above $4,500 a troy ounce on Friday. Goldman Sachs expects prices to reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, with further gains likely if private investors continue diversifying their portfolios amid geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty. Global Phenomenon In Victoria, fossickers must buy a permit from the state government. The permit allows them to fossick using only hand tools and to keep any gold they find. Demand for the miner’s right permits, which cost Australian Dollar $28.60 each and last for a decade, has hit all-time highs, at almost 16,000 by November, from nearly 11,000 last year, according to figures from Victoria’s Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action, supplied exclusively to Reuters. In total, there are more than 100,000 active miners’ right permits in Victoria.

      "summary_orig": "A day after an eight-year-old boy drowned in an uncovered manhole in Karachi’s Mehran town, Mayor Murtaza Wahab urged people not to politicise the issue, saying that the child fell because the manhole cover “had been removed and put on the side”. According to the Edhi Foundation, the number of people who died after falling into open manholes and drains across the metropolis rose to 27 in the outgoing year of 2025. Eight of them are children, the data says. The child, identified as Dilbar, was playing outside his residence with other area children when the tragedy occurred, Korangi Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari told Dawn . Speaking to the media today, Mayor Wahab, in response to a fiery question about the issue of missing manhole covers, particularly the death of a child a day earlier and reports of missing covers on II Chundrigar Road, said: “The reports I have so far received from locals, I am in touch with the child’s family, indicate that it was not that there was no cover at all, but that it had been removed and placed on the side.” Noting the tone of the question, he remarked, “Now that this question has been recorded, it will go viral, and that, unfortunately, is the real issue”. He maintained that the issue could not be looked at through a “political lens”. “The first thing I checked was if the Union Council […] was given the additional Rs100,000 I had announced? Yes, the money was disbursed.“ “The point being that we did whatever was in our capacity, but if someone removed the cover and put it on the side, then it is a problem that can not be seen through a political lens,” Mayor Wahab maintained. He stressed that it was vital to “look at what the real issue is“. In reference to PTI‘s Alamgir Khan, who is known for his ‘Fix It’ campaign, the mayor said, “Yesterday, a person from a certain party went to II Chundrigar and said that his team had installed missing covers; however, later they went missing”. “So did I remove the covers?” he asked. “It means someone stole them,“ he said, urging people to address the issue “based on merits, rather than politicising it”. Earlier this month, the body of a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal was recovered on December 1, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported. Following the tragedy, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials. The incident also prompted the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to increase the budget of 246 union committees (UCs) to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights.",

      "summary_orig": "A Saudi airstrike on what it said was a weapons shipment in Yemen on Tuesday marked the most significant escalation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to date. Once the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence. Here is a timeline of how the relationship has evolved: 2011: As the Arab Spring spreads, the two form a unified front against extremist movements, deploying joint forces to Bahrain to quell an uprising and coordinating support for Egypts 2013 military overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood government. March, 2015: They launch a military intervention in Yemen to restore the government ousted by the Houthis rebels. UAE troops lead ground operations, while Saudi air power controls the skies. June, 2017: The allies lead a boycott of Qatar, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism, charges it denies. The move cements the alignment between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ). 2019: The UAE draws down troops in Yemen, shifting strategy but retaining influence through the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), leaving Riyadh to shoulder the war against the Houthis. September, 2020: The UAE normalizes ties with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords. Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islam’s two holiest sites, declines to follow suit, insisting on Palestinian statehood first, giving Abu Dhabi a unique diplomatic channel to Washington. January, 2021: Saudi Arabia leads the Al-Ula summit to end the Qatar dispute. The UAE signs reluctantly, maintaining a cooler stance toward Doha. February, 2021: Riyadh challenges Dubai’s commercial dominance, telling foreign firms to move regional HQs to the kingdom by 2024 or lose state contracts. July, 2021: Economic rivalry spikes. Riyadh removes tariff concessions for goods from free zones, undercutting the UAE’s trade model. Simultaneously, a rare dispute erupts at OPEC as the UAE blocks a Saudi-led deal, demanding a higher crude oil production baseline. April, 2023: In Sudan’s war, Riyadh hosts ceasefire talks supporting the army, while UN experts accuse the UAE of arming the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which Abu Dhabi denies. December 8, 2025: Tensions peak in Yemen as the UAE-backed STC seizes oilfields in Hadramout, crossing a Saudi “red line.” December 30, 2025: Saudi jets strike a vessel in Mukalla. The coalition says the ship was delivering heavy weapons to separatists, marking the first direct engagement between the partners’ interests.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi has been forced to cut short his maiden Big Bash League stint after sustaining a knee injury while representing Brisbane Heat. The left-armer suffered a cartilage injury while fielding during Heat’s last-over victory against Adelaide Strikers at the Gabba on Saturday night. Following consultations between Brisbane Heat and the Pakistan Cricket Board’s medical staff, it was decided that Shaheen would return home for further treatment ahead of the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup, the club said in a statement on Tuesday. A PCB spokesperson confirmed to Dawn that Shaheen will return to Pakistan on Wednesday, adding that the seriousness of the injury and the potential recovery timeline will be determined after meetings with the board’s doctors upon his return. Shaheen expressed disappointment at leaving the tournament prematurely but thanked the franchise and its supporters for their hospitality. “I have enjoyed myself a lot playing for Brisbane and I am sad that I will not be able to finish the season with the team,” Shaheen said in a statement released by the club. “The BBL was everything I had heard it would be — lots of good, skilful cricket. I have enjoyed the challenge.” In a post on X, the pacer reiterated his gratitude to the Heat, stating that he had been called back by the PCB to begin rehabilitation. “Hopefully, I will be back in the fields soon,” he wrote. Shaheen featured in four matches for Brisbane Heat, claiming two wickets at an average of 76.50. Brisbane Heat chief executive Terry Svenson praised Shaheen’s professionalism and impact on the squad despite his brief stay. “Despite his season not finishing the way he would have liked, he has been a thorough professional,” Svenson said. “Our young bowlers have benefitted greatly from his advice and suggestions.” Acting Heat captain Xavier Bartlett also lauded Shaheen’s contribution, describing his presence as “great value” for the bowling group. The Heat are now exploring options to replace Shaheen for the remainder of the competition, while the 24-year-old will focus on recovery as Pakistan prepare for the T20 World Cup, set to be held in February-March. The pacer, however, was not named in the Pakistan squad for the upcoming three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka — which is to be played in the second week of January. His and Babar Azam’s exclusion from the roster came reportedly due to an arrangement between Cricket Australia and its Pakistan counterpart that required some national players to feature in the entirety of the competition. The BBL final will be played on January 25.",

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar exchanged views on “the current regional situation and recent developments” with his Saudi counterpart in a telephone call on Tuesday, according to the Foreign Office (FO). Both nations have a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies , with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also signed a landmark mutual defence agreement in September this year, which outlined that an attack on one party would be treated as an attack on both. In a post on social media, the FO said that Dar expressed satisfaction with the positive trajectory of bilateral relations between Islamabad and Riyadh during the exchange, while Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan “reaffirmed his commitment to further strengthening and enhancing bilateral ties”. Dar also conveyed season’s greetings and best wishes for the New Year, which were “warmly reciprocated” by Prince Faisal, the FO added. Earlier today, the Saudi-led coalition struck what it described as foreign military support to southern separatists at Yemen’s Mukalla port. Last Saturday, Pakistan expressed its full support for Saudi Arabia’s efforts to ensure peace and stability in Yemen. “Pakistan expresses its full support for the diplomatic efforts being undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for ensuring peace and stability in the Republic of Yemen. We also commend the efforts of the United Arab Emirates in this regard,” a statement from the FO read. In November, the military leadership of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia vowed to enhance bilateral defence cooperation and reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen ties between the two countries. “During the meeting, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional environment and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” the ISPR said. “The military leadership reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the strong brotherly ties and enduring defence partnership between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.”",

      "summary_orig": "In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi said that the Centre’s cooperation was vital for eliminating terrorism in the province. In a statement released on the social media platform X, the interior ministry said that Kundi called on the interior minister in Islamabad. It added that the two discussed security measures in KP’s border areas and ongoing operations against khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). According to the statement, the interior minister gave assurances of the government’s full cooperation for peace and security in KP. “Establishing peace in KP is the top priority,” he was quoted as saying. He said that the federal government was “prepared to provide support in this regard in every possible way”. “We appreciate the sacrifices made by the people of KP in the war against terrorism,” Naqvi said. “ Fitna al Khawarij and their facilitators are being eliminated through joint efforts,” he added. “No leniency of any kind will be shown toward the khawariji ,“ he said. Meanwhile, Kundi said that the Centre’s cooperation was essential for establishing peace and security in the province. “Joint and coordinated action is needed to eliminate terrorism,” he said. On Sunday, Kundi had asked the KP government to support the military operations in the province as the security situation had significantly deteriorated due to militancy. Speaking at the National Press Club, he said the KP government should support security operations, as “without stability, development projects could not move forward”. Insecurity has a negative impact on the social and economic conditions of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, adding that “sustained peace was essential for businesses and investment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”. According to statistics released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), Pakis­tan’s counterterrorism scenario saw a marked escalation in 2025 — combat-related deaths rising by 73 per cent against the previous one — with violence intensifying and pushing several indicators to their highest levels in over a decade. The year not only witnessed a steep rise in overall combat-related deaths, but also became the deadliest one for militants since 2015, the most lethal for security forces since 2011, and the worst for civilian casualties since 2015.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Tuesday that it was resuming direct flights to London in March 2026 after a six-year hiatus. In a statement, the PIA spokesperson said the national flag carrier was increasing its flights to the United Kingdom. He said the airline would operate four weekly flights from Islamabad to London from March 29, 2026. He said that the flights would be operated from Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 4. “The flights are being resumed after a long gap of six years,“ he added. The spokesperson further said that London was the airline’s “first-ever” international destination and remained one of its most important routes. He maintained that the national carrier was already operating three weekly flights to Manchester. In June 2020, the European Union Air Safety Agency had barred PIA from operating in EU countries over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament, where he termed pilots’ licences “dubious”. The European agency lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28, 2024. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. In September, PIA received the go-ahead to resume direct flights to the UK after a gap of nearly five years. Subsequently, the airline resumed flights to the UK, with flight operations to Manchester resuming in the first phase. At the time, the airline had said it planned to extend operations to Birmingham and London as well.",

There seems to be no end to the bad news: the war in Ukraine, the destruction of Gaza, the terror attack in Australia and the significant economic and political setbacks faced by many nations in Asia and across the world.\nAll these paint a rather grim picture. However, there is more than a glimmer of hope on the horizon. International science cooperation has strengthened significantly this year, in spite...",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Arif Habib — chairman of the investment firm that headed the consortium that won the auction for a controlling stake in Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Ltd (PIACL) — has said the privatisaton of the national flag carrier would lead to an increase in employment in the airline as the new owners were looking to expand its business. An Arif Habib group-led consortium had won the auction for the airline with a bid of Rs135 billion last week after a competitive process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades. The investment firm‘s chairman spoke about the development on DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’ — televised on Monday night — where he was asked about PIA employees’ concerns, reservations and protests regarding their jobs against the backdrop of the airline’s privatisaion. In response, Habib said the “number of staff [in the airline] was reasonable”, adding that the privatisation would in fact increase employment on the whole as an expansion was planned and, therefore, more team members would be required. But, he continued, a major issue would be that of “quality and performance”. “And we have come to know that most of these people are very competent,“ he said, adding that Pakistanis were generally capable people. Moreover, Habib said PIA had an “excellent track record” and that at one time, it was the world’s second-best airline. “These are the same people who made it the second-best airline.” Similarly, he added, PIA had also played “a very important role“ in the establishment of Emirates, Singapore and Malta airlines. “This means Pakistanis have the skill, and if they are given confidence, a proper platform and support, then I think these people can run PIA well. “We hope that they will play their role in bringing its (PIA’s) past glory back,” he added. A day after PIA’s privatisation, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali had also told Reuters during an interview that the buyer must retain all employees for 12 months after the transaction, with contracts unchanged. Habib was also asked about Fauji Fertiliser Company during the interview. Fauji Fertliser was initially in the race to acquire PIA shares but it later opted out of the bidding process. After the PIA auction, it joined the consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited. Confirming the development, Arif Habib had earlier told Dawn that the company had joined his consortium and discussions were under way to finalise the terms and conditions of the partnership. Speaking about it on ‘Doosra Rukh’ , he said Fauji Foundation Company was part of the consortium as a shareholder of PIA. He also said he had met Chief of Defence Forces and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on two occasions before PIA’s privatisation — first in Karachi and then in Rawalpindi. On both occasions, he said, other businessmen and industrialists were also present, and the Field Marshal had emphasised that local businesses should show interest and invest in the airline.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: A first information report (FIR) has been registered against more than a dozen lawyers after YouTuber Rajab Butt was physically assaulted during a court appearance in Karachi on Monday, it emerged on Tuesday. On Monday, Butt was physically assaulted, allegedly by some lawyers, at the Karachi City Court premises during the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said on X that “a few lawyers launched a life-threatening attack on him within the court premises”. A video of the incident showed Butt, clad in a shirt torn from places, moving through a crowd surrounding him. The FIR of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn , was subsequently registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer, Ashfaq. It named Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers”. It should be mentioned that Solangi is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. The FIR was regisisted under sections 147 (punishment for rioting), Section 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), Section 382 (Theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft), Section 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation), and Section 337-A (Punishment of shajjah) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The complainant said that his client had arrived at City Court at 9am to seek bail in a case registered against him under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the PPC. “However, when we reached the inner premises near the West building, Solangi and Fatah, along with 15-20 other lawyers, attacked and started beating my client,” he alleged. He further said that his client was injured in the attack. “The attackers assaulted me as well and other lawyers from my office,” Ashfaq said. He further added that during the attack, his client Butt was holding a bag containing Rs300,000, which was snatched from him. He said that Solangi later returned the bag, but the cash was missing. He also said that his client was then forcibly taken to the additional district and sessions judge (Central), where they “threatened to kill my client”. South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that so far no one had been arrested. Advocate Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers. On Monday, Ashfaq had said that the attackers continued to beat him (Butt) despite being repeatedly asked to stop“. “Taking the law into their hands is weakening the reputation of lawyers in the country,“ he added. Another video had showed Butt walking along with a group of lawyers, who were raising slogans “ Karachi Bar Zindabad ” (long live Karachi Bar). Among them was also Solangi. Tiktoker Nadeem Mubarak, also known as Nani Wala, was also present on the occasion and was seen in one of the videos.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday. Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said. “The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the Fajr prayer,” the party said in a statement. “We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added. Interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Bangladesh “has lost a great guardian”. “Through her uncompromising leadership, the nation was repeatedly freed from undemocratic conditions and inspired to regain liberty,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in a statement. “I pray for the eternal peace and forgiveness of Begum Khaleda Zia’s soul,” ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina said, in a statement on social media by her now banned Awami League party. Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Hasina last year. Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner. But in late November, she was rushed to hospital , where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues. Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment. She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power. View this post on Instagram There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough. Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters. Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority. Bangladesh declares three-day state mourning Bangladesh declared three days of state mourning, with Khaleda’s funeral to be held on Wednesday. Interim leader Yunus, in a television broadcast to the nation, appealed for calm. “I humbly appeal to everyone to maintain discipline while observing all forms of mourning, including the funeral prayers. I know you are all deeply emotional at this time,” Yunus said. “I hope that during this difficult period, you will show utmost patience and support one another in carrying out her last rites, including the funeral.” Asif Nazrul, who holds the law portfolio in the interim government, said the funeral prayers would be held in front of parliament after midday prayers, and that Zia would then be buried alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman. ‘Committed friend to Pakistan’ Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by Khaleda’s passing. “Her lifelong service to Bangladesh and its growth and development leaves a lasting legacy,” he said. “Begum Zia was a committed friend of Pakistan. My government and the people of Pakistan stand with the people of Bangladesh in this moment of sorrow,” he said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and the people of Bangladesh during this difficult time,” he said. President Asif Ali Zardari said Khaleda’s “leadership and services will be remembered with respect”. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also expressed his condolences at Khaleda’s passing. Separately, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Zia’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall. ‘Battling begums’ Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981. Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”. She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990. But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”. Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals. Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades. In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami. In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier. Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free. She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win. Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption. In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed. In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated. Detention and freedom Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence. The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008. Khaleda never regained power. With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics. Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods. In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics. She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated. Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster. In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: A major terror plot was thwarted by law enforcers in the city on Monday as they rescued a school-going teenage girl who had been radicalised through social media by an outlawed militant group and was being prepared for a suicide attack in Karachi. This was shared by Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar during a press conference at the Central Police Office. The minister said that the girl was detained during routine checking by police on the outskirts of Karachi and during the investigation, she revealed the details of the potential terror attack. Mr Lanjar said that the girl belonged to an ordinary family in Balochistan and had been radicalised by anti-state elements through social media before being recruited by a banned group. She was shown fictitious heroic stories of past suicide bombers and was trained through WhatsApp groups to carry out a suicide attack in Karachi. However, law enforcers “foiled the terrorists’ nefarious designs by rescuing her in time,” he added. He also said that the girl’s father, a government servant, had passed away, while her mother was alive. One of her brothers is serving in the Balochistan police while the other is employed in a government department. Home minister claims girl from Balochistan detained during routine checking on city outskirts; alleges outlawed BLA brainwashed her Additional Inspector General of Police (CTD) Azad Khan said the girl was studying at a local school in Balochistan and that the family’s sole source of income was her father’s government pension. She was initially provided hate material through a mobile phone to mentally condition her. Later, an Instagram handler linked to the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) contacted her, shared extremist content and added her to a WhatsApp group where anti-state material was regularly circulated. He said the girl was persuaded to “perform a big act” and was gradually trained towards suicide bombing. One day, she left her home and met a woman outside Karachi, who took her to another location where she was further indoctrinated before being sent to Karachi. During police checking, she failed to give satisfactory answers and was taken to a women’s police station, where she disclosed the entire story during debriefing. The CTD chief said that on the directions of the home minister, authorities had decided not to apply the normal legal process against her and instead adopt a restorative justice approach. “We will treat her as a victim, not an accused,” he said, adding that no explosive or suicide material was recovered from her possession. However, he said her brainwashing was complete and she was close to the “execution phase” when she was rescued. Responding to a question, the home minister said it was an “open secret” that the BLA was destabilising Pakistan with the direct support of India. Additional IGP Karachi Javed Alam Odho, the rescued girl, and her mother were also present at the press conference. In a recorded video message, the girl said she was a student who aspired to become a teacher. She said she first came across a story about Shari Baloch on social media. It is pertinent to mention here that Shari Baloch had carried out a suicide attack to target Chinese academics at Karachi University in 2022. The girl said she developed curiosity about how an educated woman like Shari became a suicide bomber. She watched videos and read material that made her believe there was “some truth” in the propaganda. Gradually, her mindset changed after watching videos and songs glorifying the suicide bomber. The girl said she now realizes that social media handlers who speak softly and show sympathy are actually “hunters.” She questioned why they do not radicalise their own daughters. In her video message, the girl’s mother thanked the law enforcement agencies for saving her daughter and protecting their family’s honour. Published in Dawn, December 30th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Environment ministry okays ‘run-of-the-river’ Dulhasti Stage II, to be built in held Kashmir • Indian govt forging ahead with several hydel projects in Indus basin after unilaterally suspending treaty • Water weaponisation in climate change-prone region ‘neither sane nor acceptable’, warns Sherry Rehman NEW DELHI / ISLAMABAD: India’s Ministry of Environment has been pondering clearances for a slew of controversial hydroelectric projects on the Chenab River in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident earlier this year. Yet, it does not seem to share serious apprehensions that leading environmentalists have expressed over their threat to a fragile Himalayan ecology. Last week, a panel under the ministry approved the 260-megawatt Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Kishtwar district of India-held Jammu and Kashmir, according to The Hindu . Earlier, in October, it was reported that environmental clearances were revived for the larger Sawalkote hydro-electric project on the same river. The clearances came against the backdrop of India unilaterally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after blaming Pakistan over the Pahalgam incident — an allegation Islamabad had denied, terming the suspension of the 1960 treaty “an act of war”. Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab. At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty. The projects The Sawalkote project has been in the works for decades, and has faced numerous delays related to forest clearances and the compliance compulsions of the Indus Waters Treaty. As of now, the 1,856MW project is still said to be in the pre-construction stage. Its environment clearances have been reheated several times over. The Dulhasti Stage II is a 258MW project, conceived as a complementary run-of-the-river scheme to utilise the water discharged from the existing 390MW Dulhasti Power Station “more efficiently”. It is a smaller component of the frequently discussed Chenab basin projects. It is expected to cost around $35 million. According to The Hindu, “With the treaty now in abeyance, the centre is pushing ahead with several hydroelectric projects in the Indus basin, such as Sawalkote, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai I and II.” The total land requirement for the project is estimated at 60.3 hectares. This project will require 8.27 hectares of private land from two villages, Benzwar and Palmar, in Kishtwar district, The Hindu reported. Environmental concerns The question environmentalists are posing focuses greatly on a primary concern related to climate change. Water bodies are drying up rapidly. Chenab forms at the confluence of Chandra and Bhaga rivers in Lahaul and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh. According to the Indus Waters Treaty, Chenab is a Western River, allocated to Pakistan. India is permitted limited consumption use and unlimited non-consumption use of Chenab. From the treaty’s signing up to the year 2004-05, studies estimate that glacial volume in the Chenab basin has reduced by a whopping 33.3pc. This is what the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People NGO says: “For a river whose flows are made up of 50% meltwater when it leaves India at Akhnoor, this is shocking for both India and Pakistan”. “Glaciers, the water stored in them, the slow release of this water in spring and summers is the key to water security of the entire Himalayan region. Sixty per cent irrigation in the entire Indus basin depends on glacial melt. As the glaciers are concentrated in the Indian Himalayas, their health and sustenance is crucial for millions in both countries.” In the Hindu mythology, the River Saraswati, which is said to have made up a troika with the Ganga and Yamuna rivers, disappeared in ancient times. In the real world, many more rivers and water bodies face a similar fate. Chenab is among them. Sherry expresses alarm While there was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, former climate change minister Senator Sherry Rehman protested against this weaponisation of water, saying that it was “neither sane nor acceptable”. In a post on X, the PPP leader wrote, “In flagrant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India has just given approval to the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K). “As per the IWT, which cannot be unilaterally revoked, as recent UN rapporteurs have confirmed, Pakistan has control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers fall under India’s control,” she said. “Following the illegal suspension of the treaty, India has decided to fast-track several disputed hydroelectric projects in the Indus Basin. These projects include Sawalkot, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai-1 and 2. Dulhasti Stage-II is considered part of this strategy,” she said. “This weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the frontlines of climate change and environmental stress. It will inflame tensions in a bilateral relationship already bristling with hostility and distrust,” she said. Published in Dawn, December 30th, 2025",
