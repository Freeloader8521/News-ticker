      "title_orig": "Justice Ayesha says 26th Amendment does not bar full court from hearing cases before Constitutional Bench",
      "summary_orig": "Justice Ayesha Malik on Wednesday observed that there was no bar on a full Supreme Court hearing a case fixed before the Constitutional Bench under Article 191A introduced in the 26th Amendment. She made the remarks as an eight-member resumed hearing over three dozen petitions against the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year. At the time, the PTI claimed seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate , with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence. The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment . Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain , counsel for veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak , presented his arguments today. The live stream of the hearing initially faced technical issues, with the audio being cut off. However, the issues were later resolved with proceedings being streamed as per usual. The hearing was adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow (Thursday). The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Ayesha, Mohammad Ali Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. According to the cause list , the CB has taken up 37 petitions pertaining to the 26th Amendment, including those filed by the PTI, the Sunni Ittehad Council, the Jamaat-i-Islami, and multiple bar associations. During yesterday’s proceedings, Justice Mazhar termed regular and constitutional benches “branches of one tree”. He also observed that the authority to do “complete justice” under Article 187 of the Constitution was still available and vested in the CB. This power was never given up, and can still be exercised by the CB if it feels the need to invoke this provision to do complete justice, emphasised Justice Mazhar. The doctrine of “complete justice” is the same principle invoked by a pre-amendment SC bench that allocated reserved seats to the PTI, but the verdict was later overturned by the CB . The hearing At the outset of the hearing, Hosain emphasised that the judiciary’s reputation “does not depend on the 26th Constitutional Amendment”. “This case should be heard by a different independent bench,” the lawyer asserted. Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain speaks at the rostrum, as an eight-member SC Constitutional Bench hears challenges against the 26th Amendment during live-streamed proceedings, on Oct 22, 2025. — screengrab from SC’s YouTube channel Justice Mandokhail then asked, “Do you not trust this bench?”, at which the lawyer said that a decision on Article 191A — through which the CB in the apex court was introduced — should be taken by the “original full court”. Here, Justice Rizvi noted that Hosain’s petition did mention the term “original full court”. The counsel clarified that he did not say “this bench is not independent”. Justice Mandokhail remarked, “You yourself said that the case should be kept before another independent bench. Will we judges be included in that ‘independent bench’?” Justice Aminuddin also wondered whether CJP Yahya Afridi would be a part of that “independent bench”, to which Hosain replied that he “absolutely would be”. Here, Justice Mandokhail questioned Hosain that if the current CB “could not hear this case, how could it issue any order?”. The lawyer replied, “Why is the court seeking a path to issue an order? So far, the Centre has not raised any objection to a full court or [the CB] issuing any order. Justice Aminuddin responded that each lawyer had their own stance, and that the bench was raising questions after considering the Constitution. “Some lawyers are even saying to keep aside the Amendment,” Justice Mandokhail observed. At one point, Justice Mazhar noted, “If 26 judges are included, then it will become a regular bench.” Hosain also agreed that it would not be a constitutional bench. Justice Mandokhail recalled Dr Adnan Khan’s arguments from yesterday, in which he contended that the SC and the CB were separate entities. The judge then directed the lawyer to detail when the concept of benches came into existence. At Justice Mazhar mentioning that some lawyers argued that other SC judges can also be included in the current bench, Hosain asserted that the CB was also a bench of the apex court. Justice Ayesha then directed the counsel to read Article 191A in conjunction with its Clause 3 , which says “no bench of the Supreme Court other than a Constitutional Bench shall exercise following jurisdictions vested in the Supreme Court”, with the latter including the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184. Justice Ayesha observed that the provision said the specified jurisdictions were to be exercised by the SC’s CB. “For some reason, we keep reading this as an ouster to say that no one else will [hear the case]. It simply says no other bench will do it.” She further said that even if Article 191A was interpreted to mean that “no other bench” will hear such cases, it meant that the CB would hear “a case on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court” and interpret the Constitution. “Where is the bar? […] It is reading the provisions of the Constitution and it is interpreting it, and in doing that interpretation, it is saying that while exercising this jurisdiction, because this is a matter of a Constitutional Amendment, we interpret this to mean that a full court can hear the matter. Would that make sense?” Justice Ayesha noted, “I am speaking for myself; I, in the first case, said I don’t see a bar.” She added that as per Article 191A, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) is to nominate judges for the CB. The judge termed Article 191A a “procedural” provision. She noted that while it imposes restrictions on benches, it does not on the SC, adding that the CB was interpreting the provisions as if they impose a “complete restriction”. Justice Mazhar then expressed his “complete agreement” with Hosain’s argument that contention that a 16-member bench will be regular bench, and not a CB. Hosain contended, “If you say that your hands are tied, then that is not the case. Nowhere is it written that a Constitutional Bench cannot refer the matter to the full court.” Here, Justice Mandokhail wondered whether the lawyer meant that the CB could not refer the case to a regular bench but could do so to a full court. “But then that will also be a regular bench. He (Hosain) said that a 16-member bench will be a regular one,” the judge added. At one point, Hosain contended, “My CMA does not say strike down the 26th Amendment. My CMA is very focused, which is what is before your lordships now. It is ‘please send these cases to the original full court […] and there is nothing stopping you from doing that’.” Hosain then concluded his arguments, following which the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow. Requests for full court Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan , Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s ( BHCBA ) counsel Munir A. Malik , and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners. The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request . The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself. The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

The doctrine of “complete justice” is the same principle invoked by a pre-amendment SC bench that allocated reserved seats to the PTI, but the verdict was later overturned by the CB . The hearing At the outset of the hearing, Hosain emphasised that the judiciary’s reputation “does not depend on the 26th Constitutional Amendment”. “This case should be heard by a different independent bench,” the lawyer asserted. Advocate Khwaja Ahmad Hosain speaks at the rostrum, as an eight-member SC Constitutional Bench hears challenges against the 26th Amendment during live-streamed proceedings, on Oct 22, 2025. — screengrab from SC’s YouTube channel Justice Mandokhail then asked, “Do you not trust this bench?”, at which the lawyer said that a decision on Article 191A — through which the CB in the apex court was introduced — should be taken by the “original full court”. Here, Justice Rizvi noted that Hosain’s petition did mention the term “original full court”. The counsel clarified that he did not say “this bench is not independent”. Justice Mandokhail remarked, “You yourself said that the case should be kept before another independent bench. Will we judges be included in that ‘independent bench’?” Justice Aminuddin also wondered whether CJP Yahya Afridi would be a part of that “independent bench”, to which Hosain replied that he “absolutely would be”. Here, Justice Mandokhail questioned Hosain that if the current CB “could not hear this case, how could it issue any order?”. The lawyer replied, “Why is the court seeking a path to issue an order? So far, the Centre has not raised any objection to a full court or [the CB] issuing any order. Justice Aminuddin responded that each lawyer had their own stance, and that the bench was raising questions after considering the Constitution. “Some lawyers are even saying to keep aside the Amendment,” Justice Mandokhail observed. At one point, Justice Mazhar noted, “If 26 judges are included, then it will become a regular bench.” Hosain also agreed that it would not be a constitutional bench. Justice Mandokhail recalled Dr Adnan Khan’s arguments from yesterday, in which he contended that the SC and the CB were separate entities. The judge then directed the lawyer to detail when the concept of benches came into existence. At Justice Mazhar mentioning that some lawyers argued that other SC judges can also be included in the current bench, Hosain asserted that the CB was also a bench of the apex court. Justice Ayesha then directed the counsel to read Article 191A in conjunction with its Clause 3 , which says “no bench of the Supreme Court other than a Constitutional Bench shall exercise following jurisdictions vested in the Supreme Court”, with the latter including the SC’s original jurisdiction under Article 184. Justice Ayesha observed that the provision said the specified jurisdictions were to be exercised by the SC’s CB. “For some reason, we keep reading this as an ouster to say that no one else will [hear the case]. It simply says no other bench will do it.” She further said that even if Article 191A was interpreted to mean that “no other bench” will hear such cases, it meant that the CB would hear “a case on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court” and interpret the Constitution. “Where is the bar? […] It is reading the provisions of the Constitution and it is interpreting it, and in doing that interpretation, it is saying that while exercising this jurisdiction, because this is a matter of a Constitutional Amendment, we interpret this to mean that a full court can hear the matter. Would that make sense?” Justice Ayesha noted, “I am speaking for myself; I, in the first case, said I don’t see a bar.” She added that as per Article 191A, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) is to nominate judges for the CB. The judge termed Article 191A a “procedural” provision. She noted that while it imposes restrictions on benches, it does not on the SC, adding that the CB was interpreting the provisions as if they impose a “complete restriction”. Justice Mazhar then expressed his “complete agreement” with Hosain’s argument that contention that a 16-member bench will be regular bench, and not a CB. Hosain contended, “If you say that your hands are tied, then that is not the case. Nowhere is it written that a Constitutional Bench cannot refer the matter to the full court.” Here, Justice Mandokhail wondered whether the lawyer meant that the CB could not refer the case to a regular bench but could do so to a full court. “But then that will also be a regular bench. He (Hosain) said that a 16-member bench will be a regular one,” the judge added. At one point, Hosain contended, “My CMA does not say strike down the 26th Amendment. My CMA is very focused, which is what is before your lordships now. It is ‘please send these cases to the original full court […] and there is nothing stopping you from doing that’.” Hosain then concluded his arguments, following which the hearing was adjourned till tomorrow. Requests for full court Thus far, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan , Balochistan High Court Bar Association’s ( BHCBA ) counsel Munir A. Malik , and petitioners Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed and Abid Shahid Zuberi have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners. The case proceedings are being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8, upon the petitioners’ request . The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the 26th Amendment itself. The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

Its scope will not change, and nor will its intent. It will be robust and rigorous. It will direct and oversee local investigations, with the power to compel witnesses and summon evidence.

      "summary": "Keir Starmer likely to face PMQs grilling on claims the inquiry has descended into ‘chaos’ Good morning. One of the reasons why Shabana Mahmood was appointed home secretary was because, as justice secretary, when the Tories came at her with a “two-tier justice” attack line that was being enthusiastically embraced by the rightwing media, she saw them off swiftly and effectively (essentially, by coopting the argument and responding). Today she is performing a similar rebuttal operation on the grooming gangs inquiry, which is another area where the Daily Mail/GB News etc are on the warpath and the government is floundering. Here is the Mail’s splash . We are progressing as swiftly as thoroughness allows. Misinformation undermines this process. Allegations of intentional delay, lack of interest and a widening or dilution of the inquiry’s scope are false. It was with a heavy heart, in recent days, I learnt that some members have decided to step away from the group. Should they wish to return, the door will always remain open to them.

      "summary_orig": "A Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, on Wednesday in a case pertaining to protests staged by the PTI in November last year over her absence from the hearing. This is the fourth time that the court has issued an arrest warrant for Aleema in the case. November 26 protests , as they famously came to be known as, saw more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone had ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”. Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations. Proceedings for the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station were held at the ATC in Rawalpindi today, where 10 of the 11 suspects appeared before the court. Subsequently, the ATC again issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema over her failure to appear before the court. The court also issued a show-cause notice to Superintendent of Police (Rawal Division) Saad Arshad and Deputy Superintendent of Police Naeem for filing a “bogus report”. Moreover, the court summoned them in their personal capacities over “contempt of court”. The court remarked that the officials had said in the report that Aleema had gone into hiding. But, she was seen at the Adiala jail and also on social media channels, the court observed. During the last hearing, the court had directed SP Saad to arrest and produce Aleema before the court on Oct 22 (today). It had also ordered the confiscation of her surety bond and the verification of property documents submitted by her guarantor. At today’s hearing, her guarantor’s surety bonds were confiscated and Aleema was directed to submit new surety bonds worth Rs1 million. Moreover, the surety bonds of the guarantors of four vehicles linked to the case, which had been acquired from the ATC, were also confiscated. The case has been adjourned till November 24. Previous proceedings Today was not the first time when the court issued arrest warrants for Aleema in the case over her non-appearance. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her over her continued absence from the proceedings during the last hearing on Oct 20 as well. Prior to that, the court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for her during the hearing on Oct 14, noting that she had failed to appear twice before the court. It had also directed Sadiqabad police to arrest and produce her before the court by Oct 15. The court had also rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that she was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the Nov 26 protest. The ATC had also issued a bailable arrest warrant for Aleem on Oct 8. Aleema was to be indicted during that hearing but didn’t appear before the court.",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump has stated that he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a phone call where they talked about having “no wars with Pakistan”. The US president has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. India has denied the claim that the US president was responsible for brokering the ceasefire via trade threats. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has praised Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping the two neighbours achieve peace in the region. Participating in a Diwali celebration at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he had a “great conversation” with Indian PM Modi over the phone. “We talked about trade — we talked about a lot of things, but mostly the world of trade, he’s very interested in that. Although we did talk a little while ago about let’s have no wars with Pakistan,” he said. “I think the fact that trade was involved, I was able to talk about that — and we have no war with Pakistan and India and that was a very, very good thing,” he said. Trump also called Modi a “great person”, saying that he had become a great friend of his over the years. The US president also stated that Modi was keen to see the end of the Russia-Ukraine war. “We just have a very good relationship,” he said while talking about Modi. “And he’s not gonna buy much oil from Russia; he wants to see that war end as much as I do — he wants to see the war end between Russia and Ukraine … so they’ve cut it way back and they’re continuing to cut it way back.” Trump also lauded the US’ success in “forging peace all over the world”. “We’re putting America first; we’re getting everybody to sort of get along,” he said, highlighting the US role in securing “total peace ” in the Middle East. “Nobody thought we’d ever see that happening,” he said. “We have levels of friendship with everybody … countries that hated each other now love each other,” he said. Meanwhile, Modi thanked the US president for his phone call and Diwali greetings. “On this festival of lights, may our two great democracies continue to illuminate the world with hope and stand united against terrorism in all its forms,” he said on social media platform X. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” which targeted sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory operation called “Bunyanum Marsoos” , leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Month later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Navy ship Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea, according to a statement issued on Tuesday from the naval network overseeing the operation. The Combined Maritime Force (CMF), a naval partnership that includes the United States, said the Pakistani naval vessel intercepted two different dhow sailing boats within 48 hours last week. It was working in “direct support of Saudi-led Combined Task Force (CTF) 150” of the CMF during focused operation Al Masmak, which began on October 16. “The crew boarded the first dhow and seized over two tons of crystal methamphetamine with an estimated street value of $822,400,000 [on] October 18. Less than 48 hours later, the crew boarded a second dhow and seized 350 kilogrammes of [crystal meth] worth $140,000,000 and 50kg of cocaine worth $10,000,000,” the CMF statement said. The narcotics were transported back to the ship for testing to confirm the contents and subsequently disposed of, the statement added. The intercepted vessels were “identified as having no nationality”, it said without indicating where they had originated. It was “one of the most successful narcotics seizures for CMF,” Royal Saudi Naval Forces Commodore Fahad Aljoiad, commander of the CMF taskforce carrying out the operation, was quoted as saying. “The success of this focused operation highlights the importance of the multi-national collaboration,” he further stated. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Navy said in a statement that the achievement highlighted its “unwavering commitment to regional maritime security, global peace, and the collective fight against illicit trafficking at sea”. It further said that the successful operation reaffirmed Pakistan’s “active role as a responsible maritime partner contributing to peace and security in the wider Indian Ocean region”. The statement further said that Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf commended the crew for their professionalism and dedication. “He emphasised that Pakistan Navy remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard national maritime interests while contributing to the global commons through cooperation and coordinated maritime security efforts,” it quoted him as syaing. “The Naval Chief underscored that PNS Yarmook’s operation under Saudi-led task force will further enhance the interoperability between the two navies and strengthen defence collaboration between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it added. The US Central Command in a post on X congratulated the CMF, which includes 47 countries’ navies and patrols more than three million square miles of sea, including some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes, to disrupt the smuggling of drugs and weapons. The commissioning ceremony for Pakistan Navy Ship (PNS) Yarmook was held in Romania in February 2020 and it was inducted into the Pakistan Navy fleet in December 2020. PNS Yarmook is an electronic warfare, anti-ship and anti-air platform with cutting edge self-protection and terminal defence systems. The ship is capable of performing a variety of maritime operations and unmanned aerial vehicle operations simultaneously. In March last year, the vessel was employed in a rescue operation after a distress call from a boat, carrying eight Iranian fishermen, that had caught fire. In July 2024, it was also deployed in the Indian Ocean with an embarked helicopter for the safety and security of merchant ships bound to and coming from the country’s ports.",

      "summary_orig": "North Korea fired what appeared to be multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday, South Korea’s military said, a week before a key Asia-Pacific leaders’ meeting in South Korea. It was the first launch of ballistic missiles since May by Pyongyang, which has defied a United Nations Security Council ban on the weapons. It was also the first such launch since Lee Jae Myung was elected president in South Korea, with a platform of engagement with North Korea. Lee and United States President Donald Trump are expected to meet in South Korea next week at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Trump is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. South Korea detected several projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles fired from an area near North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, in a northeasterly direction early on Wednesday, its Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. Trump to visit South Korea Lee and Trump have discussed the idea of trying to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when the American president visits the South, but Pyongyang has not publicly responded to the idea. US officials considered, but never confirmed, a trip to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, according to a person familiar with the discussions. South Korea has suspended tours of the Joint Security Area (JSA) at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom until early November, but has not confirmed any plans for a meeting with Kim. Trump and Kim held three summits during Trump’s 2017 to 2021 first term and exchanged a number of letters that Trump called “beautiful“, before the unprecedented diplomatic effort broke down over US demands that Kim give up his nuclear weapons. In September, Kim expressed “fond memories” of Trump saying there was no reason to avoid talks with the US if Washington stopped insisting his country give up nuclear weapons, but he would never abandon the nuclear arsenal to end sanctions. “It is not at all inconceivable that Donald Trump could here in Washington, DC, say ‘Denuclearisation, that’s our goal, that’s our policy’ and then go up to Panmunjom and say, ‘Oh, you know, Kim Jong Un is a nuclear power’,” said Victor Cha, with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “Even if it’s a short meeting, in the broader scheme of things, with all that the United States has to deal with these days, it wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing.” Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said while a Trump-Kim meeting was not impossible, the US president’s known schedule and timing might make it unlikely. “Trump’s only there for one night, two days, and because of the Xi-Trump meeting, that’s probably taking up all the bandwidth or resources of the US government,” he said. Multiple missiles launched Nuclear-armed North Korea has steadily upgraded its missile capabilities over the past decade, defying multiple United Nations sanctions , having test-launched long-range ballistic missiles with potential ranges to strike the US mainland if fired at a trajectory calibrated for that purpose. South Korea’s military said it had detected movements ahead of the launch, then tracked the projectiles after they were fired and flew about 350 km (217 miles), the military said. The missiles appeared to have fallen inland, a military official separately said. Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said there was no impact on Japan’s security from the North Korean missile launch and Tokyo was sharing real-time information with the US. North Korea last launched ballistic missiles on May 8 when it fired multiple short-range missiles from its east coast. North Korea showcased its latest intercontinental ballistic missile this month at a parade attended by the Chinese premier.",

South Korea has suspended tours of the Joint Security Area (JSA) at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom until early November, but has not confirmed any plans for a meeting with Kim. Trump and Kim held three summits during Trump’s 2017 to 2021 first term and exchanged a number of letters that Trump called “beautiful“, before the unprecedented diplomatic effort broke down over US demands that Kim give up his nuclear weapons. In September, Kim expressed “fond memories” of Trump saying there was no reason to avoid talks with the US if Washington stopped insisting his country give up nuclear weapons, but he would never abandon the nuclear arsenal to end sanctions. “It is not at all inconceivable that Donald Trump could here in Washington, DC, say ‘Denuclearisation, that’s our goal, that’s our policy’ and then go up to Panmunjom and say, ‘Oh, you know, Kim Jong Un is a nuclear power’,” said Victor Cha, with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “Even if it’s a short meeting, in the broader scheme of things, with all that the United States has to deal with these days, it wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing.” Andrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said while a Trump-Kim meeting was not impossible, the US president’s known schedule and timing might make it unlikely. “Trump’s only there for one night, two days, and because of the Xi-Trump meeting, that’s probably taking up all the bandwidth or resources of the US government,” he said. Multiple missiles launched Nuclear-armed North Korea has steadily upgraded its missile capabilities over the past decade, defying multiple United Nations sanctions , having test-launched long-range ballistic missiles with potential ranges to strike the US mainland if fired at a trajectory calibrated for that purpose. South Korea’s military said it had detected movements ahead of the launch, then tracked the projectiles after they were fired and flew about 350 km (217 miles), the military said. The missiles appeared to have fallen inland, a military official separately said. Japan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said there was no impact on Japan’s security from the North Korean missile launch and Tokyo was sharing real-time information with the US. North Korea last launched ballistic missiles on May 8 when it fired multiple short-range missiles from its east coast. North Korea showcased its latest intercontinental ballistic missile this month at a parade attended by the Chinese premier.",

      "summary": "North Korea fired what appeared to be multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday, South Korea’s military said, a week before a key Asia-Pacific leaders’ meeting in South Korea. It was the first launch of ballistic missiles since May by Pyongyang, which has defied a United Nations Security Council ban on the weapons. It was also the first such launch since Lee Jae Myung was elected president in South Korea, with a platform of engagement with North Korea. Lee and United States President Donald Trump are expected to meet in South Korea next week at a summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Trump is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping. South Korea detected several projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles fired from an area near North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, in a northeasterly direction early on Wednesday, its Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.

      "title_orig": "A line of contention",
      "summary_orig": "WHILE the ceasefire agreement might have brought down hostilities and the borders reopened after the weeklong fierce fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the situation remains extremely volatile. The Afghan Taliban leaders continue to insist that the border between the two countries, also known as the Durand Line is “imaginary”, and question its legitimacy. Addressing an online press conference soon after signing the ceasefire agreement with Pakistan in Doha, the Afghan Taliban defence minister emphasised that the “hypothetical” border was not discussed in any part of the accord. It may be so, but the very tenor of his statement is seen as a provocation. True, no Afghan government since the creation of Pakistan has recognised the Durand Line as a legitimate border between the two countries, but the current Taliban administration has raised the issue far more aggressively. There has been a marked intensity in their stance on the Durand Line, particularly over the past few months as tensions with Pakistan escalated. The conservative Islamic regime in Afghanistan, which is yet to be recognised by any country other than Russia, seems to have taken up the cause of Afghan nationalism to divert international scrutiny from its patronage of transnational militant groups operating from their soil. Mullah Yakub’s statement following the Doha meeting indicates that Kabul is still not willing to show any moderation. The current Taliban administration has raised the Durand Line issue far more aggressively. It gives an ironic twist to the widespread international perception that the Afghan Taliban were a proxy of Pakistan. The very fact that much of the current Afghan Taliban leadership led their resistance against American occupation from inside Pakistan had reinforced that view. What was overlooked was the fact that it was largely an alliance of expediency. Relations between the Afghan Taliban and Pakistan during that period were, however, not very smooth. Yet no one expected this level of hostility. Even the first Afghan Taliban government of Mullah Omar, which was very dependent on Pakistan’s support, refused to recognise the Durand Line as a legitimate border, although it never made an issue of it. But some Taliban leaders at that time too were quite vocal on the matter, calling the divide an artificial line that needed to be eliminated. Established in 1893 by the British and the Afghan king Abdur Rehman Khan, the 2,300-kilometre Durand Line, which cuts across KP and Balochistan, was supposed to demarcate the frontier between British India and Afghanistan. When Pakistan became independent, it inherited the agreement as one defining the country’s western frontier. It is recognised as a legitimate border under international law. But Afghanistan has refused to accept the divide. The Durand Line dispute was the main reason why Afghanistan delayed its recognition of Pakistan as an independent state. Although over the years there has been de facto recognition of the Durand Line as a border by successive governments in Kabul, tensions have often resulted in border clashes and blockades. Yet the fierce fighting last week , which reportedly also involved Pakistani air force jets bombing Kabul and other Afghan cities, has not been witnessed before. Pakistan asserts that its actions were in retaliation to the constant armed provocation from across the border and have been in accordance with international law. There has been an unprecedented rise in militant attacks in KP and Balochistan since the return of the Taliban government in Kabul more than four years ago. This year has been the bloodiest in the last one decade and has left hundreds of Pakistani security personnel dead. The reported air strikes were a message to the Taliban administration that the cost of patronising militant groups would be high. Although the Taliban administration has agreed to a ceasefire, there’s no indication yet that it would still be willing to take action against the TTP that it considers their jihadi brethren. According to some Pakistani officials who’ve been involved in negotiations with the Kabul government, there is also the question of the regime’s capacity to take action against well-armed groups with close ties to the local Afghan Taliban commanders. Then there is a fear of TTP fighters joining the Islamic State, which remains active in parts of Afghanistan. Most alarming are the reports of some other transnational groups reorganising in the border regions. It’s not only extremely dangerous for the security of regional states but for Afghanistan itself. In this situation, the Taliban’s provocative stance on the legitimacy of the existing border with Pakistan appears highly dangerous. One plausible explanation for the Afghan Taliban raising the question of the legitimacy of the Durand Line is to mobilise public support particularly in the Pakhtun belt under the banner of nationalism as the country continues to face serious socioeconomic challenges. The country is still facing international sanctions because of its retrogressive policy of barring women from work and restricting their right to education. It seems that some of the punitive actions taken by the Pakistan government, including the move to expel hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees, has worsened Islamabad’s differences with the Taliban government. It was certainly a very unwise move by Pakistan and violates human rights. Such policies have fuelled public anger. Indeed, one can understand why Pakistan is losing patience with the cross-border terrorist attacks on its security forces. Nevertheless, Islamabad should exercise prudence. It is not in the interest of a country facing internal and external challenges to escalate the situation. It was certainly a wise decision to agree to a ceasefire and sit at the negotiating table. The conflict has affected the lives of millions of people on both sides of the border. While the Doha meeting has produced a ceasefire, one hopes that the next round of talks, to be held in Istanbul soon, will help remove many more hurdles in the way of peace in the region. The involvement of regional countries in bringing down tensions has been most positive. It is in the interest of both countries to settle all their differences through negotiations.

      "summary_en": "WHILE the ceasefire agreement might have brought down hostilities and the borders reopened after the weeklong fierce fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the situation remains extremely volatile. The Afghan Taliban leaders continue to insist that the border between the two countries, also known as the Durand Line is “imaginary”, and question its legitimacy. Addressing an online press conference soon after signing the ceasefire agreement with Pakistan in Doha, the Afghan Taliban defence minister emphasised that the “hypothetical” border was not discussed in any part of the accord. It may be so, but the very tenor of his statement is seen as a provocation. True, no Afghan government since the creation of Pakistan has recognised the Durand Line as a legitimate border between the two countries, but the current Taliban administration has raised the issue far more aggressively. There has been a marked intensity in their stance on the Durand Line, particularly over the past few months as tensions with Pakistan escalated. The conservative Islamic regime in Afghanistan, which is yet to be recognised by any country other than Russia, seems to have taken up the cause of Afghan nationalism to divert international scrutiny from its patronage of transnational militant groups operating from their soil. Mullah Yakub’s statement following the Doha meeting indicates that Kabul is still not willing to show any moderation. The current Taliban administration has raised the Durand Line issue far more aggressively. It gives an ironic twist to the widespread international perception that the Afghan Taliban were a proxy of Pakistan. The very fact that much of the current Afghan Taliban leadership led their resistance against American occupation from inside Pakistan had reinforced that view. What was overlooked was the fact that it was largely an alliance of expediency. Relations between the Afghan Taliban and Pakistan during that period were, however, not very smooth. Yet no one expected this level of hostility. Even the first Afghan Taliban government of Mullah Omar, which was very dependent on Pakistan’s support, refused to recognise the Durand Line as a legitimate border, although it never made an issue of it. But some Taliban leaders at that time too were quite vocal on the matter, calling the divide an artificial line that needed to be eliminated. Established in 1893 by the British and the Afghan king Abdur Rehman Khan, the 2,300-kilometre Durand Line, which cuts across KP and Balochistan, was supposed to demarcate the frontier between British India and Afghanistan. When Pakistan became independent, it inherited the agreement as one defining the country’s western frontier. It is recognised as a legitimate border under international law. But Afghanistan has refused to accept the divide. The Durand Line dispute was the main reason why Afghanistan delayed its recognition of Pakistan as an independent state. Although over the years there has been de facto recognition of the Durand Line as a border by successive governments in Kabul, tensions have often resulted in border clashes and blockades. Yet the fierce fighting last week , which reportedly also involved Pakistani air force jets bombing Kabul and other Afghan cities, has not been witnessed before. Pakistan asserts that its actions were in retaliation to the constant armed provocation from across the border and have been in accordance with international law. There has been an unprecedented rise in militant attacks in KP and Balochistan since the return of the Taliban government in Kabul more than four years ago.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: As a virtual ‘ceasefire’ between the two main ruling allies — the PML-N and PPP — appears to be holding for now, it seems the latter has been pacified following the launch of a rehabilitation project in Punjab, under which around Rs100 billion will be provided to the flood-hit people in the province. Indeed, verbal attacks from both sides had stopped after a couple of meetings held at the PM Office, and the PPP’s subsequent CEC meeting over the weekend, where the party decided to adopt a wait-and-see approach on whether its demands would be catered to. The PPP, which had earlier raised reservations over Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s unwillingness to providing relief to flood victims through BISP, seems to have been convinced to some extent that the programme she has announced will be adequate enough to help those who are in need. Although PM Shehbaz Sharif had agreed to try and prevail upon the provincial government to accede to the PPP’s demand in toto, he was assured by CM Maryam in a subsequent meeting that the comprehensive provincial package for flood rehabilitation package would be adequate for the purpose. The premier, thereafter, seemed content that if things work out as planned, there would be no need to activate BISP in Punjab for this purpose. Talking to Dawn , senior PPP leader Syed Nayyar Hussain Bokhari, who was present in the meeting between the Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari-led delegation and PM Shehbaz, said that if the provincial government was providing a comprehensive rehabilitation package to the people, his party will have “no objections”. However, he wondered why the Punjab government had refused to provide funds through the BISP, when it had taken a share from the loans that the federal government received from donors and international lenders. When contacted, Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who had also attended the PM-Bilawal meeting, told Dawn that the premier had made a promise to Mr Bhutto-Zardari regarding assistance to flood victims in Punjab. However, he added that on the very next day, another important meeting was held at PM House, which was attended by the chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan. “In that meeting, the Punjab CM assured the PM that she was going to launch a major programme for flood victims in the province and after that there will be no need to get additional funds from the BISP,” he elaborated. “Following this, the premier was convinced that if Punjab is providing adequate funds from its own kitty, then why should the federal government, which has limited funds, spend its money for the same cause.” Another senior PPP leader, who did not wish to be named, said his party had no objection if the BISP was not being used for flood programmes in Punjab, provided that the rehabilitation package recently launched by CM Maryam would fully compensate the flood-hit people, especially farmers. The leader said the recent protests by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Paki­stan was one of the reasons that the party had stopped its confrontation with the PML-N as the country was passing through a critical situation in which all ruling allies needed to stand together to foil any attempt to disrupt peace in the country.

      "summary_orig": "The deadlock over the Asia Cup trophy — which India refused to collect at the closing ceremony last month amid Pakistan-India hostilities — continued on Tuesday as the Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) contacted Asian Cricket Council (ACC) head Mohsin Naqvi to hand over the trophy, Indian media reported citing sources. Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told reporters in Karachi on Tuesday that the ACC has informed the BCCI that a formal ceremony will be held in Dubai on December 10 to present India with the trophy. Dawn.com understands that Naqvi, as ACC chief, is keen on handing over the trophy himself following the farcical scenes that followed after last month’s final between Pakistan and India. Defending champions India edged Pakistan by five-wickets in a last-over thriller to win the Asia Cup title at the Dubai International Stadium last month. However, the closing ceremony descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi. There were no customary handshakes before the match between the teams after India refused. Pakistan captain Sal­m­an Agha said India had “ disrespected cricket ”, whe­­­r­­eas his counterpart Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup, which has been overshadowed by ill-will on both sides. A couple days after the incident, Naqvi posted on X saying: “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me. The Press Trust of India reported today that the cricket boards of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka backed BCCI’s correspondence to Naqvi. “A top ACC source told PTI that Naqvi has insisted that a BCCI representative collect the trophy from him at the body’s headquarters in Dubai but the Indian board has rejected that stance,” PTI said. “The BCCI will bring this matter up in an ICC meeting next month.” According to the ACC source: “The BCCI secretary, BCCI’s ACC representative Rajeev Shukla and representatives of other member boards including Sri Lanka Cricket and Afghanistan had written to the ACC president last week over handing the trophy to India.” The eight-nation Asia Cup remained under spotlight due to political strains between India and Pakistan, the nuclear-armed neighbours, who were competing in an international cricket event four months after a brief but intense military conflict in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgaam attack that killed 26 local tourists in the Indian-occupied Kashmir. The tension between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over into the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Asia Cup staged in the UAE when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts when the arch-rivals met in their group stage match in Dubai. Suryakumar was widely criticised for politicising the Asia Cup when he mentioned Pahalgaam incident and Indian armed forces during his post-ma­tch talk and subsequent news conference. The Pakistan camp, on their part, had avoided media interaction on the occasion of the India match. The tense situation remained the same, rather aggravated as on-field verbal skirmishes between some players took place, when the two sides met in the Super Four stage of the event.",

      "summary_en": "The deadlock over the Asia Cup trophy — which India refused to collect at the closing ceremony last month amid Pakistan-India hostilities — continued on Tuesday as the Board of Control for Cricket India (BCCI) contacted Asian Cricket Council (ACC) head Mohsin Naqvi to hand over the trophy, Indian media reported citing sources. Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told reporters in Karachi on Tuesday that the ACC has informed the BCCI that a formal ceremony will be held in Dubai on December 10 to present India with the trophy. Dawn.com understands that Naqvi, as ACC chief, is keen on handing over the trophy himself following the farcical scenes that followed after last month’s final between Pakistan and India. Defending champions India edged Pakistan by five-wickets in a last-over thriller to win the Asia Cup title at the Dubai International Stadium last month. However, the closing ceremony descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi. There were no customary handshakes before the match between the teams after India refused. Pakistan captain Sal­m­an Agha said India had “ disrespected cricket ”, whe­­­r­­eas his counterpart Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup, which has been overshadowed by ill-will on both sides.

      "summary_orig": "Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Tuesday reiterated that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity would be met with a ’firm and decisive response The army chief’s affirmation came in the wake of a border conflict with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan as long-simmering tensions over cross-border terrorism boiled over into outright fighting , along with charged statements from India’s civil-military leadership. The military’s top brass had warned India earlier this month that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”. A press release issued from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief interacted with participants of the 17th National Workshop Balochistan at the General Headquarters. “The COAS reiterated that while Pakistan seeks regional peace and stability, any violation of its territorial integrity, direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response to safeguard the lives and well-being of its citizens,” the ISPR said. The military’s media wing added that the army chief underscored that “Indian sponsored proxies” Fitna al-Hindustan and Fitna al-Khawarij propagated “anti-people and anti-development agendas with malicious intent to perpetrate violence”. He reaffirmed that all necessary actions were being taken to pursue them and rid Balochistan of their menace. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. “The COAS, during his interaction with the participants, remarked that Balochistan is the pride of Pakistan, endowed with highly vibrant, resilient and patriotic people who are its true wealth. He also highlighted the federal and provincial governments’ development initiatives, being undertaken to uplift the socio-economic landscape of Balochistan through a people-centric approach. He emphasised upon realisation of the immense economic potential of the province for the benefit of the people of Balochistan.” “Acknowledging the constructive role of civil society, particularly in engaging and empowering the youth, the COAS underscored their pivotal role in sustainable development, negating vested political agendas in the interest of long-term prosperity in Balochistan,” the ISPR added. On Saturday, the army chief had cautioned India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country. He had also urged the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence and called on the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”. “Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he had asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “ Operation Bunyanum Marsoos ”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.",

      "summary_en": "Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Tuesday reiterated that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity would be met with a ’firm and decisive response The army chief’s affirmation came in the wake of a border conflict with the Taliban regime in Afghanistan as long-simmering tensions over cross-border terrorism boiled over into outright fighting , along with charged statements from India’s civil-military leadership. The military’s top brass had warned India earlier this month that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”. A press release issued from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief interacted with participants of the 17th National Workshop Balochistan at the General Headquarters. “The COAS reiterated that while Pakistan seeks regional peace and stability, any violation of its territorial integrity, direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response to safeguard the lives and well-being of its citizens,” the ISPR said. The military’s media wing added that the army chief underscored that “Indian sponsored proxies” Fitna al-Hindustan and Fitna al-Khawarij propagated “anti-people and anti-development agendas with malicious intent to perpetrate violence”. He reaffirmed that all necessary actions were being taken to pursue them and rid Balochistan of their menace. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. “The COAS, during his interaction with the participants, remarked that Balochistan is the pride of Pakistan, endowed with highly vibrant, resilient and patriotic people who are its true wealth. He also highlighted the federal and provincial governments’ development initiatives, being undertaken to uplift the socio-economic landscape of Balochistan through a people-centric approach. He emphasised upon realisation of the immense economic potential of the province for the benefit of the people of Balochistan.” “Acknowledging the constructive role of civil society, particularly in engaging and empowering the youth, the COAS underscored their pivotal role in sustainable development, negating vested political agendas in the interest of long-term prosperity in Balochistan,” the ISPR added.
