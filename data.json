      "summary_orig": "Seven sets of remains from the Jeju April 3 Uprising whose identities had been unknown for 77 years have been returned to their families, highlighting decades-long efforts to identify the victims of state-led violence that killed tens of thousands on the island. A ceremony for newly identified victims was held at the Jeju 4.3 Peace Park in Jeju City on Tuesday. The victims include five people who disappeared after being transferred to prisons outside Jeju and two who went missing on the island. The Jeju April 3 uprising, which took place between 1947 and 1954, was a period of violence on the island carried out by government forces, marked by clashes with armed leftist groups. An estimated 25,000 to 30,000 people — many of them civilians — were killed, representing more than one-tenth of the island’s population at the time. The remains of the newly identified victims include three excavated in Daejeon in 2021, two recovered in Gyeongsan, North Gyeongsang Province, in 2008, and two unearthed at Jeju International Airport in 2007 and 2009.

      "summary_orig": "AFTER several weeks of tension in the region, the US and Iran are due to return to the negotiating table in the days ahead. Though the talks were initially scheduled in Turkiye, Oman will now reportedly serve as the new venue of the parleys. This is indeed a welcome development and a step back from the brink for all sides. Yet we must be under no illusion; the threat of a conflict continues to exist and unless all participants, particularly the US, engage in good faith, the danger of a devastating regional war has yet to pass. The Iranian president has given the green light for “fair and equitable negotiations” in an environment “free from threats and unreasonable expectations”. His US counterpart Donald Trump, meanwhile, has sent mixed messages about the prospect of talks. Pakistan is also reportedly due to attend the negotiations. Assuming the talks go ahead, it will be naïve to expect an immediate breakthrough, as both sides have diametrically opposed positions. Yet diplomacy is always preferable to war, and perhaps these parleys can lay the groundwork for more substantive talks. However, if the US insists on its maximalist demands — that Iran stop its nuclear activities, give up its ballistic missile arsenal, and suspend support for regional allies such as Hezbollah and the Houthis — then the fate of the talks may already have been sealed. In fact, there are credible reports that Israel is pushing the US to insist on these demands. While Iran is willing to discuss the nuclear issue, its missile programme and relations with regional armed groups are off the table. Hence, the US should not bow to Israeli pressure, and go into the negotiations without setting preconditions. A good place to start would be resurrecting the 2015 nuclear agreement, which Mr Trump tore up in 2018. There is a lot riding on the scheduled talks. Diplomats from around the region have been crisscrossing capitals in order to avoid war. The US has not helped by amassing thousands of additional troops and military hardware around Iran’s frontiers. All regional states know that war would be devastating for the global economy, and stability in the region, hence the shuttle diplomacy. The Iranian supreme leader has himself said that an American attack would trigger a regional war , and there is reason to heed his words. It is therefore hoped that diplomacy wins the day. President Trump should approach the Iranians with respect and an open mind, and not give in to the pressure his Zionist and neocon allies are surely applying on him to ‘get’ Iran this time when the Islamic Republic appears to be weak internally and externally. If the negotiations fail, the whole region may be consumed by a terrifying inferno. Published in Dawn, February 5th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ABU DHABI: Russia on Wednesday demanded Ukraine accept its conditions to end the four-year-war and vowed to press on with its invasion otherwise, as negotiations between the two sides opened in Abu Dhabi. The US-mediated talks are the latest round of negotiations in a flurry of diplomacy that has so far failed to strike a deal to halt the war, unleashed by Russia’s February 2022 invasion . The war has spiralled into Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II, with hundreds of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes in Ukraine and much of eastern and southern Ukraine decimated. “Our position is well known,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday as the talks got underway. EU member states agree Ukraine may use 90bn-euro loan to buy arms from close allies “Until the Kyiv regime makes the appropriate decisions, the special military operation continues,” he said, using Russia’s term for the offensive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had on Tuesday said that Russia’s strikes on Kyiv’s energy system “confirms that attitudes in Moscow have not changed: they continue to bet on war and the destruction of Ukraine, and they do not take diplomacy seriously.” “The work of our negotiating team will be adjusted accordingly,” he said, without elaborating. US President Donald Trump, however, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had “kept his word” with a week-long promise not to hit the capital or critical energy facilities. “It’s a lot, you know, one week, we’ll take anything, because it’s really, really cold over there,” Trump said on Tuesday. “I want him to end the war,” Trump added of Putin. Asked if he was disappointed Putin had not extended the pause, he replied: “I would like him to.” Sticking point in talks The main sticking point in the talks to settle the conflict is the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is demanding that Kyiv pull its troops out of swathes of the Donbas , including heavily fortified cities atop vast natural resources, as a precondition of any deal. It also wants international recognition that land seized in the invasion belongs to Russia. Kyiv has said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected a unilateral pull-back of forces. Ukraine’s top negotiator Rustem Umerov confirmed the talks had started Wednesday in a trilateral format. Trump has despatched his ubiquitous envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner to try to corral the sides to an agreement. Ukraine’s Umerov is seen a shrewd negotiator, hailed by colleagues as a worker of diplomatic “wonders”. Russia’s top negotiator is military intelligence director Igor Kostyukov, a career naval officer sanctioned in the West over his role in the Ukraine invasion. Russia occupies around 20 per cent of Ukraine, but Kyiv still controls around one-fifth of the Donetsk region. EU loan for Ukraine In a related development, EU countries on Wednesday agreed Ukraine could use a new 90-billion-euro ($118 billion) loan to buy a greater share of weapons from close allies like Britain, if those countries contribute financially, officials said. The EU said in a statement key allies could gain more access if they pay “a fair and proportionate financial contribution to the costs arising from borrowing”. Published in Dawn, February 5th, 2026",

US President Donald Trump, however, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had “kept his word” with a week-long promise not to hit the capital or critical energy facilities. “It’s a lot, you know, one week, we’ll take anything, because it’s really, really cold over there,” Trump said on Tuesday. “I want him to end the war,” Trump added of Putin. Asked if he was disappointed Putin had not extended the pause, he replied: “I would like him to.” Sticking point in talks The main sticking point in the talks to settle the conflict is the long-term fate of territory in eastern Ukraine. Moscow is demanding that Kyiv pull its troops out of swathes of the Donbas , including heavily fortified cities atop vast natural resources, as a precondition of any deal. It also wants international recognition that land seized in the invasion belongs to Russia. Kyiv has said the conflict should be frozen along the current front line and has rejected a unilateral pull-back of forces. Ukraine’s top negotiator Rustem Umerov confirmed the talks had started Wednesday in a trilateral format. Trump has despatched his ubiquitous envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner to try to corral the sides to an agreement. Ukraine’s Umerov is seen a shrewd negotiator, hailed by colleagues as a worker of diplomatic “wonders”. Russia’s top negotiator is military intelligence director Igor Kostyukov, a career naval officer sanctioned in the West over his role in the Ukraine invasion. Russia occupies around 20 per cent of Ukraine, but Kyiv still controls around one-fifth of the Donetsk region. EU loan for Ukraine In a related development, EU countries on Wednesday agreed Ukraine could use a new 90-billion-euro ($118 billion) loan to buy a greater share of weapons from close allies like Britain, if those countries contribute financially, officials said. The EU said in a statement key allies could gain more access if they pay “a fair and proportionate financial contribution to the costs arising from borrowing”. Published in Dawn, February 5th, 2026",

      "summary": "ABU DHABI: Russia on Wednesday demanded Ukraine accept its conditions to end the four-year-war and vowed to press on with its invasion otherwise, as negotiations between the two sides opened in Abu Dhabi. The US-mediated talks are the latest round of negotiations in a flurry of diplomacy that has so far failed to strike a deal to halt the war, unleashed by Russia’s February 2022 invasion . The war has spiralled into Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II, with hundreds of thousands killed, millions forced to flee their homes in Ukraine and much of eastern and southern Ukraine decimated. “Our position is well known,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Wednesday as the talks got underway. EU member states agree Ukraine may use 90bn-euro loan to buy arms from close allies “Until the Kyiv regime makes the appropriate decisions, the special military operation continues,” he said, using Russia’s term for the offensive.

Arabia, Turkiye, Egypt ‘unlikely’ to take part at this stage ISLAMABAD / WASHINGTON: The prospects for talks between Iran and the United States seemed fraught with uncertainty on Wednesday, even after Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi publicly announced the date and timing of the proposed negotiations. “Nuclear talks with the United States are scheduled to be held in Muscat on about 10 am Friday. I’m grateful to our Omani brothers for making all necessary arrangements,” he posted on X late on Wednesday night. A US official also confirmed that the neg­o­tiations are on track, Reuters reported. The statement came amid swirling speculation that the talks had already been called off. Indications of trouble first surfaced after American news website Axios reported that the talks were falling apart, as the US had told Iran that it would not agree to Tehran’s demands to change the location and format of talks. US officials considered the request to change the venue but then decided to reject it, Axios said. “We told them it is this or nothing, and they said, ‘Ok, then nothing,’” a senior US official was quoted as saying. The news outlet later reported, citing two US officials, that plans for US-Iran nuclear talks are back on after several Middle Eastern leaders “urgently lobbied the Trump administration on Wednesday afternoon not to follow through on threats to walk away. “At least nine countries from the region reached out to the White House at the highest levels strongly urging the US not to cancel the meeting,” it added. Insider accounts suggested the talks were salvaged after persistent requests from regional actors, which had originally been slated to participate in the discussions planned for Turkiye, but were later excluded from the round shifted to Oman. These countries — including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye — maintain dir­ect stakes, as they would face significant consequences in the event of a conflict, and thus have sustained their strong interest in the dialogue. Their advocacy seems to have helped preserve at least some channel for de-escalation and prevented the breakdown of diplomacy. Talking to Dawn from Tehran, Iranian officials had suggested that regional players like were unlikely to take part at this stage. Qatar’s prime minister, however, is more likely to be involved alongside Omani interlocutors. Troubled talks Reports about the cancellation of talks started making rounds after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in public remarks, insisted that any engagement would need to address Iran’s ballistic missiles, its regional posture and its domestic governance, alongside nuclear issues. Rubio’s comments, many believed, pointed to divisions within the US administration itself. While President Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been tasked with exploring a diplomatic opening, Rubio articulated a far more expansive and hawkish agenda. For Tehran, this seemed to confirm long-held suspicions that Washington was abandoning the idea of a limited confidence-building process. Iranian officials, therefore, saw the expanded agenda not as a starting point for negotiation, but as an attempt to front-load concessions. A senior Iranian official, however, said the talks would only be about Iran’s nuclear programme, and that its missile programme was “off the table”. The diplomatic efforts come after Trump’s threats of military action against Iran during its crackdown on protesters last month and the deployment of more naval power to the Gulf. After Israel and the United States bombed Iran last summer, renewed friction has kindled fears among regional states of a major conflagration that could rebound on them or cause long-term chaos in Iran. Trump has continued to weigh the option of strikes on Iran, sources say. Oil prices have risen due to the tension. Khamenei ‘should be very worried’ Meanwhile, Trump said on Wednesday that Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be “very worried”, as Washington builds up its military forces in the region. “I would say he should be very worried, yeah, he should be,” Trump said in an interview with US broadcaster NBC News . “As you know, they are negotiating with us.” Trump also said that Iran had eyed a new nuclear site after US strikes. “They were thinking about starting a new site in a different part of the country,” Trump told NBC . “We found out about it, I said, you do that, we’re going to do very bad things to you.” Published in Dawn, February 5th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: A coalition of opposition political parties announced the withdrawal of province-wide protests in Balochistan following a meeting with government officials on Wednesday, a move described as a “goodwill gesture” amid the province’s current security and political situation. In response to the announcement, the Balochistan government agreed to release all government employees recently arrested by police while attempting to enter the “Red Zone”. The decision was reached during a meeting between an authorised government committee and an All Parties delegation representing a broad spectrum of political leadership, including the Awami National Party (ANP), National Party, Pakhtunkhwa National Awami Party (PkNAP), and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). During the session, the political coalition formally ended its protest movement, citing the prevailing circumstances in Balochistan. In turn, the government confirmed it would move forward with the release of detained employees to de-escalate tensions. The two sides scheduled a follow-up meeting for Feb 12. During that session, senior political leaders and the government committee are expected to formulate a comprehensive strategy to resolve all remaining pending issues. The government delegation included Mir Shoaib Nosherwani, provincial minister for finance and minerals; Raheela Hameed Durrani, provincial education minister; and Provincial Minister Ali Madad Jattak. Other government representatives included Pakistan Peoples Party leader Syed Iqbal Shah, Principal Secretary to the Chief Minister Imran Zarkoon, and Special Secretary Finance Arif Khan Achakzai. The All Parties delegation featured prominent leaders, including ANP Prov­incial President Asghar Khan Achakzai, National Party Central Vice President Dr. Ishaq Baloch, PkNAP Provincial President Nasrullah Khan Zerey, and PTI’s Salam Agha. Additional participants included Hazara Democratic Party leader Asmat Yari, ANP’s Sanaullah Kakar, National Party’s Mir Inayat Buzdar, employees’ representative Ismail Kasi, and Inayat Shah of the National Democratic Movement.

      "summary_orig": "Commenting on the decision to boycott the match against India in the T20 World Cup, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that there “should be no politics in sports”. He made the remarks while addressing the federal cabinet in Islamabad. The remarks were televised. “We have taken a clear stand regarding the T20 World Cup that we will not play the match against India,” he said. “There should be no politics in sports,” he said. “We have taken this stand after deliberating on it carefully,” he said, calling it an “appropriate decision”. It should be noted that the government on Sunday gave the cricket team the nod to participate in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held on Feb 15 in Colombo. The development came after Bangladesh’s withdrawal from the tournament amid tensions with India, which is one of the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup. At the start of his address, PM Shehbaz began by talking about the attacks in Balochistan. “Within three to four days, 180 terrorists were sent to hell,” he said. “As a result, 17 personnel embraced martyrdom. Similarly, 31 civilians were martyred.” He added that a “heartbreaking incident” took place in Gwadar, where five women and children were martyred. “These people (terrorists) are not human,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said that the nation would never forget the sacrifice of security forces and that since Marka-i-Haq — the name for Pakistan’s brief military conflict against India last year — Pakistan’s “hostile eastern neighbour” and other khawarij were conspiring against the country’s progress and prosperity. Khawarij is a term used by the state to designate members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. “God willing, this will not happen. We will completely eradicate terrorism and Pakistan will find success on the path of progress,” PM Shehbaz vowed. He added that the nation should remember how terrorists killed women, children and people who were trying to work. “It is a terrible incident and the whole nation is mourning, but it is standing with its law enforcement agencies and the Pakistan armed forces,” the premier added. “The day will come when these sacrifices will be worthwhile and the scourge of terrorism will be erased from this country.” Switching gears and discussing the tensions in Iran, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan has played a “brotherly role”. “Myself, the deputy prime minister and the field marshal met the Iranian leadership on multiple occasions and we had telephone conversations,” he outlined. “We had several discussions and played our brotherly role as best we could.” The premier expressed the hope that through dialogue, a peaceful path would emerge leading to regional peace. Speaking about Kashmir Day on February 5 (tomorrow), PM Shehbaz said that the nation, from Peshawar to Karachi, would express solidarity with freedom movements within the Indian-occupied territory. “The people will express their passionate devotion to Kashmir in different cities,” the premier said. “I personally will be heading to Azad Kashmir tomorrow and we will convey a message of solidarity on behalf of the whole nation.” PM Shehbaz then spoke about his meeting with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. “I called him the day he was elected and assured him that he would have the full support of the Centre, regardless of whatever party he belongs to,” the premier recounted. “I told him that Pakistan comes before the party and that he is the chief minister of an important, beautiful province where the people are proud Pakistanis and brave. They have also sacrificed much.” The premier noted that during the 2010 National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Rs800 billion was allocated to KP for counter-terrorism, security and policing. “I told him that we gave this money under the NFC, but we have yet to see the results,” he said. “I said that the Safe City project remains incomplete, but he assured me that he intends to complete it. “I spoke to him again , and he mentioned that some payments have been delayed,” the premier added. “I immediately tasked [Planning Minister] Ahsan Iqbal, the finance minister and the finance secretary to meet him (KP CM) and, wherever there are delays in payments, to resolve them,” he said.",

      "summary_en": "Commenting on the decision to boycott the match against India in the T20 World Cup, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that there “should be no politics in sports”. He made the remarks while addressing the federal cabinet in Islamabad. The remarks were televised. “We have taken a clear stand regarding the T20 World Cup that we will not play the match against India,” he said. “There should be no politics in sports,” he said. “We have taken this stand after deliberating on it carefully,” he said, calling it an “appropriate decision”. It should be noted that the government on Sunday gave the cricket team the nod to participate in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held on Feb 15 in Colombo. The development came after Bangladesh’s withdrawal from the tournament amid tensions with India, which is one of the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup. At the start of his address, PM Shehbaz began by talking about the attacks in Balochistan. “Within three to four days, 180 terrorists were sent to hell,” he said. “As a result, 17 personnel embraced martyrdom. Similarly, 31 civilians were martyred.” He added that a “heartbreaking incident” took place in Gwadar, where five women and children were martyred. “These people (terrorists) are not human,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said that the nation would never forget the sacrifice of security forces and that since Marka-i-Haq — the name for Pakistan’s brief military conflict against India last year — Pakistan’s “hostile eastern neighbour” and other khawarij were conspiring against the country’s progress and prosperity. Khawarij is a term used by the state to designate members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. “God willing, this will not happen. We will completely eradicate terrorism and Pakistan will find success on the path of progress,” PM Shehbaz vowed.

However, he added, “Now that the situation is returning to normal, it has been decided to restore mobile internet service from tomorrow at 12am midnight.” Meanwhile, mobile data services reportedly remained suspended in Nushki and Sibi, as well as in Mastung where services were briefly restored. Mobile data has been inaccessible for those in Kalat, Khuzdar, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat for varying periods due to prior security concerns. Separately, a spokesperson for Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, Muhammad Kashif, told Dawn that train services from Quetta to other parts of the country remain suspended. He added that “once the security situation improves and we receive clearance, services of the Jaffar Express (Quetta-Peshawar) and the Bolan Mail (Quetta-Karachi) will be restored”. On Tuesday, security forces continued ‘mop-up actions’ in Nushki district and other parts of the province following the coordinated attacks, with the number of terrorists killed now at 197. In Nushki, armed men had attacked various government offices on Saturday, including a police station, judicial complex, police lines, Deputy Commissioner (DC) office and a Federal Constabulary (FC) camp in the town, and set some government buildings on fire. But while the town of Nushki has been cleared and bazaars reopened after three days, search operations by security forces are continuing in the mountainous areas of the district, officials told Dawn.",

      "summary_orig": "The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has strongly condemned the series of terrorist attacks across multiple locations in Balochistan. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the UNSC said the attacks, which occurred on January 31, 2026, were carried out across the province and described them as “heinous and cowardly acts of terrorism”. The UNSC expressed its “deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governor and people of Pakistan”. The council also wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured in the attacks. The statement reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”. It added that it was crucial to “hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers, and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice,” urging all states to cooperate with the government of Pakistan in accordance with international law and relevant UNSC resolutions. The UNSC reiterated that “any act of terrorism is criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of motivation, timing, or perpetrator”. It further stressed that all states must combat terrorism “by all means, in accordance with the UN Charter and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, and international humanitarian law,” in order to address threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. Earlier on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combating terrorism. “We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said. The number of terrorists killed in clearance operations across Balochistan has risen to 197, as security forces continued ‘ mop-up’ actions in Nushki district and other parts of the province. The clearance operations follow several coordinated terrorist attacks staged across the province on Saturday.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s spin-heavy squad are in winning form ahead of the T20 World Cup, but a controversial decision to forfeit their marquee clash against India could still trigger another early exit. Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with Bangladesh , who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns. The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15. With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A. It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention. Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18. Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands. “That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said. The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that. “Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said. Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group. The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly Babar Azam’s low strike rate , under scrutiny. The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents. Confidence restored Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand. However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence. Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia. “We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub. “We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said. The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease. The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah. Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive. Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component. When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat. Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan. For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.",
