      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Friday extended the airspace ban for Indian aircraft till October 24, according to a statement by the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA). Last month, the government extended the closure of its airspace to Indian aircr­aft for another month, until September 25, according to a NOTAM (notice to airmen) issued on August 22. New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating April’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire. On April 24, Pakistan’s top brass had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country. PAA spokesperson Saifullah Khan confirmed to Dawn.com that the airspace closure for Indian aircraft had been extended till October 24. A copy of the NOTAM, available with Dawn.com , also confirmed the closure. “Pakistan’s airspace will remain closed to Indian registered aircraft. This ban applies to all aircraft owned, operated or leased by Indian airlines or operators. This includes military flights,” the statement by the PAA spokesperson said. “The ban will come into effect from 1:00 PM (PKT) on 19 September 2025 and will end at 4:59 AM (PKT) on October 24 2025 (end time is approximate). The ban will be effective from ground level to unlimited altitude,” the PAA said. The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces multiple times during the hostilities last month. Pakis­tan reopened its airspace for all types of flig­hts on May 10 after the ceasefire was announced.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday that the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia earlier this week would not be used to threaten any other country. Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday. On Thursday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif stated in an interview that the pact was defensive in nature. During a weekly press briefing today, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan called the agreement “an important milestone for promoting peace and security in the region and the world” and noted that since the 1960s, a key pillar of the ties between Islamabad and Riyadh has been defence cooperation. “The Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement formalises this decades-old and robust defence partnership,” the spokesperson said. “It is defensive in nature and not directed against any third country. It will contribute to regional peace, security and stability.” Khan added that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received a telephone call from the Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty on Thursday night, congratulating him on the landmark agreement. “The strategic defence agreement is a milestone in promoting partnership and trust,” the spokesperson said, quoting the Egyptian FM. “Both foreign ministers discussed regional and global issues and emphasised the importance of peace, stability and economic development.” According to the spokesperson, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia enjoy a “long and distinguished history of brotherhood and cooperation”. “[The] Pakistan-Saudi Arabia bilateral relationship is unique, enduring and multifaceted,” Khan outlined. “The leadership of the two countries share the common vision to take it to new heights. “The relationship lives in the hearts of the people of [the] two countries. [The] people of Pakistan have special sentiments for Saudi Arabia, the land of Mecca and Madinah, and they hold the Royal family in high esteem for being the custodian of the holy sites.",

      "title_orig": "Fact check: Viral video does not show Houthi official threatening Pakistan after Saudi defence deal",
      "summary_orig": "Post from multiple Indian users on social media platform X on Friday shared a video clip of a Houthi official, claiming that it showed him threatening Pakistan for allegedly sending troops to the Saudi–Yemen border amid the signing of a mutual defence deal with the kingdom. However, the video is old and does not show the Houthi official talking about Pakistan. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh on Sept 16, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. A statement from the PM’s office announcing the signing of the pact read: “This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression.” A known Indian propaganda account shared the picture of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on X today, along with a video clip of a Houthi official. The caption of the post said: “Breaking: Tensions escalate after Pakistan sends 25,000 troops to the Saudi–Yemen border under a new defence pact. Houthi fighters issued a stark threat, saying they will ‘turn the Yemen–Saudi border into a graveyard for Pakistani soldiers’, raising fears of wider confrontation.” The video attached to the post did not have any subtitles or a translation of what the person was saying. It also did not mention the identity of the person in the video clip. The post gained over 359,000 views. The video with the same claim was shared by multiple other users on X as can be seen here , here , here and here . A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the defence agreement signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. A keyword search to corroborate the alleged developments yielded no news reports from credible mainstream international, Saudi, Yemeni or domestic media outlets about either Pakistan sending 25,000 troops to the Saudi-Yemen border or the Houthis threatening Pakistan for any such move. To corroborate what was actually being said in the video, its content was translated into English through AI transcription tool Turboscribe, which showed that the Houthi official did not say anything about threatening Pakistan. Translating the video through ChatGPT and Google Translate also yielded the following transcription: “For us, Gaza is a red line — a red line. Our causes, our sanctities, and our Islam are a red line, and we do not compromise on them. In his last speech, Sayyid [the leader] said: There are no red lines in front of the Yemeni people. No red lines. If you have red lines, we have none in front of us. We will target things the enemy has never thought of, never imagined, and not even the Yemeni people or the peoples of the [Muslim] nation have imagined. And we will reach, by God’s permission and with His power, the fifth and sixth stages. If the enemy’s aggression continues against Gaza, there will be positions and actions that not even the Yemeni spirit could have imagined.” A reverse image search yielded a video report by Lebanon-based news outlet Al Mayadeen News on its YouTube channel on May 14, 2024. Comparing the viral clip with the original video showed that they were the same, as can be seen by the writing in the background, the speaker’s hand gestures and his facial features. The translation of the news clip is provided below: Anchor: “From the Yemeni support front, Yemeni Armed Forces spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree confirmed that Gaza is a red line and that operations are open with no red lines. He also stressed that if the aggression against Gaza continues, the armed forces will strike targets that the enemies cannot imagine.” Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree: “If Gaza is a red line, then our causes, our sanctities, and our Islam are red lines, and we will not compromise on them. I heard Mr Al-Shammari say in the last test that there are no red lines for the Yemeni people, no red lines. If you have red lines for us, they are not red lines. We will target things that the enemy has not thought of, that the enemy cannot imagine, that even the Yemeni people and the peoples of the nation cannot imagine. And we will reach the fifth and sixth stages, God willing and with God’s power, if the enemy continues its aggression against Gaza. This means that there will be situations that even the Yemeni people cannot imagine, and that even the Americans cannot imagine.” The Al Mayadeen News report mentions the person speaking as Yemeni Armed Forces’ spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree. The translated transcription shows that he did not mention Pakistan in his statements. A keyword search for further information on the video yielded a news article published by Iranian news outlet Press TV on May 14, 2024, titled “Yemen warns it may strike targets enemy ‘can’t even imagine’”. According to the report, Saree warned that Yemen’s armed forces might escalate their pro-Palestinian strikes if Israel kept up its “ongoing genocidal war” against the Gaza Strip. The articles quoted Saree as saying: “Gaza is a red line for us, a red line. Our causes, holy sites and our Islam are red lines, and we will not compromise on them. We target things that the enemy hasn’t thought of and can’t imagine, things that neither the Yemeni people nor the people of the [Arab and Islamic] nation can imagine.” Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video clip shows a Houthi official threatening Pakistan after the signing of a mutual defence deal with Saudi Arabia is false . The video is old from May 2024 and shows Houthi spokesperson Yahya Saree talking about Israel and the Gaza conflict. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

      "summary_en": "Post from multiple Indian users on social media platform X on Friday shared a video clip of a Houthi official, claiming that it showed him threatening Pakistan for allegedly sending troops to the Saudi–Yemen border amid the signing of a mutual defence deal with the kingdom. However, the video is old and does not show the Houthi official talking about Pakistan. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh on Sept 16, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. A statement from the PM’s office announcing the signing of the pact read: “This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression.” A known Indian propaganda account shared the picture of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman on X today, along with a video clip of a Houthi official. The caption of the post said: “Breaking: Tensions escalate after Pakistan sends 25,000 troops to the Saudi–Yemen border under a new defence pact. Houthi fighters issued a stark threat, saying they will ‘turn the Yemen–Saudi border into a graveyard for Pakistani soldiers’, raising fears of wider confrontation.” The video attached to the post did not have any subtitles or a translation of what the person was saying. It also did not mention the identity of the person in the video clip. The post gained over 359,000 views. The video with the same claim was shared by multiple other users on X as can be seen here , here , here and here . A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the defence agreement signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. A keyword search to corroborate the alleged developments yielded no news reports from credible mainstream international, Saudi, Yemeni or domestic media outlets about either Pakistan sending 25,000 troops to the Saudi-Yemen border or the Houthis threatening Pakistan for any such move. To corroborate what was actually being said in the video, its content was translated into English through AI transcription tool Turboscribe, which showed that the Houthi official did not say anything about threatening Pakistan. Translating the video through ChatGPT and Google Translate also yielded the following transcription: “For us, Gaza is a red line — a red line. Our causes, our sanctities, and our Islam are a red line, and we do not compromise on them. In his last speech, Sayyid [the leader] said: There are no red lines in front of the Yemeni people. No red lines. If you have red lines, we have none in front of us. We will target things the enemy has never thought of, never imagined, and not even the Yemeni people or the peoples of the [Muslim] nation have imagined. And we will reach, by God’s permission and with His power, the fifth and sixth stages. If the enemy’s aggression continues against Gaza, there will be positions and actions that not even the Yemeni spirit could have imagined.” A reverse image search yielded a video report by Lebanon-based news outlet Al Mayadeen News on its YouTube channel on May 14, 2024. Comparing the viral clip with the original video showed that they were the same, as can be seen by the writing in the background, the speaker’s hand gestures and his facial features. The translation of the news clip is provided below: Anchor: “From the Yemeni support front, Yemeni Armed Forces spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree confirmed that Gaza is a red line and that operations are open with no red lines. He also stressed that if the aggression against Gaza continues, the armed forces will strike targets that the enemies cannot imagine.” Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree: “If Gaza is a red line, then our causes, our sanctities, and our Islam are red lines, and we will not compromise on them. I heard Mr Al-Shammari say in the last test that there are no red lines for the Yemeni people, no red lines. If you have red lines for us, they are not red lines. We will target things that the enemy has not thought of, that the enemy cannot imagine, that even the Yemeni people and the peoples of the nation cannot imagine. And we will reach the fifth and sixth stages, God willing and with God’s power, if the enemy continues its aggression against Gaza. This means that there will be situations that even the Yemeni people cannot imagine, and that even the Americans cannot imagine.” The Al Mayadeen News report mentions the person speaking as Yemeni Armed Forces’ spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Saree. The translated transcription shows that he did not mention Pakistan in his statements.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and India will clash again in the Asia Cup on Sunday, renewing one of cricket’s fiercest rivalries a week after their last match was overshadowed by a handshake row. India won the September 14 group match by seven wickets in Dubai and afterwards refused to shake hands with their opponents in a controversial move. It was the first meeting between the neighbours since a four-day cross-border conflict in May left more than 70 people dead. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged a protest with the International Cricket Council (ICC), alleging that match referee Andy Pycroft had told skipper Salman Ali Agha not to approach Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav for a handshake at the toss. The PCB demanded that Pycroft be removed from their matches and threatened to withdraw from the eight-team Twenty20 competition. Their last group game was held up for an hour before the PCB said Pycroft had apologised and the match, with the Zimbabwean in charge, eventually went ahead. Pakistan beat hosts, the United Arab Emirates, to qualify for the next stage, the Super Fours, and set up another meeting with India in Dubai. Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for Sunday’s clash. India spinner Kuldeep Yadav sought to defuse the controversy. “When you step onto the field, it’s just a batter in front of you. I have always approached it this way against Pakistan,” he said ahead of India’s last group game, against Oman today. Salman also stuck to sports. “If we play good cricket like we have played in the last few months, I think we’ll be good against any side,” the Pakistan captain told reporters . Simmering tensions Because of fraught political ties, nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan only meet at neutral venues during multi-team tournaments. Tensions soared ahead of the Asia Cup after the two countries engaged in their worst conflict since 1999. The hostilities in May left more than 70 people dead in missile, drone and artillery exchanges, before a ceasefire . The conflict was triggered by an April attack on civilians in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir that New Delhi accused Pakistan of backing, a charge Islamabad denies . India resisted calls to boycott the first Pakistan match. A potential third India-Pakistan showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai. India lifted the Asia Cup in its last, 50-over edition and are the favourites to retain the crown. India and Pakistan advanced to the next stage from Group A, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh qualified from Group B. Sri Lanka face Bangladesh on Saturday in the first Super Fours fixture. The Lankan Lions, unbeaten so far, look dangerous while Bangladesh carry the underdog tag under skipper Litton Das. Along with regional bragging rights, the Asia Cup serves as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.",

Along with regional bragging rights, the Asia Cup serves as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.",

      "title_orig": "Taliban release detained elderly British couple from Afghanistan jail",
      "summary_orig": "An elderly British couple detained in Afghanistan for almost eight months were released on Friday, the Taliban authorities said, after pressure built to free the pair due to fears over their health. Taliban officials have refused to detail why Peter Reynolds, 80, and his wife Barbara, 76, were arrested in February as they were returning to their home. “We’ve been treated very well. We’re looking forward to seeing our children,” said Barbara, in a red headscarf, standing next to her bearded husband, near a plane on the tarmac of Kabul airport. “We are looking forward to returning to Afghanistan if we can. We are Afghan citizens,” she added, after Qatar-facilitated negotiations for their release. The couple were married in Kabul in 1970, and have spent almost two decades living in Afghanistan, running educational programmes for women and children. They also became official Afghan citizens. When the Taliban returned to power in 2021, the couple remained in Afghanistan against the advice of the British embassy. Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi, in a statement posted on social media, said the couple were handed over to the UK’s special representative to the countr,y Richard Lindsay. “Two British nationals named Peter and Barbara Reynolds, who had violated the laws of Afghanistan, were released from custody today following the judicial process,” Balkhi added. Images of the couple standing together with Lindsay at Kabul airport before their departure to the Qatari capital Doha were broadcast on Sky News. “They are very relieved to be going home,” Lindsay told the broadcaster. The couple were first held in a maximum security facility, “then in underground cells, without daylight, before being transferred” to the intelligence services in Kabul, according to UN experts. The release of the British couple is a “moment of immense joy”, their family said today. “We are overwhelmed with gratitude and relief to share that our parents, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after seven months and 21 days in detention by the Taliban,” the family said. Thanking Qatari officials for facilitating the negotiations, the family said their “dedication and humanity have made an unforgettable impact on our lives”, and also thanked the UK government for ensuring the couple had access to medication. “This experience has reminded us of the power of diplomacy, empathy, and international cooperation. While the road to recovery will be long as our parents regain their health and spend time with their family, today is a day of tremendous joy and relief,” the family said in a statement. In a latest update, an AFP journalist reported that the couple has arrived in Qatar. In late July, the independent UN human rights experts called for the Taliban government to free the pair, warning of the “rapid deterioration” of their physical and mental health, stating that they “risk irreparable harm or even death”. Their family had made repeated pleas about their ailing health after their arrest. Hamish Falconer, the UK’s minister for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, said in a statement that he was “relieved… their ordeal has come to an end”. He added that it was against travel advice for British citizens to visit Afghanistan, warning that the government’s ability to offer consular assistance “is extremely limited”. Russia is the only country to have officially recognised the Taliban government, which has imposed a strict version of Islamic law and been accused of sweeping human rights violations. Only a handful of embassies have reopened in the capital after most were evacuated at the end of the NATO-led war against Taliban militants. Foreign ministry spokesman Balkhi in his statement said that the government “does not view the matters of citizens from a political or transactional angle”, adding that “Afghans, wherever they may be, should also receive consular services”. It comes after Washington’s special envoy on hostages, Adam Boehler, made a rare visit on Saturday to Kabul to discuss the possibility of a prisoner exchange. At least one US citizen, Mahmood Habibi, is held in Afghanistan. Dozens of foreign nationals have been arrested since the Taliban returned to power in August 2021 following the withdrawal of the US military. A Qatari official, on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, told AFP that the couple were “safely released from detention in Afghanistan following mediation led by Qatar”. “The Qataris had been engaged with the Afghan authorities for many months, working in close coordination with the British government,” he added.",

About 6,000 people from 18 residential buildings in the Quarry Bay area will be evacuated on Friday night, with demolition work set to begin early on Saturday morning, police added. Hong Kong was an early target in what would become a full-blown Asian campaign for imperial Japan during the Second World War. The city saw fierce fighting between Japanese and Allied forces during wartime, and hikers and construction workers still occasionally discover unexploded bombs in the territory nearly 100 years later. In May 2018, a bomb was discovered in Hong Kong’s Wan Chai district, which led authorities to evacuate 1,200 residents. Police said the unexploded ordnance unearthed on Friday was of the same type as the one found in 2018. At that time, the bomb disposal process took about 20 hours to complete.",

During the interview, the military spokesperson was asked about Army Chief Asim Munir’s visits to the US and whether they had helped with “warming up” relations between Islamabad and Washington. In his response, Lt-Gen Chaudhry appreciated the US and President Trump’s role in mediating a ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May after a four-day escalation . He said, “Over a period of time, we have been able to enhance and amplify on our convergences (with the US) and deftly managed the divergences.” @dawn.today Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to a “longstanding” relationship with the United States, stating that “there is no either-or in our relations with other countries”. The DG ISPR expressed these views during an interview to a German media outlet. The interview was broadcast by Pakistani television channels on Friday. During the interview, the military spokesperson was asked about Army Chief Asim Munir’s visits to the US and whether they had helped with “warming up” relations between Islamabad and Washington. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com “There are areas where a lot can be done, there are areas where a lot of engagement can be done,” he said, adding that “Pakistan views its relationship with the US as very important.” “We don’t think that these relationships have anything to do — or there is either-or with other countries.” At this point, the interviewer interjected him to mention China, with the DG ISPR continuing — following a cut in the video — that “we, at the same time, have very constructive and strategic relationships with China and other countries.” He said that there is a lot of “scope” for collaboration between the US and Pakistan on the matter of counterterrorism. On that note, he expressed satisfaction over the United States’ recent declaration of the Majeed brigade as a terrorist outfit. Pakistan has proscribed the Majeed Brigade — the terrorist outfit Balochistan Liberation Army’s suicide squad — as a terrorist entity since July 18, 2024. On the question of Pakistan’s concerns over weapons systems left behind by the US in the wake of its withdrawal from Afghanistan, DG ISPR cited the retrieval of US-made weapons from terrorists involved in the Mianwali airbase attack on 4 November 2023 as evidence. He said that “we share all this data with the Americans,” adding that “the amount of weapons left behind by the US is huge.” Quoting a report prepared by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), Lt-Gen Chaudhry said that, “after withdrawal of the United States and NATO forces, more than $7.2 billion worth of US equipment has been left.” On the issue of strained relations with India, DG ISPR referred to the May escalation, noting that “On May 10, actually the fire ceased — it’s the cease of fire that happened, [but] the conflict endures.” “Whether it is the Kashmir issue, whether it is state-sponsored terrorism of India, whether it is the rising extremism of Hindutva mentality, rationality that has gripped India —” Lt-Gen Chaudhry said. Stating Pakistan’s position on the matter, he said, “Pakistan believes that the issues need [a] resolution,” calling for international actors to intervene. “Especially players like the USA, they must intervene,” he said. He went on to say: “We have no doubt in our minds in Pakistan that each and every incident of terrorism that happens in Pakistan — behind that is Indian support and its abetment.” Noting Pakistan’s efforts in curbing terrorism and the frequency of terrorist attacks in the country, DG ISPR highlighted that, “just by the threat that is coming to Pakistan, any sane mind can understand this can not go on without external support.” DG ISPR alleged that, “the base of operation that the Indians use is Afghanistan, the whole of terrorism that is being done is executed by the Indians over there.” “Indians have a playbook of using terror as a tool of state,” he said, claiming that their “main tools” at the moment are terrorist outfits Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and BLA. On the question of insurgency in the country, DG ISPR denied that such a thing existed, stating, “There is no insurgency in Pakistan; the correct term is terrorist,” he said. Asked if the grievances of the people in Balochistan are properly addressed, he claimed that out of Balochistan’s total population, only a fraction actually lived in Balochistan, saying that “before talking about the issue, it is important to see how many Baloch are we talking about.” Over the issue of missing persons in Balochistan, he claimed that “half of these missing persons are part of BLA.” He said that several terrorists killed in Balochistan were included in the list of missing persons as well, claiming that there were more missing persons in Sindh and Punjab than in Balochistan.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that he put forward a “fair and balanced” nuclear proposal to European powers to prevent the return of United Nations sanctions on the Islamic republic. Iran is “introducing a creative, fair, and balanced proposal which addresses genuine concerns and is mutually beneficial,” Araghchi said on X. He added that the proposal was made on Thursday to Britain, France and Germany — known collectively as the E3 — as well as the European Union. “Turning this idea into action can be prompt and resolve the respective bottom lines to avert a crisis,” Araghchi said, arguing that “Iran cannot be the sole responsible actor”. The comments were made as the United Nations Security Council was set to vote on Friday on reimposing biting economic sanctions on Tehran over its contested nuclear programme. Diplomatic sources expect that Iran does not have the nine votes needed to maintain the status quo and prevent the punitive measures from being reimposed by the end of the month. The E3, signatories to a landmark 2015 nuclear agreement that lifted international sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, claim Tehran has reneged on its commitments under the deal. The accord was intended to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, a goal that Western powers and Iran’s arch-enemy Israel have long accused it of harbouring, but which it has consistently denied. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the deal has been hanging by a thread ever since the United States withdrew from it in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. The withdrawal prompted Iran in 2019 to begin rolling back on its own commitments, including limiting access to its facilities by inspectors from the UN’s nuclear watchdog. In June, Israel launched an unprecedented attack on Iran targeting nuclear and military sites, as well as residential areas, and killing more than 1,000 people, including senior commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran retaliated with missile and drone attacks that killed dozens in Israel. The US briefly joined Israel’s campaign for a series of strikes on key nuclear facilities before a ceasefire was reached after 12 days of war. Last week, Iran agreed on a new framework for working with the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after it suspended cooperation following the Israeli and US strikes. The IAEA has warned that Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed country that enriches uranium to 60 per cent — far beyond the 3.67pc cap set by the 2015 deal, and a short step from the 90pc required for a weapon.",

      "summary_en": "Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Friday that he put forward a “fair and balanced” nuclear proposal to European powers to prevent the return of United Nations sanctions on the Islamic republic. Iran is “introducing a creative, fair, and balanced proposal which addresses genuine concerns and is mutually beneficial,” Araghchi said on X. He added that the proposal was made on Thursday to Britain, France and Germany — known collectively as the E3 — as well as the European Union. “Turning this idea into action can be prompt and resolve the respective bottom lines to avert a crisis,” Araghchi said, arguing that “Iran cannot be the sole responsible actor”. The comments were made as the United Nations Security Council was set to vote on Friday on reimposing biting economic sanctions on Tehran over its contested nuclear programme. Diplomatic sources expect that Iran does not have the nine votes needed to maintain the status quo and prevent the punitive measures from being reimposed by the end of the month. The E3, signatories to a landmark 2015 nuclear agreement that lifted international sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, claim Tehran has reneged on its commitments under the deal.

      "summary_orig": "• US vetoes resolution calling for immediate Gaza ceasefire, Democrats table resolution for recognition of Palestine • Focus on Middle East may affect scheduled Trump-Shehbaz meeting • PM heads to London, will attend UN moot on two-state solution WASHINGTON: With world leaders expected to converge on New York for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the escalating crises in Gaza and Qatar are reshaping global diplomatic priorities, with significant implications for Pakistan’s engagement with the United States. In addition to his address at the General Assembly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is also expected to take part in the high-level international conference for the ‘Peaceful Sett­lement of the Question of Pales­tine and the Imple­men­tation of the Two-State Solution’. The conference, which will take place on Monday, would require the Pakistani delegation to hold close consultations with Arab and Muslim leaders during the UNGA. At a news briefing this week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres noted that the 80th UNGA was meeting “in turbulent — even uncharted — waters”. The UN chief pointed out that nearly 150 heads of state and government, alongside thousands of officials and diplomats, will participate in this “World Cup of diplomacy” that begins in New York on Monday. “Palestine is going to be the huge elephant [in the room] in this session of the General Assembly,” said Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour, while explaining how this issue will keep the world leaders busy. US veto and resolution On Thursday, Washington reverted to its usual ways as it vetoed a draft Security Council resolution, which would have demanded an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, as well as calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on aid deliveries into the besieged Palestinian enclave. The text, drafted by the elected 10 members of the 15-member council, would also have demanded the immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all prisoners held in Gaza. It received 14 votes in favour, but the US used its veto power for a sixth time to come to Israel’s aid. In a rare move last week, the US had backed a Security Council statement condemning recent strikes on Qatar, though the text did not mention Israel was responsible. In another surprising development, Senate Democrats introduced a resolution calling for the US to extend recognition to the Palestinian state. Although the measure is unlikely to pass the chamber where President Donald Trump’s Repu­blicans have a 53-47 majority, the resolution urges US recognition of a demilitarised Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel. Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who is leading the effort, said in a statement: “America has a responsibility to lead, and the time to act is now.” Rescheduled Islamabad’s proactive stance in condemning the Israeli airstrike on Qatar and its subsequent diplomatic engagements have elevated its profile within the Muslim world, with the recent signing of a mutual defence accord with Saudi Arabia further enhancing its significance in regional security discussions. In addition, the shifting focus of the UNGA in the wake of Israel’s belligerent actions is also expected to impact meetings scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the summit, as those are now expected to be dominated by hectic diplomacy by Middle Eastern actors. Amidst all this, diplomatic sources in Washington suggested that a proposed meeting between US President Donald Trump and PM Shehbaz Sharif may have to be rescheduled. While the White House is still interested in the meeting, the intensifying crises in Gaza and Qatar may necessitate a shift in focus, sources said. President Trump is expected to engage with Israeli and Arab leaders during the UNGA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already announced that he is meeting President Trump at the White House on Sept. 29, soon after Trump’s consultations with world leaders at the UNGA. This may mean that the Shehbaz-Trump interaction is confined to the sidelines of the assembly session in New York. Embassy sources, however, say that Islamabad would prefer a full-fledged meeting at the White House, to address bilateral and regional issues. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, who has previously met President Trump at the White House, is also expected to accompany PM Shehbaz. PM in London Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif arrived in London on Thursday for meetings with senior British officials, ahead of his US trip. According to sources, the prime minister will remain in London until Sept 21. During his stay, he is scheduled to hold meetings with senior officials and address a gathering of Pakistanis organised by the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation. Before landing in London, the premier made a stopover in Geneva to meet his elder brother, Nawaz Sharif. The elder Sharif had arrived in Geneva four days ago for medical treatment, accompanied by his son, Hassan Nawaz, and his physician, Dr Adnan. Mr Sharif is expected to travel to London on Monday to join the prime minister and his delegation, which includes Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and the prime minister’s special assistant, Tariq Fatemi.

      "summary_orig": "NEW DELHI: India’s opposition leader on Thursday accused the election commission of blocking an investigation into alleged large-scale voter roll tampering, in a fresh attack on the body’s credibility and independence. Opposition leaders and critics have alleged multiple times that voting in the world’s largest democracy has been undermined by targeted manipulation of electoral rolls. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has denied all charges. But in his latest broadside, 55-year-old Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi accused the ECI of withholding key data that could help identify those accused of tampering with electoral rolls. He accused ECI chief Gyanesh Kumar of “protecting the people who are destroying and attacking the constitution”. The ECI called the accusations “incorrect” and “baseless”, saying that it had itself filed a police complaint against “certain unsuccessful attempts” to delete voters from rolls. Gandhi on Thursday unveiled what he called “100 per cent proof” of an attempt to delete thousands of voters in Karnataka state using automated software. He said the ECI had refused to share technical data sought by investigators examining an alleged operation targeting Congress-leaning areas. The Karnataka criminal investigation department has asked the ECI “18 times in 18 months,” he alleged. “And they are not giving it.” The allegations come ahead of elections expected in October or November in Bihar, India’s third-most populous state with at least 130 million people. The opposition alleged the ECI had embarked on a “mass disenfranchisement” exercise, after it gave voters in the state just weeks to prove their citizenship, requiring documents that few possess in a registration revamp.

The opposition alleged the ECI had embarked on a “mass disenfranchisement” exercise, after it gave voters in the state just weeks to prove their citizenship, requiring documents that few possess in a registration revamp.

      "summary": "NEW DELHI: India’s opposition leader on Thursday accused the election commission of blocking an investigation into alleged large-scale voter roll tampering, in a fresh attack on the body’s credibility and independence. Opposition leaders and critics have alleged multiple times that voting in the world’s largest democracy has been undermined by targeted manipulation of electoral rolls. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has denied all charges. But in his latest broadside, 55-year-old Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi accused the ECI of withholding key data that could help identify those accused of tampering with electoral rolls. He accused ECI chief Gyanesh Kumar of “protecting the people who are destroying and attacking the constitution”. The ECI called the accusations “incorrect” and “baseless”, saying that it had itself filed a police complaint against “certain unsuccessful attempts” to delete voters from rolls. Gandhi on Thursday unveiled what he called “100 per cent proof” of an attempt to delete thousands of voters in Karnataka state using automated software. He said the ECI had refused to share technical data sought by investigators examining an alleged operation targeting Congress-leaning areas. The Karnataka criminal investigation department has asked the ECI “18 times in 18 months,” he alleged. “And they are not giving it.” The allegations come ahead of elections expected in October or November in Bihar, India’s third-most populous state with at least 130 million people.

      "summary_orig": "• Four terrorists eliminated in Khuzdar operation, says ISPR • Two FC men injured in Kalat grenade attack • Suicide bomber strikes convoy near Kech QUETTA: At least six people lost their lives in a powerful bomb explosion in the border town of Chaman, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy in Kech district, while security forces killed four militants in Khuzdar during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) on Thursday. Separately, four people, including two Frontier Corps officials, were injured in a grenade attack and firing by unknown armed men in the Mangochar area of Kalat division late in the evening. Officials said the Chaman blast ripped through a crowded taxi stand near the Pak-Afghan border in the evening, killing four people instantly and injuring two others. The wounded later succumbed to their injuries, raising the death toll to six. “The explosion took place near makeshift shops,” Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch told Dawn . Police and Levies forces rushed to the scene and shifted the dead and injured to the district hospital. “The blast left bodies mangled and body parts scattered,” eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told Dawn by phone. Police said initial investigations suggested explosives had been planted outside the shops at the taxi stand. The Balochistan Home Depart­ment confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident. It asked citizens to cooperate with investigation officials, stressing that the culprits would be brought to justice. Kech suicide attack Meanwhile, a convoy travelling from Gwadar to Turbat came under attack in the Dasht-i-Kuddan area of Kech district, around 60 kilometres from Turbat. Officials said gunmen opened fire on the convoy before a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden pickup into one of the buses. There was no official word from the local administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) about the incident. It was not immediately clear whether anyone had been killed or injured. The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack. Khuzdar operation Separately, the military’s media wing said on Thursday that security forces killed four militants linked to the “Indian proxy” group Fitna al-Hindustan during an intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar. “During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a statement. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the site, it added. “Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said. Thursday’s attacks come amid a surge in militant activity across Balochistan. Earlier this week, five militants were killed in Khuzdar. Last week, four militants were also killed during an IBO in Mastung, according to ISPR. A day earlier, two police stations and a Levies post were targeted in Sherani district, leaving one poli­ce­­man martyred and two Levies personnel injured. Published in Dawn, September 19th, 2025",

Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission for the former prime minister and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while confined in the same jail. According to sources, a three-member NCCIA team, headed by Additional Director Ayaz Khan, visited the Central Jail Adiala on Thursday for the second time during this week to question the PTI founder about his “X” handle. However, the sources said Mr Khan told the team to bring his lawyers if they wanted to question him on any matter and refused to participate in the investigation. The team arrived at Adiala Jail at around 3.30pm and left two hours later empty-handed amid ti­­ght security. The NCCIA launched the investigation after tweets were posted from Mr Khan’s account criticising government officials and the establishment.Earlier, on Tuesday, the same team had visited the Adiala Jail to investigate the PTI founder regarding the ope­ration of his social media account. Plea for conjugal rights Separately, A petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court seeking permission for the former premier Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi to exercise their conjugal rights, while confined in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. The petition, submitted under Article 199 of the Constitution, was filed by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and a supporter of Mr Khan. The respondents named in the petition include the Chief Commis­sioner Islamabad, the Punjab government, the Inspector General of Prisons Punjab, and the Superin­tendent of Central Jail Adiala. The petitioner argued that denying conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous court rulings. The plea referred to the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Conv­e­n­­tion on Human Rights, all of which safeguard the right to family life. It also cited a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh home department following Sup­reme Court directions, which allo­w­­ed convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. It furt­h­­er relied on the Federal Shariat Co­­urt’s landmark judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement. It requested the IHC to order the implementation of SC and Federal Shariat Court directives. A police spokesperson said that security will be beefed up around the ATC Rawalpindi on Friday during hearing of GHQ attack case, in which the PTI founder is set to attend the proceeding via video link.

      "summary": "• NCCIA team makes second attempt in a week to interrogate PTI founder over social media activity; Imran insists on his lawyers being present for questioning • IHC moved for conjugal rights of Imran Khan and his wife at Adiala Jail; security around ATC beefed up ahead of today’s hearing RAWALPINDI: Despite repea­ted attempts by National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to interrogate PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail, officials have been unable to extract any information as he has consistently refused to meet them. Meanwhile, a petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission for the former prime minister and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while confined in the same jail. According to sources, a three-member NCCIA team, headed by Additional Director Ayaz Khan, visited the Central Jail Adiala on Thursday for the second time during this week to question the PTI founder about his “X” handle. However, the sources said Mr Khan told the team to bring his lawyers if they wanted to question him on any matter and refused to participate in the investigation. The team arrived at Adiala Jail at around 3.30pm and left two hours later empty-handed amid ti­­ght security. The NCCIA launched the investigation after tweets were posted from Mr Khan’s account criticising government officials and the establishment.Earlier, on Tuesday, the same team had visited the Adiala Jail to investigate the PTI founder regarding the ope­ration of his social media account. Plea for conjugal rights Separately, A petition has been filed in the Islamabad High Court seeking permission for the former premier Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi to exercise their conjugal rights, while confined in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi. The petition, submitted under Article 199 of the Constitution, was filed by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and a supporter of Mr Khan. The respondents named in the petition include the Chief Commis­sioner Islamabad, the Punjab government, the Inspector General of Prisons Punjab, and the Superin­tendent of Central Jail Adiala. The petitioner argued that denying conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous court rulings. The plea referred to the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the European Conv­e­n­­tion on Human Rights, all of which safeguard the right to family life. It also cited a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh home department following Sup­reme Court directions, which allo­w­­ed convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. It furt­h­­er relied on the Federal Shariat Co­­urt’s landmark judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement. It requested the IHC to order the implementation of SC and Federal Shariat Court directives. A police spokesperson said that security will be beefed up around the ATC Rawalpindi on Friday during hearing of GHQ attack case, in which the PTI founder is set to attend the proceeding via video link.
