He added that the deceased was identified as Aftab-ur-Rehman, while the two injured — identified as Kalu Khan and Abdul Wahid — were rushed to the Trauma Centre in Quetta. “A search operation is underway to look for the assailants. They attacked the police with rocket launchers, snipers, and explosives, damaging the stations’ communication system,” he said. “The unknown assailants set a Levies vehicle on fire along with another vehicle carrying relief supplies from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).” There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. In August, three security personnel, including a senior officer, were martyred in an attack in Balochistan’s Mastung district. Earlier this month, at least five people were killed and 29 were injured in a blast at a rally of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium. In July, a Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred , and two others suffered injuries when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on the National Highway in the Mastung district.",

      "summary_orig": "The wife of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Wednesday that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning while incarcerated at an Arctic prison in February 2024. Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most formidable critic for years, died in mysterious circumstances while serving a 19-year prison sentence on a string of charges widely seen as retribution for his opposition. The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-got gains of Putin’s inner circle. His allies allege he was murdered in prison, and Moscow has never fully explained the causes of his death, saying only that he fell ill while walking in the prison yard on February 16, 2024. Before he was buried, his wife Yulia Navalnaya said his allies “were able to obtain and securely transfer biological samples of Alexei abroad”. “Laboratories in two countries came to the conclusion that Alexei was killed. Specifically: poisoned,” she said in a video posted on social media. She did not divulge details of what samples were obtained nor the results of the analysis, but she urged the labs to independently release their results and to specify which poison they believe was used. Navalnaya also published unverified photos she said were of his prison cell after his body was removed, showing a pool of vomit on the floor, and claimed that testimony from prison officials said he had been convulsing on the floor. ‘Murder’ Navalny was previously poisoned with a nerve agent of the Novichok type in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering. Jailed upon his return to Russia in January 2021, he was convicted on a series of charges, including “extremism”. From behind bars, he continued to campaign against Putin and spoke out against the invasion of Ukraine. Russian authorities said he died suddenly after falling ill while walking outside after lunch in his prison colony. Following Navalny’s death, officials refused for days to release his body to his relatives, raising suspicions among his followers. Navalnaya has maintained that her husband was killed on Putin’s orders, an accusation she repeated Wednesday.\n“Vladimir Putin is guilty of the murder of my husband, Alexei Navalny,” she said. The Kremlin denies the charges. It escalated a crackdown against his allies and opponents even after his death, adding Navalnaya to a “terrorists and extremists” blacklist and sentencing his lawyers and journalists who followed his court cases to years in prison. Most of his family and key allies have long lived abroad. The Russian opposition, plagued by infighting, has struggled for relevance in exile following Navalny’s death. Public displays of opposition to Putin inside Russia have become exceptionally rare since he invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin introduced military censorship, ramped up its targeting of dissenters and critics and effectively outlawed criticism both of the Kremlin and the invasion.",

      "title_orig": "A year on from making Olympic history, Arshad set for tilt at world title",
      "summary_orig": "TOKYO: Arshad Nadeem’s formula for winning Olympic gold in Paris was simple. He set himself a goal, and God gave it. The response was typical for the 28-year-old Pakistani, who made himself comfortable on a lobby couch at the athletes’ hotel for the World Athletics Championships , kicking off a slipper and tucking one foot under his thigh as he spoke about his win a year on. Faith in God and a supernatural sense of being seemed to be the only explanation for Arshad’s monstrous throws, forged from ancient, decrepit facilities back home in Lahore, where he trained in intense heat. Arshad’s maiden Olympic title, complemented by a record of 92.97m, was more than a rewriting of the script. It undid the superiority of biomechanical technology and world-class facilities that usually produce Olympic champions like himself. For him, hard work, perseverance, and a God-given talent were enough to conquer the upper-most echelons of javelin that he had been marching towards in years prior. His milestone achievements, that he dedicated to the cricket-crazy people of Pakistan, have all fallen in August the past few years. The Mian Channu born athlete made history for Pakistan every time he competed; first Pakistani to make an Olympic track and field final in Tokyo 2021 ; first to win gold at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2022; first to medal at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest 2023 with a silver; first to win an individual gold for Pakistan at the Olympics ; first Pakistani to hold an Olympic record. It is now September in Tokyo. It’s where Arshad’s fifth-place finish spurred the desire for an Olympic medal, but it also catalysed the Athletics Federation of Pakistan to pair him with a new coach, Salman Butt. The stocky, occasionally temperamental 60-something-year-old was a former discus champion in the 1980s, who trained with facilities better than what Arshad has today. Paris made Arshad’s fame and earnings balloon overnight, but the decrepit facilities at his disposal in Pakistan remained largely unchanged, save for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s plans for an elite training centre being built in Islamabad. “When athletes grow, so should their team,” Salman said, the exhaustion of a one-man show apparent in the long sighs and unmasked irritation in his voice. He doubles as Arshad’s manager, liaison, translator and ‘ roohani baap ’ — spiritual father — as Arshad calls him. He was lamenting the absence of a physio for Arshad during competitions when Terseus Liebenberg, Nadeem’s short-term coach in South Africa, appeared in the lobby like the protagonist of a movie. He offered for the South African physiotherapist to work on Arshad’s injury-prone calf. In an instant, Salman looked visibly more relaxed as he slumped back down on the couch after Liebenberg’s reassurance. Moments like these and people like him were the village that supported Arshad before stardom in Paris. His Olympic kit was sponsored by Nayza — meaning javelin in Urdu; a brand name inspired by Arshad’s milestone achievements for Pakistan, whose dri-fit shirt he proudly sported after a training session. One year on from Paris, everything and nothing has changed for Arshad. “I mean, I’m still the same,” he laughed in response. “But life has changed. There is more love, more respect. People are excited to see me at the airport, ask for selfies. This is everything for an athlete, for people to recognise you as an Olympian.” It was evident from the change in Instagram posts and sense of dressing — Nadeem sporting a business casual suit with sneakers and a cap to one event — that he’s grown into the global stardom that comes with an Olympic gold. The burden of expectation doesn’t weigh down on him. “His job is to train and throw a javelin and achieve records never achieved before,” Salman said. The one thing that remains unchanged in Arshad is the desire to keep helping people in struggle. Perhaps the biggest change that he and Salman revealed were plans to train outside Pakistan next year, in a climate better suited for his injury-prone body battling record heat and humidity in Lahore. The simple winning formula for Paris is questionable ahead of Tokyo, not in the sense that his Olympic win was a fluke, but more grounded in statistics. Arshad has only competed once this season, with a modest 86.40 throw in May. A persistent calf injury beckoned surgery in June, followed by rehabilitation in the UK, where he had plans to train ahead of two Diamond Leagues in Europe that he withdrew from in August. “Injuries happen, you drop out of competitions; this is a given in sports,” Arshad said. It was lesser-known that he won gold in Paris with a calf injury he managed to substitute with the throw of a lifetime. “My body feels good, I’m pretty fit. The qualifiers [on Wednesday] will show where I stand, and I’ll have expectations for the final based on that.” Scenes akin to Wagah? There couldn’t have been a more heightened time for a Pakistan-India javelin clash, save for the four-day war in May. The absence of a handshake during the men’s Asia Cup clash between the two sides just days earlier has thrown the cricketing world into a whirlwind of statements and clarifications and analyses and jingoism. The world is watching — albeit eclipsed by the cricket drama — whether Japan National Stadium will see scenes akin to Wagah Border: Arshad and Neeraj Chopra meeting in the middle but not quite; staring each other down at a distance close enough to be a hug that the brotherly duo may have once shared and may never do so again. Dare we compare the javelins to spears? When asked about his current relationship with Neeraj, Arshad said they’ve had “ chalte phirte salam dua [greetings here and there]” in the athletes’ hotel in Tokyo. He declined to give any analysis on the Pakistan-India tensions brewing back home. Neeraj has declined any interviews till after the javelin final on Thursday. Salman offered a more generous response on whether India and Pakistan will always be the antithesis of each other, especially in sports. “Pakistan and India have a natural rivalry. There’s always this excitement of people looking for that competition,” Salman said. “I just wish it was a healthy competition, just athletes and fellow athletes like other teams. “Sportsmanship should prevail, we should all proceed on with what we do as sports people.” The sports people in question know how to focus on their own goals and deliver when it matters the most. Handshakes or not, the show will go on. Originally appeared in print under the title “Qualifiers will show where I stand, says Arshad Nadeem” Published in Dawn, September 17th, 2025",

      "summary_en": "TOKYO: Arshad Nadeem’s formula for winning Olympic gold in Paris was simple. He set himself a goal, and God gave it. The response was typical for the 28-year-old Pakistani, who made himself comfortable on a lobby couch at the athletes’ hotel for the World Athletics Championships , kicking off a slipper and tucking one foot under his thigh as he spoke about his win a year on. Faith in God and a supernatural sense of being seemed to be the only explanation for Arshad’s monstrous throws, forged from ancient, decrepit facilities back home in Lahore, where he trained in intense heat. Arshad’s maiden Olympic title, complemented by a record of 92.97m, was more than a rewriting of the script. It undid the superiority of biomechanical technology and world-class facilities that usually produce Olympic champions like himself. For him, hard work, perseverance, and a God-given talent were enough to conquer the upper-most echelons of javelin that he had been marching towards in years prior. His milestone achievements, that he dedicated to the cricket-crazy people of Pakistan, have all fallen in August the past few years. The Mian Channu born athlete made history for Pakistan every time he competed; first Pakistani to make an Olympic track and field final in Tokyo 2021 ; first to win gold at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham 2022; first to medal at the World Athletics Championships in Budapest 2023 with a silver; first to win an individual gold for Pakistan at the Olympics ; first Pakistani to hold an Olympic record. It is now September in Tokyo. It’s where Arshad’s fifth-place finish spurred the desire for an Olympic medal, but it also catalysed the Athletics Federation of Pakistan to pair him with a new coach, Salman Butt. The stocky, occasionally temperamental 60-something-year-old was a former discus champion in the 1980s, who trained with facilities better than what Arshad has today. Paris made Arshad’s fame and earnings balloon overnight, but the decrepit facilities at his disposal in Pakistan remained largely unchanged, save for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s plans for an elite training centre being built in Islamabad. “When athletes grow, so should their team,” Salman said, the exhaustion of a one-man show apparent in the long sighs and unmasked irritation in his voice. He doubles as Arshad’s manager, liaison, translator and ‘ roohani baap ’ — spiritual father — as Arshad calls him. He was lamenting the absence of a physio for Arshad during competitions when Terseus Liebenberg, Nadeem’s short-term coach in South Africa, appeared in the lobby like the protagonist of a movie. He offered for the South African physiotherapist to work on Arshad’s injury-prone calf. In an instant, Salman looked visibly more relaxed as he slumped back down on the couch after Liebenberg’s reassurance. Moments like these and people like him were the village that supported Arshad before stardom in Paris. His Olympic kit was sponsored by Nayza — meaning javelin in Urdu; a brand name inspired by Arshad’s milestone achievements for Pakistan, whose dri-fit shirt he proudly sported after a training session. One year on from Paris, everything and nothing has changed for Arshad. “I mean, I’m still the same,” he laughed in response. “But life has changed. There is more love, more respect. People are excited to see me at the airport, ask for selfies. This is everything for an athlete, for people to recognise you as an Olympian.” It was evident from the change in Instagram posts and sense of dressing — Nadeem sporting a business casual suit with sneakers and a cap to one event — that he’s grown into the global stardom that comes with an Olympic gold. The burden of expectation doesn’t weigh down on him. “His job is to train and throw a javelin and achieve records never achieved before,” Salman said. The one thing that remains unchanged in Arshad is the desire to keep helping people in struggle. Perhaps the biggest change that he and Salman revealed were plans to train outside Pakistan next year, in a climate better suited for his injury-prone body battling record heat and humidity in Lahore. The simple winning formula for Paris is questionable ahead of Tokyo, not in the sense that his Olympic win was a fluke, but more grounded in statistics. Arshad has only competed once this season, with a modest 86.40 throw in May. A persistent calf injury beckoned surgery in June, followed by rehabilitation in the UK, where he had plans to train ahead of two Diamond Leagues in Europe that he withdrew from in August. “Injuries happen, you drop out of competitions; this is a given in sports,” Arshad said. It was lesser-known that he won gold in Paris with a calf injury he managed to substitute with the throw of a lifetime. “My body feels good, I’m pretty fit. The qualifiers [on Wednesday] will show where I stand, and I’ll have expectations for the final based on that.” Scenes akin to Wagah? There couldn’t have been a more heightened time for a Pakistan-India javelin clash, save for the four-day war in May. The absence of a handshake during the men’s Asia Cup clash between the two sides just days earlier has thrown the cricketing world into a whirlwind of statements and clarifications and analyses and jingoism. The world is watching — albeit eclipsed by the cricket drama — whether Japan National Stadium will see scenes akin to Wagah Border: Arshad and Neeraj Chopra meeting in the middle but not quite; staring each other down at a distance close enough to be a hug that the brotherly duo may have once shared and may never do so again. Dare we compare the javelins to spears? When asked about his current relationship with Neeraj, Arshad said they’ve had “ chalte phirte salam dua [greetings here and there]” in the athletes’ hotel in Tokyo.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump formally begins his unprecedented second state visit to Britain on Wednesday, with the royal pomp a grand veneer to key diplomatic talks and as difficult questions about Jeffrey Epstein linger. King Charles and the royal family will roll out the red carpet for the president when he arrives at Windsor Castle, the oldest and largest inhabited castle in the world and family home to British monarchs for almost 1,000 years, with a carriage procession, gun salutes, a military flypast and a lavish banquet. Britain says it will be the largest military ceremonial welcome for a state visit in living memory. Trump, an overt royal fan, has made little secret of his delight at being not just the first US leader, but the first elected politician to be invited by a British monarch for two visits. “I Love King Charles,” he posted on his Truth Social account in February. On his arrival, he said of Britain: “It’s a very special place.” UK hopes visit will cement ‘special relationship’ Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hoping to use that sentiment to Britain’s advantage as his government seeks to use the trip to cement the two nations’ “special relationship”, deepen economic ties, secure billions of dollars of investment, discuss tariffs and press the US president on Ukraine. The visit has already delivered a new technology pact between the two countries with companies from Microsoft to Nvidia, Google and OpenAI pledging 31 billion pounds ($42bn) in British investments over the next few years, in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy. Starmer also wants further progress on tariffs. “Basically, I’m there also on trade. They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” Trump said when he left the White House for Britain on Tuesday.\n“They’d like to see if they could get a little bit better deal, so we’ll talk to them.” Protesters pull off Epstein stunt despite high security While security for the visit was tight, with a massive police operation in place in Windsor and 1,600 officers deployed in London to deal with a demonstration by the “Stop the Trump Coalition”, protesters pulled off a stunt in Windsor. Police said four people were arrested for malicious communications on Tuesday after images of Trump alongside late sex offender Epstein were projected on to one of Windsor Castle’s towers. Trump was not in Windsor at the time. Starmer last week sacked Peter Mandelson as Britain’s ambassador in Washington over his ties to Epstein, which could lead to awkward questions for Starmer and Trump, whose own relationship with the financier has also come under scrutiny. London commuters had mixed views about Trump’s state visit on Wednesday morning, with some angry about the invitation and others saying it was smart politics and a good use of Britain’s soft power. “We’re looking to sort of make the best of a bad situation,” lawyer Kirstie Robertshaw, 54, said. Trump to be dazzled by pageantry Wednesday will be dominated by ceremony. Trump and his wife Melania will first be greeted by the king’s “very handsome” son Prince William — as the president has called him - and the heir’s wife Kate. Charles and his wife Queen Camilla will then join the Trumps on a carriage procession through the grounds of the castle, with the route lined by 1,300 British service personnel. The royals will show the president and first lady historical items from the Royal Collection relating to the U.S., before the Trumps visit St George’s Chapel, the final resting place of Queen Elizabeth, who hosted Trump for his first state visit in 2019, where he will lay a wreath on her tomb. Later, there will be a flypast by military aircraft before the state banquet at which the king and president will deliver speeches. For Charles himself, the visit might provoke mixed emotions. He has little obviously in common with Trump, from his 50 years championing environmental causes to his efforts to bring harmony between religions and his recent steadfast support for Canada, where he is head of state. But the occasion will also afford him the greatest global attention since his coronation. “I don’t think anyone could seriously make a case that President Trump and King Charles III are naturally aligned in their views on really anything at all. And yet expect the king to play a consummately professional role,” said historian Anthony Seldon. “If it goes well… I think this will go down as the most consequential event in his reign.” On Thursday, the action will move to Starmer’s Chequers country residence, where the focus will be on geopolitics.

      "title": "UK rolls out red carpet for Trump, and hopes to avoid red faces",
      "summary": "US President Donald Trump formally begins his unprecedented second state visit to Britain on Wednesday, with the royal pomp a grand veneer to key diplomatic talks and as difficult questions about Jeffrey Epstein linger. King Charles and the royal family will roll out the red carpet for the president when he arrives at Windsor Castle, the oldest and largest inhabited castle in the world and family home to British monarchs for almost 1,000 years, with a carriage procession, gun salutes, a military flypast and a lavish banquet. Britain says it will be the largest military ceremonial welcome for a state visit in living memory. Trump, an overt royal fan, has made little secret of his delight at being not just the first US leader, but the first elected politician to be invited by a British monarch for two visits. “I Love King Charles,” he posted on his Truth Social account in February. On his arrival, he said of Britain: “It’s a very special place.” UK hopes visit will cement ‘special relationship’ Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hoping to use that sentiment to Britain’s advantage as his government seeks to use the trip to cement the two nations’ “special relationship”, deepen economic ties, secure billions of dollars of investment, discuss tariffs and press the US president on Ukraine. The visit has already delivered a new technology pact between the two countries with companies from Microsoft to Nvidia, Google and OpenAI pledging 31 billion pounds ($42bn) in British investments over the next few years, in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy. Starmer also wants further progress on tariffs. “Basically, I’m there also on trade.

      "summary_orig": "Security forces earlier this week killed five “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Wednesday. The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. In a press release, the ISPR said security forces conducted the IBO on the night of 14/15 September on the “reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan”. “During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the military’s media wing added. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR noted. Sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, according to the ISPR. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the military reaffirmed. The operation comes after five security personnel, including an officer, were martyred in an explosion in Balochistan’s Kech district on Monday. Over the weekend, security forces had killed 31 terrorists in two separate INOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, ISPR said. On September 12, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung. On September 7, two people were seriously injured in Khuzdar’s Naal area when an improvised explosive device was detonated, police said. Last month, security forces gunned down 50 terrorists over a four-day operation, foiling an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan.",

      "summary_orig": "DUBAI: The Pakistan Cricket Board will take a final call regarding the national team’s participation in the Asia Cup on Wednesday after the handshake controversy that unfolded in their match against archrivals India. “The Pakistan Cricket Board has not yet made any final decision regarding the Asia Cup,” PCB spokesperson Amir Mir said in a statement that came late on Tuesday night, following what Dawn learnt was a meeting involving officials from the board and the government in Islamabad. “Consultations are ongoing in this regard, and a final decision will be made by tomorrow,” the spokesperson added. “The decision will be made keeping in view Pakistan’s interests.” The PCB correspondence was followed by Pakistan’s decision to not hold their pre-match press conference ahead of their final Group ‘A’ fixture against hosts UAE. The Pakistan team did, however, turn up for practice on the eve of the game. “Pakistan has decided not to hold their pre-match press conference today,” a short message from the Asian Cricket Council said. The PCB was awaiting a response from the International Cricket Council over a protest about match referee Andy Pycroft. The Zimbabwean oversaw Sunday’s politically charged clash with India, after which the victorious India team refused to shake hands with the Pakistan players. The PCB alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match. Pycroft is scheduled to be the match referee for the game on Wednesday as reports coming out from India claimed the ICC had rejected Pakistan’s demand. “Late last night, ICC had sent a reply to PCB stating that Pycroft won’t be removed and their plea has been rejected,” an ICC source told the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) news agency on Tuesday. According to PTI sources, Pakistan cancelled their pre-match press conference “to avoid questions on the widely reported threat of a pullout” from the tournament. Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema had also filed a complaint with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) alleging that it was on Pycroft’s insistence that team sheets weren’t exchanged between the two skippers on Sunday as is the norm. Pakistan could potentially lose out on revenue worth $16 million if they forfeit their remaining Asia Cup matches, the PTI said. It is understood that PCB is trying to work out a respectable solution by which Pycroft doesn’t officiate in their matches, added the agency. One proposal given by the PCB is to have Richie Richardson stand in its match against the UAE but whether that would happen or not is the big question. If Pakistan beat the home side in Dubai they will face neighbours India again on Sunday in the next round. Last Sunday’s seven-wicket defeat to India was the first time the rivals had faced off in cricket since the countries fought a brief but deadly border conflict in May. According to PTI , the situation arose due to PCB’s international cricket director Usman Wahla, who didn’t apprise Salman about the rules and regulations that are to be followed during the tournament. It is learnt that an irate PCB chief Mohsin, who is also the current chairman of the ACC, ordered the sacking of Walha on Monday “for the embarrassment caused to the national cricket team and its captain”, PTI said.

      "summary_orig": "MUZAFFARABAD: A leopard that had played “hide and seek” with residents of the AJK capital for more than 36 hours was finally captured on Tuesday afternoon, bringing much-needed relief to the panicked populace. The drama began late Sunday night, when reports emerged on social media that a leopard had been spotted in the Sathra area. Residents fanned out with torches and mobile phone lights to trace it, but in vain. CCTV footage that surfaced later showed the animal roaming through Madina Market, a busy commercial hub about a kilometre away, without coming into contact with night watchmen or passers-by. On Monday morning, the big cat was sighted in the Central Plate neighbourhood near Jinnah Dental Hospital, where it leapt past a female resident and crouched in an open plot beside her house. “Surprisingly, it was not violent but friendly,” she recalled. Another resident, Raja Asad Khan, described his unnerving face-to-face encounter when the leopard jumped into his house. “As I stepped out of the washroom, I suddenly found myself staring at it. I swiftly locked the room, retreated to safety and alerted emergency services,” he said, adding that the animal appeared overwhelmed rather than aggressive. “It did not deliberately target my house. It was simply fleeing human pursuit.” Police and wildlife teams rushed to the spot, but the leopard slipped away again, sparking conflicting reports about its whereabouts and a flood of memes on social media. Later in the day, the animal entered a scrap warehouse along Plate Road owned by Matiullah Khan, an Afghan national settled in Muzaffarabad. His children managed to lock it in a room, but the leopard forced its way out through a narrow opening and climbed onto the roof before disappearing into a three-foot-wide alley, hemmed in by tall buildings, leading to a basement where it eventually got stuck. Wildlife teams attempted to tranquilize it with a dart gun, but the confined space made it nearly impossible to strike properly. By Tuesday morning, the leopard had become visibly stressed and vets advised against sedation, fearing it could prove fatal. At this stage, Mr Khan volunteered to take matters into his own hands. Donning a helmet and gloves provided by the wildlife department, he crawled into the cavity with ropes as cameras rolled. “It attacked me thrice, but I didn’t give up. I wanted to rid this city, which gave me livelihood and respect, of fear and panic,” he later told Dawn . With assistance from wildlife watchers Junaid Akram and Raja Mudassar and local volunteer Hasnain Ali Khokhar, the leopard was finally subdued and dragged into the open, before being shifted to an iron cage. The animal, believed to be aged between 1.5 and 2.5 years, was later transported to the wildlife department’s rehabilitation centre in Chela neighbourhood. “We will keep it under observation to monitor its behaviour, following which it will be released into its natural habitat,” said Wildlife Monitoring Officer Dr Shaista Ali. “At the moment, it is healthy and active, but if its condition deteriorates we will transfer it to Islamabad,” she told Dawn . Since the leopard had shown little aggression during its early encounters and it remained unclear how it had strayed into the city, many residents speculated it might have been a pet. Dr Ali, however, said it was too early to either confirm or rule out that possibility. Published in Dawn, September 17th, 2025",

      "summary_en": "MUZAFFARABAD: A leopard that had played “hide and seek” with residents of the AJK capital for more than 36 hours was finally captured on Tuesday afternoon, bringing much-needed relief to the panicked populace. The drama began late Sunday night, when reports emerged on social media that a leopard had been spotted in the Sathra area. Residents fanned out with torches and mobile phone lights to trace it, but in vain. CCTV footage that surfaced later showed the animal roaming through Madina Market, a busy commercial hub about a kilometre away, without coming into contact with night watchmen or passers-by. On Monday morning, the big cat was sighted in the Central Plate neighbourhood near Jinnah Dental Hospital, where it leapt past a female resident and crouched in an open plot beside her house. “Surprisingly, it was not violent but friendly,” she recalled. Another resident, Raja Asad Khan, described his unnerving face-to-face encounter when the leopard jumped into his house. “As I stepped out of the washroom, I suddenly found myself staring at it. I swiftly locked the room, retreated to safety and alerted emergency services,” he said, adding that the animal appeared overwhelmed rather than aggressive. “It did not deliberately target my house. It was simply fleeing human pursuit.” Police and wildlife teams rushed to the spot, but the leopard slipped away again, sparking conflicting reports about its whereabouts and a flood of memes on social media.

However, the group was deported by the Japanese immigration authorities from the airport and the matter was then reported to the FIA. The FIA launched an inquiry and finally arrested the suspect and registered cases against him. Published in Dawn, September 17th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: Donald Trump’s second state visit to the United Kingdom this week is shaping up to be as controversial as his first, with an imminent protest and a simmering personal feud with London mayor Sadiq Khan threatening to overshadow the carefully choreographed royal pageantry. Mr Khan fired the opening salvo ahead of the visit, highlighting new Home Office figures showing a record number of Americans applying for UK citizenship. He attributed the surge to London’s “liberal values” and diversity, remarks seen as a direct rebuke of Trump. “Many Americans identify with our values — adherence to the rule of law, celebrating diversity, and defending minority rights,” the mayor said. Earlier in the month, Mr Khan in an interview had said, “I’ll show him mosques, diversity and the Notting Hill Carnival. It’ll prove that multi-culturalism is our greatest strength.” The US president, who has repeatedly called Mr Khan a “stone cold loser” and accused him of presiding over rising crime in the capital, is unlikely to let the criticism pass unanswered. Right-leaning commentators in Britain have urged restraint. Writing in the Telegraph , columnist Brendan O’Neill warned Mr Khan not to repeat what he desc­r­i­bed as “infantile stunts” and recalling the giant Trump Baby balloon flown over Parliament Square during the president’s earlier visits. “Our relationship with Ame­rica is more important than ever,” he cautioned. But protests are already planned. The Stop Trump Coalition has announced a large-scale march through London on Wednesday, the first day of the visit, when Trump will meet King Charles and PM Keir Starmer. The demonstration comes less than a week after a far-right rally in London, addressed by former Trump adviser Elon Musk, whose warnings of violent uprising drew condemnation from Starmer. Behind the scenes, officials are bracing for potential pitfalls. The BBC reports that Windsor Castle has been transformed into a “ring of steel,” with 1,300 troops and 120 horses deployed to stage the ceremonial welcome and carriage procession. Palace aides have pored over banquet seating plans and menus to ensure the president feels honoured, while also preparing King Charles’s speech to avoid political controversy. Official state visits by US presidents are rare and make this week’s spectacle diplomatically significant. But with protesters on the streets and a Sadiq Khan-Trump feud simmering, the risks of political theatre overshadowing substance remain high. Published in Dawn, September 17th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• ‘Why not’, says Dar when asked about possibility of combined security force in Middle East • PM meets Qatari emir, Iranian president on sidelines of Doha summit KARACHI: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar hinted at the possibility of joining a proposed unified front against Israel, if such a move came to fruition. Pakistan has “very large” and “effective” armed forces that have proven their capabilities in conventional warfare, Mr Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, said during an interview with Al Jazeera. He was responding to a question about the possible position Islam­abad would take in case a united body was formed in the Middle East to stop Israeli aggression. When asked if the formation of such a body — away from the Uni­ted Nations structure — to intervene in Gaza was one of the options on the table, Mr Dar said that a mechanism could be chalked out. He mentioned that there had been talk along the lines of “some sort of combined security force” during recent interactions among Arab nations and the Arab League. “Why not? What’s wrong with that? They should [have a combined force]. And according to their own capacity, own strength, they should create some mechanism. Not for aggression purpose [sic], but for peaceful purpose[s], for stopping the aggressor, for stopping the occupier, for stopping someone who just doesn’t listen.” When asked where nuclear-armed Pakistan would stand, Mr Dar responded: “Pakistan, obvi­o­usly, as a member of the ummah, would discharge its duty.” When pressed to elaborate, he clarified that Pakistan saw nuclear weapons only for deterrence and didn’t intend to use them. “We have no intention of using it; it is only a deterrence.” “But Pakistan has a very large, known, very effective army, very effective air force, very effective navy … We have proved that we can beat [our opponent] even conventionally, if challenged,” he maintained. The interviewer then brought up a recent debate at the UN Security Council where Israel had invoked a 2011 attack within Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden in a bid to justify its attacks in Gaza. “So if now Pakistan comes under attack, from a country like the United States, for instance, would Pakistan act differently [than it did in 2011]?” he asked. “We would not allow the breach of our territorial integrity, no matter by whom, be it the smallest or the largest country. We would respond. But I don’t see any reason why the US or any other country would do it. India did it. You saw what happened to them,” replied Dar. Need for UN reform Mr Dar highlighted that Israel had attacked multiple countries in the Middle East and said that international laws, international humanitarian rules and UN Security Council resolutions seemed to have “no effect on one country, which is repeatedly doing what it feels like”. “That means [the] multilateral system needs very serious reforms right now … This is the need of the hour. I think the UN Security Council, as well as the UN system itself needs very serious ref­orms. To a question about whether Israel could attack Pakistan next after Qatar, Dar reminded that India had tried that and Israel “gave it full support according to our information” and the “world saw that the claim is exposed”. “We are ready. Again, I repeat, we want peace. The nuclear-armed state does not want any de-stabilisation in the region because that will have consequences beyond [the region],” he added, stressing the need for collective efforts for reforms in UN Security Council resolutions. Saying that Israel and India were the only countries that did not abide by UN Security Council resolutions, he emphasised evolving a mechanism in the council for taking practical measures to “control the situation” if its resolutions were not acted upon and implemented. “And that might require physical actions, physical interventions,” he mused. PM’s meetings Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held separate meetings with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Iranian Pre­sident Masoud Peze­shkian on the sidelines of the Emergency Arab–Islamic Summit convened in Doha. In his meeting with Qatari emir, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s strongest condemnation of the Israeli strike on a residential area in Doha on September 9 that led to the loss of precious lives and injured several others, says a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office. While reaffirming Pakistan’s all-out support and solidarity with Qatar at this critical time, PM Shehbaz termed Israel’s attack a flagrant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as a serious breach of international law. The Qatari emir expressed appreciation for the prime minister’s participation in the Em­e­rgency Arab-Islamic Sum­mit as well as for his visit to Doha on September 12 to express solidarity with Qatar at this difficult time. During a meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s str­ongest condemnation of Israeli aggression against Qatar on Sept 9. Both leaders expressed their solidarity and support for Qatar and called for unity among the ranks of the Ummah in the face of Israeli aggression. President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s strong position on the Palestine issue and exp­ressed his desire to continue working closely with the prime minister to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran relations.

The Qatari emir expressed appreciation for the prime minister’s participation in the Em­e­rgency Arab-Islamic Sum­mit as well as for his visit to Doha on September 12 to express solidarity with Qatar at this difficult time. During a meeting with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s str­ongest condemnation of Israeli aggression against Qatar on Sept 9. Both leaders expressed their solidarity and support for Qatar and called for unity among the ranks of the Ummah in the face of Israeli aggression. President Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan’s strong position on the Palestine issue and exp­ressed his desire to continue working closely with the prime minister to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran relations.

      "summary": "• ‘Why not’, says Dar when asked about possibility of combined security force in Middle East • PM meets Qatari emir, Iranian president on sidelines of Doha summit KARACHI: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar hinted at the possibility of joining a proposed unified front against Israel, if such a move came to fruition. Pakistan has “very large” and “effective” armed forces that have proven their capabilities in conventional warfare, Mr Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, said during an interview with Al Jazeera. He was responding to a question about the possible position Islam­abad would take in case a united body was formed in the Middle East to stop Israeli aggression. When asked if the formation of such a body — away from the Uni­ted Nations structure — to intervene in Gaza was one of the options on the table, Mr Dar said that a mechanism could be chalked out. He mentioned that there had been talk along the lines of “some sort of combined security force” during recent interactions among Arab nations and the Arab League. “Why not? What’s wrong with that? They should [have a combined force]. And according to their own capacity, own strength, they should create some mechanism. Not for aggression purpose [sic], but for peaceful purpose[s], for stopping the aggressor, for stopping the occupier, for stopping someone who just doesn’t listen.” When asked where nuclear-armed Pakistan would stand, Mr Dar responded: “Pakistan, obvi­o­usly, as a member of the ummah, would discharge its duty.” When pressed to elaborate, he clarified that Pakistan saw nuclear weapons only for deterrence and didn’t intend to use them. “We have no intention of using it; it is only a deterrence.” “But Pakistan has a very large, known, very effective army, very effective air force, very effective navy … We have proved that we can beat [our opponent] even conventionally, if challenged,” he maintained. The interviewer then brought up a recent debate at the UN Security Council where Israel had invoked a 2011 attack within Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden in a bid to justify its attacks in Gaza. “So if now Pakistan comes under attack, from a country like the United States, for instance, would Pakistan act differently [than it did in 2011]?” he asked. “We would not allow the breach of our territorial integrity, no matter by whom, be it the smallest or the largest country. We would respond. But I don’t see any reason why the US or any other country would do it. India did it. You saw what happened to them,” replied Dar. Need for UN reform Mr Dar highlighted that Israel had attacked multiple countries in the Middle East and said that international laws, international humanitarian rules and UN Security Council resolutions seemed to have “no effect on one country, which is repeatedly doing what it feels like”. “That means [the] multilateral system needs very serious reforms right now … This is the need of the hour. I think the UN Security Council, as well as the UN system itself needs very serious ref­orms. To a question about whether Israel could attack Pakistan next after Qatar, Dar reminded that India had tried that and Israel “gave it full support according to our information” and the “world saw that the claim is exposed”. “We are ready. Again, I repeat, we want peace. The nuclear-armed state does not want any de-stabilisation in the region because that will have consequences beyond [the region],” he added, stressing the need for collective efforts for reforms in UN Security Council resolutions. Saying that Israel and India were the only countries that did not abide by UN Security Council resolutions, he emphasised evolving a mechanism in the council for taking practical measures to “control the situation” if its resolutions were not acted upon and implemented. “And that might require physical actions, physical interventions,” he mused. PM’s meetings Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held separate meetings with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Iranian Pre­sident Masoud Peze­shkian on the sidelines of the Emergency Arab–Islamic Summit convened in Doha. In his meeting with Qatari emir, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s strongest condemnation of the Israeli strike on a residential area in Doha on September 9 that led to the loss of precious lives and injured several others, says a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office. While reaffirming Pakistan’s all-out support and solidarity with Qatar at this critical time, PM Shehbaz termed Israel’s attack a flagrant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as a serious breach of international law.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, a member of the five-judge Supreme Court constitutional bench, on Tuesday questioned whether the National Assembly could be granted specific authority under the constitution to enact tax legislation that operates outside the financial year. Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the CB was hearing multiple petitions filed by taxpayers challenging the constitutional vires of the amen­ded Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO), 2001, applicable to the tax year 2023. However, senior counsel Hafiz Ehsaan Ahmad Khokhar, representing the Federal Board of Rev­e­nue (FBR), argued that the present case did not involve any question of the National Assembly’s legislative competence. During the hearing, Add­­i­­tional Attorney Gen­e­ral Chaudhry Aamir Reh­m­an informed the court that the federal governm­ent would submit a written response within a few days. On April 4, 2024, a division bench of the IHC comprising then Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri while hearing intra-court appeals had directed one of the respondents to continue paying tax liability under Section 4C as amended by the Finance Act, 2023. The super tax, introduced by the PML-N government in 2015, applies to wealthy individuals, associations of persons and companies earning above Rs500 million. It levies 4 per cent tax on the income of banking companies and 3pc on other sectors to fund rehabilitation of temporarily displaced persons. Mr Khokhar defended the constitutionality of Sections 4B and 4C of the ITO, 2001, stressing that under Article 77, parliament has exclusive authority to levy taxes. He argued that the super tax, introduced through Finance Acts 2015 and 2022, was a lawful exercise of fiscal power. He noted that Section 4B, which initially imposed super tax on high-income taxpayers, had already been upheld by all high courts. Issues such as double taxation, violation of Article 25 and legislative competence had been decided in favour of the federation. Turning to Section 4C, introduced in 2022, which extended the levy through progressive slabs and sector-specific categories, Mr Khokhar said the high courts erred by reconstructing the statutory scheme. This amou­nted to judicial legislation, he argued. Under Article 199, he emphasized, courts may only strike down laws that clearly violate fundamental rights, not redesign tax schemes. By doing otherwise, the high courts committed judicial overreach and upset the balance of power between legislature and judiciary, he said. On the claim that super tax constituted double taxation, he called the argument “wholly misconceived,” noting that under Article 77 and Entry 47 of the federal legislative List, parliament has plenary authority to levy taxes on income other than agricultural income. Section 2(63) of the Ordinance defines “tax” to inc­l­u­­de super tax, while Section 3 provides that income tax shall be charged for each tax year where expressly provided. Thus, super tax is not a separate levy but an additional component of income tax on high-income earners, comparable to a surcharge or advance tax, he explained.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Days after Pakistan asked the Afghan Taliban to choose whether they want to stand with their neighbour, or the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­­i­s­tan (TTP) militant group, a key US official has called on Islamabad to seek a political settlement with Kabul. Zalmay Khalilzad, who was named US special representative to Afghanistan during the previous Trump administration, also called on Afghanistan to “help Pakistan with such negotiations”. The former diplomat recently undertook a visit to Kabul alongside US hostage envoy Adam Boehler, where he met with key members of the Afghan Taliban regime. In a tweet posted after he wrapped up his visit, Khalilzad noted that violence between Pakistan’s security forces and the TTP had resulted in the deaths of a significant number of security personnel and citizens. Imran echoes Khalilzad’s views, terms dialogue with Kabul only way to achieve lasting peace Saying that he believed pursuing a military solution to this challenge was a mistake, he called on Islamabad to “shift to a political strategy and negotiate”. “The Pakistani establishment always advised the US and Afghan government before 2021 to negotiate and seek a political settlement with the Afghan Taliban. The time has come for Pakistan to consider doing the same,” he said. The timing of the message is significant, as it comes just days after PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir gave Kabul a stark choice. “I want to give a clear message to Afghanistan to choose between Pakistan and TTP,” PM Shehbaz had said during a visit to Bannu alongside the army chief. Although President Trump and US military officials such as CENTCOM chief Gen Michael Kurilla have repeatedly praised Pakistan’s counterterror cooperation — with the arrest of IS-Khorasan operative who targeted the Kabul airport’s Abbey Gate in 2021 being a highlight — Khalilzad’s message seems to be the first indication that the US wants both Islamabad and Kabul to come to the table. In Washington circles, Khalilzad is viewed as a hawk. He openly sympathises with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan and has — in the past — reserved critical words for Pakistan. In a tweet posted just last month, he claimed that Afghanistan’s successful operations against IS-Khorasan had pushed their leadership into Pakistan and alleged that the latter was now becoming a ‘safe haven’ for the militant group. Imran echoes dialogue call Khalilzad’s remarks echoed the views of the incarcerated former PM, who has also called for dialogue to address the militancy currently pla­guing the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — where his party is in power. In a tweet posted to his X account on Tuesday, Mr Khan said that operations initiated in the former tribal areas were leading to rising police, military and civilian casualties. “This approach can ne­­v­er establish peace. Las­t­ing peace only comes thr­ough dialogue,” he said. He alleged that what was being attempted in KP was merely an atte­mpt to discredit the PTI government, and claimed a military operation would only fuel further terrorism. As police are diverted to counter the rising threat from terrorism, governance and law and order will collapse, he said. He urged all KP lawmakers to sit with the chief minister to urgently resolve the challenges of the province, and called on his allies — namely Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mahmood Khan Achakzai — to send a peace delegation to Afghanistan.
