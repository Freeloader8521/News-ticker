This was the most powerful storm to ever strike the island nation, packing winds of up to 185mph at its peak. Western parts of Jamaica were worst hit, with 90% of homes in the town of Black River losing their roof or being destroyed entirely. Roughly three-quarters of the country lost electricity, with at least 19 people known to have lost their lives at the time of publication. The cleanup operation was hampered by thunderstorms even after Melissa cleared to the north. The hurricane continued northwards, but was a slightly weakened category 3 storm by the time it made landfall in Cuba. Nonetheless, the storm continued to bring winds of up to 120mph and torrential rains. Haiti was particularly badly affected by flash floods and landslides, with at least 30 people believed to have been killed as a result.

In a letter addressed to the Ministry of Interior and dated October 30 — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — the Balochistan government requested that the relevant authorities be directed to suspend 3G/4G internet services in Quetta on October 31 (today) for 24 hours. “Owing to the peculiar law and order situation and threat perceptions, the services of 3G and 4G services are required to be jammed in district Quetta,” the missive said. In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened , as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The suspension also comes only two months after mobile data services in the province were suspended in August over “security reasons”. However, on August 21— 16 days into the suspension — the Balochistan High Court (BHC) had ordered the immediate restoration of mobile internet services, leading to the resumption of connectivity in the province. According to a report published in January, Pakistan was leading the world in terms of financial losses suffered as a result of outages and shutdowns of internet and social media apps last year. Pakistan topped the charts with a cumulative financial impact of $1.62 billion. This was higher than the cost in countries like Sudan and Myanmar, which are ravaged by civil wars.",

      "summary_orig": "An anti-terrorism court in Islamabad issued a notice to police on Friday on an application for the provision of documents in a narcotics and terrorism case registered against senior journalist Matiullah Jan. The case, registered at Margalla Police Station on November 28 last year, accuses the journalist of snatching a government-issued rifle, hitting a vehicle at a police barrier and possessing narcotics. Initiation of legal proceedings against Jan has drawn strong criticism from journalist bodies and rights groups, who maintain that he is being targeted for investigating reports of alleged deaths during law enforcement action against PTI protesters in November last year. At the outset of the hearing today, lawyer Mian Ali Ashfaq submitted a power of attorney to Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on behalf of Jan. He also contended that the journalist had been “portrayed as a terrorist” in the case. Judge Sipra remarked that the other side needed to be heard as well and issued a notice to police for November 8 on an application by Jan for the provision of case documents and adjourned the hearing until the said date. Lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, who has also represented Jan in the case, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists President Afzal Butt and other journalists were also present in the court during the hearing. At the last hearing  held yesterday, the ATC had rejected Jan’s acquittal plea. The ATC had also handed over all case documents to Jan. It should be mentioned that several veteran journalists and human rights activists have demanded the immediate withdrawal of the case registered against Jan. Jan’s arrest According to the first information report (FIR) registered against Jan at Margalla Police Station, his car was stopped at a checkpoint in Sector E-9, where he allegedly resisted arrest, rammed his vehicle into a police barrier and snatched a rifle before being subdued. The FIR invokes Section 9(2)4 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA) for possessing 100 to 500 grams of crystal meth and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) for acts of terrorism. Jan was arrested on the night of November 26, 2024, and initially remanded in police custody. However, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had later overturned that decision and sent him to judicial custody. His defence counsels, Advocates Imaan Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chatha, had subsequently secured his post-arrest bail. Meanwhile, Jan had written a letter to the Inspector General of Islamabad Police (IG), alleging abduction and torture prior to his arrest. In the letter, Jan stated that on November 27, 2024, he and fellow journalist Saqib Bashir were abducted from the Pims Hospital parking area by men in police uniforms, blindfolded and taken to an unknown location where they were tortured and illegally detained. He claimed that police later registered a bogus FIR at Margalla Police Station, accusing him of terrorism and drug smuggling. Jan said his colleague’s sworn affidavit before the Anti-Terrorism Court confirmed their abduction. Jan also recalled his 2020 abduction , underscoring that such acts violated his constitutional and professional rights, as well as the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act, 2021. He had urged the IG to appoint an honest and independent officer to investigate the case on merit.",

      "summary_orig": "‘Life on Earth is adapted to the rotation of our planet. … There are also indications that chronic misalignment between our lifestyle and the rhythm dictated by our inner timekeeper is associated with increased risk for various diseases.’ — The Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine OUR existence is a rhythm which continues to play every 24 hours, throughout our lives. This is true for all living beings — animals, plants and even microorganisms. Sounds a bit poetic, a bit mystical — indeed that’s how our existence is. Our body functions are hardwired to an endogenous day and night clock. We follow this in autopilot mode — not at the conscious level, but very much like breathing. We breathe all the time but we don’t have to think about breathing. Likewise, a route is set for our bodies to follow every 24 hours (with individual variations of up to four hours or so). It is an intrinsic autonomous daily routine called the circadian rhythm. Here is a super summary of it. As the darkness of the night fades and sunlight gradually takes over, light enters our eyes and strikes the retina at the back. The photoreceptor cells of the retina convert the light into neural signals, which are then transmitted through the optic nerve to the hypothalamus, a part in the forebrain which regulates many autonomic functions, for example, temperature, hunger, sleep and emotions. The light signal stimulates a particular part of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which then triggers the release of a hormone called cortisol. This is primarily secreted by the adrenal glands located on top of our kidneys. To be healthy is to be in sync with our circadian rhythm. Cortisol is an arousal hormone, which activates the body. Between 7am and 8am, our pancreas secretes the maximum insulin and our body needs glucose, so it’s time for a hearty breakfast. Around 9am, testosterone levels are elevated, which imparts a sense of well-being and boosts energy, among other functions. Around 10am our hormones have prepared us to face the world and we are ready for the day. Our alertness peaks at this time. Between 2pm and 6pm, our body temperature reaches its daily high, which makes our muscles more flexible and pliable. We have the greatest cardiovascular and skeletal muscle strength at around 5pm. At 6pm, we have the highest level of lipids in our bloodstream. It is in anticipation of the fasting period at night during sleep since lipid metabolism is slow. At around 8pm, we have the highest level of neutrophils circulating in our body. As guardians against inflammation, these white blood cells are ready to take their position during the night in our cells to undertake immune surveillance and respond to any cell damage. Around 9pm, the small cone-shaped pineal gland, situated almost at the centre of the brain between the two hemispheres, slowly starts releasing the sleep hormone melatonin. We are tired, start yawning and are ready to fall asleep. Between 2am to 4am we have the deepest restorative sleep. This is when we don’t even see dreams and are unconscious. During this phase we have our lowest body temperature in 24 hours. After deep sleep, there is again a gradual build-up of cortisol and we slowly wake up, also due to sunlight, ready for another day. Day after day, apart from autonomous breathing, a beating heart, constant digestive work in our gut, the functioning of our liver and kidneys, there is a timetable followed by our hormones which bring changes in our physiology at fixed times of the day. The science of the circadian rhythm has been a subject of constant inquiry by researchers. Experiments have startled scientists who find that even if a person is kept constantly in a dark environment for 24 hours and there are no external stimuli of light, the body still follows the timings of the circadian rhythm. The same is true for plants. Most readers would know about the plant called touch-me-not (Mimosa Pudica), which folds its leaves on being touched. This plant has been extensively studied. Normally, it folds its leaves at night and unfurls them in sunlight. However, it would still follow the same routine if kept in complete darkness for 24 hours, i.e., folding and unfurling its leaves at fixed times of the 24-hour day. This shows that these attributes of organisms are deeply embedded in our existence at the genetic level. In 1971, a gene was finally located in a fruit fly by American chronobiologists. They called it a ‘period (per) gene’. The per gene is “the first discovered genetic determinant of behavioural rhythmicity”. Later, another gene called the ‘time gene’ was also discovered. They also demonstrated that if these genes are destroyed then the fruit fly loses its circadian rhythm. Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young were given the Nobel Prize of Physiology or Medicine in 2017 for this “cracking the clock” discovery. The quote in the beginning of the column is from a press release issued by the Nobel Committee at the time of bestowing this Nobel Prize. Please read this again. Our state of health and disease has a lot to do with how much we are aligned or misaligned with our circadian rhythm. External stimuli, those in the environment — for instance, light, temperature and especially those we generate ourselves through our lifestyle behaviour — if not aligned with our circadian rhythm, can have a huge negative effect on our health and we become prone to developing various diseases. The lifestyle stimuli include what and when we eat; whether and when and how we exercise; when we sleep and the quality of sleep; how we manage stress; the quality of our social connectedness and relationships and whether we use any addictive substances. To be healthy is to be in sync with our diurnal or circadian rhythm, and to be mindful about it.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Punjab and Islamabad have emerged as jointly “the most dangerous places” for journalists in Pakistan, as violations against the media surged by around 60 per cent in the year leading up to the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, observed on November 2, compared to the preceding year. This was revealed in the Annual Impunity Report 2025 of Freedom Network, produced with assistance of International Media Support (IMS). The report indicates a worsening environment of freedom of expression and the safety of journalists under the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The report noted a “sharp rise” in attacks and violations against journalists and other media professionals in Pakistan. “At least 142 cases of violations were documented, marking a nearly 60pc increase compared to the previous year. The hostile environment for the media, which intensified after the February 2024 general elections, has made almost every region in Pakistan unsafe for journalism, with incidents reported across all provinces and territories,” it said. It also documented at least 36 formal legal cases against 30 journalists and media practitioners under the controversial Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) during the first year of the current federal government. The Act was amended through the parliament in early 2025, making its punitive provisions harsher for journalists, which sparked widespread outcry. Of these 36 cases, 22 cases were registered under the Peca and 14 under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), with some individuals facing multiple charges. Most Peca cases targeted practitioners in Punjab, while all PPC cases were also registered in the province. The report, titled “Impunity Report — 2025: Crime and Punishment in Pakistan’s Journalism World,” is Freedom Network’s annual flag publication. It provides detailed insight into the impunity for crimes against journalists and efforts to combat the menace, which undermines the freedom to report freely and professionally. “The use of legal framework to crack down on free expression has become a tool the federal government is now using excessively to target critical voices. Pakistan cannot afford to silence critical media, which is equally important in a democratic dispensation,” Freedom Network Executive Director Iqbal Khattak said, responding to the increasing number of legal cases against journalists under Peca and other laws. Covering violations against journalists and media professionals across Pakistan from Nov 2024 to Sept 2025, the report found Punjab and Islamabad to be the most dangerous places for journalists.

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Punjab and Islamabad have emerged as jointly “the most dangerous places” for journalists in Pakistan, as violations against the media surged by around 60 per cent in the year leading up to the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, observed on November 2, compared to the preceding year. This was revealed in the Annual Impunity Report 2025 of Freedom Network, produced with assistance of International Media Support (IMS). The report indicates a worsening environment of freedom of expression and the safety of journalists under the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The report noted a “sharp rise” in attacks and violations against journalists and other media professionals in Pakistan. “At least 142 cases of violations were documented, marking a nearly 60pc increase compared to the previous year. The hostile environment for the media, which intensified after the February 2024 general elections, has made almost every region in Pakistan unsafe for journalism, with incidents reported across all provinces and territories,” it said. It also documented at least 36 formal legal cases against 30 journalists and media practitioners under the controversial Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) during the first year of the current federal government. The Act was amended through the parliament in early 2025, making its punitive provisions harsher for journalists, which sparked widespread outcry. Of these 36 cases, 22 cases were registered under the Peca and 14 under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), with some individuals facing multiple charges. Most Peca cases targeted practitioners in Punjab, while all PPC cases were also registered in the province. The report, titled “Impunity Report — 2025: Crime and Punishment in Pakistan’s Journalism World,” is Freedom Network’s annual flag publication. It provides detailed insight into the impunity for crimes against journalists and efforts to combat the menace, which undermines the freedom to report freely and professionally. “The use of legal framework to crack down on free expression has become a tool the federal government is now using excessively to target critical voices. Pakistan cannot afford to silence critical media, which is equally important in a democratic dispensation,” Freedom Network Executive Director Iqbal Khattak said, responding to the increasing number of legal cases against journalists under Peca and other laws. Covering violations against journalists and media professionals across Pakistan from Nov 2024 to Sept 2025, the report found Punjab and Islamabad to be the most dangerous places for journalists.

      "summary_orig": "• PPP likely to announce PM nominee today as incumbent premier stays put • AJK planning department suspends release of development funds ISLAMABAD: After days of consultations, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday endorsed the plan for in-house change in Azad Kashmir in a meeting attended by senior PPP and PML-N leadership at the Presidency. Sources said the name of the PPP candidate for AJK premiership would most likely be announced today (Friday) after a meeting of the PPP AJK parliamentary party to be chaired by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. A source describing the meeting as the final round of consultations over the upcoming no-trust motion termed it “very positive”. He said both sides called for political stability in Azad Kashmir and criticised the incumbent AJK government for the manner in which it handled recent protests in the state. A member of the AJK Assembly, when asked if the PML-N would vote for the no-confidence motion against Anwar ul Haq as well as for the PPP nominee, said that “they will be automatically voting for the PPP candidate when they vote against Haq, as the successor’s name will be there on the resolution to be passed”. It may be noted here that it is mandatory under the interim constitution to summon the session of the Legislative Assembly within 14 days of the submission of the resolution for a vote of no-confidence. The resolution has to be signed by at least 14 members of the House. Under the law, a resolution for a vote of no-confidence cannot be moved in the assembly unless, by the same resolution, the name of another member of the assembly is put forward as the successor. “A resolution shall not be voted upon before the expiration of three days, or later than seven days, from the date on which it is moved in the assembly,” the law reads. Azad Jammu and Kashmir Interim Constitution Act 1974 provides that when a no-confidence motion is passed in the house, the successor proposed in the resolution becomes the next prime minister without any separate election procedure. Meanwhile, incumbent AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar ul Haq, who at one stage had decided to step dow n, has decided to remain the chief executive of the state as long as he can. A source close to him said though the option of resigning before a vote on no-confidence will be open, PM Haq was ready to face the vote. Moreover, the Planning and Develo­pment Department of Azad Jammu and Kashmir has suspended the release of funds to the tune of billions sanctioned for different line departments for development projects under the annual development programme for the first half of the current financial year 2025-26. The letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn , proposed clearance of Rs 3,721.259 million in “mature liabilities” in various sectors like communication, agriculture, education, health, etc. A formal notification barred the release of further funds for any development scheme without written approval. Huge funds amounting to well over seven billion, however, have already been released to different departments. Published in Dawn, October 31st, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Istanbul dialogue: Pakistan, Afghanistan agree to continue ceasefire",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed early on Friday morning to continue a ceasefire between the two countries following a rapid deterioration of ties and a brief conflict along their shared border earlier this month. A second round of discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had began in Istanbul on Saturday, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Kabul remained a major point of contention, resulting in a stalemate . A breakthrough came after Türkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week, following Pakistan’s announcement on Wednesday that the talks had “failed” and that its negotiators were preparing to return home. A joint statement released by Türkiye, the host of the latest round of talks, early on Friday stated “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. Though the statement didn’t specify who the “principals” would be, it is expected that it meant the defence ministers of the two countries, who led their sides in the first round in Doha, would now meet in Istanbul. The joint statement further said that during this period, the two countries also agreed on a “monitoring and verification mechanism” to ensure the maintenance of peace and to impose a penalty on the side that breaches the ceasefire. “All parties have agreed to put in place a monitoring and verification mechanism that will ensure maintenance of peace and imposing penalty on the violating party,” said the joint statement released by Türkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The statement further said that as mediators, Türkiye and Qatar expressed their appreciation for the “active contribution of both parties” and the two countries will continue their cooperation with both sides for “lasting peace and stability”. Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, commenting on the development, said, “Just as the Islamic emirate seeks good relations with other neighbouring countries, it also desires positive ties with Pakistan and remains committed to relations based on mutual respect, non-interference in internal affairs and not posing a threat to any side.” The joint statement came shortly after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — who had earlier issued a strongly worded warning to Kabul after the stalemate in talks — said that a “ray of light” was visible in the Istanbul negotiations. “Different drafts are being exchanged for an eventual agreement. You can say that some ray of light is visible; there is very guarded optimism. Let’s hope that some shape emerges from this,“ he stated while speaking on Geo News show ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath ’. “Qatar and Türkiye are very respected by us and are our well-wishers. Türkiye clearly openly supported us in the Pakistan-India conflict, so we respect them and their opinion,” the defence minister said. ‘Verifiable action’ The Istanbul negotiations centred on Pakistan’s core demand that Afghanistan take “clear, verifiable and irreversible action” against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist groups involved in cross-border attacks from Afghan territory. Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, speaking earlier in Peshawar, reiterated Pakistan’s red lines, saying that while Islamabad desired peace with all its neighbours, it “will not allow cross-border terrorism to be perpetrated from Afghan soil against Pakistan.” The Taliban delegation, while participating in the dialogue, however, maintained that it could not fully control TTP operatives. A senior Taliban official said the Afghan side had offered to detain and expel any TTP members found on Afghan territory. “But Pakistan keeps insisting that we control TTP’s attacks inside Pakistan,” the official said. “These fighters are Pakistani nationals operating within Pakistan.” Pakistani negotiators also demanded that the Taliban formally declare the TTP a terrorist organisation and publicly denounce it as a fitna — an Islamic term for sedition or mischief. Diplomatic sources said direct interaction between the two delegations remained limited throughout the five days, with most communication handled through mediators. “Even during meal breaks, the sides barely spoke,” one source said. Afghanistan continues to deny harbouring militants, accusing Pakistan instead of violating its sovereignty through airstrikes and, according to Afghan media, allowing US drones to operate from its airspace — a charge Islamabad denies. Kabul insisted during the talks that any future agreement must include assurances against such operations. While the Istanbul agreement marks a breakthrough after days of tension, diplomats cautioned that deep mistrust persists. “This is a framework for peace, not yet peace itself,” a foreign diplomat said. “It will take sustained verification, discipline and trust to make it hold.” Border skirmishes and talks Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week , the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Türkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But on Wednesday, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.",

      "summary_orig": "• Despite Imran’s instructions not to air dirty laundry in public, Salman Akram Raja and Aliya Hamza engage in ‘Twitter war’ over decision to remove party’s central Punjab president and secretary • Dispute between senior lawyers over list of who gets to meet Imran in Adiala leaves many within the party red-faced LAHORE: Mere weeks after incarcerated founder Imr­an Khan warned party leaders against airing their dirty laundry in public, ano­ther tiff — this time over the leadership of PTI in central Punjab — has erupted over the social media platform X, in full public view. In a telling series of tweets on Thursday, Secretary Gene­ral Salman Akram Raja railed against those who were “conspiring against him”, and recalled that Mr Khan had personally tasked him with conveying messages from Adiala jail. Although he didn’t explain the issue at hand, a cursory glance at his earlier tweets and messages posted by other PTI leaders laid bare the dispute. The controversy centres around the ouster of PTI Cen­tral Punjab President Ahmad Chattha and Gene­ral Secre­tary Bilal Ejaz, who were remo­ved on instructions supposedly conveyed by Imran Khan on Oct 16, when he met Barr­ister Gohar Ali Khan and Salman Akram Raja in Adiala jail. Mr Chattha was one of the men shot and injured in Wazirabad when Imran Khan’s container was fired upon during a rally in 2022. A notification, issued on the same day by PTI’s Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza, had announced Mr Chattha’s removal. He was to be replaced by Ali Imtiaz Warraich. Aliya Hamza Following the Oct 16 meeting, however, Mr Raja had tweeted that the party founder had not ordered any change in the Punjab hierarchy in his presence, adding that they would seek confirmation of this decision from Mr Khan at their next meeting. In a tweet on Wednesday, however, he clarified that he was told the ‘decision’ to remove both men was conveyed — ostensibly to Barrister Gohar — before he arrived at the prison. Speaking to the media on Thursday, Mr Raja disclosed that two lawyers, Ali Imran and Mubashir Maqsood Awan, had met Imran Khan in jail, and later claimed that he had instructed the appointment of Mr Warraich as central Punjab president. In a tweet, Mr Raja also claimed that he told the new president, Ali Imtiaz, to start working after being informed that the confusion stemming from the matter had brought the party’s affairs to a standstill in Punjab. But the decision to remove the two men was disputed by Imran’s sister Uzma during an interaction with reporters, as well as a tweet from Mr Khan’s official X account — which he doesn’t have access to while in prison. “I wish to make it clear that Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. They have stood by me with unwavering loyalty and made tremendous sacrifices. I have not issued any orders for their removal,” said the tweet, published on Wednesday. Diving headfirst into the fray, PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza tweeted that Imran Khan was the final authority on all decisions, and that she was simply implementing the instructions that had been passed to her. Ms Hamza had earlier appointed Ali Imran as the party’s Punjab spokesman. When approached, party insiders alleged that Ali Imran was a controversial person, being one of the men who ‘misguided’ Salman Akram Raja over Ahmad Chattha’s removal. Some went as far as to accuse Ms Hamza of ‘playing for the other team’, claiming that she was preoccupied by optics; holding meetings, visiting workers’ homes, holding cake-cutting ceremonies and protests on court premises, while silencing voices being raised from the party’s Punjab media cell. When approached for comment, Aliya Hamza denied any leadership crisis, saying that the PTI Punjab president’s portfolio was still with Dr Yasmin Rashid, adding that Mr Khan had instructed her to serve as acting president after Hammad Azhar stepped down from the role. List dispute Salman Akram Raja Another dispute that Mr Raja alluded to in his tweets on Thursday was the confusion about who would submit lists for access to Adiala jail. It may be recalled that the Supreme Court had recently specified that the party’s secretary general, i.e. Salman Akram Raja, should be the one to submit such lists. However, a tug-of-war over who has the authority to issue these lists erupted after two separate lists were sent to the Adiala Jail superintendent on Oct 29, one by secretary-general Salman Akram Raja and the other by Barrister Ali Zafar. In another thread of tweets on Thursday, Mr Raja explained that he had personally messaged Barrister Zafar, informing him that he would send the list. He then claimed to have forwarded the list to the superintendent through TCS, WhatsApp and in person through a lawyer. However, he wrote, “Senator Zafar still sent a separate list of meeting participants”. Party leaders Dawn spoke to on Thursday seemed embarrassed, saying that such a controversy erupting between such senior party members was tantamount to ‘party ka mazaaq’ (making a mockery of the party).

      "summary_orig": "Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir said on Thursday that Pakistan sought peace with all neighbours, including Afghanistan, but reiterated that the country will not allow cross-border terrorism to be perpetrated from Afghan soil. According to a statement from the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Field Marshal Munir made the comments during a trip to Peshawar, where he held an interactive session with a jirga of tribal elders. Later on, he was given a comprehensive briefing at Headquarters 11 Corps on the prevailing security environment, operational preparedness and ongoing counter terrorism efforts to maintain peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border. Pakistan-Afghanistan relations have worsened sharply in recent weeks, marked by border clashes and mutual accusations . Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul against permitting the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to use Afghan territory for attacks — an allegation the Taliban reject. After a ceasefire, both sides initiated talks in Turkiye to develop a mechanism for monitoring Taliban measures to curb cross-border assaults, but discussions have so far reached a stalemate. While addressing the jirga, Field Marshal Munir highlighted that “despite the continuation of cross-border terrorism from Afghanistan, Pakistan, over the last few years has exercised patience and extended multiple diplomatic and economic overtures to Afghanistan, aimed at improving Pak-Afghan bilateral relations.” “However, instead of acting decisively against Indian-sponsored terror proxies Fitna Al Khwarij and Fitna Al Hindustan , [the] Afghan Taliban regime has been providing all possible assistance to these groups,” the statement said. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. It added that during the interaction, the COAS assured the tribal elders that Pakistan, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, will be “cleansed of the terrorists and their abettors.” The army chief also appreciated the “steadfast and unconditional support” rendered by the tribal people to the security forces during the recent standoff between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban. “He paid rich tribute to the resilience and sacrifices of the brave people of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa in [the] war against terrorism,” the statement said, adding that the tribal elders reiterated their “full support to the armed forces against terrorism and also against the Afghan Taliban.” Per the statement, the tribal elders appreciated the candid discourse by the COAS and expressed their unwavering commitment to peace in Pakistan and highlighted that the “twisted ideology” of the Fitna al Khwarij had no acceptance among the tribes of KP.",

      "summary_orig": "Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men, dressed in black, rallied in Jerusalem on Thursday to protest against military conscription , an issue that has caused major strain in Israel’s right-wing ruling coalition. The vast crowd were protesting against the absence of a law guaranteeing their right to avoid Israel’s mandatory military service — a pledge long promised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Crowds of men, many wearing black hats, set fire to pieces of tarpaulin as hundreds of police officers cordoned off several roads across the city, AFP correspondents reported. Carrying placards denouncing conscription, demonstrators marched along main roads leading into Jerusalem. The mass demonstration follows a recent crackdown on ultra-Orthodox draft dodgers, with thousands of call-up notices sent in recent months and several deserters imprisoned. Under a ruling established at the time of Israel’s creation in 1948, when the ultra-Orthodox were a very small community, men who devote themselves full-time to the study of sacred Jewish texts are given a de facto pass. This exemption has come under mounting pressure since the military conflict erupted in Gaza in October 2023, as the military struggles to fill its ranks. Whether the exemption should be scrapped has been a long-running point of contention in Israeli society, with Netanyahu pledging that his government would pass a law enshrining the waiver. But he has so far failed to deliver. Responding to the call of two ultra-Orthodox parties — one of which forms a key part of the ruling coalition — men travelled from all over Israel today to demand the continuation of their exemptions. The police closed roads to Jerusalem and announced the mobilisation of 2,000 officers in the city. In June 2024, the supreme court ruled that the state must draft ultra-Orthodox men, declaring their exemption had expired. Vital support for coalition A parliamentary committee is now discussing a bill expected to end the exemptions and encourage young ultra-Orthodox men who are not studying full-time to enlist. The issue has placed Netanyahu’s coalition — one of the most right-wing in the country’s history — under severe strain. In July, ministers from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party resigned from the cabinet over the issue, though the party has not formally left the coalition. The other ultra-Orthodox party, United Torah Judaism, has already quit both the government and the coalition. Ultra-Orthodox Jews protest against conscription into Israel’s military in Jerusalem, Israel on October 30. — AFP The Sephardic Shas, which holds 11 seats in the 120-member Knesset (Israeli parliament), has warned that it will withdraw support unless military service exemptions are anchored in law — a move that could topple Netanyahu’s fragile coalition, now down to 60 seats. Some ultra-Orthodox rabbis fear that conscription will make young people less religious, but others accept that those who do not study holy texts full-time can enlist. Ultra-Orthodox Jews make up 14 per cent of Israel’s Jewish population, or about 1.3 million people, and roughly 66,000 men of military age currently benefit from the exemption. According to an army report presented to parliament in September, there has been a sharp increase in the number of ultra-Orthodox Jews enlisting despite opposition from their leaders, but the numbers still remain low, at a few hundred over the past two years.",

      "summary_orig": "Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said on Wednesday that first-time offenders caught by the newly implemented traffic e-ticketing system can have their fines waived within 10 days by appearing in person and submitting an apology, according to a press release. The CM inaugurated the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS), commonly known as the e-ticketing system, at the Central Police Office (CPO) on Monday. He explained that the new system replaces the outdated manual ticketing process with a fully automated e-ticketing mechanism, utilising advanced AI-integrated CCTV cameras to detect violations such as speeding, red-light jumping, and helmet non-compliance. According to the press release, CM Shah received a report from Sindh Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon detailing traffic rule violations under the new system, which has issued fines to 35 official vehicles for various infractions. “According to the report, e-challans were issued for offences such as not wearing seatbelts, running red lights, using tinted windows, and operating mobile phones while driving,” the press release stated. The report revealed that a police vehicle was fined for a seatbelt violation on the Lyari Expressway at 1:36pm on Tuesday. Traffic Deputy Inspector General Peer Muhammad Shah informed the chief minister that the vehicle’s driver was twice observed not wearing a seatbelt between Garden and Lyari Expressway, triggering the automated system to issue a Rs10,000 fine, according to the press release. “The CM said that first-time offenders can have their fines waived within 10 days by appearing in person and submitting an apology,” the press release stated. “Even the police must comply with traffic regulations. This system upholds fairness and accountability for all citizens,” CM Shah was quoted as saying. The press release added the provincial chief executive underlined the importance of traffic law compliance for public safety and directed that while first-time offenders can have their challans waived, repeat offenders would pay fines without exception. “All citizens have equal rights under the law — compliance must be ensured across the board,” CM Shah added. On Tuesday, more than 2,650 electronic challans were issued by the Karachi Traffic Police following the inauguration of the new e-ticketing system. According to the Sindh police, 1,535 challans were issued for not wearing a seat belt, 507 challans for riding a motorcycle without a helmet, 419 for speeding, 166 for running a red light, and 32 for using a mobile phone while driving. Additionally, seven challans were issued for putting tints on vehicle windows, five challans each for improper parking and parking in a no-parking zone, four for stop line violation, and three each for lane line violation and driving on the wrong way. In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred. The decision came amid Karachi witnessing a surge in traffic accidents , particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data. The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.",

      "summary_orig": "PTI-backed independent candidate Khurram Zeeshan on Thursday was elected as a senator on the general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz, who was the opposition leader in the Senate, after he was convicted in cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots. A minimum of 75 votes were needed to win the seat. Zeeshan won a total of 91 votes out of the 137 cast by KP lawmakers during the polling process today. He defeated opposition-backed Taj Mohammad Afridi, who was able to secure 45 votes. Out of the 145-member KP Assembly, eight lawmakers did not cast their ballots, including four Awami National Party (ANP) leaders. One vote was rejected. “Thank God,” Zeeshan said in a post on his Facebook account after his win. “Our priority is Pakistan’s haqeeqi azadi (true freedom)”, the PTI leader told reporters outside the KP Assembly earlier today, echoing a phrase used by Imran. Though three candidates were in the run for the polls, the main contest was expected to be between Zeeshan and Afridi. Irfan Saleem, another PTI-backed candidate on the electoral roll, was the covering candidate for Zeeshan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also took part in the voting process, with a post on his X account voicing support for Zeeshan. The polling began at 9:30am and concluded at 4pm, with provincial election commissioner Saeed Gul as the returning officer (RO). KP CM Sohail Afridi, a PTI MPA, casts his vote for Senate by-polls at KP Assembly on Oct 30, 2025. — via author JUI-F’s Gurpal Singh casts his vote for Senate by-polls at KP Assembly on Oct 30, 2025. — via author PPP’s MPA Ehsanullah Khan casts his vote for Senate by-polls at KP Assembly on Oct 30, 2025. — via author Zeeshan and Saleem had also been nominated by the PTI to contest the Senate elections in 2024, but the polls for seats from KP were postponed and later held in July this year. Afridi, who hails from the Khyber tribal district, was in 2020 reported to be the richest senator with his assets declared for the previous year amounting to Rs1.22 billion. Two other candidates — independent Abid Khan Yousafzai and PPP’s Nisar Khan — withdrew their candidature. Yesterday, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had dismissed the request of Faraz’s lawyer to stay today’s by-polls. Faraz had challenged his disqualification and subsequent de-notification as a senator before the Peshawar High Court (PHC). However, the PHC earlier this month denied him and two MNAs any relief, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats, and instead ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court. CM Afridi to announce ‘brief’ KP cabinet today Separately, CM Afridi said he would announce a “brief” provincial cabinet once the Senate elections had concluded. This comes two days after PTI founder Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “ complete authority ” to form the provincial cabinet after he was once again denied a meeting with the incarcerated ex-premier. Opposition MPAs in the KP Assembly have criticised the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province. Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, the chief minister said PTI came to power in the province for the third time because of its “good governance”. Afridi said he was listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today. He added that if barred again from meeting his party founder, he would file a contempt of court case against the Adiala jail administration for not implementing the Islamabad High Court’s directives . During his media talk, the chief minister termed the KP government the “main stakeholder” in the recent counterterrorism talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan. CM Afridi said the government and people of KP were not taken into confidence for “any decisions or talks”. While welcoming the Pak-Afghan discussions, he said his government had “some reservations”. The chief minister said Pakistan should take decisions while considering its interests. However, he added that the security decisions of KP, which has “sacrificed more than 80,000 lives in the war against terrorism”, should not be taken behind closed doors. CM Afridi said, “One person comes with his formula and turns them (militants) into Mujahideens and heroes. Another person comes and carries out operations. A third person comes and thinks about rehabilitating them. Then a fourth person again thinks to conduct operations.” “This is not a laboratory; this is our province,” he quipped, calling for a clear policy and questioning why terrorism had not been eradicated despite thousands of intelligence-based operations. The chief minister further said legal action should be taken against those responsible for “collateral damage in drone attacks”. He added that an in-house committee of all parliamentary leaders yesterday discussed various topics, including the introduction of laws related to the matter.\n۔",

      "title": "PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan wins Senate seat vacated after Shibli Faraz’s disqualification",
      "summary": "PTI-backed independent candidate Khurram Zeeshan on Thursday was elected as a senator on the general seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The seat had fallen vacant following the disqualification of PTI leader Shibli Faraz, who was the opposition leader in the Senate, after he was convicted in cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots. A minimum of 75 votes were needed to win the seat. Zeeshan won a total of 91 votes out of the 137 cast by KP lawmakers during the polling process today. He defeated opposition-backed Taj Mohammad Afridi, who was able to secure 45 votes. Out of the 145-member KP Assembly, eight lawmakers did not cast their ballots, including four Awami National Party (ANP) leaders. One vote was rejected. “Thank God,” Zeeshan said in a post on his Facebook account after his win. “Our priority is Pakistan’s haqeeqi azadi (true freedom)”, the PTI leader told reporters outside the KP Assembly earlier today, echoing a phrase used by Imran. Though three candidates were in the run for the polls, the main contest was expected to be between Zeeshan and Afridi. Irfan Saleem, another PTI-backed candidate on the electoral roll, was the covering candidate for Zeeshan. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also took part in the voting process, with a post on his X account voicing support for Zeeshan. The polling began at 9:30am and concluded at 4pm, with provincial election commissioner Saeed Gul as the returning officer (RO). KP CM Sohail Afridi, a PTI MPA, casts his vote for Senate by-polls at KP Assembly on Oct 30, 2025. — via author JUI-F’s Gurpal Singh casts his vote for Senate by-polls at KP Assembly on Oct 30, 2025. — via author PPP’s MPA Ehsanullah Khan casts his vote for Senate by-polls at KP Assembly on Oct 30, 2025. — via author Zeeshan and Saleem had also been nominated by the PTI to contest the Senate elections in 2024, but the polls for seats from KP were postponed and later held in July this year. Afridi, who hails from the Khyber tribal district, was in 2020 reported to be the richest senator with his assets declared for the previous year amounting to Rs1.22 billion. Two other candidates — independent Abid Khan Yousafzai and PPP’s Nisar Khan — withdrew their candidature. Yesterday, a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had dismissed the request of Faraz’s lawyer to stay today’s by-polls. Faraz had challenged his disqualification and subsequent de-notification as a senator before the Peshawar High Court (PHC). However, the PHC earlier this month denied him and two MNAs any relief, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats, and instead ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court. CM Afridi to announce ‘brief’ KP cabinet today Separately, CM Afridi said he would announce a “brief” provincial cabinet once the Senate elections had concluded. This comes two days after PTI founder Im­ran Khan’s sister told the newly appointed CM he had “ complete authority ” to form the provincial cabinet after he was once again denied a meeting with the incarcerated ex-premier. Opposition MPAs in the KP Assembly have criticised the PTI over its failure to form the provincial cabinet, saying the government affairs had come to a halt. The lawmakers also feared that the prolonged delay in the cabinet formation was tantamount to inviting the imposition of an emergency in the province. Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, the chief minister said PTI came to power in the province for the third time because of its “good governance”. Afridi said he was listed among the individuals allowed to meet Imran today. He added that if barred again from meeting his party founder, he would file a contempt of court case against the Adiala jail administration for not implementing the Islamabad High Court’s directives . During his media talk, the chief minister termed the KP government the “main stakeholder” in the recent counterterrorism talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan. CM Afridi said the government and people of KP were not taken into confidence for “any decisions or talks”. While welcoming the Pak-Afghan discussions, he said his government had “some reservations”. The chief minister said Pakistan should take decisions while considering its interests. However, he added that the security decisions of KP, which has “sacrificed more than 80,000 lives in the war against terrorism”, should not be taken behind closed doors. CM Afridi said, “One person comes with his formula and turns them (militants) into Mujahideens and heroes. Another person comes and carries out operations. A third person comes and thinks about rehabilitating them. Then a fourth person again thinks to conduct operations.” “This is not a laboratory; this is our province,” he quipped, calling for a clear policy and questioning why terrorism had not been eradicated despite thousands of intelligence-based operations. The chief minister further said legal action should be taken against those responsible for “collateral damage in drone attacks”. He added that an in-house committee of all parliamentary leaders yesterday discussed various topics, including the introduction of laws related to the matter.\n۔",
