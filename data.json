      "summary_orig": "Korea aims to cut carbon emissions at its international airports by 10 percent by 2030 while expanding the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a government report showed Sunday. Under the blueprint for the 2026-2030 period, set by the transport, environment and industry ministries, carbon emissions at Korea's international airports are projected to reach 29.8 million tons in 2030, up 28 percent from 23.3 million tons recorded this year. The government aims to reduce the projected amount by 10 percent, or 2.87 million tons. The report said the reduction can be achieved by using SAF, shorter standby time during takeoff and landing, and improved efficiency in airport operations. In line with the efforts, international aircraft taking off from Korea will be required to use SAF for at least 1 percent of their fuel, and the share will be raised to between 3 percent and 5 percent after 2030. Korea will come up with measures to ease the financial burden on air carriers, considering that SAF prices are around three times higher than those of conventional jet fuel, including partially assisting",

      "title_orig": "Law minister Tarar stresses need for ‘national dialogue’, highlights significance of political and economic stability",
      "summary_orig": "Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar stressed on Sunday the need for a national dialogue, saying Pakistan required political and economic stability as the country remains mired in political clashes between the government and the opposition. “Politics is the name of a continuous process,“ he said, as he addressed a seminar in Lahore. “No country or nation can progress amid political and economic instability.” The relationship between the government and the opposition has come under additional strain in recent weeks, especially after the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan as a “national security threat”, triggering a strong reaction . Moreover, Imran, who is already facing a slew of legal cases, was once again sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday, making his release uncertain. The law minister stated that the country had witnessed cultures of tolerance as well as violence, emphasising that it was the duty of politicians to “balance out” these tendencies and pave a way through “dialogue”. He emphasised that all politicians must play their role in preventing violence and extremism from paving the way into politics. “We feel the need for a national dialogue, only for the sake of our beloved country.“ Emphasising restraint and respect for dissent, he called for “listening to opponents, embracing positive criticism, and forging a national political charter to ensure stability”. Meanwhile, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) – the grand opposition alliance headed by Mahmood Khan Achakzai – is currently holding a two-day national conference in Islamabad. The alliance had also called for a national dialogue in all parties’ conference in August, calling for a new charter of democracy between all political stakeholders. “The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” they said. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had also shown his willingness to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties. However, there has been no formal initiation of the dialogue between the government and the opposition since last year. PM’s advisor warns against ‘confrontation and violence’ Speaking at the same event, the Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said political stability can only be achieved through “restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue.” He warned that “confrontation and violence” had repeatedly derailed Pakistan’s democratic course. “No nation can progress through fighting, chaos and disorder,” adding that attacks on defence installations were “gravely wrong” and unacceptable. He argued that political instability emerges when parties abandon dialogue for confrontation, stressing that the government has repeatedly offered talks. “Tell us — who is refusing dialogue? If it is us, we will correct ourselves; if it is someone else, name them,” he said. Rejecting claims that the general elections were selectively fair or unfair, Sanaullah recalled that even in 2018, the opposition alleged mandate theft, yet extended an offer to work together in parliament — an offer that was rebuffed with threats of imprisonment by Imran. “If elections are disputed, political parties — not the establishment — must decide the way forward. Political stability is essential for national progress.” Sanaullah also cited overtures made before the passage of this year’s budget, saying Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly invited the opposition for talks, including in the presence of the military leadership, proposing a ‘Charter of Pakistan’. “Who is declining political dialogue?” he asked again, urging clarity to remove ambiguities blocking stability. The former interior minister said, noting that while second-tier leadership within the PTI favours dialogue, fear of backlash from within the party’s ranks had stifled it. Saad Rafique calls for Charters of Democracy and Economy Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique called for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, warning against inter-provincial polarisation and repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote. Rafique underscored that confrontation and chaos cannot strengthen the state, warning that repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote had eroded public trust. Calling for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, he urged “engagement with all constitutional forces and dialogue with institutions to reduce political pressure and restore stability”.",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan rout India to clinch U-19 Asia Cup title as Sameer Minhas and Ali Raza star",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan produced a dominant all-round performance to thrash arch-rivals India by a massive 191 runs in the final of the U-19 Asia Cup at the ICC Academy Ground on Sunday, claiming the prestigious title in emphatic fashion. Opener Sameer Minhas lit up the first half of the match with a record-breaking 172 — the highest individual score in a U-19 Asia Cup final — propelling Pakistan to a formidable 347 for 8 after being asked to bat first. In reply, India’s much-vaunted batting line-up crumbled spectacularly, folding for a paltry 156 in just 26.2 overs as pacer Ali Raza ripped through the order with figures of 4 for 42. The victory marked a sweet redemption for Pakistan, who had suffered a heavy defeat to the same opponents in the group stage and had entered the final as underdogs against an unbeaten Indian side. Instead, it was Pakistan who delivered a clinical display, overwhelming India in every department to lift the trophy amid jubilant celebrations. India captain Ayush Mhatre won the toss and elected to bowl, perhaps hoping to restrict Pakistan on a surface expected to assist the seamers early on. However, the decision backfired spectacularly as Sameer launched a brutal assault from the outset. After Hamza Zahoor fell early for 18, Sameer combined with Usman Khan (35) and Ahmed Hussain (56) in substantial partnerships — 92 for the second wicket and 137 for the third — to put Pakistan in complete command. The right-hander brought up his century off 71 balls and raced to 172 off 113 deliveries, studded with 17 fours and nine sixes, before falling to a slower ball from Deepesh Devendran in the 43rd over. A late flurry of wickets — five falling for 45 runs in the final overs — prevented Pakistan from reaching 400, but their total remained the highest ever posted in a U-19 Asia Cup final. Khilan Patel was the pick of India’s bowlers with 2 for 44, while Devendran claimed 3 for 83. Chasing 348, India started explosively, racing to 21 in the first over off Ali Raza, with Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashing a six and four in an over that also included a no-ball and extras. Suryavanshi continued the onslaught, striking three sixes and a four in his blistering 26 off 10 balls. But the introduction of spin and disciplined pace turned the tide irreversibly. Captain Mhatre (2) holed out to mid-off, Aaron George (16 off 9) miscued a pull, and Suryavanshi nicked behind — all falling to Raza and Mohammad Sayyam as India slipped to 49 for 3 in the fifth over. The collapse deepened. Vihaan Malhotra (7) was bowled attempting a rash pull off Abdul Subhan, Vedant Trivedi (9) found short midwicket, and Abhigyan Kundu (13) upper-cut to deep third. Kanishk Chouhan (9) and Khilan Patel (19) offered brief resistance, but regular strikes kept India on the back foot. Lower down, Deepesh Devendran provided late entertainment with a quickfire 36 off 16 balls, including six fours and two sixes, but his dismissal — skying one to point off Raza — ended any lingering hopes. Subhan (2-29) and off-spinner Huzaifa Ahsan (2-12) chipped in effectively, while Sayyam supported with 2 for 38. India’s innings lasted a mere 26.2 overs, underscoring Pakistan’s bowling dominance and fielding sharpness after the break. The margin of victory was the largest in a U-19 Asia Cup final, completing a comprehensive rout. Man of the Match Sameer was hoisted onto his team-mates’ shoulders as Pakistan celebrated wildly, while India, unbeaten until the final, were left to rue a day when nothing went right.",

      "summary_orig": "Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has said that formations of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) infiltrating into Pakistan mostly comprised Afghans. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. The defence forces’ chief made this statement at the National Ulema Conference held in Islamabad on December 10. However, details of the Field Marshal’s address at the conference were scant thus far and clips of his speech from the event were broadcast on television today. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to put an end to the use of Afghan soil by terrorists for carrying out attacks in Pakistan. Kabul, however, denies the allegation. Turning his attention to the matter at the conference, CDF Munir questioned: “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He recalled that the Afghan Taliban had been told to choose between Pakistan and the TTP. Speaking about the four-day May conflict with India, he said in Pakistan’s retaliatory operation during the confrontation, Bunyanum Marsoos, the armed forces received “divine help”. “We felt it,” he commented. India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, an act which led to the worst between the old foes in decades. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles , artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people , before agreeing to a ceasefire . The confrontation followed an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22, which resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”. The Field Marshal also stated that there were 57 Islamic countries in the world, and among them, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain (a reference to Makkah and Madina)”. He also drew parallels between Pakistan and the Islamic State established in Saudi Arabia 1,400 years ago. “Both are founded for the same reason […], were founded in the same month, the Ramazan, and their establishment involved the element of migration.” The CDF further said that no one could order jihad in an Islamic state other than the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said during the conference. The Field Marshal also cited multiple verses from the Quran during his address.",

Low visibility due to fog was reported from Super Highway, Surjani Town, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, I.I. Chundrigarh Road, Clifton and Defence. Updates on the Karachi airport’s website showed that multiple flights were cancelled or delayed in the morning. Pakistan Airports Authority spokesperson Saifullah Khan confirmed in a statement that six international flights scheduled to land in Karachi had to be diverted due to fog. The statement said that the diversion was a usual safety measure taken due to reduced visibility. It added that Pegasus Airlines, Eitehad Airways, Flyadeal and Gulf Air flights had been diverted to Muscat. Moreover, a Pakistan International Airlines flight that had departed from Madina, too, had to be divered to Muscat. Similarly, Fly Jinnah flight arriving from Jeddah was diverted to Islamabad. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), shallow fog also engulfed the Rahim Yar Khan-Karachi Highway and Karachi-Lasbella Highway between 8am and 11am. Air quality Updates on air quality monitoring platform IQAir around 11:30am showed that the air quality was “very unhealthy” in the city, with an AQI reading of 282.

Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”. Road accident Police, meanwhile, reported the death of a motorcyclist in an accident, attributing it to hazy weather conditions, among other factors. South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Asad Raza told Dawn that the incident occurred on Clifton Bridge due to “smog, slippery roads and speeding”.

      "summary_orig": "Illustration by Abro George Orwell’s classic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four , published in 1949, explores a fictional totalitarian regime that maintains absolute power by dismantling individual thought, memory and personal connection. Orwell wrote the novel after witnessing the rise of fascism in Germany and, especially, the Stalinist system in the Soviet Union. A self-described socialist, Orwell fought against fascists in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). But he critically differentiated between ‘democratic-socialism’ and the communism practised in the Soviet Union. By the time Nineteen Eighty-Four was published, totalitarianism in Germany had fallen, but Stalinism persisted. Orwell was particularly disturbed by the Soviet Union’s trajectory, having already satirised it in his 1945 allegory Animal Farm . In Nineteen Eighty-Four , he presented a warning about communism’s potential to create a terrifying dystopia. The term ‘Orwellian’ quickly entered political discourse as a universal descriptor for state overreach, the manipulation of truth and society’s tendency toward mass surveillance and the erosion of individual privacy. From e-challans to clamping down on fake news, almost everything is lazily labelled as ‘Orwellian’ these days by people who do not understand exactly what George Orwell’s writing was critiquing However, since the conclusion of the Cold War in 1991, one can argue that the term ‘Orwellian’ has been stripped of its original meaning, often serving as a catch-all phrase for any unpopular policy. Recently, a friend described the e-challan traffic cameras installed in Karachi as “Orwellian”. He was serious. In a 2021 essay, American novelist Rachel Klein observed that Orwell’s novel and the term ‘Orwellian’ have become political shorthand for censorship and authoritarianism, often used by those who wish to decry state power but without truly understanding Orwell’s specific critiques. Individuals frequently cite the novel and the term due to personal grievances, such as facing social media bans, increased taxation or ‘unpopular’ judicial decisions, regardless of the novel’s actual context. This linguistic drift mirrors the devaluation of the word ‘fascism’. Orwell himself noted in 1944 that the word ‘fascism’ had lost its weight, becoming a mere synonym for the word ‘bully’. Historically, fascism was a systematic, amoral ideology that sparked genocides and a global war while attempting the total psychological subjugation of society. As a word, it just cannot be used nonchalantly or in a matter-of-fact manner. The term ‘Orwellian’ has also become trivialised. Many scholars posit that the manner in which the term is applied to modern inconveniences qualifies it to become obsolete. To understand why this is so, one must look at how modern society differs from the one in Orwell’s novel. The nature of social control in reality is dramatically different from the dystopian world envisioned in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four . American-Canadian cultural theorist Henry A. Giroux observes that while, in the novel, the state enforced surveillance through omnipresent/unavoidable telescreens, today, surveillance is largely voluntary. People willingly exchange their biometrics, habits and movements via the convenience of smartphones, social media and smart home devices. Furthermore, according to Indian assistant professor Anuradha, instead of the monolithic state serving as the primary overseer in Orwell’s narrative, in today’s reality, the main overseers in this regard are private corporate entities. This paradigm is often termed “surveillance capitalism”, where corporations harvest massive amounts of personal data, converting the human experience into data and selling it for profit, making the corporate entity, rather than the state, the primary overseer of the 21st century. This has actually weakened the role of the state. In fact, the state is also struggling to come to terms with this reality. In Nineteen Eighty-Four , the state physically deleted or rewrote history, but modern day control is often achieved through information saturation and/or through an overwhelming abundance of content, misinformation and algorithmic echo chambers that intentionally obscure the distinction between truth and fiction. These are often the doings of new tech corporations and citizens, and not so much of the state. In other words, these conditions are largely being produced by non-state actors. In another stark contrast, Nineteen Eighty-Four depicted a world defined by constant war and extreme scarcity, enforced rationing and austerity. Many modern societies, however, are driven by hectic consumption, fuelled by advertising and rapacity. Adding to this conceptual dilution is the trivialised way Orwell’s novel and the term ‘Orwellian’ are currently used by the political left and right. They accuse each other of being ‘Orwellian’, much like they use the term ‘fascist’/‘fascism’. Both sides have drained these words of their actual meaning, using them instead as clichés for anything they disagree with. Both have hollowed out the actual meaning of these terms, employing them as facile labels for disagreement. A lot of people, both on the right and the left, frequently apply the term ‘Orwellian’ when private companies such as X and Facebook ban accounts. Yet, ‘Orwellian’ strictly describes state-sponsored control of thought and language. Nothing’s private in his novel. The term is also misapplied to government policies such as pandemic lockdowns or public health mandates, despite Orwell’s support for state intervention during crises. The pushback against clamping down on fake news is also termed as ‘Orwellian’ by many ‘free speech’ advocates. The irony is that it is the pushback that is actually ‘Orwellian’, because the creation of an alternative reality through fake news and claims using political jargon is arguably the very essence of the distortion that Orwell warned against. Orwell’s true target was totalitarianism in all its forms, encompassing both the right and the left. In 2021, the American writer Benjamin Newcomb wrote that the term ‘Orwellian’ has become too vague, too cliché and too pretentious to be of use anymore. It is invoked to describe any number of events that its user finds distasteful. The issue is not that ‘Orwellian’ is an ill-conceived word, but that it is a word whose meaning has frayed. Sales of Nineteen Eighty-Four have once again spiked in recent years. Indeed, Orwell is back in vogue, but still quite out of context. Published in Dawn, EOS, December 21st, 2025",

But he critically differentiated between ‘democratic-socialism’ and the communism practised in the Soviet Union. By the time Nineteen Eighty-Four was published, totalitarianism in Germany had fallen, but Stalinism persisted. Orwell was particularly disturbed by the Soviet Union’s trajectory, having already satirised it in his 1945 allegory Animal Farm . In Nineteen Eighty-Four , he presented a warning about communism’s potential to create a terrifying dystopia. The term ‘Orwellian’ quickly entered political discourse as a universal descriptor for state overreach, the manipulation of truth and society’s tendency toward mass surveillance and the erosion of individual privacy. From e-challans to clamping down on fake news, almost everything is lazily labelled as ‘Orwellian’ these days by people who do not understand exactly what George Orwell’s writing was critiquing However, since the conclusion of the Cold War in 1991, one can argue that the term ‘Orwellian’ has been stripped of its original meaning, often serving as a catch-all phrase for any unpopular policy. Recently, a friend described the e-challan traffic cameras installed in Karachi as “Orwellian”. He was serious. In a 2021 essay, American novelist Rachel Klein observed that Orwell’s novel and the term ‘Orwellian’ have become political shorthand for censorship and authoritarianism, often used by those who wish to decry state power but without truly understanding Orwell’s specific critiques. Individuals frequently cite the novel and the term due to personal grievances, such as facing social media bans, increased taxation or ‘unpopular’ judicial decisions, regardless of the novel’s actual context. This linguistic drift mirrors the devaluation of the word ‘fascism’. Orwell himself noted in 1944 that the word ‘fascism’ had lost its weight, becoming a mere synonym for the word ‘bully’. Historically, fascism was a systematic, amoral ideology that sparked genocides and a global war while attempting the total psychological subjugation of society. As a word, it just cannot be used nonchalantly or in a matter-of-fact manner. The term ‘Orwellian’ has also become trivialised. Many scholars posit that the manner in which the term is applied to modern inconveniences qualifies it to become obsolete. To understand why this is so, one must look at how modern society differs from the one in Orwell’s novel. The nature of social control in reality is dramatically different from the dystopian world envisioned in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four . American-Canadian cultural theorist Henry A. Giroux observes that while, in the novel, the state enforced surveillance through omnipresent/unavoidable telescreens, today, surveillance is largely voluntary. People willingly exchange their biometrics, habits and movements via the convenience of smartphones, social media and smart home devices. Furthermore, according to Indian assistant professor Anuradha, instead of the monolithic state serving as the primary overseer in Orwell’s narrative, in today’s reality, the main overseers in this regard are private corporate entities. This paradigm is often termed “surveillance capitalism”, where corporations harvest massive amounts of personal data, converting the human experience into data and selling it for profit, making the corporate entity, rather than the state, the primary overseer of the 21st century. This has actually weakened the role of the state. In fact, the state is also struggling to come to terms with this reality. In Nineteen Eighty-Four , the state physically deleted or rewrote history, but modern day control is often achieved through information saturation and/or through an overwhelming abundance of content, misinformation and algorithmic echo chambers that intentionally obscure the distinction between truth and fiction. These are often the doings of new tech corporations and citizens, and not so much of the state. In other words, these conditions are largely being produced by non-state actors. In another stark contrast, Nineteen Eighty-Four depicted a world defined by constant war and extreme scarcity, enforced rationing and austerity. Many modern societies, however, are driven by hectic consumption, fuelled by advertising and rapacity. Adding to this conceptual dilution is the trivialised way Orwell’s novel and the term ‘Orwellian’ are currently used by the political left and right. They accuse each other of being ‘Orwellian’, much like they use the term ‘fascist’/‘fascism’. Both sides have drained these words of their actual meaning, using them instead as clichés for anything they disagree with. Both have hollowed out the actual meaning of these terms, employing them as facile labels for disagreement. A lot of people, both on the right and the left, frequently apply the term ‘Orwellian’ when private companies such as X and Facebook ban accounts. Yet, ‘Orwellian’ strictly describes state-sponsored control of thought and language. Nothing’s private in his novel. The term is also misapplied to government policies such as pandemic lockdowns or public health mandates, despite Orwell’s support for state intervention during crises. The pushback against clamping down on fake news is also termed as ‘Orwellian’ by many ‘free speech’ advocates. The irony is that it is the pushback that is actually ‘Orwellian’, because the creation of an alternative reality through fake news and claims using political jargon is arguably the very essence of the distortion that Orwell warned against. Orwell’s true target was totalitarianism in all its forms, encompassing both the right and the left. In 2021, the American writer Benjamin Newcomb wrote that the term ‘Orwellian’ has become too vague, too cliché and too pretentious to be of use anymore.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has declared that the protective bails, granted to scores of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s lawmakers and leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, were meant to facilitate their appearance before the relevant courts, so the relief shouldn’t be used for participating in protests or anti-state activities. “This interim relief shall not, under any circumstances, be construed, interpreted, invoked or relied upon by the petitioner(s) as a shield, protection, justification, or safeguard for any purpose other than facilitating their appearance before the competent court. For abundant caution, it is further clarified that this order shall not be used, directly or indirectly, to enable, justify or facilitate the petitioner(s) participation in any protest, demonstration, anti-state activity, or any event of a similar nature,” reads a ruling by a bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali in multiple cases. It declared that any misuse, abuse or attempt to extend the scope of that order beyond the limited purpose for which it had been granted would expose the petitioner(s) to appropriate legal consequences, including, but not limited to, proceedings in accordance with the law. The court issued these directives in a four-page detailed decision on the petition of former National Assembly speaker and current MNA Asad Qaiser and other PTI leaders. Bench declares that relief granted only for approaching relevant courts Qaiser had sought details of the cases registered against him by law-enforcement agencies and the grant of protective bail in those cases. The other petitions were filed by MPAs Sohail Afridi and former chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur, MNAs Sheikh Waqas Akram, Naseem Shah, Faisal Amin Khan, Shandana Gulzar, Noorul Haq Qadri and Yousaf Ali, Senator Khurram Zeeshan and several other PTI leaders. On the plea of Islamabad’s chief commissioner, the bench had referred all these connected petitions to the chief justice on Dec 9for constituting a larger bench for hearing. The bench ruled that since certain crucial issues, as identified by the federal prosecutor general as well as other counsel, were involved in this matter, the office was directed to place the matter before the chief justice of this court for the formation of a larger bench. In the detailed order, the bench directed the Islamabad chief commissioner to act as focal person between the petitioners and the law-enforcement agencies at federal level as well as within Islamabad. It declared: “The petitioner(s) in the present case, as well as in the connected cases, shall approach the said office through an application, either directly or through an advocate, seeking information regarding their involvement in criminal cases within three days of the receipt of this order.” “Upon receipt of such application, the worthy Chief Commissioner, Islamabad, shall procure the record of all criminal cases in which the arrest of the petitioner(s) is required from the law enforcing agencies at the federal level and within the Capital Territory of Islamabad. The said record shall be provided to the petitioner(s) at the earliest, but not later than seven days from the date of the application,” it declared. The court added that once the records were provided to the petitioner(s), he should approach or surrender within three days before the appropriate court for bail or any other legal remedy, if available. The high court later clubbed petitions of several other lawmakers with those of Senator Mashal Azam and MNAs Atif Khan and Shahid Khattak. In these cases, federal prosecutor general Ghulam Sarwar Nehung had represented the chief commissioner and contended that the petitioner (Asad Qaiser) had filed repeated petitions for the same relief without disclosing the fate of the earlier adjudications. His main concern was that the present petitioner as well as those in connected matters, obtained protective orders from the court (high court) but, pursuant to such orders, failed to approach or surrender before the appropriate forum. Consequently, he claimed, they remained on bail before arrest for a considerable period of time without joining the investigation agencies in other provinces. He submitted that there was no uniform policy of this court regarding the grant of omnibus bail (bail in all cases orders or protective bail, and petitions filed by the same petitioner for bail before arrest or omnibus bail were placed before different benches, therefore such practice was contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in one of its cases (PLD 1986 SC 173). Contrary to his claims, the lawyers representing the petitioners had insisted that despite directions of the court, the respondents had failed to provide details of all required FIRs.

Sharif Osman Hadi was a key figure in last year’s uprising — which sent Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s regime packing — a spokesman for the Inqilab Morcho political platform, and a candidate for next year’s elections scheduled for February. After news of his death spread on Thursday, protests in various parts of Bangladesh spiralled out of control, as rampaging mobs resorted to rioting and arson. Among the institutions attacked were two of the country’s leading newspapers, Prothom Alo and The Daily Star . Staffers of the latter publication survived a terrifying ordeal when a mob torched their building, and they had to be rescued by security personnel. As per local media, Hadi’s funeral on Saturday drew hundreds of thousands of mourners, including Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus. Inqilab Morchohas termed the murdered leader a “martyr … against Indian hegemony”, while the suspected killer has reportedly escaped to India. With elections only a few months away, it is essential that the interim authorities in Bangladesh prevent the country from sliding into anarchy. There can be no room for political violence and mob rule. Hadi’s killers must be traced and punished, while all political groups must adhere to democratic norms even as they stage protests. In particular, media outlets and civil society groups must be protected from vigilantes, and those involved in stoking violence need to be punished. Sheikh Hasina’s rule was among the darker chapters of Bangladesh’s turbulent history. Her transformation from an elected leader to a ruthless autocrat was stark, and last year’s uprising was a reaction to her brutal rule. Bangladesh needs to chart a new course, and for this a peaceful transition to full democratic rule is vital, or else the sacrifices of the people may go to waste.

Inqilab Morchohas termed the murdered leader a “martyr … against Indian hegemony”, while the suspected killer has reportedly escaped to India. With elections only a few months away, it is essential that the interim authorities in Bangladesh prevent the country from sliding into anarchy. There can be no room for political violence and mob rule. Hadi’s killers must be traced and punished, while all political groups must adhere to democratic norms even as they stage protests. In particular, media outlets and civil society groups must be protected from vigilantes, and those involved in stoking violence need to be punished. Sheikh Hasina’s rule was among the darker chapters of Bangladesh’s turbulent history. Her transformation from an elected leader to a ruthless autocrat was stark, and last year’s uprising was a reaction to her brutal rule. Bangladesh needs to chart a new course, and for this a peaceful transition to full democratic rule is vital, or else the sacrifices of the people may go to waste.

      "summary": "BANGLADESH has been rocked by spasms of violence after a student leader, who was shot in Dhaka recently, succumbed to his injuries while receiving treatment in Singapore. Sharif Osman Hadi was a key figure in last year’s uprising — which sent Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s regime packing — a spokesman for the Inqilab Morcho political platform, and a candidate for next year’s elections scheduled for February. After news of his death spread on Thursday, protests in various parts of Bangladesh spiralled out of control, as rampaging mobs resorted to rioting and arson. Among the institutions attacked were two of the country’s leading newspapers, Prothom Alo and The Daily Star . Staffers of the latter publication survived a terrifying ordeal when a mob torched their building, and they had to be rescued by security personnel. As per local media, Hadi’s funeral on Saturday drew hundreds of thousands of mourners, including Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus.

      "summary_orig": "IN many ways, the year 2025 was an epochal moment for Pakistan. The country stood up to an aggressor much larger in size and resources, instilling renewed confidence and self-esteem in the Pakistani nation. It also discredited Indian narratives linking terrorism with Pakistan. It all started with a terrorist incident in the Pahalgam area of Indian-occupied Kashmir last April. As usual, India’s knee-jerk reaction was to blame Pakistan . However, this time around, the world refused to endorse India’s falsehood. Pakistan proposed impartial investigations, but India declined, and instead, carried out military strikes against nine targets in Pakistan on May 7. The latter responded robustly through a multi-domain, integrated and hybrid warfare. With seven of its planes down, including French Rafale, India sought help from the US for a ceasefire, but bizarrely, refused to acknowledge America’s role. Ever since, India’s global profile has continued to fall in the eyes of the West, which was disappointed that the country that was being prepared as a counter-balance to China could not even handle Pakistan. A panicked Indian leadership decided to tilt towards Russia and China, which had their own questions about New Delhi’s viability as a strategic partner. India’s self-proclaimed strategic autonomy has become a difficult balancing act vis-à-vis major powers. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia entered into a strategic mutual defence agreement with Pakistan with a clause that aggression against one would be considered aggression against the other. This has added another layer to Pakistan’s deterrence regime against potential aggressors. The US also broke its decade-long stalemate with Pakistan and began to explore investments in the latter’s mineral, oil and gas sectors. Pakistan was also invited to the high table to negotiate an end to the genocidal war Israel had waged against Palestinians living in Gaza. For its part, China was pleased that some of its defence technology shared with Pakistan had been tested in a combat environment with favourable results. CPEC’s second phase has also been launched. Regional states, particularly Iran, Bangladesh and the Central Asian Republics, have further warmed up to Pakistan. Going into the next year, worsening ties with the Afghan Taliban is a major concern for Pakistan. India, which had little feeling for the Taliban previously, has now embraced them to create a two-front situation for Pakistan. India has kept open the option of resuming conflict with Pakistan through its Operation Sindoor, which is presently on pause. Given an unfavourable international environment and the embarrassing defeat in May, it is unlikely to resume kinetic aggression against Pakistan soon. However, most observers believe that India will increase its covert war against Pakistan through proxies such as the TTP and BLA. So, Pakistan will need to keep itself prepared to counter any potential Indian misadventure. The world refused to endorse India’s falsehood. Pakistan’s domestic scene has also seen progress. With inflation falling, fiscal deficits reducing, and reserves rising, the country continues on the path of economic stabilisation. The economy is increasingly being digitised, and efforts are underway to broaden the tax net. However, we continue to live beyond our means. Floods have played havoc with those associated with agriculture. Unemployment, particularly among the youth, is another test for policymakers. Devolution of power and resources for local governments are largely missing, defeating the spirit of the 18th Amendment. The security situation remains precarious, particularly in view of terrorist attacks by the TTP and BLA. One positive is the firm action taken against the TLP, sending a str­­­ong signal to radical groups that there would be zero tolerance for violent extremism. At a time when the world order is under severe strain and international law is being violated with impunity, most countries are reflecting on their priorities, either leaning towards their own regions, or making alignments with like-minded countries, or opting for self-reliance. Since South Asia remains the least integrated region, due mainly to India’s hegemonic designs, Pakistan and other South Asian countries have few options but to fend for themselves. In this turbulent era, Pakistan must seek ways to attain political stability and foster its economic resilience against shocks brought about by a chaotic world order. The leadership must undertake structural reforms for the economy and lessen the bureaucratic red tape that is strangulating potential investments. With dozens of reports containing doable recommendations already on the table, the question is not what should be done. The real test for policymakers is to muster the political will to do what must be done. The writer is chairman of Sanober Institute Islamabad. Published in Dawn, December 21st, 2025",

But any such move will not have a prayer unless both the hybrid set-up and the opposition step back from their confrontation. After US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s statement at a briefing in Washington, expressing gratitude to Pakistan for “their offer to be part of it, or at least their offer to consider being part of it [the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza]”, what was clear was that issues remain to be addressed before any move forward on the matter. Contacts have been going on since the ceasefire in Gaza in October this year. More recently, whe­ther it has been US-led activity in Doha or Florida or visits to Pakistan by the Jordanian monarch , the Indonesian president or the Egyptian defence minister, they all appear to be links in the same chain. Around the time the October ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump, the perceptive king of Jordan made the observation, which is at the heart of the matter — that his country and other Muslim nations would have a ‘peacekeeping’ but not a ‘peace enforcement’ role. This observation is what has triggered the contacts and conversations around the region and the world because regardless of what the US and Israel want, at least the prospective Muslim part of the ISF is reluctant, in fact adamant, not to play any role in ‘disarming’ Hamas. For its part, Hamas has linked the laying down of its weapons to a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which is nowhere on the cards, and said it would surrender weapons to a Palestinian state authority only after a complete cessation of the Israeli military operation and the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital. None of these conditions are likely to be met in the foreseeable future. The state of the economy, the rise in foreign-inspired terrorism and domestic political instability are all areas of concern. There are indications that the Hamas stance is to take a tough negotiating position but it is also clear that if Israel, the apartheid state, also adopts a similar posture the whole process will begin to unravel or worse, stay locked in a state of suspended animation, with no end in sight for the sufferings of the Palestinians in Gaza in particular. The last thing any Muslim contingent of the ISF would want is to be seen to be doing the genocidal Zionist state’s bidding. This will neither be acceptable to the leaders of any participating countries nor to their people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. Honestly speaking, even if the entire ISF were made up of contingents from non-OIC member states, even then any sane leaders/ commanders would be reluctant to take on Hamas in Gaza as it would be a pointless, long and bloody fight and one they would not win where the Israeli Occupation Forces failed. There can be no doubt that Donald Trump has staked his personal credibility on the Gaza ceasefire and his own 20-point peace plan. Therefore, the efforts of the US administration members and officials seem aimed at delivering the plan. Given what is in the public domain so far, it isn’t easy to assess how far the US can bend Israel to force the latter to enable conditions for a long-term peace to become a reality. Even then, it’s easy to say at this point that the doubters seem more credible than those who are optimistic. With Trump now unleashing his fury on Europe, because he feels that it is less Russian President Vladimir Putin and more the leaders of the European Union and the UK who have not done enough to end the Ukraine war, God knows who will have to bear his wrath if his Gaza plan is slow to gain traction or if it fails. For countries like Pakistan, there are two avenues of safety. One is safety in numbers. Its leadership should ensure, whatever the negotiations and the final position taken, that all OIC member states who have been asked to consider joining the ISF say exactly the same thing. They should evolve a consensus view and collectively own it. For the resource-rich Gulf states and Indonesia, the fallout from a possible (and for the sake of the Gaza Palestinians one hopes that it never happens) collapse of the Trump plan will be minimal. I wish I could say the same for our IMF-dependent economy. We need to have all our ducks in a row. It is critical to make an effort at national reconciliation too. There are many advocates of the so-called hard state in the media these days, with the voices calling for the opposite being far and few. But that does not mean the point they make is without merit. From the various courts sentencing the opposition leaders — from the top and middle tiers — to long jail terms, it is clear that protagonists of the hard state have the upper hand. The state of the economy, which is the result of forever delaying structural reform, the rise in foreign-inspired terrorism and domestic political instability are all areas of concern. For any attempt at starting a national dialogue, temperatures will have to be lowered. As a first step, the rhetoric should be toned down. Personal attacks should be put on hold. The hybrid set-up has seen through some serious challenges to its existence and now seems co­­m­­fortably ensconced in power. It should use its po­­­sition of strength to lay out reasonable terms for a dialogue. No matter how principled their position may be, it is time equally for the opposition leaders to practise politics as the art of the possible. Confrontation has delivered nothing to them and kept the country on tenterhooks. People’s issu­­es are multiplying. The country won the war aga­inst the arch-enemy earlier this year. It is to time to bring the war within to a successful conclusion. The writer is a former editor of Dawn. abbas.nasir@hotmail.com Published in Dawn, December 21st, 2025",

Given what is in the public domain so far, it isn’t easy to assess how far the US can bend Israel to force the latter to enable conditions for a long-term peace to become a reality. Even then, it’s easy to say at this point that the doubters seem more credible than those who are optimistic. With Trump now unleashing his fury on Europe, because he feels that it is less Russian President Vladimir Putin and more the leaders of the European Union and the UK who have not done enough to end the Ukraine war, God knows who will have to bear his wrath if his Gaza plan is slow to gain traction or if it fails. For countries like Pakistan, there are two avenues of safety. One is safety in numbers. Its leadership should ensure, whatever the negotiations and the final position taken, that all OIC member states who have been asked to consider joining the ISF say exactly the same thing. They should evolve a consensus view and collectively own it. For the resource-rich Gulf states and Indonesia, the fallout from a possible (and for the sake of the Gaza Palestinians one hopes that it never happens) collapse of the Trump plan will be minimal. I wish I could say the same for our IMF-dependent economy. We need to have all our ducks in a row. It is critical to make an effort at national reconciliation too. There are many advocates of the so-called hard state in the media these days, with the voices calling for the opposite being far and few. But that does not mean the point they make is without merit. From the various courts sentencing the opposition leaders — from the top and middle tiers — to long jail terms, it is clear that protagonists of the hard state have the upper hand. The state of the economy, which is the result of forever delaying structural reform, the rise in foreign-inspired terrorism and domestic political instability are all areas of concern. For any attempt at starting a national dialogue, temperatures will have to be lowered. As a first step, the rhetoric should be toned down. Personal attacks should be put on hold.

      "summary": "SERIOUS global challenges and their likely impact on Pakistan’s fragile economy make it incumbent on this country to initiate a process of national reconciliation. But any such move will not have a prayer unless both the hybrid set-up and the opposition step back from their confrontation. After US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s statement at a briefing in Washington, expressing gratitude to Pakistan for “their offer to be part of it, or at least their offer to consider being part of it [the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza]”, what was clear was that issues remain to be addressed before any move forward on the matter. Contacts have been going on since the ceasefire in Gaza in October this year. More recently, whe­ther it has been US-led activity in Doha or Florida or visits to Pakistan by the Jordanian monarch , the Indonesian president or the Egyptian defence minister, they all appear to be links in the same chain. Around the time the October ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump, the perceptive king of Jordan made the observation, which is at the heart of the matter — that his country and other Muslim nations would have a ‘peacekeeping’ but not a ‘peace enforcement’ role. This observation is what has triggered the contacts and conversations around the region and the world because regardless of what the US and Israel want, at least the prospective Muslim part of the ISF is reluctant, in fact adamant, not to play any role in ‘disarming’ Hamas. For its part, Hamas has linked the laying down of its weapons to a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, which is nowhere on the cards, and said it would surrender weapons to a Palestinian state authority only after a complete cessation of the Israeli military operation and the establishment of an independent and sovereign Palestinian state, with East Jerusalem as its capital. None of these conditions are likely to be met in the foreseeable future. The state of the economy, the rise in foreign-inspired terrorism and domestic political instability are all areas of concern. There are indications that the Hamas stance is to take a tough negotiating position but it is also clear that if Israel, the apartheid state, also adopts a similar posture the whole process will begin to unravel or worse, stay locked in a state of suspended animation, with no end in sight for the sufferings of the Palestinians in Gaza in particular. The last thing any Muslim contingent of the ISF would want is to be seen to be doing the genocidal Zionist state’s bidding. This will neither be acceptable to the leaders of any participating countries nor to their people who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. Honestly speaking, even if the entire ISF were made up of contingents from non-OIC member states, even then any sane leaders/ commanders would be reluctant to take on Hamas in Gaza as it would be a pointless, long and bloody fight and one they would not win where the Israeli Occupation Forces failed. There can be no doubt that Donald Trump has staked his personal credibility on the Gaza ceasefire and his own 20-point peace plan. Therefore, the efforts of the US administration members and officials seem aimed at delivering the plan. Given what is in the public domain so far, it isn’t easy to assess how far the US can bend Israel to force the latter to enable conditions for a long-term peace to become a reality.

      "summary_orig": "Kinno grading in process at a plant in Sargodha.—Photo by the writer LAHORE: Despite being among the world’s largest producers of citrua, Pakistan is set to export only 400,000-450,000 tonnes of kinno during the 2025-26 season, well below its estimated potential of 700,000-800,000 tonnes, as growers and exporters struggle with high freight costs, border restrictions and the absence of effective government facilitation. During the 2024-25 season, kinno exports stood at around 350,000-400,000 tonnes, with Russia, Indonesia, the UAE, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Central Asian states as major destinations. For the current season, a slight improvement is expected due to better fruit size and quality in Sargodha and adjoining areas, but structural issues continue to cap growth. Former MPA and large kinno orchard owner Faisal Cheema said the crisis has deepened despite an excellent crop. “By the grace of God, this year’s kinno crop is outstanding in both quantity and quality, but it has become a pattern that whenever the crop is good, it goes to waste. The Afghan border issue has been hurting us for the last couple of years, while the recent goods transporters’ strike caused further damages as we failed to meet some export orders due to unavailability of reefer containers,” he said. Market prices have collapsed sharply during the season and orchard owners, out of panic, are selling their produce at whatever price is being offered. At the start of packing for Dubai exports, large size kinno fetched Rs120-125 per kg and smaller fruit Rs90-95 per kg, rates that held until Nov 30. By Dec 10, prices fell to Rs100 per kg for large fruit and Rs70 per kg for small. Between Dec 10 and 15, factories sold large fruit at Rs85-90 per kg and small at Rs55-60 per kg. After Dec 15, the situation became alarming, with factories offering barely Rs75 per kg for large fruit and Rs35-40 per kg for small — despite near-total buyer apathy. Kabul border dispute and unstable markets put citrus sector at risk According to industry estimates, traders are selling kinno to factories at Rs1,400-1,500 per maund, while factories have cut packing speeds drastically, daily operations halved from ten to five pickings causing repeated topping of orchards and severe damage to trees. Sajid Tarar, a former president of the Sargodha Chamber of Commerce and Industry, warned that border closures have brought the export chain to a standstill. “Over 100 factories did not open at all due to the Afghan border issue. Of the remaining units, most were already operating at around half capacity, and now closures are accelerating. Nearly 50 units are shut, with many more on the brink,” he said, cautioning that up to 800,000 workers could face unemployment if the crisis persists. In a hint to the disturbing Afghan market, he said that some fruit had been going to Afghanistan through Iran, but the tensions on borders created a hostile atmosphere in Afghanistan against Pakistani products and a consignment of bananas was damaged by some people in the markets there. Cold storages across Sargodha are reported to be 80-90 per cent full, putting kinnow worth millions of dollars at risk of spoilage. Growers fear losses of Rs8-10 billion, with ripple effects likely to hit future crops, including wheat and sugarcane, due to shrinking farm resources. Stakeholders have urged the government to take immediate action by finding alternative international markets and routes for fruits, subsidising logistics, resolving border issue, and supporting exporters. “Saving kinno exports means saving farmers — and strengthening the national economy,” Faisal Cheema emphasised.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Despite authorities’ best efforts, there is a dire shortage of dollars in the open market, and many currency exchanges are “only selling what they buy”, causing consternation among those planning to travel abroad for the holidays, or in the new year. Visits to multiple exchange outlets across different parts of the metropolis revealed that currency dealers are facing a dearth of greenbacks in their accounts. Some have stopped selling dollars altogether, while others are rationing their supply, only allowing customers to purchase up to $100 at a time. In addition, a small number of exchanges only have old-design dollar notes in stock. These are not of much use to travellers who wish to exchange greenbacks for the local currency of their destination. As a result, a number of passengers have been forced to purchase exotic foreign currencies in Pakistan, leading to them getting a ‘bad deal’ in terms of the exchange rate. One such passenger, who was travelling to Malaysia at the end of November, told Dawn that they were unable to buy dollars at the airport, which they hoped to exchange for ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Just hours before their flight, they settled for an exorbitant exchange rate in the open market: Rs74.5 for a ringgit. Strict regulatory measures compound the situation; exchanges are only selling what they buy According to them, they were worse off as the exchange rate should have been less than Rs70. Mid-market exchange rate (MMER) data available on Wise confirms this speculation for the given period, as it lists the MMER for a ringgit at roughly Rs68. But the buck doesn’t stop at travellers. In fact, another group of non-speculative buyers has been hit hard by the shortage: students. Dawn spoke to a Lahore resident who was unable to buy dollars even after visiting 11 different exchange companies to support their siblings’ education expenses. This shortage, some argue, can also be attributed to recent changes to SOPs surrounding the exchange of currencies. Biometric verification and the requirement of an original CNIC were among the changes previously made. But recent changes include an SBP circular dated November 14, mandating exchange companies to issue cheques to customers wishing to buy dollars for deposit into their foreign currency accounts. A more recent circular adds another layer of verification that is not easily accessible for women who wear veil: facial recognition. Even with these new SOPs, one exchange we spoke to was willing to accept a digital CNIC, after initially hesitating to sell even a single greenback. While three other exchanges that initially hesitated became willing to sell up to $100, provided an original CNIC was available. In contrast, only five exchanges visited by Dawn , were willing to sell dollars without hesitation, whereas seven exchanges outright refused to sell dollars. An employee highlighted the shortage and the lack of customers willing to supply greenbacks to the open market. Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan acknowledged the difference in demand and supply, said when a currency was not available, the exchanges were supposed to “note down customer information” and arrange it for them. Impact of digital currencies Despite shortage at the exchanges, dollars are still becoming more accessible than ever, through digital currencies pegged to the dollar, a type of transaction that is currently against SBP instructions for banks. Pakistan Banks Association Secretary Mir Nejib Rahman said that “no bank can operationally engage with stablecoins or crypto rails” until SBP issues the relevant regulations and supervisory framework, which can only happen once Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) published its detailed guidelines. Mr Bostan also noted his concerns related to illegal activity moving towards unregulated crypto rails, and cited the PVARA chairman’s references to 40 million crypto users who may have lost money as a result of the recent drop in Bitcoin’s value. Experts previously warned that this shortage indicates illegal operators entering the market, and “while smuggling has been largely controlled, hoarding is becoming increasingly likely”. Dawn reached out to SBP for comment, but no response was received. Published in Dawn, December 21st, 2025",

Pakistan Banks Association Secretary Mir Nejib Rahman said that “no bank can operationally engage with stablecoins or crypto rails” until SBP issues the relevant regulations and supervisory framework, which can only happen once Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) published its detailed guidelines. Mr Bostan also noted his concerns related to illegal activity moving towards unregulated crypto rails, and cited the PVARA chairman’s references to 40 million crypto users who may have lost money as a result of the recent drop in Bitcoin’s value. Experts previously warned that this shortage indicates illegal operators entering the market, and “while smuggling has been largely controlled, hoarding is becoming increasingly likely”. Dawn reached out to SBP for comment, but no response was received. Published in Dawn, December 21st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• PTI to challenge guilty ruling in high court, as ex-PM says ‘not surprised’ • Asad says left with no option but ‘resistance’; Raja insists verdict not based on evidence ISLAMABAD: As a court sentenced him to jail in the Toshakhana-II case, former prime minister Imran Khan on Saturday issued a call for a nationwide protest besides announcing his intention to challenge the verdict in the Islamabad High Court. The PTI chief does not have access to his social media handles in jail. “I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” he said as per the account of the conversation between the PTI leader and his lawyer posted on X. He said his sentence in this case did not come as a surprise, but he had asked his legal team to move the high court against the decision. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me. This decision was given in haste by the judge without any evidence and without fulfilling the legal requirements,” he said, adding that his legal team was “not even heard”. The PTI chief said it was inevitable for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and the legal community to “come to the front foot” for the supremacy of law and the restoration of the Constitution. He said that without justice, economic development was not possible. ‘Political revenge’ The PTI, in a statement, called the sentence “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation”. The PTI leaders alleged that the conviction was merely an attempt to extend the incarceration of Imran Khan and provide temporary relief to a “petrified ruling clique”. They stated that the rule of law had been buried in Pakistan, with political revenge being systematically carried out through a “subservient” judiciary. Addressing a press conference alongside PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja stated that the PTI founder had a meeting with his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and conveyed a message to the nation. He made his position absolutely clear, stating, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.” Salman Raja alleged that the case was based solely on promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said. Mr Raja described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was exerted on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case. Mr Qaiser stated that the current circumstances leave no option other than resistance. He emphasised that the resistance would be peaceful, democratic, and grounded in constitutional principles. He further asserted that PTI was seeking justice for its founder and would continue its struggle until it was served. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that even Imran Khan’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo” court announced the verdict. The sentence was the second for the same charge, which was a clear violation of the Constitution, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy, he said. ‘Pre-written script’ Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against him were being delivered under a “pre-written script”. Ms Khan claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts. “Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to 10 years or 14 years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said. “Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned. According to Ms Khan, the PTI founder’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in “illegal solitary confinement”. Separately, PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgement. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former premier and his wife were those of a “kangaroo court”. “There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Mr Ayub added.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A special court on Saturday sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case. The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated. Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions. Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time. View this post on Instagram Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Imran’s jail term in the case would begin after his sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.” It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”. Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, the two had denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case. PTI slams verdict The PTI, in a post on X, said that Imran’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo court announced the verdict of the Toshakhana 2 case”. “A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair; it is in fact a military trial,” the party said. It also shared a video of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan inside a car asking why she was not being allowed to proceed further. “They can’t stop us. The jail trial is today,” she said in the video, adding that it was “illegal” that the family was being stopped. Later, Aleema, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against Imran were being delivered under a pre-written script. “Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. Aleema claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to ten years or fourteen years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said. “Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned. View this post on Instagram According to Aleema, Imran’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in what she described as illegal solitary confinement. Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja stated that the case was being conducted on the basis of promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said. He described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was put on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case. PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgment. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former prime minister and his wife were those of a “Kangaroo court”. “There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Ayub added. A detailed statement released by the PTI’s Central Media Department rejected the sentence against the former prime minister and his wife, terming it “unconstitutional, illegal, ill-intended” and the “worst form of political revenge”. The party alleged that Imran and Bushra Bibi’s lawyers were not present at the time of the verdict was announced. “Neither were their families allowed to come to court, nor were basic judicial requirements fulfilled,” PTI said. “This is open contempt of court, contempt of law and contempt of justice,” the party said. The party further stated that the sentence was the “second for the same charge, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy”. The party alleged that the courts had become an “instrument of political engineering, rather than being an independent forum”. It said that the “sole” purpose of this court was to “prolong the illegal imprisonment of Imran and provide temporary support to the rulers who are afraid of the mandate of the people”. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja slammed the sentence for how its proceedings were conducted in “undue haste” with the couple and their lead counsel not present when the judgement was announced. Minister says sentence to run consecutively Separately, Information Minister Tarar said the punishment was a “consecutive sentence”, adding that it would begin after the sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. Speaking to Geo News , the minister welcomed the judgment, asserting that the former prime minister and his wife had “committed fraud” by getting the gifts undervalued and retaining them for personal use. He said that PTI founder and his wife’s actions were a “breach of public trust”. View this post on Instagram “During the trial, when these gifts were properly assessed, it emerged that[..] the actual price was quite high,“ he said. He further stated that the two had “committed fraud” by undervaluing the gifts and retaining them for personal use. “They had no right to harm the exchequer and retain gifts,” he stressed. He said the judgment was “completely fair and grounded in the principles of justice”. “The misuse of office, dishonesty with the government’s property, and criminal breach of trust, all of it has been proven,” he said. Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, while speaking with Geo News, remarked that the judgment was “in line with the Constitution and the law”. He stressed that “there was no political side to this, if you violate the law, it is clear that a punishment is expected”. “The trial that went on for 15-16 months, it was proven that PTI founder and his wife caused the national exchequer significant harm as the set’s valuation was under-reported,” Malik said. “The gift was not even submitted,” he added. Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the judgment came after lengthy legal proceedings. Speaking to Geo News, he noted that the case followed a similar pattern to that of the Toshakhana-I reference. “The state was given a gift that was not deposited, which they were legally bound to do according to the procedure for acceptance and gifts in Toshakhana,“ he said. “Unfortunately, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan attempted to buy the set at throwaway rates,“ he said. He asserted that all the facts had “now been established in light of today’s judgement”. Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah also addressed the sentence while speaking to the media in Chiniot, saying that state gifts did not belong to an individual but to the state. He said the entire case against Imran was documented.",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: A special court on Saturday sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case. The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price. During the proceedings, the prosecution contended that the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated. Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions. Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time. View this post on Instagram Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Imran’s jail term in the case would begin after his sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.” It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”. Imran and Bushra Bibi were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, the two had denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify Imran from politics. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case. PTI slams verdict The PTI, in a post on X, said that Imran’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo court announced the verdict of the Toshakhana 2 case”. “A closed-door jail trial is neither free nor fair; it is in fact a military trial,” the party said. It also shared a video of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan inside a car asking why she was not being allowed to proceed further. “They can’t stop us. The jail trial is today,” she said in the video, adding that it was “illegal” that the family was being stopped. Later, Aleema, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against Imran were being delivered under a pre-written script. “Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. Aleema claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to ten years or fourteen years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said. “Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned. View this post on Instagram According to Aleema, Imran’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in what she described as illegal solitary confinement. Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja stated that the case was being conducted on the basis of promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said. He described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was put on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case. PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgment. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former prime minister and his wife were those of a “Kangaroo court”. “There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Ayub added. A detailed statement released by the PTI’s Central Media Department rejected the sentence against the former prime minister and his wife, terming it “unconstitutional, illegal, ill-intended” and the “worst form of political revenge”. The party alleged that Imran and Bushra Bibi’s lawyers were not present at the time of the verdict was announced. “Neither were their families allowed to come to court, nor were basic judicial requirements fulfilled,” PTI said. “This is open contempt of court, contempt of law and contempt of justice,” the party said. The party further stated that the sentence was the “second for the same charge, which is a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy”. The party alleged that the courts had become an “instrument of political engineering, rather than being an independent forum”. It said that the “sole” purpose of this court was to “prolong the illegal imprisonment of Imran and provide temporary support to the rulers who are afraid of the mandate of the people”. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja slammed the sentence for how its proceedings were conducted in “undue haste” with the couple and their lead counsel not present when the judgement was announced. Minister says sentence to run consecutively Separately, Information Minister Tarar said the punishment was a “consecutive sentence”, adding that it would begin after the sentence in the £190 million corruption case ended. Speaking to Geo News , the minister welcomed the judgment, asserting that the former prime minister and his wife had “committed fraud” by getting the gifts undervalued and retaining them for personal use. He said that PTI founder and his wife’s actions were a “breach of public trust”. View this post on Instagram “During the trial, when these gifts were properly assessed, it emerged that[..] the actual price was quite high,“ he said. He further stated that the two had “committed fraud” by undervaluing the gifts and retaining them for personal use. “They had no right to harm the exchequer and retain gifts,” he stressed. He said the judgment was “completely fair and grounded in the principles of justice”. “The misuse of office, dishonesty with the government’s property, and criminal breach of trust, all of it has been proven,” he said. Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, while speaking with Geo News, remarked that the judgment was “in line with the Constitution and the law”. He stressed that “there was no political side to this, if you violate the law, it is clear that a punishment is expected”. “The trial that went on for 15-16 months, it was proven that PTI founder and his wife caused the national exchequer significant harm as the set’s valuation was under-reported,” Malik said. “The gift was not even submitted,” he added. Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the judgment came after lengthy legal proceedings. Speaking to Geo News, he noted that the case followed a similar pattern to that of the Toshakhana-I reference. “The state was given a gift that was not deposited, which they were legally bound to do according to the procedure for acceptance and gifts in Toshakhana,“ he said. “Unfortunately, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan attempted to buy the set at throwaway rates,“ he said. He asserted that all the facts had “now been established in light of today’s judgement”. Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah also addressed the sentence while speaking to the media in Chiniot, saying that state gifts did not belong to an individual but to the state. He said the entire case against Imran was documented.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday sentenced PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed to 10 years in prison terms in two more May 9 cases. The latest court verdict comes a day after a Lahore ATC acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while sentencing four other leaders, including Dr. Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid, and Ejaz Chaudhry, to 10 years in prison in another case related to the May 9 riots. Rana Mudassar, the counsel for the PTI leaders, confirmed the development to Dawn , saying the cases are related to the burning of police vehicles in Lahore’s Gulberg and the burning of a container near Kalma Chowk during the nationwide riots on May 9, 2023 following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan. On that day, supporters and workers of the party, reacting to founder Imran Khan’s arrest, vandalised and torched military installations and government properties. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against Imran and his party, booking the party founder and its leadership in multiple cases. ATC-III Judge Arshad Javed presided over the hearings for both cases today in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. A total of 22 accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison, while five were acquitted in the Kalma Chowk case. In the Gulberg case, the judge handed down sentences to five, including the PTI leaders, while acquitting 22 others. The judge noted that former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had not yet been indicted in either case and his trial would proceed separately once a supplementary challan was submitted by the prosecution. According to the prosecution, a total of 78 witnesses were presented in both cases. In the Gulberg case, a challan was filed against 33 individuals, while four others were declared proclaimed offenders during the trial. In the Kalma Chowk case, the prosecution filed a challan against 36 people, while 12 others, including Hammad Azhar, Murad Saeed, Zubair Niazi, and Mian Aslam Iqbal, were declared absconders. The prosecutor argued that PTI leaders had instigated party workers to revolt and create public disorder. Talking to the media later, PTI’s counsel said the cases were scheduled for routine proceedings, but “sentences have been handed down once again in the darkness of night”. He added that the defence was not given the chance to fully present its case. “The morale of the prisoners in Kot Lakhpat Jail is high. So far, the leaders have been sentenced to a total of more than 200 years,” the counsel said, adding that the sentences would be challenged in the high court. With these verdicts, decisions have now been announced in seven of the 14 cases related to the May 9 riots registered in Lahore. Verdicts had previously been announced in trials concerning an attack on Shadman Police Station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House, and an attack on the entrance gate of the GOR-I Club Chowk.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: After weeks of protracted deliberations with security and administration officials, tribal elders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s restive Tirah valley finally agreed to start vacating their homes from January 10, ahead of an operation against militants, after reaching a written agreement with the district administration. The deadlock had persisted between the valley’s tribal elders and government officials over the launch of a military operation in the valley as well as the relocation of families to prevent collateral damage. Sources among the 24-member jirga, who negotiated the written agreement on the displacement process with the district administration, said that the entire Tirah valley would be vacated by January 25, 2026, thus paving the way for the long-anticipated military operation against all proscribed militant groups currently holed up in the valley. Spelling out the terms and conditions of the written agreement, the jirga said that the district administration agreed to pay Rs3 million to those whose houses were completely damaged and Rs1 million to those whose houses were partially damaged, respectively, during the military operation, which will be launched once the evacuation is completed. They said that the jirga was also assured that every family would receive Rs250,000 through JazzCash or Easypaisa upon biometric verification at the time of registration at the Bagh Markaz and Paindi Cheena registration centers. Each family would further be provided with a monthly stipend of Rs50,000 until April 5, 2026, when the return process would begin following the completion of the military operation, the sources added. The district administration also agreed to arrange free transportation for the departing families, along with the provision of free health services during their journey to their next destination. It was further decided during the deliberations held at Khyber House that families who had already left their homes would be included in the survey of newly displaced families, with the head of each family required to report to either the Bagh Markaz or Paindi Cheena registration center for biometric verification before January 25, 2026. A representative jirga of Tirah elders had earlier presented a list of demands to security and administrative officials, which included Rs8 million and Rs4 million as compensation for fully and partially damaged houses, respectively, along with Rs500,000 for every departing family. The demands were, however, toned down to a limit mutually agreed upon by the security and administrative officials and the jirga members, with the Tirah elders left with no option but to accept a written agreement as time was running out for the launch of a decisive military operation. Sources among the jirga members insisted that collateral damage from indiscriminate artillery shelling of suspected militants’ hideouts and quadcopter attacks was a major concern for most residents of the Tirah valley, while security officials argued that the presence of militants in congested residential areas was a major obstacle to executing intelligence-based military operations (IBOs). They said that the forceful occupation of private houses by militant groups and their frequent changes of location were also a source of continuous trouble and inconvenience, with security officials constantly insisting on the complete relocation of Tirah residents to pave the way for a decisive push against all outlawed militant groups. Security officials, in consultation with local elders, had earlier agreed on limited internal displacement during the IBOs, with families from a suspected locality relocated to a nearby safer area for a limited period and returning home upon the completion of the IBOs. However, this failed to alleviate the suffering of local residents, while security forces were forced to launch frequent IBOs whenever militant groups re-entered areas previously declared safe. “It’s imperative that we leave the entire valley at the disposal of the security forces after our complete relocation to safer locations, far from the heat of the military operations in Tirah,” a jirga member told Dawn . The jirga member, however, firmly insisted on the demand that there be no further displacement once the anticipated military operation is completed, with a strong assurance of no future IBOs in areas cleared after the major operation. Dawn has also learned that MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani, along with members of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, who had vehemently opposed forced displacement and the subsequent military operations in Tirah, were left out of the intense deliberations between the 24-member Tirah jirga and district administration officials. Later, responding to a Dawn query about his absence from the Friday jirga, MNA Iqbal Afridi insisted that military operations in the merged districts had never achieved the desired results and had instead proved to be a source of destruction and prolonged displacement of innocent tribesmen. He regretted being declared a proclaimed offender following the registration of numerous allegedly false First Information Reports (FIRs) against him, as he had consistently raised his voice against the military operations and forced displacements, which he said were actually aimed at gaining unlawful control over the natural resources of the newly merged districts. Last month at least five terrorists affiliated with the proscribed Tekreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in an IBO in Tirah valley. In September, at least two dozen residents of Tirah, including women and children, lost their lives in blasts , which officials claim were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses.",

The demands were, however, toned down to a limit mutually agreed upon by the security and administrative officials and the jirga members, with the Tirah elders left with no option but to accept a written agreement as time was running out for the launch of a decisive military operation. Sources among the jirga members insisted that collateral damage from indiscriminate artillery shelling of suspected militants’ hideouts and quadcopter attacks was a major concern for most residents of the Tirah valley, while security officials argued that the presence of militants in congested residential areas was a major obstacle to executing intelligence-based military operations (IBOs). They said that the forceful occupation of private houses by militant groups and their frequent changes of location were also a source of continuous trouble and inconvenience, with security officials constantly insisting on the complete relocation of Tirah residents to pave the way for a decisive push against all outlawed militant groups. Security officials, in consultation with local elders, had earlier agreed on limited internal displacement during the IBOs, with families from a suspected locality relocated to a nearby safer area for a limited period and returning home upon the completion of the IBOs. However, this failed to alleviate the suffering of local residents, while security forces were forced to launch frequent IBOs whenever militant groups re-entered areas previously declared safe. “It’s imperative that we leave the entire valley at the disposal of the security forces after our complete relocation to safer locations, far from the heat of the military operations in Tirah,” a jirga member told Dawn . The jirga member, however, firmly insisted on the demand that there be no further displacement once the anticipated military operation is completed, with a strong assurance of no future IBOs in areas cleared after the major operation. Dawn has also learned that MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani, along with members of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, who had vehemently opposed forced displacement and the subsequent military operations in Tirah, were left out of the intense deliberations between the 24-member Tirah jirga and district administration officials. Later, responding to a Dawn query about his absence from the Friday jirga, MNA Iqbal Afridi insisted that military operations in the merged districts had never achieved the desired results and had instead proved to be a source of destruction and prolonged displacement of innocent tribesmen. He regretted being declared a proclaimed offender following the registration of numerous allegedly false First Information Reports (FIRs) against him, as he had consistently raised his voice against the military operations and forced displacements, which he said were actually aimed at gaining unlawful control over the natural resources of the newly merged districts. Last month at least five terrorists affiliated with the proscribed Tekreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed in an IBO in Tirah valley. In September, at least two dozen residents of Tirah, including women and children, lost their lives in blasts , which officials claim were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses.",

      "summary": "PESHAWAR: After weeks of protracted deliberations with security and administration officials, tribal elders from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s restive Tirah valley finally agreed to start vacating their homes from January 10, ahead of an operation against militants, after reaching a written agreement with the district administration. The deadlock had persisted between the valley’s tribal elders and government officials over the launch of a military operation in the valley as well as the relocation of families to prevent collateral damage. Sources among the 24-member jirga, who negotiated the written agreement on the displacement process with the district administration, said that the entire Tirah valley would be vacated by January 25, 2026, thus paving the way for the long-anticipated military operation against all proscribed militant groups currently holed up in the valley. Spelling out the terms and conditions of the written agreement, the jirga said that the district administration agreed to pay Rs3 million to those whose houses were completely damaged and Rs1 million to those whose houses were partially damaged, respectively, during the military operation, which will be launched once the evacuation is completed. They said that the jirga was also assured that every family would receive Rs250,000 through JazzCash or Easypaisa upon biometric verification at the time of registration at the Bagh Markaz and Paindi Cheena registration centers. Each family would further be provided with a monthly stipend of Rs50,000 until April 5, 2026, when the return process would begin following the completion of the military operation, the sources added. The district administration also agreed to arrange free transportation for the departing families, along with the provision of free health services during their journey to their next destination. It was further decided during the deliberations held at Khyber House that families who had already left their homes would be included in the survey of newly displaced families, with the head of each family required to report to either the Bagh Markaz or Paindi Cheena registration center for biometric verification before January 25, 2026.
