The blessing card she presented said: “Knowing the powerful impact my thoughts can have on others and the environment, I choose to create a positive mindset.” This beautiful vision is in everyday life Nazaré Oliveira, an indigenous woman from Belém, and a descendant of the Potyguar people. She is part of the international spiritual organisation Brahma Kumaris , led by women and which uses meditation to emphasise the concept of identity as souls rather than bodies and the idea that humanity and nature are one. This is my fifth COP. I’ve been around since COP26 in Glasgow and this has been the most militarised COP I’ve attended. We had really high expectations because I’m from Latin America, and this is also the Latin American COP – apart from the Amazonian and the Brazilian Cop. So we had really high expectations of also being able to demonstrate, protest and exercise our right to the civic space. But we have encountered heavy militarisation and a heavy crackdown on civil society protesting outside the venue. I think it’s very disconcerting. Like it was definitely a very racist letter where the UN seems to want to inflict power over the autonomous territory of Brazilian authorities. I think this is a confrontation that is needed. What’s happening in between civil society, the military and the UN, it’s a reflection of the tension that exists within this space. So I hope for this COP that the United Nations authorities and the Brazilian authorities open their eyes and they realise that what they are doing, what they are inflicting with the militarisation of COP is completely opposite of what they have been preaching in the last three years. Brazil knew that they wanted to host this COP since three years ago, probably even earlier. So the way that they are responding to it does not show that they were ready to receive all this flow of international civil society. So my hope is that they can release, relax the heavy militarization that they’re putting in the space and allow us to use the civic space to demonstrate. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Wednesday announced the allocation of 80 electric buses for Rawalpindi, aiming to improve public transportation and reduce congestion. The chief minister was scheduled to inaugurate the new transport system in the garrison city on October 15, but the ceremony was cancelled due to the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan protest in Islamabad. Addressing the inauguration ceremony of the electric bus initiative in Rawalpindi today, CM Maryam said, “The electric buses are equipped with modern amenities, including air conditioning, free Wi-Fi, and charging ports.” The initiative, the chief minister highlighted, is part of a broader effort to enhance infrastructure and public services in Rawalpindi. Other projects include signal-free corridors, flyovers, and hospitals. “The government has allocated significant funds for road construction and improvement,” she said, adding that the electric buses are part of a larger plan to promote sustainable transportation and reduce pollution. “The buses are wheelchair accessible and have dedicated compartments for women,” CM Maryam pointed out. She detailed that the fare for the buses is Rs20, with free travel for women, the elderly, and children with special needs. “The government has also launched initiatives to improve healthcare, education, and social welfare,” CM Maryam said. “New hospitals and schools are being built, and existing ones are being upgraded.” “Crime has reduced by 70 per cent in Punjab, and efforts are being made to further improve public safety,” she claimed. “The initiatives are part of a broader effort to promote development and improve the quality of life for citizens.” Earlier today, Dawn reported that in the first phase, 45 e-buses will be operated on four routes and the number of buses will be expanded in the coming days. “As Kutchery Chowk remodeling project is in progress, it is not included among the routes,” said Regional Transport Authority (RTA) Secretary Asad Shirazi told Dawn earlier. A total of seven buses will be operated from Saddar to Qabristan Chowk at Misrial Road via Qasim Market, Shalley Valley (total 7 kilometres), eight buses on the second route from Fawara Chowk to Koral Chowk via Liaquat Bagh and Sir Syed Road and the Old Airport Road (11.3 kilometres) and seven buses on the third route will be from Saddar Metro Bus Station to Munawar Colony via Tulsa Road. Moreover, 14 buses will be operated on the fourth route from Marrir Metro Bus Station to the Motorway Chowk via The Mall and Peshawar Road (13.1 kilometres).",

A total of seven buses will be operated from Saddar to Qabristan Chowk at Misrial Road via Qasim Market, Shalley Valley (total 7 kilometres), eight buses on the second route from Fawara Chowk to Koral Chowk via Liaquat Bagh and Sir Syed Road and the Old Airport Road (11.3 kilometres) and seven buses on the third route will be from Saddar Metro Bus Station to Munawar Colony via Tulsa Road. Moreover, 14 buses will be operated on the fourth route from Marrir Metro Bus Station to the Motorway Chowk via The Mall and Peshawar Road (13.1 kilometres).",

      "title_orig": "PTI says Imran’s sisters manhandled, ‘violently detained’ by police while camped outside Adiala jail",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI said late on Tuesday that police manhandled and “violently detained” the sisters of ex-premier Imran Khan from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with the party founder. The PTI had held a protest outside the jail on Tuesday, where Imran is currently incarcerated, but the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. Subsequently, the party held a sit-in outside the jail and criticised the prison administration for violating the court order in this regard. In a post on social media platform X after midnight, the party said Aleema Khan, Noreen Niazi and Dr Uzma Khan were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when the police action happened. It added that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi, MNA Shahid Khattak and other party workers, including several women, were “subjected to violence and picked up by police”. “What should be routine weekly court-mandated family visits, in accordance with Imran Khan’s rights as a prisoner, are being used as a tool of oppression and violence against his family members and supporters,” the party said. Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled. In a later video shared by the party, Noreen said that female police officials grabbed her by her hair and forced her down to the ground. “I didn’t understand it. I still don’t understand what happened,” she said, asserting that PTI workers were sitting peacefully outside the jail. Aleema said that at one point, Noreen was “practically unconscious” as she was dragged on the floor. “Thank goodness we saw and managed to set her free,” she said. She also asserted that the incident would not “scare us”, adding that a press conference would be held later. “The way the women dragged us, ripped away our chaddors … they should be ashamed.” Aleema also alleged that her and her sisters were denied a meeting with Imran as “Asim Munir’s notification has not yet been signed”. In another post, the party condemned the “inhumane, unlawful, and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family members. It said that the PTI founder’s sisters, along with his legal team, had arrived at the jail to meet him on Tuesday but were denied the meeting and forced to wait until night. “By 10pm, despite spending twelve hours under severe distress, the Punjab government ordered an appalling operation that no civilised or democratic society could ever justify,” the PTI said. It alleged that the area where Imran’s sisters were seated was “intentionally flooded with water”. “The lights were switched off to plunge the entire place into darkness, and in the ensuing chaos, police physically assaulted Imran Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan and Uzma Khan,” it added. It further said that one of the sisters was dragged “across the road, manhandled, and violently detained despite her cries and the pleas of those present”. “This level of state oppression and cruelty represents an unprecedented assault on basic human dignity, constitutional freedoms, and moral norms,” it said. Meanwhile, a senior Rawalpindi police official told Dawn that no action was taken against the PTI protesters. He said that they were only removed from the road they were occupying. Later, in the afternoon today, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja held a press conference along with Imran’s sisters and party leaders. He said the PTI would approach the Supreme Court with the appeal that when Imran’s family and party workers were barred from meeting the PTI founder, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) “remained silent”. The PTI had previously moved the IHC, seeking meetings with Imran. The IHC had issued a verbal order, directing the relevant authorities to allow the meetings. Yet, there has been a restriction on meetings. Aleema also addressed the press conference, maintaining all their protests outside Adiala Jail had been peaceful. She alleged that one of her sisters, who is a doctor, was “detained by police for hours last week” and police personnel stationed outside the jail had been “misbehaving” with them. “Yesterday, too, we weren’t allowed to meet [Imran] and were protesting peacefully,” she said. ‘Our collective humiliation’ KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the police action against Imran’s sisters and a member of his cabinet. “The attempt to arrest MNA Shahid Khattak and other provincial and national assembly members is also condemnable,” he said, adding that things were now progressing to a point of no return. “This is today’s Pakistan — where the sanctity of a woman’s veil is violated. The sisters’ only fault was that they came to meet their brother,” said ex-president Arif Alvi. “With every crime, the usurpers feel more and more immune. Abductions, arrests, raids, military court trials, rigged elections, amendments — all are connected. Every time they get away with no accountability, they feel more immune. Every time the bureaucracy, media, and judiciary, instead of resisting falls in line, they are emboldened,” said activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir. He said that the Iddat case against Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi, the recent discourse on an article published by The Economist about the couple and the manhandling of the PTI founder’s sister all served one purpose: to humiliate. “It is a fallacy to think this is Imran Khan’s or PTI’s humiliation alone. It is our collective humiliation. We are all being shown the price of dissent, the price of seeking justice, demanding democracy, and resisting oppression,” he said. Senior journalist Hamid Mir said that the current regime was not realising that the “inhumane and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family was tarnishing the country’s image globally. “It’s becoming difficult for our diplomats serving in the West to defend at public forums,” he said. Journalist Shahzad Iqbal termed the “dragging and manhandling [of] Imran Khan’s elderly sisters” a “shameless act of oppression”. A day ago, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz “was saying we don’t indulge in politics or revenge and victimisation, and then imagine this happening in her provincial jurisdiction,” Iqbal added. “Which Pakistan is this? What humanity is this?” asked Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. He said that the police action against Imran’s sisters was a “slap in the face of humanity and an example of the worst abuse of state power”. “Those who lay their hands on women are neither worthy of being called Muslims nor Pakistanis,” he said. PTI firebrand leader Sher Afzal Marwat condemned the treatment meted out to Noreen. “Such brutality against a citizen — let alone a woman — is unacceptable. The state has reached a new low, and this abuse of power must end!” he said. PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari said police had demonstrated “highly despicable behaviour” by attacking Imran’s sisters. “We strongly condemn this disgraceful and unjustifiable act by the police,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said Saudi Arabia was being designated as a “major, non-Nato ally”. “Tonight, I’m pleased to announce that we’re taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-Nato ally, which is something that is very important to them,” Trump said during a formal black-tie dinner at the White House. “And I’m just telling you now for the first time, because they wanted to keep a little secret for tonight,” Trump said of the designation, which only 19 other countries have previously received. View this post on Instagram According to Politico , the other countries in that category include Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Qatar. The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June had made Saudi Arabia safer, Trump added. Meanwhile, bin Salman had earlier promised to increase his country’s US investment to $1 trillion from a $600 billion pledge he made when Trump visited Saudi Arabia in May. But offered no details or timetable. In his remarks at the dinner, the Saudi crown prince thanked Trump for the “warm welcome” accorded to him. “This relationship started close to nine decades ago,” he said, adding that the two countries had worked together during this period. “But today is a special day. We think the horizon of economic cooperation between US and Saudi Arabia, it’s bigger and wider,” he said, adding that the two were also signing agreements that would lead to deeper ties. Defence agreement Separately, a White House fact sheet said the two sides signed a Strategic Defence Agreement, which “fortifies deterrence across the Middle East,” makes it easier for US defense firms to operate in the country and secures “new burden-sharing funds from Saudi Arabia to defray US costs”. The agreement appeared to fall short of the congressionally ratified Nato-style treaty Saudi Arabia initially sought. The White House announced Trump had approved future deliveries of F-35 fighter jets and the Saudis had agreed to purchase 300 American tanks. The sale of the stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, which has requested to buy 48 of the advanced aircraft, would mark the first US sale of the advanced fighter jets to Riyadh, a significant policy shift. The deal could alter the military balance in the Middle East and test Washington’s definition of maintaining what the US has termed Israel’s “qualitative military edge”. Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East to have the F-35. The two countries also signed a joint declaration on the completion of negotiations on civil nuclear energy cooperation, which the White House said would build the legal foundation for a long-term nuclear energy partnership. Bin Salman has been seeking a deal to unlock access to US nuclear technology and help Saudi Arabia level up with the UAE and traditional regional foe Iran. But progress on such a nuclear pact has been difficult because the Saudis have resisted a US stipulation that would rule out enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel.",

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab government has formed 12 joint investigation teams (JITs) to probe several cases registered against the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in Lahore and Sheikhupura districts, it emerged on Wednesday. The teams were notified by the provincial home department in similar notifications, of which 11 are dated November 6 and one was issued on October 31. According to the notifications, seen by Dawn , the provincial government ordered the formation of five JITs under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 for as many cases registered against the TLP in Sheikhupura district. Of these, four cases have been registered in Muridke tehsil and one in Ferozewala tehsil. Another seven JITs have been formed to carry out the investigation in as many cases registered in Lahore. Of these cases, three have been registered in the  Nawankot area, three in Shahdara Town and one in the Ravi Road area. For the cases registered in Sheikhupura, each JIT will comprise six members, including a superintendent of police (SP), sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), station house officer (SHO), investigating officer (IO), a representative from the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD) in the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP), and any co-opted member. For the cases lodged in Lahore, each JIT is to have five members, including SP Investigation, DSP Investigation, IO, a representative from CTD in the rank of DSP and any co-opted member. The notifications further added that the “convener of the JIT shall depute one of the members of the JIT, for the purpose of submission of the report,” as required by Section 19(1) of the ATA 1997. Crackdown on TLP In recent weeks, the Punjab government has intensified action against the TLP following a ban imposed on the party after a violent clash between TLP protesters and law enforcement personnel in Muridke last month. The now-banned group had launched a protest march in support of Gaza and Palestine, planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration outside the US embassy. However, the group’s movement was thwarted as violent clashes erupted, with reports of party workers attacking law enforcement agencies. Subsequently, the federal government imposed a ban on the party at the request of the Punjab government, concluding that TLP was “involved in terrorism and violent acts”. Meanwhile, authorities continue to look for TLP Chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi, whose disappearance has seemingly baffled the Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies. The TLP chief and his brother were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 first information reports lodged against them. On October 29, the duo, including 21 other senior TLP leaders, were placed on the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL) to prevent them from travelling abroad. A senior officer in the Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore told Dawn on Nov 13 that so far, Lahore police have reportedly arrested a total of the group’s 1,250 key members, including their financiers and the workers wanted in over 100 criminal cases. The official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of party. So, the major focus of the police remained on arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore. A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke, where they had encountered the LEAs. The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said, adding that the crackdowns continued daily. As per sources, the sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members have increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes. A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid a police crackdown. On Tuesday, Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari detailed that assets worth Rs23.40 billion belonging to the TLP had been frozen, along with 92 bank accounts linked to the organisation.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States confirmed the sale to Taiwan of an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million, its second weapons package in a week, bringing the total to $1 billion, and reaffirmed support for Taipei . In the Indo-Pacific region, only Australia and Indonesia now operate the system, three of which the US said last year Taiwan would receive as part of a $2-billion weapons sale. The National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) medium-range air defence solutions, as they are called, are made by RTX. They have been battle-tested in Ukraine , but are a new weapon for Taiwan. The Pentagon said the company was given a firm fixed-price contract for procurement of the NASAMS units, with work estimated to be completed in February 2031. “Fiscal 2026 foreign military sales (Taiwan) funds in the amount of $698,948,760 were obligated,” it said in a statement on Monday. RTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Used in Ukraine to defend against the Russian invasion , the NASAMS system offers a sharp boost in air defence capabilities that the US is exporting to Taiwan as demand for it surges. ‘Rock solid’ US support “It should be clear today and will remain clear into the future that America’s commitments to Taiwan are rock solid,” Raymond Greene, the de facto US ambassador in Taipei, told an event of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan on Tuesday. “We are backing these words with actions, with a focus on supporting Taiwan’s efforts to achieve peace through strength. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our growing defence industrial cooperation.” Thursday’s US approval of the sale of fighter jet and other aircraft parts to Taiwan for $330m was its first such deal since US President Donald Trump took office in January, prompting thanks from Taipei and anger in Beijing. The arms sales news comes amid a worsening diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Tokyo over Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, although Taipei’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims. On Sunday, Chinese coast guard ships sailed through waters around a group of East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China. Japan said it also scrambled fighter jets on Saturday, after China flew a drone between Taiwan and Japan’s westernmost island of Yonaguni. Asked about the tension on Wednesday, Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said China should not resort to force to resolve disputes. “China should abandon its thinking of using force to resolve things,” he told reporters. Taiwan’s military is beefing up its armaments to better tackle any attack from China, through efforts such as building its own submarines to defend vital maritime supply lines. China’s military operates around Taiwan on an almost daily basis in what Taipei views as a “grey zone” strategy to test and exhaust Taiwan’s forces. Despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, the US is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, to the constant anger of Beijing.",

      "summary_orig": "• DIG says speed limits for different roads to be set after completion of road safety, engineering audit • Police say prior to launch of e-challan system, citywide speed limit for cars, motorcycles, etc was 30km/h • In first phase, 60km/h limit set for cars, bikes and LTVs on Sharea Faisal • Many believe top speed on city’s main artery is ‘ok for bikers but too slow for cars’ KARACHI: The newly introduced automated e-ticketing system appears to have been launched in haste as traffic authorities have issued hundreds of challans for speeding, but they are yet to set the speed limit for vehicles on major thoroughfares, it emerged on Tuesday. Last week, authorities had installed speed limit signs on Sharea Faisal, despite the fact that the traffic police had already issued 1,967 tickets for speeding within the first week (from Oct 27 to Nov 3) of the launch of the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (Tracs). The traffic police said they are in the process of fixing speed limits for vehicles on different arteries in the metropolis and in the first phase they set 60 kilometres per hour (km/h) on Sharea Faisal for all cars, motorbikes and light transport vehicles (LTVs) and 30 km/h for heavy transport vehicles (HTVs). DIG Traffic Pir Mohammed Shah conceded that at present “road-specific speed limits” were not notified. “A comprehensive road safety and engineering audit including assessment of road geometry, access points, pedestrian activity, and traffic flow is under way,” he told Dawn. “Once the audit is completed, revised and road-specific speed limits will be notified.” He said that currently a uniform, but interim, speed limit is in place for all roads in the metropolis. “At present, the citywide speed limit for HTVs is 60 km/h, while for cars, motorcycles and LTV it is 30 km/h,” he said. However, he did not know when this speed limit had been fixed or whether it had ever been revised. Asked as to how fines were imposed over speeding violation, the DIG claims: “Limits were displayed from the day 1 through digital boards on all digital streamers across the city.” DIG defends speed limit on signal-free Sharea Faisal People using Sharea Faisal for their daily commute are expressing their surprise over the speed limit of 60 km/h, saying the road is almost signal free from Hotel Metropole traffic intersection to Karachi Airport. Many people are of the view that the speed limit makes sense for motorcyclists, but for cars, 60 km/h is too slow on a signal-free road. A senior official, requesting anonymity, told Dawn that Sharea Faisal is used for VVIP traffic and vehicles part of their motorcade drive at the minimum speed of 100 km/h. “The speed limit should have been 80 km/h for LTVs and cars and 60 km/h for motorbikes,” he said. However, the DIG Traffic told Dawn the speed limit was fixed keeping in view road safety, and not traffic flow alone. He said although Sharea Faisal now functions as a signal-free corridor, “it remains a mixed-traffic urban artery, with multiple entry/exit points, pedestrian activity at certain locations, service lanes, and merging traffic from side roads”. “Higher speed will significantly increase the likelihood and severity of accidents,” he said. He believed that the 60 km/h limit was in line with “international standards for urban expressways where pedestrian and mixed-use interactions still exist”. “Our goal is to maintain smooth traffic movement while prioritising the safety of commuters, motorcyclists and pedestrians,” DIG Shah said. He said that the 30 km/h speed limit for heavy vehicles was due to their “size, braking distance and impact force”, which posed a significantly higher risk at high speeds. “Even at night, Sharea Faisal continues to have private traffic, motorcyclists, and ride-hailing vehicles, and any high-speed accident involving a heavy vehicle can be catastrophic,” he said.

Many spend years behind bars — far longer than the maximum sentence for their crime. Some, convicted by lower courts, are later acquitted by the higher judiciary. In this context, last month the Supreme Court overturned the convictions of two brothers, who had earlier been found guilty of carrying out the 2005 PIDC bomb attack in Karachi. In its detailed judgement issued last week, the court advised the federal and provincial governments to enact laws for the compensation and rehabilitation of “victims of miscarriage of justice” and to hold public officials accountable for dereliction of duty. The ruling exposes a deeply flawed parole and probation process due to a legal system that functions for the privileged not the poor. Courts should focus on setting time limits for both police investigations and the conclusion of trials. A report by NCHR, National Academy for Prisons Administration and Justice Project Pakistan testifies to the staggering jail rush: spaces for under 66,000 are crammed with over 102,000 inmates; three-quarters are under trial. Society forgets that an undertrial prisoner is a detainee not yet convicted. The Supreme Court’s newly pruned status should give Chief Justice Yahya Afridi more time to focus on the undertrial population, better legislative provisions and implementation of judgements on rights such as bail and legal aid for the poor. Scores could have been acquitted or granted suspended sentences had trials been speedy. A streamlined judicial process offers relief, whereas prolonged incarceration can turn first-time offenders into hardened criminals. Jail reform must then be a priority. Besides vocational training and education for inmates, the authorities can look into options like electronic devices to keep track of undertrial prisoners, thus easing jail congestion.

The ruling exposes a deeply flawed parole and probation process due to a legal system that functions for the privileged not the poor. Courts should focus on setting time limits for both police investigations and the conclusion of trials. A report by NCHR, National Academy for Prisons Administration and Justice Project Pakistan testifies to the staggering jail rush: spaces for under 66,000 are crammed with over 102,000 inmates; three-quarters are under trial. Society forgets that an undertrial prisoner is a detainee not yet convicted. The Supreme Court’s newly pruned status should give Chief Justice Yahya Afridi more time to focus on the undertrial population, better legislative provisions and implementation of judgements on rights such as bail and legal aid for the poor. Scores could have been acquitted or granted suspended sentences had trials been speedy. A streamlined judicial process offers relief, whereas prolonged incarceration can turn first-time offenders into hardened criminals. Jail reform must then be a priority. Besides vocational training and education for inmates, the authorities can look into options like electronic devices to keep track of undertrial prisoners, thus easing jail congestion. Lastly, compensation should be given to the acquitted — a small price for the loss of precious years of freedom. Published in Dawn, November 19th, 2025",
