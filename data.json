      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday stated Pakistan did not “subscribe to the opinion” of the judge — who convicted lawyer Imaan Mazari-Hari and her spouse, Hadi Ali Chattha — on “terrorist states”. In his verdict , Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had noted: “Currently there are four countries designated as terrorist states, which are Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Korea, Iran and Syria.” Asked about that judgment during his weekly press briefing in Islamabad on Thursday, FO spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said, “This judgment […] is the view of the learned judge. Pakistan, of course, does not subscribe to this opinion. “And frankly, this kind of designation does not exist either under the United Nations (UN) or under international law,” he said. Judge Majoka had made the observation while noting that Pakistan was “not included in the list of terrorist states”. It is worth mentioning that the UN does not maintain a list of “terrorist states”. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has a “Consolidated List” of individuals, entities and other groups that it subjects to certain measures, such as sanctions, due to various reasons. While it may include certain government-affiliated departments, it does not name any country in its entirety. Imaan and Hadi were sentenced on January 24 under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act’s (Peca) sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism), and 26-A (false and fake information). They were handed a total of 17 years in jail, with the longest sentence being 10 years, and fined Rs36 million each collectively. In his judgment, Judge Majoka had remarked about the four countries while noting that the couple had “intentionally in their tweets mentioned the [sic] Pakistan as a terrorist state”. Earlier on Thursday, the European Union’s (EU) Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Anouar El Anouni raised concerns over the conviction of Imaan and Hadi. In a post on X, the EU official said their convictions “over social media activity goes against freedom of expression and independence of lawyers”. “These are not only key democratic principles but also part of [Pakistan’s] international human rights commitments,” Anouni said. Andrabi was asked to comment on Anouni’s remarks during the briefing, to which he said: “This is a domestic affair of Pakistan, the trial and conviction took place under our local laws through a judicial process. The relevant individuals have a right to appeal and have a right to a judicial recourse. “As such, there is domestic remedy available to these individuals. Whilst we remains engaged with the EU on all issues, we do make a distinction about our domestic affairs.” On Iran-US rift The FO spokesperson was also about whether Pakistan was making any efforts to ease tensions between Iran and the US in view of a threat of a war between the two. In his response, Andrabi said Pakistan had always advocated for peace and diplomacy to settle all outstanding issues. “Pakistan remains firmly opposed to interference in internal affairs of our brotherly country Iran. We have opposed the use of force; we have opposed the imposition of sanctions,” he added. The FO spokesperson recalled that earlier, this week, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had telephone conversations with his Iranian counterpart twice and the Pakistan delegation, particularly Dar, also engaged with the US at the World Economic Forum. “So, our advocacy for peace diplomacy continues and this remains our stated position. This region cannot afford war, turmoil because this in essence, stops the economic development, and prosperity. So, we hope that peace and diplomacy will prevail,” he said. Board of Peace Multiple questions were asked about US President Donald Trump-led Board of Peace. Trump announced the establishment of the Board of Peace on January 15 as part of his broader plan for Gaza, under which the ceasefire agreement was reached. The board was authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 2803 in November 2025. The board was originally conceived to oversee the ceasefire and reconstruction of Gaza, but its charter expands its mandate to peace-building in all areas affected by or at risk of conflict. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was among the world leaders who signed the board’s charter on January 22 in Davos. Andrabi was asked today whether the FO had “prohibited” the PM or the government from signing the charter “for the time being” when the premier was leaving for Davos. The FO spokesperson dismissed the reports, saying: “This news is incorrect.” Responding to other questions on the matter, he said: “Pakistan has joined the Board of Peace in good faith. Our basic objective in joining the Board of Peace is threefold. “One, to consolidate and sustain ceasefire in Gaza; second to support reconstruction; and thirdly to advance a just and lasting peace based on the Palestinian right to self-determination.” The FO spokesperson pointed out that seven other Muslim countries had joined the board as well. “As such, Pakistan joining the Board of Peace should be seen in the continuum of the initiative by these eight Arab Islamic countries to promote peace in Gaza, leading towards a lasting solution to the Palestinian question — and this initiative dates back to September and August last year. “All eight countries have joined the Board of Peace with a single collective voice. The Board of Peace offers a viable glimmer of hope for Gaza and for wider Palestinian question,” he asserted. Andrabi further stated that for over two years, the people of Gaza had witnessed unprecedented suffering, death and destruction. “The UN Security Council remained deadlocked on this issue. The International Court of Justice issued three advisory opinions, and the General Assembly adopted a number of resolutions, all of which failed to prevent the Israeli onslaught. “So, in this backdrop, the Board of Peace is a glimmer of hope for Palestine,” he said. Andrabi also clarified that it was misconception that joining the board was “anyway connected to any Abraham accord or any sidetrack to this issue. Pakistan’s positions remain unchanged, and we will not become a party to the Abraham accord”. He said the board “does not replace the United Nations”. “It has been established with a specific mandate authorised by the UN Security Council resolution 2803. We understand that the Board of Peace is intended to complement and not undermine the UN system,” he said, adding that Pakistan had not decided to join the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) and the membership of the Board of Peace did not imply contributing to troops to ISF. As for the decision to join the board itself, he said, the foreign ministry and all stakeholders held joint consultations. “This was a collective decision taken with all procedural formalities completed in terms of the ‘Rules of Business’ of the federal government.” Andrabi further stated: “We hope that the framework established by the Board of Peace will lead to concrete steps towards permanent ceasefire, expanded humanitarian assistance, the reconstruction of Gaza and will advance Palestinians people’s right to self-determination through a credible, time bound political process in line with international legitimacy and the relevant UN resolutions, culminating in an independent, sovereign, contiguous state of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.” He said Pakistan looked forward to continuing to play a constructive role as part of the Board of Peace in achieving these goals and in ending the suffering of Palestinian brothers and sisters. The FO spokesperson explained that representation at the Board of Peace depended on “at what level the meeting is taking place. I mean, there could be a summit level, or a ministerial level. So, on this issue, we will know, as we advance in this process”. “As for the status of the membership, there is basically a three-year membership. And after three years, there is certain payment. There is no permanent and non-permanent category, as such, linked to the financial contribution,” he added.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday spoke with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, with the two leaders exchanging views on the “evolving regional situation”. According to a handout from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), PM Shehbaz “underscored the importance of sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement for promoting peace, security and development in the region”. “Reflecting the close and fraternal ties between Pakistan and Iran, rooted in shared history, culture, and faith, both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to maintain regular high-level engagements and consultations through bilateral institutional mechanisms, to further strengthen cooperation across the full spectrum of bilateral relations,” the statement said. The development comes as reports emerged that US President Donald Trump was weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders. The call also came hours after Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had underscored the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in a phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. The Foreign Office (FO) posted on X that the two foreign ministers had spoken on the phone, during which Dar expressed concern over the evolving regional situation. The foreign minister “underscored that dialogue and diplomacy remain the only viable way forward”, the FO said. It added that both leaders agreed to remain in close contact. The two leaders had already spoken on Saturday, when Dar received a call from Araghchi while on a visit to Dubai. According to the FO, the Iranian minister had thanked the deputy prime minister for “his strong support and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, including its call for a vote as well as voting against the resolution concerning Iran”. Last week, the United Nations Human Rights Council had adopted a resolution to extend the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran for two years. Pakistan was one of the seven countries that voted against the resolution, along with India and China.",

      "summary_orig": "WITH the threat of a new American attack on Iran persisting, many of the Islamic Republic’s neighbours have said they will not allow their territory to be used against Tehran. This is significant as a number of Iran’s neighbours host thousands of American troops, and these states realise that if their territory is used to mount fresh aggression, regional US bases will become targets for Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian have discussed the situation , with the latter saying that Iran welcomes any process that will avoid war. The prince, on the other hand, reiterated that Saudi territory will not be used against Iran. Earlier, the UAE had also said that it will not allow its facilities to be used against its neighbour across the Gulf. Meanwhile, the Turkish foreign minister has observed that a new American war would be “wrong”, while calling for a diplomatic resolution of the crisis. But diplomacy does not seem to be on top of US President Donald Trump’s agenda, as his pugnacious remarks on Wednesday indicate. He observed that unless Iran comes to the table, “the next attack will be far worse” than last year’s US-Israeli aggression. The uneasiness of Iran’s neighbours at the thought of fresh hostilities is understandable. Iranian authorities have said several times that if targeted by foreign aggression, they will reply with full force. They have also said that if neighbouring countries allow their land or airspace to be used, “they will be considered hostile”. There is clearly no appetite for a new war in the region, apart from the Israelis. Therefore, the US should abandon its threatening posture and regime change plans, and adopt a more conciliatory tone with Iran. The Iranians are willing to talk, but as their foreign minister said yesterday, negotiations “under threat cannot succeed”. There may still be time to pull back and stop a destructive new war. Mr Trump should listen to regional voices, and approach Iran with respect if he is serious about peace. However, the Zionist and neocon members of his inner circle appear to be egging on the American leader towards confrontation with the Islamic Republic. If these warmongers have their way, a devastating conflagration may be on the horizon, as the Iranian establishment will consider this an existential battle. Published in Dawn, January 29th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least three terrorists were killed on Thursday after security forces launched a large-scale operation in the Domel tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district. A police statement said several terrorists were also injured in clashes with security forces. The operation was launched in the tehsil’s Sperka and Kotka Akbar Ali Khan area. During the operation, security forces have targeted militant hideouts with more than 25 quadcopter strikes, while a heavy exchange of fire continues in the area. The operation is being supervised by senior police and security officials who are also present in the field. Security forces have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to arrest terrorists attempting to flee, which is still ongoing. Continuous surveillance by drones and helicopters is being carried out in the region, indicating the sensitive nature and importance of the operation. The objective, security forces said, is to completely clear the area and restore law and order. Meanwhile, local sources said that amid intense firing and fierce clashes, three civilians were killed, including two women. Due to the severity of the fighting, public access to the area remains restricted, and as a result, the bodies are still lying inside their homes. Separately, MTI spokesperson Muhammad Noman told Dawn that four injured persons were brought to Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital, Bannu Township, including two women and two children. Earlier this week, two terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with police in Domel area. The police also recovered weapons and ammunition from the possession of the killed militants. On January 13, armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee in the district. The incident took place in the Gulbadin Landi Dak area of Bannu district. According to a senior official of the district police, the victims were all travelling in the same vehicle when armed men opened “indiscriminate fire” on them. The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence. Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.",

      "summary_orig": "Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the armed forces were “undergoing major transformation in multiple domains”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday. According to an ISPR press release , the army chief made the remarks while addressing troops of the Bahawalpur Garrison at Khairpur Tamewali (KPT) in Punjab, where he witnessed a high-intensity field exercise ‘Steadfast Resolve’. The corps, based at Bahawalpur Garrison, is a key strike formation of the Pakistan Army. Its area of responsibility includes the southern Punjab desert zone and its order of battle includes multiple divisions. It focuses on modern, technology-enabled, multi-domain operations, often conducting exercises in areas like Khairpur Tamewali. “COAS & CDF highlighted that Pakistan Armed Forces are undergoing major transformation in multiple domains,” the military’s media affairs wing said. “Character of war has evolved massively, with technological advancements driving the evolution, dictating huge mental transformation at all tiers,” the army chief observed. He added: “In the future, technological manoeuvres will replace physical manoeuvres and will fundamentally alter the way offensive and defensive operations are undertaken.” “Therefore, Pakistan armed forces are embracing and absorbing technology at a rapid pace. In this process, innovation, indigenisation and adaptation shall remain fundamental.” CDF Munir also lauded the troops’ high morale, professional competence and operational preparedness. He reaffirmed that the armed forces remain fully prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity “against all threats, emphasising the need to maintain optimum readiness to meet the requirements of future battlefield and security challenges”, the ISPR added. The ‘Steadfast Resolve’ exercise encompassed the “integration of niche technologies like unmanned aerial systems (drones), advanced surveillance assets, electronic warfare assets and modern command-and-control mechanisms, reflecting the armed forces’ focus on technology-enabled multi-domain operations”, the statement said. CDF and COAS Field Marshal Asim Munir visits Khairpur Tamewali in Punjab’s Bahawalpur in this photo released on Jan 29, 2026. — ISPR During his visit to Bahawalpur Garrison, Field Marshal Munir was also briefed on “various operational, training and administrative aspects of the Corps, with special focus on preparations for multi-domain warfare”. Upon his arrival at the garrison, the CDF was received by the Bahawalpur Corps commander. He also laid a floral wreath at the Martyrs’ Monument and offered prayers for the martyrs, paying tribute to their sacrifices. Earlier, COAS Munir inaugurated the “ROHI eSkills Learning Hub (STP) aimed at promoting digital skills and learning opportunities for students, particularly from southern Punjab and across the country”.

According to an ISPR press release , the army chief made the remarks while addressing troops of the Bahawalpur Garrison at Khairpur Tamewali (KPT) in Punjab, where he witnessed a high-intensity field exercise ‘Steadfast Resolve’. The corps, based at Bahawalpur Garrison, is a key strike formation of the Pakistan Army. Its area of responsibility includes the southern Punjab desert zone and its order of battle includes multiple divisions. It focuses on modern, technology-enabled, multi-domain operations, often conducting exercises in areas like Khairpur Tamewali. “COAS & CDF highlighted that Pakistan Armed Forces are undergoing major transformation in multiple domains,” the military’s media affairs wing said. “Character of war has evolved massively, with technological advancements driving the evolution, dictating huge mental transformation at all tiers,” the army chief observed. He added: “In the future, technological manoeuvres will replace physical manoeuvres and will fundamentally alter the way offensive and defensive operations are undertaken.” “Therefore, Pakistan armed forces are embracing and absorbing technology at a rapid pace. In this process, innovation, indigenisation and adaptation shall remain fundamental.” CDF Munir also lauded the troops’ high morale, professional competence and operational preparedness. He reaffirmed that the armed forces remain fully prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity “against all threats, emphasising the need to maintain optimum readiness to meet the requirements of future battlefield and security challenges”, the ISPR added. The ‘Steadfast Resolve’ exercise encompassed the “integration of niche technologies like unmanned aerial systems (drones), advanced surveillance assets, electronic warfare assets and modern command-and-control mechanisms, reflecting the armed forces’ focus on technology-enabled multi-domain operations”, the statement said.

      "title_orig": "Trump weighs Iran strikes to inspire renewed protests, sources say",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, multiple sources said, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the government. Two US sources familiar with the discussions said Trump wanted to create conditions for “regime change” after a crackdown crushed a nationwide protest movement earlier this month. To do so, he was looking at options to hit commanders and institutions that Washington holds responsible for the violence, to give protesters the confidence that they could overrun government and security buildings, they said. One of the US sources said the options being discussed by Trump’s aides also included a much larger strike intended to have a lasting impact, possibly against the ballistic missiles that can reach US allies in the Middle East or its nuclear enrichment programmes. The other US source said Trump has not yet made a final decision on a course of action, including whether to take the military path. The arrival of a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East this week has expanded Trump’s capabilities to potentially take military action, after he repeatedly threatened intervention over Iran’s crackdown. Four Arab officials, three Western diplomats, and a senior Western source whose governments were briefed on the discussions said they were concerned that instead of bringing people onto the streets, such strikes could weaken a movement already in shock after the crackdown. Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute, said that without large-scale military defections, Iran’s protests remained “heroic but outgunned.” The sources in this story requested anonymity to talk about sensitive matters. Iran’s foreign office, the US Department of Defense and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Israeli Prime Minister’s office declined to comment. Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons, warning that any future US attack would be more severe than a June bombing campaign against three nuclear sites. He described the ships in the region as an “armada” sailing to Iran. A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was “preparing itself for a military confrontation, while at the same time making use of diplomatic channels.” However, Washington was not showing openness to diplomacy, the official said. Iran, which says its nuclear program is civilian, was ready for dialogue “based on mutual respect and interests” but would defend itself “like never before” if pushed, Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X on Wednesday. Trump has not publicly detailed what he is looking for in any deal. His administration’s previous negotiating points have included banning Iran from independently enriching uranium and restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles and on Tehran’s network of armed proxies in the Middle East. Limits of air power A senior Israeli official with direct knowledge of planning between Israel and the United States told Reuters that Israel does not believe airstrikes alone can topple the Islamic Republic, if that is Washington’s goal. “If you’re going to topple the regime, you have to put boots on the ground,” he said, noting that even if the United States killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would “have a new leader that will replace him.” Only a combination of external pressure and an organised domestic opposition could shift Iran’s political trajectory, the official said. The Israeli official said Iran’s leadership had been weakened by the unrest but remained firmly in control despite the ongoing deep economic crisis that sparked the protests. Multiple US intelligence reports reached a similar conclusion: that the conditions that led to the protests were still in place, weakening the government, but without major fractures, two people familiar with the matter said. The Western source said they believed Trump’s goal appeared to be to engineer a change in leadership, rather than “topple the regime,” an outcome that would be similar to Venezuela, where US intervention replaced the president without a wholesale change of government. Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand deaths during the protests. He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.” Khamenei retains control but less visible At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said. Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran’s security network and big parts of the economy. However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy — meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei. In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said. But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions. Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said. Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse — not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran’s borders. A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint. The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources. Regional blowback Gulf states — long‑time US allies and hosts to major American bases — fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran. “The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.” Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre said the US deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium. The most likely outcome is a “grinding erosion — elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession — that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said. EU set to add Iran’s Guards to terror list after France U-turn Meanwhile, the European Union is poised to include Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations after France said on Wednesday it would now support the move. EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests. “France will support the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X. With France, Italy and Germany now on board, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday, although it does need unanimity among the bloc’s 27 members. Earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU’s terrorist organisation list, joining the United States. “The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain,” Barrot said. The French presidency had earlier announced the decision. Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes. Cutting ties, fears for citizens in Iran While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU’s terrorist list, others, led by France, have been more cautious. They feared such a move could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, and also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons. Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year. Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal, given the IRGC’s role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said were tantamount to terrorist activity. “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck, and it’s good to call that out,” said one senior EU diplomat.",

Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year. Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal, given the IRGC’s role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said were tantamount to terrorist activity. “If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck, and it’s good to call that out,” said one senior EU diplomat.",
      "title": "Trump weighs Iran strikes to inspire renewed protests, sources say",
      "summary": "US President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, multiple sources said, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the government. Two US sources familiar with the discussions said Trump wanted to create conditions for “regime change” after a crackdown crushed a nationwide protest movement earlier this month. To do so, he was looking at options to hit commanders and institutions that Washington holds responsible for the violence, to give protesters the confidence that they could overrun government and security buildings, they said. One of the US sources said the options being discussed by Trump’s aides also included a much larger strike intended to have a lasting impact, possibly against the ballistic missiles that can reach US allies in the Middle East or its nuclear enrichment programmes. The other US source said Trump has not yet made a final decision on a course of action, including whether to take the military path. The arrival of a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East this week has expanded Trump’s capabilities to potentially take military action, after he repeatedly threatened intervention over Iran’s crackdown. Four Arab officials, three Western diplomats, and a senior Western source whose governments were briefed on the discussions said they were concerned that instead of bringing people onto the streets, such strikes could weaken a movement already in shock after the crackdown. Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute, said that without large-scale military defections, Iran’s protests remained “heroic but outgunned.” The sources in this story requested anonymity to talk about sensitive matters. Iran’s foreign office, the US Department of Defense and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Israeli Prime Minister’s office declined to comment. Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons, warning that any future US attack would be more severe than a June bombing campaign against three nuclear sites. He described the ships in the region as an “armada” sailing to Iran. A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was “preparing itself for a military confrontation, while at the same time making use of diplomatic channels.” However, Washington was not showing openness to diplomacy, the official said. Iran, which says its nuclear program is civilian, was ready for dialogue “based on mutual respect and interests” but would defend itself “like never before” if pushed, Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X on Wednesday. Trump has not publicly detailed what he is looking for in any deal. His administration’s previous negotiating points have included banning Iran from independently enriching uranium and restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles and on Tehran’s network of armed proxies in the Middle East. Limits of air power A senior Israeli official with direct knowledge of planning between Israel and the United States told Reuters that Israel does not believe airstrikes alone can topple the Islamic Republic, if that is Washington’s goal. “If you’re going to topple the regime, you have to put boots on the ground,” he said, noting that even if the United States killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would “have a new leader that will replace him.” Only a combination of external pressure and an organised domestic opposition could shift Iran’s political trajectory, the official said. The Israeli official said Iran’s leadership had been weakened by the unrest but remained firmly in control despite the ongoing deep economic crisis that sparked the protests. Multiple US intelligence reports reached a similar conclusion: that the conditions that led to the protests were still in place, weakening the government, but without major fractures, two people familiar with the matter said. The Western source said they believed Trump’s goal appeared to be to engineer a change in leadership, rather than “topple the regime,” an outcome that would be similar to Venezuela, where US intervention replaced the president without a wholesale change of government. Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand deaths during the protests. He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.” Khamenei retains control but less visible At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said. Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran’s security network and big parts of the economy. However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy — meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei. In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said. But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions. Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said. Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse — not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran’s borders. A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint. The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources. Regional blowback Gulf states — long‑time US allies and hosts to major American bases — fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran. “The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.” Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre said the US deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium. The most likely outcome is a “grinding erosion — elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession — that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said. EU set to add Iran’s Guards to terror list after France U-turn Meanwhile, the European Union is poised to include Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations after France said on Wednesday it would now support the move. EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests. “France will support the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X. With France, Italy and Germany now on board, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday, although it does need unanimity among the bloc’s 27 members. Earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU’s terrorist organisation list, joining the United States. “The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain,” Barrot said. The French presidency had earlier announced the decision. Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.

      "summary_orig": "Sri Lanka will deploy elite armed units to protect teams at next month’s T20 World Cup, part of enhanced security measures with a special emphasis on matches between perennial rivals India and Pakistan, officials have told AFP . The island is co-hosting the biennial cricket tournament with India and will hold 20 games between February 7 and March 8. The Indian and Pakistani teams will play each other at least once, in their Group A clash in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo on February 15. Cricket matches have long been a stage for expressing political tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, which fought a four-day conflict last year. Sri Lanka has given the “highest priority” to ensuring the tournament runs smoothly and is “paying special attention to the India-Pakistan matches”, sports minister Sunil Kumara Gamage told AFP late on Wednesday. Elite commando units, usually assigned to guard visiting heads of state, will be deployed to protect all participating teams, police and security officials said. “From the time they step out of the airport till they return to their aircraft, they will be protected by armed guards,” an official said, asking not to be named. India and Pakistan have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, opting to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead. Hence, for the T20 World Cup, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has shifted their matches to Sri Lanka. Bangladesh also tried to have their matches moved out of India due to security fears, but the ICC rejected the request. An angry Bangladesh then withdrew from the tournament, and Scotland were drafted in as their replacement. Pakistan has indicated that it may yet boycott the event in solidarity with Bangladesh. Sri Lanka maintained a studious silence throughout the India-Bangladesh row. Cricket Secretary Bandula Dissanayake told AFP Colombo wanted to avoid being drawn into regional disputes. “In these disputes among India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, we are remaining neutral, all of these are friendly nations,” he said. But he added that Sri Lanka would be willing to host future tournaments for any of the countries if asked. Sri Lanka has also used the T20 World Cup as an opportunity to upgrade its international venues. It has commissioned new floodlights at the Singhalese Sports Club, one of two stadiums in Colombo. The Pallekele Stadium in Kandy was unaffected by a deadly cyclone that damaged buildings in the region in November, and will host a T20 international between Sri Lanka and England from Friday.",

The department updated its travel advisory for Pakistan on Jan 26, advising travellers to think twice before visiting due to crime, civil unrest, terrorism, and the risk of kidnapping. Pakistan has been placed under a Level 3 advisory, a category that indicates a high risk where terrorist attacks may occur without warning. According to the State Department, typical targets include “transportation hubs, hotels, markets, shopping malls, military and security sites, airports, trains, schools, hospitals, places of worship, tourist locations, and government buildings”. Some regions, including parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have been designated Level 4: Do Not Travel areas. The advisory urges US citizens not to travel to Level 4 areas “for any reason”, warning that assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, particularly against government officials and private citizens. The warning also applies to US citizens of Pakistani origin. The State Department noted that local laws prohibit demonstrations without a permit and warned that “US citizens have been detained for participating” in such activities. A Level 3 advisory indicates “serious risks to safety”, and travelers are advised to reconsider their travel plans. Level 4 is the highest advisory level and discourages all travel.
