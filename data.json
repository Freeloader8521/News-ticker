      "summary_orig": "Over 7,000 cases of data breaches have been reported by companies in Korea over the past six years, data showed Sunday, raising concerns over the country's cybersecurity amid a recent string of hacking attacks against telecom and financial firms. A total of 7,198 cases of cybersecurity threats were filed with authorities between 2020 and last Sunday, according to data submitted to Rep. Hwang Jung-a of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea. The number of cases stood at 603 in 2020 and climbed slightly to 640 in 2021 before nearly doubling to 1,142 in 2022. In 2023, a total of 1,277 cases were reported, followed by 1,887 in 2024 and 1,649 so far this year. Small and medium-sized firms reported 5,907 such cases, accounting for 82 percent of the total, followed by mid-sized firms at 592 cases, and conglomerates at 242 cases. Nonprofit organizations also reported 457 cases, according to the data. Most of the cases involved system hacking, which stood at 4,354 cases, or 60.5 percent of the total, while malware infections and distributions accounted for 20.9 percent, and DDoS attacks stood at 18.",

      "summary_orig": "An Afghan Taliban government official said on Sunday that a deal over Bagram air base was “not possible”, after US President Donald Trump said he wanted the former US base back. Trump threatened the country on Saturday with unspecified punishment, just days after he raised the idea of the United States retaking control of the base while on a state visit to the United Kingdom. “If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!” the 79-year-old leader wrote on his Truth Social platform. Trump, who has previously said he wants the United States to acquire territories and sites ranging from the Panama Canal to Greenland , has appeared focused on Bagram for years. Asked on Saturday whether he would send in US troops to retake the base, Trump declined to give a direct answer, saying: “We won’t talk about that.” “We’re talking now to Afghanistan and we want it back and we want it back soon, right away. And if they don’t do it — if they don’t do it, you’re going to find out what I’m gonna do,” he told reporters at the White House. On Sunday, Fasihuddin Fitrat, chief of staff of the Ministry of Defence, said “some people” want to take back the base through a “political deal”. “Recently, some people have said that they have entered negotiations with Afghanistan for taking back Bagram air base,” he said in comments broadcast by local media. “A deal over even an inch of Afghanistan’s soil is not possible. We don’t need it.” Bagram, the largest air base in Afghanistan, was a linchpin of the US-led war effort against the Taliban, whose government Washington toppled following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. US and Nato troops chaotically pulled out of Bagram in July 2021 as part of a Trump-brokered deal with the Taliban. The loss of crucial air power saw the Afghan military collapse just weeks later and the Taliban sweep back to power . Current and former US officials privately caution that re-occupying Bagram air base in Afghanistan might end up looking like a re-invasion of the country, requiring more than 10,000 troops as well as deployment of advanced air defences. Experts say the sprawling air base would be difficult to secure initially and would require massive manpower to operate and protect. Even if the Taliban accepted the US re-occupation of Bagram following negotiations, it would need to be defended from a host of threats including the terrorist Islamic State and Al Qaeda militants inside Afghanistan. It could also be vulnerable to an advanced missile threat from Iran, which attacked a major US air base in Qatar in June after the United States struck Iranian nuclear sites .",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan have a chance at redemption as they face India again today in Dubai for the Super Four stage of the Men’s Asia Cup after their last game was marred by a controversy spiralling from the neighbouring team’s refusal to shake hands with their opponents. The Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday — their first meeting since the four-day military conflict between them in May — ended on a bitter note when the Men in Blue refused to shake hands with the Green Shirts after winning the game . There were no handshakes between the captains at the toss either. According to Reuters , Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for today’s clash, which is scheduled for 7:30pm PKT at the Dubai International Stadium. Match referee Andy Pycroft, whose removal was sought by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over the controversy but was denied by the International Cricket Council (ICC), is still scheduled to officiate today. Asked about the handshake issue and Pycroft’s presence yesterday, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav changed the subject, saying, “It will be a good contest between the ball and the bat”. He added: “Close your room, switch off your phone and sleep. I think that’s the best thing to shut the noise. It’s easy to say, but sometimes it is difficult.” India won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively. Suryakumar, who had seemingly politicised last Sunday’s victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, said: “I have been very clear with all the boys. I think it’s very important if you want to do well in this tournament and going forward. “We will have to shut a lot of noise from outside and take what is good for you.” Despite India’s triumph in their previous encounter, Suryakumar insisted past results would count for nothing when the rivals meet again in today’s Super Four match. “I feel our preparation has been really good leading into the tournament. We have also had three good games, so we are actually focusing on what we can do best,” he added. “We want to follow all the good habits that we have been doing from the last two or three games. We take it one game at a time. It doesn’t give us an edge that we have played them once, and we had a good game. We have to start from scratch.” Pakistan had cancelled their pre-match press conference yesterday, making it the second consecutive time that they did so following the handshake incident. Last night, PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi met with the Green Shirts in Dubai as they participated in warm-up exercises for today’s match. Handshake ruckus Earlier this week, the situation escalated to the point that the PCB was even mulling its participation in the Asia Cup after the ICC rejected its complaint seeking the removal of Pycroft, who PCB said told captain Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart before the match. However, the situation was finally settled when, just before Pakistan’s match against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday, the PCB said Pycroft “ apologised ” to the Green Shirts’ manager and captain over the ruckus resulting from “miscommunication”. Nevertheless, the tournament still had lingering disputes; the ICC reportedly took exception to the PCB recording Pycroft’s “apology” meeting with Pakistan team officials. The event had been marred by controversy before it even began, with calls for a boycott of the game from across the border.",

The hacking incident hit check-in and boarding systems provider Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX, disrupting operations on Saturday at London’s Heathrow, Berlin Airport and in Brussels, where passengers faced long queues, dozens of cancellations and delays. Disruption had eased significantly by early Sunday despite some continuing delays, airport officials and data showed, while regional regulators said they were investigating the origin of the hacking incident. The disruption is the latest in a string of hacks to hit sectors from healthcare to autos. A breach at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover halted production, while another caused Marks & Spencer losses in the hundreds of millions of pounds. RTX called the incident a “cyber-related disruption” and said it had impacted its MUSE software, which is used by several airlines. RTX was not immediately available for comment on Sunday. Berlin Brandenburg Airport said on Sunday that problems persisted, but that it was working with the company to resolve the issue. A manual workaround is in place, and there are currently no major delays or cancellations, it added. Brussels Airport said in an update to passengers on Sunday that the cyberattack was having a “large impact on the flight schedule”, causing delays and cancellations of flights. Heathrow said early on Sunday work was continuing to recover from the check-in system outage. It added that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”. An analysis by aviation data provider Cirium said delays at Heathrow were “low”, Berlin had “moderate” delays, while Brussels had “significant” delays, but that they were decreasing.",

      "summary_orig": "At the end of the first Pakistan-India game in this year’s Asia Cup, the Indian team refused to shake the hands of their Pakistani counterparts. The move was broadly criticised within Pakistan and by some former cricket greats in other cricket-playing countries as well. Most Indians have been going through an existential crisis of sorts after losing a short war against Pakistan in May this year. Not shaking hands with Pakistani players can, therefore, also be understood as an act of sulking brought on by the shock of losing a war to a much smaller neighbour. One of the most common reactions to the sulky behaviour of the Indian players was that “politics should not be mixed with sport.” Nothing new in this, really. For decades, one has heard this over and over again. Indeed, one can’t help but agree with this sentiment, but when it comes to cricketing relations between India and Pakistan, politics is historically and inherently entrenched in these relations. After the 1965 war between the two countries, both the countries snapped their cricketing ties. Things got even worse after the 1971 war between the two countries. Pakistan had accused India of aiding militant Bengali separatists in the erstwhile East Pakistan during a civil war there. In December 1971, East Pakistan broke away to become Bangladesh when India entered the war on the side of the separatists. Cricket, whether one likes it or not, is inescapably linked to the turbulent waters that Pak-India relations tread and to suggest ‘keeping politics out of sport’ is to ignore this reality Interestingly, though, both countries continued to compete regularly in international hockey events. But the hockey matches were often politically charged. For example, just a day before their match against India at the 1974 Asian Games, the Pakistan team played loud patriotic songs to irritate their Indian opponents lodged nearby. In 1976, the government of Z.A. Bhutto in Pakistan gave the green light to the country’s cricket board to start talks with the Indian cricket board. The response of the Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi was positive. The two cricket boards met and decided to resume cricket ties by 1978. The ties were revived when India toured Pakistan in late 1978 (after 17 years) — even though, by then, Indira had lost power after the 1977 Indian elections, and the Bhutto regime had been overthrown in a military coup by Gen Ziaul Haq. India-Pakistan relations remained somewhat stable until 1982, when the Indian government — once again headed by Indira — accused Pakistan’s military regime of providing support to Sikh separatists. This did not impact the cricketing ties between the two countries, though. However, in 1984, the Indian team cut short its tour of Pakistan when Indira was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards. By 1986, tensions between the two countries started to mount once again. Both the countries were set to jointly host the 1987 Cricket World Cup. In February 1987, as India began amassing its troops along the Pakistani border, Gen Zia paid an unscheduled visit to New Delhi. Pakistan was still deeply involved in the anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan. The Pakistan cricket team was touring India at the time. Zia’s visit came as a surprise to the Indian PM Rajiv Gandhi. Zia announced he had come to watch a Pakistan-India Test match with the Indian PM. Rajiv, though hesitant at first, obliged. The two did visit the stadium to watch some cricket. But they mostly talked politics. Zia dubbed his trip as a “Cricket for Peace Tour” and managed to defuse tensions between the two countries. Political commentators dubbed this as “cricket diplomacy.” But relations between the two countries began to deteriorate once again in the 1990s. The escalation of militancy in Kashmir led to a sentiment (in India) that bilateral cricketing ties should be avoided. The electoral appeal of Hindu nationalists in India had begun to expand as well. Hindu nationalism is radically anti-Muslim/anti-Pakistan. Even though the two countries played against each other in one day international (ODI) tournaments — including jointly hosting the 1996 World Cup — Test matches between the two came to a standstill. It was only in 1999 — a decade after the 1989-90 Test series — that the two countries once again fully restored cricket ties. In 1999, a Hindu nationalist government was in power but it had decided to stabilise relations with Pakistan — especially at the behest of Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif. It was a tense series. Radical Hindu nationalist organisations were constantly threatening the Pakistani players and, in one case, destroyed the pitch in Delhi on which a Test had to be played. Just months later, war between the two countries erupted in Kargil and Sharif was toppled in a military coup by Gen Pervez Musharraf. Cricket ties between the two countries snapped again. Three years later, relations between India and Pakistan began to stabilise and, once again renewal of cricket ties was used to signal this. In 2003, India toured Pakistan after 15 years. Pakistan toured India in 2005, India returned in 2006, and Pakistan toured India again in 2007. Former Pakistan cricket board chairman and diplomat, the late Shahryar Khan, described this period as one of the most robust years of cricket diplomacy between the two countries. But cricket ties snapped once again after a terrorist attack in Mumbai in 2011. Things got even worse after a more radical Hindu nationalist government came to power in India in 2014 and Pakistan was facing terror attacks from militant Islamists and Baloch separatists. Both countries accused each other of aiding terrorism in their countries. They continued to play against each other in ODI and T20 events on neutral venues, even though Pakistan travelled to India to play the 2023 World Cup. There have been no bilateral Test, ODI and T20 series between the two countries since 2007, except one in 2012 when Pakistan toured India for a short ODI/T20 series. One can also posit that hockey, once a popular sport in both the countries, suffered due to the constant usage of cricket as a tool for political diplomacy. Nevertheless, the possibility of cricket diplomacy has continued to shrink. Politics is inherently mixed with cricket when it comes to Pakistan-India cricket ties. Saying that it shouldn’t is not a practical sentiment. The fact is, one can’t help but mix the two. Therefore, I think the more appropriate thing to suggest would be to mix it in a way that is not detrimental to the game. But, unfortunately, it has become detrimental — not only for cricket in both the countries, but for the larger cricketing world as well. And India can now be pointed out as a leading culprit in this regard. Published in Dawn, EOS, September 21st, 2025",

      "title_orig": "PAKISTAN’s STRUGGLE FOR WOMEN’S RIGHTS",
      "summary_orig": "Over the last two decades, Pakistan has seen major legislative changes in the areas of gender-based violence and harassment. The legislative changes are remarkable in the context of deep patriarchy and parochialism that permeates Pakistan’s society and culture. The legal developments are the product of a combination of factors, not least of which is a strong women’s rights movement that has consistently demanded that the state act to protect and promote the rights of women. A frequent refrain in political and social commentary in Pakistan is that these laws, while transformative on paper, have not translated to actual change in the lives of women and girls because of poor implementation. Widespread incidents of violence against women at the home, workplace and public places persist. Women and girls who approach state institutions, such as police and courts, in the hope of some accountability for violence, confront patriarchal attitudes and corruption and inefficiency of state actors, leading to deep frustration and retraumatisation. Online spaces, where misogynist targeting of women and girls is rampant, amplify their insecurities. Historically, feminism in Pakistan has relied heavily on the power of the law to promote gender justice. For much of Pakistan’s history, feminists formed alliances with state actors and institutions to achieve their goals.  This was, in part, due to the state’s receptivity to demands for progressive laws and policies to promote the status of women. Gen Ziaul Haq’s decade of rule over Pakistan from 1977-88 was an aberration, with long-standing impact. Zia initiated sweeping changes to laws as part of his ‘Islamisation’ campaign, which led to the detention of women on accusations of adultery and fornication, promoted impunity for sexual violence and threatened to demote them to second-class citizens. A women’s rights movement grew in response to Zia’s policies and devoted many years fighting against his regressive changes. From resisting Gen Ziaul Haq’s regressive Hudood laws to having progressive anti-harassment and domestic violence legislation enacted, the women’s rights movement in Pakistan has achieved much. But for countless women, the gulf between the laws on paper and the realities on the ground remains wide. Does the strategy for gender justice need a rethink? Eos presents, with permission, an excerpt from the book Progressive Laws in Patriarchal Societies: Lessons from Pakistan, published by Bloomsbury… The passage of gender progressive laws in recent years marks a dramatic shift in the state’s attitude to women’s rights, compared to Zia’s rule. Years after the passage of some of the gender progressive laws, however, their effective implementation remains a distant goal. Legislatures and some mainstream political parties may have affirmed their faith in gender equality, but pushing state machinery to meaningfully activate legislation is proving to be an immensely difficult task. Given the disjuncture between gender progressive laws on the one hand and the lived experiences of women and girls in Pakistan on the other, the following question should be investigated closely: what are the barriers to enforcement of gender-progressive laws and what can be done to eliminate or, at least, reduce the barriers? This is a crucial question for the women’s rights movement in Pakistan, which has adopted reform of legal frameworks as one of its central aims. While the women’s right movement that grew from the activism against Zia’s rule has premised its work on the assumption that a liberal democratic state will help advance the goal of gender equality, the current scenario casts doubt on the effectiveness of state power, even with gender-progressive laws in place, to meet feminist goals. Assessing the obstacles to implementation is important for women rights activists to understand not only how law reform can be made more meaningful, but also to determine the extent to which they should prioritise law reform advocacy in their work. MAIN ACTORS DRIVING LAW REFORM A key force behind the passage of laws was a women’s rights movement that gained strength over the decades, particularly during the 1980s and beyond. Women legislators in elected parliaments gained strength in numbers after reserved seats were reinstated in 2002 and supported the demands of women’s rights activists. Pronouncements by the judiciary on the state’s responsibility to prevent and punish gender-based violence gave impetus to advocacy for legislative change. These factors led to fertile ground for the enactment of gender-progressive legislation. ACTIVISTS AND NGOS Until the 1980s, women’s rights activism in Pakistan met with a degree of benign accommodation by the state. Following the imposition of discriminatory laws by Zia, women’s rights activists adopted a confrontational stance towards the state and challenged its promotion of patriarchy and its ‘Islamisation’ agenda. Zia notoriously imposed ‘Islamisation’ on laws and policies, and a crucial pillar of his project was to undermine women’s freedom and autonomy.  He openly stated that women’s role should be confined in the home or ‘chadar chaar divari’ [veil and four walls]. He made extensive changes to criminal laws through the Hudood Ordinances. One piece of legislation, the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, took rape provisions outside the Penal Code and placed them in purportedly Shariah-based laws that conflated rape with adultery, with the result that many women, including those who had in fact been raped, faced adultery trials that could lead to the death penalty. His government’s reforms to the Evidence Act 1872, to supposedly bring it in compliance with Shariah [Islamic law], stipulated that, in financial matters, a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s. This change was perceived as state-sponsored discrimination against women and the imposition of second-class status. It was met with strong resistance from women activists who, in February 1983, demonstrated outside the Lahore High Court and were confronted with police brutality, leading to the imprisonment of several women, some of whom went on to become leaders of the women’s movement that played a significant role in the resistance against Zia’s dictatorship. Activists formed the Women’s Action Forum (WAF), a collective that advocated for the reversal of Gen Zia’s regressive legal measures. It comprised women lawyers, journalists and academics and established chapters in cities across the country. Activists in WAF simultaneously established and strengthened non-governmental organisations (NGOs) during the course of the 1980s, which lent institutional support to their advocacy agenda. Shirkat Gah, an NGO formed in 1975-6, became a prominent voice in the struggle against the Zia regime and included activists such as Khawar Mumtaz and Farida Shaheed. The Aurat Foundation was formed in 1986 by Shahla Zia and Nigar Ahmed as a research and advocacy organisation focusing on the rights of women. Over the years, it developed legislative expertise and regularly issued analyses of laws, legal proposals and recommendations for legislative change. Aurat Foundation released a newsletter called Legislative Watch that monitored legislative advocacy and made recommendations for law reform. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan was founded in 1986 by leading lawyers and activists, including Asma Jahangir and Hina Jilani , and became a major force for advocacy for the rights of women and the research and documentation of human rights abuses. With the end of Zia’s regime and the return of elected governments in 1988, the women’s movement pushed for state recognition of women’s equal status and a legal regime that guaranteed the equality of women. The 1990s saw the expansion of a nationally prominent women’s movement and women-led civil society organisations that directly interacted with and confronted state power to demand the repeal of Zia’s laws and the implementation of laws that protect women from patriarchal violence. Western donors and the United Nations provided funding to these organisations, allowing some of them to expand rapidly to major cities across Pakistan. These organisations developed ties to a global human rights community and, in particular, the global women rights movement that achieved crucial gains in the international human rights system through the decades of the ’80s and ’90s. Benazir Bhutto attended the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing. NGOs such as Shirkat Gah and Aurat Foundation participated in the conferences and also worked with the government to prepare conference reports. The Pakistan government signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in 1996 in response to demands from WAF and other NGOs. Leading activists took roles in the United Nations human rights system, which enabled them to strengthen human rights norms globally and also enhanced the credibility of their domestic advocacy. A Women’s Action Forum (WAF) and Punjab Women Lawyers Association march on February 12, 1983 against the Gen Zia regime’s proposed Law of Evidence (which would make the testimony of two women equivalent to that of one man): activists in WAF established and strengthened NGOs during the course of the 1980s | Shirkatgah Women’s Resource Centre Jahangir was appointed a UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial killings and, then, freedom of religion. Jilani was appointed Special Representative to the Secretary General on Human Rights Defenders. NGOs also developed ties to feminists in South Asia, becoming founding members of South Asians for Human Rights (SAHR). Shirkat Gah joined a network of Muslim feminists known as Women Living Under Muslim Laws, to share experiences of women living in Muslim countries and to advocate for law reform. Women’s rights activists and NGOs used their resources to raise awareness around pervasive violence against women during the decade of the 1990s. They led vigorous agitations against the ‘honour’ killings of women, which were reported in the media and highlighted by activists. The case of Samia Sarwar , who was killed by her mother in the law offices of Jilani after Sarwar had left her husband and sought a divorce, received widespread media and international attention. It stoked the flames of outrage against increasing reports of women being murdered with impunity. ‘Honour’ killings were exonerated because of amendments to the Penal Code provisions on murder and assault brought about as a result of Zia’s push to ‘Islamise’ criminal laws. Known as Qisas and Diyat amendments, which were first introduced through an ordinance and then enacted by parliament in 1997, these legal changes made murder a ‘compoundable’ offence — one for which punishment in the form of imprisonment could be avoided if the heirs of the victim agreed to be compensated by the murderer. Activists highlighted incidents of sexual violence and condemned the failure of the state to hold perpetrators accountable for these incidents. The NGO War Against Rape, founded in 1989, publicised incidents of sexual violence and provided aid and legal representation to survivors. Activism through the 1990s led to increased public awareness and societal condemnation of gender-based violence, paving the ground for legislative changes that were to come years later. Activism in Pakistan was fuelled by the international women’s rights movement of the 1990s that made violence against women one of its central advocacy goals. “Violence against women (VAW)” became an established phrase, assuming an important role in the international human rights system. The concept incorporated the recognition that violence in both public and private spheres falls within the human rights obligations of governments. The 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights was a watershed moment for the recognition of women’s rights as human rights. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action that emerged from the conference reflected the recognition that women have the right to be protected from violence in the private sphere. States acknowledged their responsibility to prevent and punish harms caused to women within the family and to address the harmful effects of traditional and customary practices. The UN General Assembly passed a declaration in 1993, soon after the Vienna Convention, that recognised that violence against women “is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women.” The declaration explicitly covered violence occurring in private as well as public life. In 1994, a UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women was appointed who submitted annual reports to the UN General Assembly. These accomplishments of the international women rights movement reinforced the women’s movement in Pakistan against patriarchal violence, which gained strength through the 1990s and the first decade of the 20th century. Activist fervour and donor-funded NGO agendas combined to lay the groundwork for criminal legislation on violence against women. The resistance of activists to gender-based violence and their inclination to hold the government accountable for its inaction met with the rights-based, law-reform-oriented priorities of NGOs, whose agendas were influenced by United Nations’ human rights norms and foreign donor priorities. Resistance to the state, a hallmark of the 1980s activism, was tempered over a period of time to accommodate reformist agendas that found openings with Pakistan’s constitutional and legal framework to address patriarchal violence. Over time, activists and NGOs found allies in political parties and legislatures. A Women’s Parliamentary Caucus (WPC) event taking place on July 18, 2023: the WPC has served as an important forum for discussion and debate on legislation, with civil society organisations also engaging with the caucus | WPC POLITICAL PARTIES AND LEGISLATORS The return of civilian governance in the 1990s did not lead to a reversal of Zia’s regressive laws. Although much hope was placed in the first government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, it did not repeal the Zina Ordinances or discriminatory provisions in Zia’s law of evidence. A former member of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and National Assembly, Dr Shahnaz Wazir Ali, notes that the PPP governments of the 1990s were continuously besieged by the military establishment and aggressive opposition within the parliament. In this environment, Benazir Bhutto and the PPP focused on political survival and could not afford to take on the religious right by repealing laws that were ascribed a religious justification. The two tenures of Benazir Bhutto’s government (1988-1990 and 1993-96) did, however, create space for women activists and NGOs to advocate with legislators and government departments. Bhutto’s participation in the 1994 International Conference on Women and Development and the 1995 Beijing Conference signalled an openness to demands for gender equality and a willingness to engage with activists and NGOs. In her second government, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto formed a Commission on the Inquiry of the Status of Women, which included lawyers and activists Asma Jahangir and Shahla Zia, and was chaired by a Supreme Court judge. The commission released its report in 1997, which gave comprehensive recommendations for political and legal reform in the areas of criminal laws, violence against women, family laws and political participation among others. The recommendations in the area of criminal legislation included the repeal of Zia’s Hudood Ordinances. The commission’s report contained a chapter on the theme of Violence Against Women, which included a recommendation that “[s]pecific legislation on domestic violence by husbands or in-laws should be enacted” and that there “should be no mitigation of any sentence in any case of honour killing.” It also called for a law “making it mandatory for all employers to respond to and monitor incidents of violence and harassment in the workplace.” The report also contained a chapter on ‘Institutionalisation’, which included recommendations on protection measures for persons vulnerable to violation. It called for shelters throughout the country that are “only protective and not custodial or reformatory.” The commission’s inquiry report included a set of recommendations on political participation. It recommended that 33 percent seats in both houses of parliament — the Senate and the National Assembly — be reserved for women, and that women in the reserved seats be elected directly. In 1999, Pakistan’s short-lived experience with elected governments was cut short as another military leader, Gen Pervez Musharraf, came into power in a coup. Musharraf led the country until 2007. Unlike Pakistan’s previous military dictator, Musharraf made some attempts to portray a progressive outlook, including on issues of gender. The most significant institutional reform during Musharraf’s years was the restoration of reserved seats for women in elected bodies. The 1973 Constitution provided five percent reserved seats for women in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies, but this provision lapsed in 1980. Musharraf’s Legal Framework Order of 2001 granted women 33 percent reserved seats at all three tiers of local government, and 17.5 percent in national and provincial legislative bodies. This dramatically increased the representation of women in subsequently elected assemblies. Following the 2002 general elections, more than 70 women became members of the National Assembly. The National Assembly formed after the 2008 general elections had 76 women representatives (60 on reserved seats, and 16 on general seats). National elections held in 2008 marked a return to civilian government, with the PPP emerging victorious in national elections after the assassination of its leader, Benazir Bhutto. The PPP came to power with the most progressive agenda among mainstream parties on the issue of gender. Its origins in populist democracy in the 1970s as well as its leadership by Benazir, the first Muslim woman to lead a Muslim country, are among the factors that contributed to its progressive outlook and rhetoric on gender. The party also formed a government in the province of Sindh. The provincial assemblies acquired greater legislative power following the 18th constitutional amendment in 2010, which devolved more areas of governance from the federal government to the provinces. With a critical mass of women legislators in the assemblies, the momentum for women’s rights and progressive legislation accelerated in the 2008-2013 period. This period also saw the first woman speaker of the National Assembly, Fahmida Mirza , who supported the women legislators in their efforts to bring progressive legislation to the floor.  Women legislators formed cross-party alliances to pass these laws, using the Women Parliamentary Caucus as an important forum for discussion and debate on legislation. Civil society organisations also engaged with the caucus, providing crucial resources and support while lobbying for legislative measures. National and provincial legislatures during this time passed a number of gender-progressive laws, including: the Protection against Harassment of Women in the Workplace Act 2010, the Acid Crime Prevention Act 2011, the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013 and the Sindh Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 2013. This legislation was perceived to be ground-breaking, as it provided legal guarantees to women and girls of state protection against harassment, violence and traditional patriarchal norms in the private sphere of the home and the workplace. The elected National Assembly completed its tenure and elections held in 2013 marked a shift in power to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), led by Nawaz Sharif. During its two tenures in the 1990s, the PML-N was no friend of the women’s movement or its causes. In his second stint in office (1997-99), Nawaz proposed a constitutional amendment that would give the federal government the power to enforce Shariah — a measure that was also strongly opposed by WAF, which saw it as an attempt to extend Zia’s ‘Islamisation’ agenda that would pave the way for more regressive legislation for women. Sharif’s party’s attitude to women’s rights shifted somewhat when he took office in 2013. In 2016, the National Assembly made amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code that strengthened criminal penalties against rape and amended procedures for evidence collection in sexual assault cases. The year 2016 also saw amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code that attempted to restrict the application of Qisas and Diyat provisions in the case of ‘honour’ killings against women — but, unfortunately, the amendments were not effective. In 2016, the PML-N-dominated National Assembly passed the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) , which contained criminal penalties for offending the “modesty of a natural person.” Free speech activists and journalists protested against the law that imposed draconian restrictions on online speech, but it was nonetheless enacted, while being portrayed as a law that would protect women in online spaces. ASSESSING SUCCESS These successes [towards law reform] nonetheless demand critical analysis and thorough assessment. This book attempts to critically assess the success attained by governance feminism in Pakistan in the legal recognition of many forms of violence against women and legislative enactments to introduce new criminal offences, enhance criminal penalties and establish protection mechanisms. By tracing the background momentum that led to these changes, it considers why this particular solution — criminal regulation and accountability — gained more recognition than other potential approaches to tackle violence against women. It looks at how the successes impacted the intended beneficiaries of these gains — women and girls who face patriarchal violence and how they attempted to utilise these legislative gains. It also sheds light on the costs of these gains, costs that may be incurred through both the failures of implementation as well as the successful utilisation of criminal law and processes as well as their failures. Finally, it asks women rights activists in Pakistan who continue to raise concerns about gender-based violence to assess options for future advocacy. While working out how criminal justice-based approaches may be made more effective, they should also consider how approaches outside the criminal justice system may be explored and leveraged. I suggest that these questions be answered not from a standpoint that idealises state power or an opposite perspective that rejects any emancipatory potential of state institutions. In fact, the evidence about the impact of gender-progressive laws illustrates that a superior framework rejects a state/non-state binary. Instead, it identifies elements of state power that can be harnessed to pursue feminist goals, while incorporating emancipatory activism that de-centres the punitive state.

      "summary_en": "Over the last two decades, Pakistan has seen major legislative changes in the areas of gender-based violence and harassment. The legislative changes are remarkable in the context of deep patriarchy and parochialism that permeates Pakistan’s society and culture. The legal developments are the product of a combination of factors, not least of which is a strong women’s rights movement that has consistently demanded that the state act to protect and promote the rights of women. A frequent refrain in political and social commentary in Pakistan is that these laws, while transformative on paper, have not translated to actual change in the lives of women and girls because of poor implementation. Widespread incidents of violence against women at the home, workplace and public places persist. Women and girls who approach state institutions, such as police and courts, in the hope of some accountability for violence, confront patriarchal attitudes and corruption and inefficiency of state actors, leading to deep frustration and retraumatisation. Online spaces, where misogynist targeting of women and girls is rampant, amplify their insecurities. Historically, feminism in Pakistan has relied heavily on the power of the law to promote gender justice. For much of Pakistan’s history, feminists formed alliances with state actors and institutions to achieve their goals.  This was, in part, due to the state’s receptivity to demands for progressive laws and policies to promote the status of women. Gen Ziaul Haq’s decade of rule over Pakistan from 1977-88 was an aberration, with long-standing impact. Zia initiated sweeping changes to laws as part of his ‘Islamisation’ campaign, which led to the detention of women on accusations of adultery and fornication, promoted impunity for sexual violence and threatened to demote them to second-class citizens. A women’s rights movement grew in response to Zia’s policies and devoted many years fighting against his regressive changes. From resisting Gen Ziaul Haq’s regressive Hudood laws to having progressive anti-harassment and domestic violence legislation enacted, the women’s rights movement in Pakistan has achieved much. But for countless women, the gulf between the laws on paper and the realities on the ground remains wide. Does the strategy for gender justice need a rethink? Eos presents, with permission, an excerpt from the book Progressive Laws in Patriarchal Societies: Lessons from Pakistan, published by Bloomsbury… The passage of gender progressive laws in recent years marks a dramatic shift in the state’s attitude to women’s rights, compared to Zia’s rule. Years after the passage of some of the gender progressive laws, however, their effective implementation remains a distant goal. Legislatures and some mainstream political parties may have affirmed their faith in gender equality, but pushing state machinery to meaningfully activate legislation is proving to be an immensely difficult task. Given the disjuncture between gender progressive laws on the one hand and the lived experiences of women and girls in Pakistan on the other, the following question should be investigated closely: what are the barriers to enforcement of gender-progressive laws and what can be done to eliminate or, at least, reduce the barriers? This is a crucial question for the women’s rights movement in Pakistan, which has adopted reform of legal frameworks as one of its central aims. While the women’s right movement that grew from the activism against Zia’s rule has premised its work on the assumption that a liberal democratic state will help advance the goal of gender equality, the current scenario casts doubt on the effectiveness of state power, even with gender-progressive laws in place, to meet feminist goals. Assessing the obstacles to implementation is important for women rights activists to understand not only how law reform can be made more meaningful, but also to determine the extent to which they should prioritise law reform advocacy in their work. MAIN ACTORS DRIVING LAW REFORM A key force behind the passage of laws was a women’s rights movement that gained strength over the decades, particularly during the 1980s and beyond. Women legislators in elected parliaments gained strength in numbers after reserved seats were reinstated in 2002 and supported the demands of women’s rights activists. Pronouncements by the judiciary on the state’s responsibility to prevent and punish gender-based violence gave impetus to advocacy for legislative change.

Activists formed the Women’s Action Forum (WAF), a collective that advocated for the reversal of Gen Zia’s regressive legal measures. It comprised women lawyers, journalists and academics and established chapters in cities across the country. Activists in WAF simultaneously established and strengthened non-governmental organisations (NGOs) during the course of the 1980s, which lent institutional support to their advocacy agenda. Shirkat Gah, an NGO formed in 1975-6, became a prominent voice in the struggle against the Zia regime and included activists such as Khawar Mumtaz and Farida Shaheed. The Aurat Foundation was formed in 1986 by Shahla Zia and Nigar Ahmed as a research and advocacy organisation focusing on the rights of women. Over the years, it developed legislative expertise and regularly issued analyses of laws, legal proposals and recommendations for legislative change. Aurat Foundation released a newsletter called Legislative Watch that monitored legislative advocacy and made recommendations for law reform. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan was founded in 1986 by leading lawyers and activists, including Asma Jahangir and Hina Jilani , and became a major force for advocacy for the rights of women and the research and documentation of human rights abuses. With the end of Zia’s regime and the return of elected governments in 1988, the women’s movement pushed for state recognition of women’s equal status and a legal regime that guaranteed the equality of women. The 1990s saw the expansion of a nationally prominent women’s movement and women-led civil society organisations that directly interacted with and confronted state power to demand the repeal of Zia’s laws and the implementation of laws that protect women from patriarchal violence. Western donors and the United Nations provided funding to these organisations, allowing some of them to expand rapidly to major cities across Pakistan. These organisations developed ties to a global human rights community and, in particular, the global women rights movement that achieved crucial gains in the international human rights system through the decades of the ’80s and ’90s. Benazir Bhutto attended the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing. NGOs such as Shirkat Gah and Aurat Foundation participated in the conferences and also worked with the government to prepare conference reports. The Pakistan government signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in 1996 in response to demands from WAF and other NGOs. Leading activists took roles in the United Nations human rights system, which enabled them to strengthen human rights norms globally and also enhanced the credibility of their domestic advocacy. A Women’s Action Forum (WAF) and Punjab Women Lawyers Association march on February 12, 1983 against the Gen Zia regime’s proposed Law of Evidence (which would make the testimony of two women equivalent to that of one man): activists in WAF established and strengthened NGOs during the course of the 1980s | Shirkatgah Women’s Resource Centre Jahangir was appointed a UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial killings and, then, freedom of religion. Jilani was appointed Special Representative to the Secretary General on Human Rights Defenders. NGOs also developed ties to feminists in South Asia, becoming founding members of South Asians for Human Rights (SAHR). Shirkat Gah joined a network of Muslim feminists known as Women Living Under Muslim Laws, to share experiences of women living in Muslim countries and to advocate for law reform.

A Women’s Parliamentary Caucus (WPC) event taking place on July 18, 2023: the WPC has served as an important forum for discussion and debate on legislation, with civil society organisations also engaging with the caucus | WPC POLITICAL PARTIES AND LEGISLATORS The return of civilian governance in the 1990s did not lead to a reversal of Zia’s regressive laws. Although much hope was placed in the first government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, it did not repeal the Zina Ordinances or discriminatory provisions in Zia’s law of evidence. A former member of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and National Assembly, Dr Shahnaz Wazir Ali, notes that the PPP governments of the 1990s were continuously besieged by the military establishment and aggressive opposition within the parliament. In this environment, Benazir Bhutto and the PPP focused on political survival and could not afford to take on the religious right by repealing laws that were ascribed a religious justification. The two tenures of Benazir Bhutto’s government (1988-1990 and 1993-96) did, however, create space for women activists and NGOs to advocate with legislators and government departments. Bhutto’s participation in the 1994 International Conference on Women and Development and the 1995 Beijing Conference signalled an openness to demands for gender equality and a willingness to engage with activists and NGOs. In her second government, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto formed a Commission on the Inquiry of the Status of Women, which included lawyers and activists Asma Jahangir and Shahla Zia, and was chaired by a Supreme Court judge. The commission released its report in 1997, which gave comprehensive recommendations for political and legal reform in the areas of criminal laws, violence against women, family laws and political participation among others. The recommendations in the area of criminal legislation included the repeal of Zia’s Hudood Ordinances. The commission’s report contained a chapter on the theme of Violence Against Women, which included a recommendation that “[s]pecific legislation on domestic violence by husbands or in-laws should be enacted” and that there “should be no mitigation of any sentence in any case of honour killing.” It also called for a law “making it mandatory for all employers to respond to and monitor incidents of violence and harassment in the workplace.” The report also contained a chapter on ‘Institutionalisation’, which included recommendations on protection measures for persons vulnerable to violation. It called for shelters throughout the country that are “only protective and not custodial or reformatory.” The commission’s inquiry report included a set of recommendations on political participation. It recommended that 33 percent seats in both houses of parliament — the Senate and the National Assembly — be reserved for women, and that women in the reserved seats be elected directly. In 1999, Pakistan’s short-lived experience with elected governments was cut short as another military leader, Gen Pervez Musharraf, came into power in a coup. Musharraf led the country until 2007. Unlike Pakistan’s previous military dictator, Musharraf made some attempts to portray a progressive outlook, including on issues of gender. The most significant institutional reform during Musharraf’s years was the restoration of reserved seats for women in elected bodies. The 1973 Constitution provided five percent reserved seats for women in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies, but this provision lapsed in 1980. Musharraf’s Legal Framework Order of 2001 granted women 33 percent reserved seats at all three tiers of local government, and 17.5 percent in national and provincial legislative bodies. This dramatically increased the representation of women in subsequently elected assemblies. Following the 2002 general elections, more than 70 women became members of the National Assembly. The National Assembly formed after the 2008 general elections had 76 women representatives (60 on reserved seats, and 16 on general seats). National elections held in 2008 marked a return to civilian government, with the PPP emerging victorious in national elections after the assassination of its leader, Benazir Bhutto. The PPP came to power with the most progressive agenda among mainstream parties on the issue of gender. Its origins in populist democracy in the 1970s as well as its leadership by Benazir, the first Muslim woman to lead a Muslim country, are among the factors that contributed to its progressive outlook and rhetoric on gender. The party also formed a government in the province of Sindh. The provincial assemblies acquired greater legislative power following the 18th constitutional amendment in 2010, which devolved more areas of governance from the federal government to the provinces. With a critical mass of women legislators in the assemblies, the momentum for women’s rights and progressive legislation accelerated in the 2008-2013 period. This period also saw the first woman speaker of the National Assembly, Fahmida Mirza , who supported the women legislators in their efforts to bring progressive legislation to the floor.  Women legislators formed cross-party alliances to pass these laws, using the Women Parliamentary Caucus as an important forum for discussion and debate on legislation. Civil society organisations also engaged with the caucus, providing crucial resources and support while lobbying for legislative measures. National and provincial legislatures during this time passed a number of gender-progressive laws, including: the Protection against Harassment of Women in the Workplace Act 2010, the Acid Crime Prevention Act 2011, the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013 and the Sindh Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 2013. This legislation was perceived to be ground-breaking, as it provided legal guarantees to women and girls of state protection against harassment, violence and traditional patriarchal norms in the private sphere of the home and the workplace. The elected National Assembly completed its tenure and elections held in 2013 marked a shift in power to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), led by Nawaz Sharif. During its two tenures in the 1990s, the PML-N was no friend of the women’s movement or its causes. In his second stint in office (1997-99), Nawaz proposed a constitutional amendment that would give the federal government the power to enforce Shariah — a measure that was also strongly opposed by WAF, which saw it as an attempt to extend Zia’s ‘Islamisation’ agenda that would pave the way for more regressive legislation for women. Sharif’s party’s attitude to women’s rights shifted somewhat when he took office in 2013. In 2016, the National Assembly made amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code that strengthened criminal penalties against rape and amended procedures for evidence collection in sexual assault cases. The year 2016 also saw amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code that attempted to restrict the application of Qisas and Diyat provisions in the case of ‘honour’ killings against women — but, unfortunately, the amendments were not effective. In 2016, the PML-N-dominated National Assembly passed the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) , which contained criminal penalties for offending the “modesty of a natural person.” Free speech activists and journalists protested against the law that imposed draconian restrictions on online speech, but it was nonetheless enacted, while being portrayed as a law that would protect women in online spaces. ASSESSING SUCCESS These successes [towards law reform] nonetheless demand critical analysis and thorough assessment. This book attempts to critically assess the success attained by governance feminism in Pakistan in the legal recognition of many forms of violence against women and legislative enactments to introduce new criminal offences, enhance criminal penalties and establish protection mechanisms. By tracing the background momentum that led to these changes, it considers why this particular solution — criminal regulation and accountability — gained more recognition than other potential approaches to tackle violence against women. It looks at how the successes impacted the intended beneficiaries of these gains — women and girls who face patriarchal violence and how they attempted to utilise these legislative gains. It also sheds light on the costs of these gains, costs that may be incurred through both the failures of implementation as well as the successful utilisation of criminal law and processes as well as their failures. Finally, it asks women rights activists in Pakistan who continue to raise concerns about gender-based violence to assess options for future advocacy. While working out how criminal justice-based approaches may be made more effective, they should also consider how approaches outside the criminal justice system may be explored and leveraged. I suggest that these questions be answered not from a standpoint that idealises state power or an opposite perspective that rejects any emancipatory potential of state institutions. In fact, the evidence about the impact of gender-progressive laws illustrates that a superior framework rejects a state/non-state binary. Instead, it identifies elements of state power that can be harnessed to pursue feminist goals, while incorporating emancipatory activism that de-centres the punitive state.

      "title": "PAKISTAN’s STRUGGLE FOR WOMEN’S RIGHTS",
      "summary": "Over the last two decades, Pakistan has seen major legislative changes in the areas of gender-based violence and harassment. The legislative changes are remarkable in the context of deep patriarchy and parochialism that permeates Pakistan’s society and culture. The legal developments are the product of a combination of factors, not least of which is a strong women’s rights movement that has consistently demanded that the state act to protect and promote the rights of women. A frequent refrain in political and social commentary in Pakistan is that these laws, while transformative on paper, have not translated to actual change in the lives of women and girls because of poor implementation. Widespread incidents of violence against women at the home, workplace and public places persist. Women and girls who approach state institutions, such as police and courts, in the hope of some accountability for violence, confront patriarchal attitudes and corruption and inefficiency of state actors, leading to deep frustration and retraumatisation. Online spaces, where misogynist targeting of women and girls is rampant, amplify their insecurities. Historically, feminism in Pakistan has relied heavily on the power of the law to promote gender justice. For much of Pakistan’s history, feminists formed alliances with state actors and institutions to achieve their goals.  This was, in part, due to the state’s receptivity to demands for progressive laws and policies to promote the status of women. Gen Ziaul Haq’s decade of rule over Pakistan from 1977-88 was an aberration, with long-standing impact. Zia initiated sweeping changes to laws as part of his ‘Islamisation’ campaign, which led to the detention of women on accusations of adultery and fornication, promoted impunity for sexual violence and threatened to demote them to second-class citizens. A women’s rights movement grew in response to Zia’s policies and devoted many years fighting against his regressive changes. From resisting Gen Ziaul Haq’s regressive Hudood laws to having progressive anti-harassment and domestic violence legislation enacted, the women’s rights movement in Pakistan has achieved much. But for countless women, the gulf between the laws on paper and the realities on the ground remains wide. Does the strategy for gender justice need a rethink? Eos presents, with permission, an excerpt from the book Progressive Laws in Patriarchal Societies: Lessons from Pakistan, published by Bloomsbury… The passage of gender progressive laws in recent years marks a dramatic shift in the state’s attitude to women’s rights, compared to Zia’s rule. Years after the passage of some of the gender progressive laws, however, their effective implementation remains a distant goal. Legislatures and some mainstream political parties may have affirmed their faith in gender equality, but pushing state machinery to meaningfully activate legislation is proving to be an immensely difficult task. Given the disjuncture between gender progressive laws on the one hand and the lived experiences of women and girls in Pakistan on the other, the following question should be investigated closely: what are the barriers to enforcement of gender-progressive laws and what can be done to eliminate or, at least, reduce the barriers? This is a crucial question for the women’s rights movement in Pakistan, which has adopted reform of legal frameworks as one of its central aims. While the women’s right movement that grew from the activism against Zia’s rule has premised its work on the assumption that a liberal democratic state will help advance the goal of gender equality, the current scenario casts doubt on the effectiveness of state power, even with gender-progressive laws in place, to meet feminist goals. Assessing the obstacles to implementation is important for women rights activists to understand not only how law reform can be made more meaningful, but also to determine the extent to which they should prioritise law reform advocacy in their work. MAIN ACTORS DRIVING LAW REFORM A key force behind the passage of laws was a women’s rights movement that gained strength over the decades, particularly during the 1980s and beyond. Women legislators in elected parliaments gained strength in numbers after reserved seats were reinstated in 2002 and supported the demands of women’s rights activists. Pronouncements by the judiciary on the state’s responsibility to prevent and punish gender-based violence gave impetus to advocacy for legislative change. These factors led to fertile ground for the enactment of gender-progressive legislation. ACTIVISTS AND NGOS Until the 1980s, women’s rights activism in Pakistan met with a degree of benign accommodation by the state. Following the imposition of discriminatory laws by Zia, women’s rights activists adopted a confrontational stance towards the state and challenged its promotion of patriarchy and its ‘Islamisation’ agenda. Zia notoriously imposed ‘Islamisation’ on laws and policies, and a crucial pillar of his project was to undermine women’s freedom and autonomy.  He openly stated that women’s role should be confined in the home or ‘chadar chaar divari’ [veil and four walls]. He made extensive changes to criminal laws through the Hudood Ordinances. One piece of legislation, the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, took rape provisions outside the Penal Code and placed them in purportedly Shariah-based laws that conflated rape with adultery, with the result that many women, including those who had in fact been raped, faced adultery trials that could lead to the death penalty. His government’s reforms to the Evidence Act 1872, to supposedly bring it in compliance with Shariah [Islamic law], stipulated that, in financial matters, a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s. This change was perceived as state-sponsored discrimination against women and the imposition of second-class status. It was met with strong resistance from women activists who, in February 1983, demonstrated outside the Lahore High Court and were confronted with police brutality, leading to the imprisonment of several women, some of whom went on to become leaders of the women’s movement that played a significant role in the resistance against Zia’s dictatorship. Activists formed the Women’s Action Forum (WAF), a collective that advocated for the reversal of Gen Zia’s regressive legal measures. It comprised women lawyers, journalists and academics and established chapters in cities across the country. Activists in WAF simultaneously established and strengthened non-governmental organisations (NGOs) during the course of the 1980s, which lent institutional support to their advocacy agenda. Shirkat Gah, an NGO formed in 1975-6, became a prominent voice in the struggle against the Zia regime and included activists such as Khawar Mumtaz and Farida Shaheed. The Aurat Foundation was formed in 1986 by Shahla Zia and Nigar Ahmed as a research and advocacy organisation focusing on the rights of women. Over the years, it developed legislative expertise and regularly issued analyses of laws, legal proposals and recommendations for legislative change. Aurat Foundation released a newsletter called Legislative Watch that monitored legislative advocacy and made recommendations for law reform. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan was founded in 1986 by leading lawyers and activists, including Asma Jahangir and Hina Jilani , and became a major force for advocacy for the rights of women and the research and documentation of human rights abuses. With the end of Zia’s regime and the return of elected governments in 1988, the women’s movement pushed for state recognition of women’s equal status and a legal regime that guaranteed the equality of women. The 1990s saw the expansion of a nationally prominent women’s movement and women-led civil society organisations that directly interacted with and confronted state power to demand the repeal of Zia’s laws and the implementation of laws that protect women from patriarchal violence. Western donors and the United Nations provided funding to these organisations, allowing some of them to expand rapidly to major cities across Pakistan. These organisations developed ties to a global human rights community and, in particular, the global women rights movement that achieved crucial gains in the international human rights system through the decades of the ’80s and ’90s. Benazir Bhutto attended the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing. NGOs such as Shirkat Gah and Aurat Foundation participated in the conferences and also worked with the government to prepare conference reports. The Pakistan government signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in 1996 in response to demands from WAF and other NGOs. Leading activists took roles in the United Nations human rights system, which enabled them to strengthen human rights norms globally and also enhanced the credibility of their domestic advocacy. A Women’s Action Forum (WAF) and Punjab Women Lawyers Association march on February 12, 1983 against the Gen Zia regime’s proposed Law of Evidence (which would make the testimony of two women equivalent to that of one man): activists in WAF established and strengthened NGOs during the course of the 1980s | Shirkatgah Women’s Resource Centre Jahangir was appointed a UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial killings and, then, freedom of religion. Jilani was appointed Special Representative to the Secretary General on Human Rights Defenders. NGOs also developed ties to feminists in South Asia, becoming founding members of South Asians for Human Rights (SAHR). Shirkat Gah joined a network of Muslim feminists known as Women Living Under Muslim Laws, to share experiences of women living in Muslim countries and to advocate for law reform. Women’s rights activists and NGOs used their resources to raise awareness around pervasive violence against women during the decade of the 1990s. They led vigorous agitations against the ‘honour’ killings of women, which were reported in the media and highlighted by activists. The case of Samia Sarwar , who was killed by her mother in the law offices of Jilani after Sarwar had left her husband and sought a divorce, received widespread media and international attention. It stoked the flames of outrage against increasing reports of women being murdered with impunity. ‘Honour’ killings were exonerated because of amendments to the Penal Code provisions on murder and assault brought about as a result of Zia’s push to ‘Islamise’ criminal laws. Known as Qisas and Diyat amendments, which were first introduced through an ordinance and then enacted by parliament in 1997, these legal changes made murder a ‘compoundable’ offence — one for which punishment in the form of imprisonment could be avoided if the heirs of the victim agreed to be compensated by the murderer. Activists highlighted incidents of sexual violence and condemned the failure of the state to hold perpetrators accountable for these incidents. The NGO War Against Rape, founded in 1989, publicised incidents of sexual violence and provided aid and legal representation to survivors. Activism through the 1990s led to increased public awareness and societal condemnation of gender-based violence, paving the ground for legislative changes that were to come years later. Activism in Pakistan was fuelled by the international women’s rights movement of the 1990s that made violence against women one of its central advocacy goals. “Violence against women (VAW)” became an established phrase, assuming an important role in the international human rights system. The concept incorporated the recognition that violence in both public and private spheres falls within the human rights obligations of governments. The 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights was a watershed moment for the recognition of women’s rights as human rights. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action that emerged from the conference reflected the recognition that women have the right to be protected from violence in the private sphere. States acknowledged their responsibility to prevent and punish harms caused to women within the family and to address the harmful effects of traditional and customary practices. The UN General Assembly passed a declaration in 1993, soon after the Vienna Convention, that recognised that violence against women “is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women.” The declaration explicitly covered violence occurring in private as well as public life. In 1994, a UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women was appointed who submitted annual reports to the UN General Assembly. These accomplishments of the international women rights movement reinforced the women’s movement in Pakistan against patriarchal violence, which gained strength through the 1990s and the first decade of the 20th century. Activist fervour and donor-funded NGO agendas combined to lay the groundwork for criminal legislation on violence against women. The resistance of activists to gender-based violence and their inclination to hold the government accountable for its inaction met with the rights-based, law-reform-oriented priorities of NGOs, whose agendas were influenced by United Nations’ human rights norms and foreign donor priorities. Resistance to the state, a hallmark of the 1980s activism, was tempered over a period of time to accommodate reformist agendas that found openings with Pakistan’s constitutional and legal framework to address patriarchal violence. Over time, activists and NGOs found allies in political parties and legislatures. A Women’s Parliamentary Caucus (WPC) event taking place on July 18, 2023: the WPC has served as an important forum for discussion and debate on legislation, with civil society organisations also engaging with the caucus | WPC POLITICAL PARTIES AND LEGISLATORS The return of civilian governance in the 1990s did not lead to a reversal of Zia’s regressive laws. Although much hope was placed in the first government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, it did not repeal the Zina Ordinances or discriminatory provisions in Zia’s law of evidence. A former member of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and National Assembly, Dr Shahnaz Wazir Ali, notes that the PPP governments of the 1990s were continuously besieged by the military establishment and aggressive opposition within the parliament. In this environment, Benazir Bhutto and the PPP focused on political survival and could not afford to take on the religious right by repealing laws that were ascribed a religious justification. The two tenures of Benazir Bhutto’s government (1988-1990 and 1993-96) did, however, create space for women activists and NGOs to advocate with legislators and government departments. Bhutto’s participation in the 1994 International Conference on Women and Development and the 1995 Beijing Conference signalled an openness to demands for gender equality and a willingness to engage with activists and NGOs. In her second government, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto formed a Commission on the Inquiry of the Status of Women, which included lawyers and activists Asma Jahangir and Shahla Zia, and was chaired by a Supreme Court judge. The commission released its report in 1997, which gave comprehensive recommendations for political and legal reform in the areas of criminal laws, violence against women, family laws and political participation among others. The recommendations in the area of criminal legislation included the repeal of Zia’s Hudood Ordinances. The commission’s report contained a chapter on the theme of Violence Against Women, which included a recommendation that “[s]pecific legislation on domestic violence by husbands or in-laws should be enacted” and that there “should be no mitigation of any sentence in any case of honour killing.” It also called for a law “making it mandatory for all employers to respond to and monitor incidents of violence and harassment in the workplace.” The report also contained a chapter on ‘Institutionalisation’, which included recommendations on protection measures for persons vulnerable to violation. It called for shelters throughout the country that are “only protective and not custodial or reformatory.” The commission’s inquiry report included a set of recommendations on political participation. It recommended that 33 percent seats in both houses of parliament — the Senate and the National Assembly — be reserved for women, and that women in the reserved seats be elected directly. In 1999, Pakistan’s short-lived experience with elected governments was cut short as another military leader, Gen Pervez Musharraf, came into power in a coup. Musharraf led the country until 2007. Unlike Pakistan’s previous military dictator, Musharraf made some attempts to portray a progressive outlook, including on issues of gender. The most significant institutional reform during Musharraf’s years was the restoration of reserved seats for women in elected bodies. The 1973 Constitution provided five percent reserved seats for women in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies, but this provision lapsed in 1980. Musharraf’s Legal Framework Order of 2001 granted women 33 percent reserved seats at all three tiers of local government, and 17.5 percent in national and provincial legislative bodies. This dramatically increased the representation of women in subsequently elected assemblies. Following the 2002 general elections, more than 70 women became members of the National Assembly. The National Assembly formed after the 2008 general elections had 76 women representatives (60 on reserved seats, and 16 on general seats). National elections held in 2008 marked a return to civilian government, with the PPP emerging victorious in national elections after the assassination of its leader, Benazir Bhutto. The PPP came to power with the most progressive agenda among mainstream parties on the issue of gender. Its origins in populist democracy in the 1970s as well as its leadership by Benazir, the first Muslim woman to lead a Muslim country, are among the factors that contributed to its progressive outlook and rhetoric on gender. The party also formed a government in the province of Sindh. The provincial assemblies acquired greater legislative power following the 18th constitutional amendment in 2010, which devolved more areas of governance from the federal government to the provinces. With a critical mass of women legislators in the assemblies, the momentum for women’s rights and progressive legislation accelerated in the 2008-2013 period. This period also saw the first woman speaker of the National Assembly, Fahmida Mirza , who supported the women legislators in their efforts to bring progressive legislation to the floor.  Women legislators formed cross-party alliances to pass these laws, using the Women Parliamentary Caucus as an important forum for discussion and debate on legislation. Civil society organisations also engaged with the caucus, providing crucial resources and support while lobbying for legislative measures. National and provincial legislatures during this time passed a number of gender-progressive laws, including: the Protection against Harassment of Women in the Workplace Act 2010, the Acid Crime Prevention Act 2011, the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013 and the Sindh Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 2013. This legislation was perceived to be ground-breaking, as it provided legal guarantees to women and girls of state protection against harassment, violence and traditional patriarchal norms in the private sphere of the home and the workplace. The elected National Assembly completed its tenure and elections held in 2013 marked a shift in power to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), led by Nawaz Sharif. During its two tenures in the 1990s, the PML-N was no friend of the women’s movement or its causes. In his second stint in office (1997-99), Nawaz proposed a constitutional amendment that would give the federal government the power to enforce Shariah — a measure that was also strongly opposed by WAF, which saw it as an attempt to extend Zia’s ‘Islamisation’ agenda that would pave the way for more regressive legislation for women. Sharif’s party’s attitude to women’s rights shifted somewhat when he took office in 2013. In 2016, the National Assembly made amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code that strengthened criminal penalties against rape and amended procedures for evidence collection in sexual assault cases. The year 2016 also saw amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code that attempted to restrict the application of Qisas and Diyat provisions in the case of ‘honour’ killings against women — but, unfortunately, the amendments were not effective. In 2016, the PML-N-dominated National Assembly passed the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) , which contained criminal penalties for offending the “modesty of a natural person.” Free speech activists and journalists protested against the law that imposed draconian restrictions on online speech, but it was nonetheless enacted, while being portrayed as a law that would protect women in online spaces. ASSESSING SUCCESS These successes [towards law reform] nonetheless demand critical analysis and thorough assessment. This book attempts to critically assess the success attained by governance feminism in Pakistan in the legal recognition of many forms of violence against women and legislative enactments to introduce new criminal offences, enhance criminal penalties and establish protection mechanisms. By tracing the background momentum that led to these changes, it considers why this particular solution — criminal regulation and accountability — gained more recognition than other potential approaches to tackle violence against women. It looks at how the successes impacted the intended beneficiaries of these gains — women and girls who face patriarchal violence and how they attempted to utilise these legislative gains. It also sheds light on the costs of these gains, costs that may be incurred through both the failures of implementation as well as the successful utilisation of criminal law and processes as well as their failures. Finally, it asks women rights activists in Pakistan who continue to raise concerns about gender-based violence to assess options for future advocacy. While working out how criminal justice-based approaches may be made more effective, they should also consider how approaches outside the criminal justice system may be explored and leveraged. I suggest that these questions be answered not from a standpoint that idealises state power or an opposite perspective that rejects any emancipatory potential of state institutions. In fact, the evidence about the impact of gender-progressive laws illustrates that a superior framework rejects a state/non-state binary. Instead, it identifies elements of state power that can be harnessed to pursue feminist goals, while incorporating emancipatory activism that de-centres the punitive state.

We were driving to Leeds, UK, for a family commitment. It is about 2,300 kilometres away from where we live in Javea, Spain, a small town on the Mediterranean coast, midway between Valencia and Alicante. In my relatively younger days, we thought nothing of driving a thousand kilometres in a day. But now, in my not-so-young days, my family does not agree to any plan that involves such long drives. We drive about 600 km at most and make night stops after being on the road for no more than six to seven hours. Our night stops decided, accommodation booked, we thought we’d be happily on our way. But the French had other ideas. They vehemently safeguard their rights and, despite voting in a Conservative president committed to curtailing public expenditure, resent any cuts that impact their lives, healthcare plans, pensions, retirement age, to name just a few. So, when their government presented a plan in parliament aimed at addressing what it said was a 44 billion-euro hole in the finances, the first casualty was the prime minister, who was voted out — not the same significance as in our parliamentary democracy, because France’s president is all-powerful, with the power to appoint one prime minister after another, which he promptly did. America’s unconditional support to Israel is forcing a rethink in the Middle East and beyond. An impromptu strike call was given by some parties and unions last week, which was partially successful. Then, this past Thursday, all the main unions joined in the strike call and pledged to shut down the country. Since our arrival date was not flexible and neither was our departure, we decided to drive from our home in Spain to Clermont Ferrand in France, a distance of 1,100 km because we could not take the chance of being stranded due to the strike at our original night stop in Perpignan, just across the border from Spain — a town where Spaniards used to drive to watch films which the censors would block during the Franco dictatorship in their country. Our amended plan meant staying two nights in Clermont Ferrand, which is home to the famous Michelin Tyres with a huge manufacturing unit and research laboratory situated here. Our drive took us through the picturesque Massif Central via the Norman Foster-designed Millau Viaduct (the world’s tallest bridge), which we saw being constructed when we first drove through the area in 1995. We stayed at one of the motorway (called autoroute in France) hotels for two nights. After the 10-hour, 1,100 km drive, when we finally got to the room, a shattered me received my good friend and Dawn Magazines editor Hasan Zaidi’s ‘this is huge’ WhatsApp message, sharing a link, carrying the story of Pakistan’s mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia. For as long as I can remember, the two nations have had very close defence ties, with Pakistani troops based in Saudi Arabia in the past for not just training their army but also acting as a reserve force in an internal security role. Even then, I have never read anything nearly as categorical as “an attack on one will be considered an attack on both”. After Chinese mediation in recent years led to not just de-escalation in tensions between traditional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, but also declarations of brotherhood, this defence accord can’t really be directed at Tehran. In fact, it followed Israel’s missile attack on Qatari soil, apparently targeting the Hamas negotiating team said to be discussing a US proposal for hostage release and ceasefire in Gaza. Israel remained unapologetic and said it would again target its enemies wherever they were. The attack seems to have brought home the realisation to the Arab Gulf leaders that the security umbrella the US extends to their states excludes protection from Israeli aggression as a totally different set of standards govern the conduct of the genocidal apartheid state. “Pakistani military might, Saudi financial heft to redraw Gulf security map,” read the six-colu­­mn headline in The News , summing up the developm­ent. Whether the Gulf security map would be re­­drawn via this agreement will become clearer when the details emerge. But it has been signal­led that Saudi security won’t rely on a single sou­r­­ce, which proved unreliable in Qatar’s case. Qa­­tar was attacked despite being home to the US Ce­­ntral Command’s largest base in the Middle East. Even the details, if made public, are unlikely to shed light on, for example, a nuclear umbrella for the kingdom. Equally, many Pakistanis would be keen to find out what kind of response the next possible aggression from India on our soil would evoke from Saudi Arabia. India is Saudi Arabia’s second-largest trading partner, while Saudi Arabia is India’s fifth.  Riyadh has pledged tens of billions of dollars in investment in India. But America’s unconditional support to Israel is forcing a rethink not just in the Middle East ; it is leading to realignments beyond as well. Who knows if the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s collective or indivisible security may,  in the end, appear more appealing to the wealthy Arab Gulf states than reliance on the US, which has shown it supports Israeli ambitions at the expense of other allies, including those in the Gulf. In fact, when the Muslim leaders’ emergency meeting in Qatar was calling upon the US to exerc­ise its influence over Israel for a ceasefire in Gaza, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was inaugurating the excavation of a tunnel (an ‘archaeological site’) which will end near the Al Aqsa Mosque and for which many Palestinians have been forcibly evicted from their homes in Jerusalem. Against this backdrop, the US-end­orsed Gaza genocide continues, billions around the world who oppose it are powerless to stop it.

      "summary_orig": "JERUSALEM: Israel’s military kept up its assault on Gaza City and the wider Gaza Strip on Saturday, dismantling underground shafts and booby-trapped structures in attacks that left 87 Palestinians dead, 70 of them in Gaza City. The civil defence agency said 11 were killed when warplanes struck the Dughmush family in the city’s Al-Sabra neighbourhood. The assault came as 10 countries including Australia, Belgium, Britain and Canada are scheduled to formally recognise an independent Palestinian state on Monday, ahead of the annual gathering at the UN General Assembly. Israel’s intensified military demolition campaign targeting high-rise buildings in Gaza City began this week alongside a ground assault. Its forces, which control Gaza City’s eastern suburbs, have in recent days been pounding the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al Hawa areas from where they would be positioned to advance on central and western parts of the city, where most of the population is sheltering. Hamas warns lives of Israeli prisoners are in danger due to massive bombardment Israel’s military estimates it has demolished up to 20 tower blocks over the past two weeks and believes some 350,000 people have left Gaza City since the start of this month. Another 600,000 or so remain, however. Included in that tally are some of the Israeli prisoners being held by Hamas. The group’s military wing released an image of the prisoners on Telegram on Saturday, warning that their lives were at risk due to Israel’s military operation in Gaza City. In almost two years of fighting, Israel’s bombardment has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, spread famine, demolished most structures and displaced most of the population, in many cases multiple times. Israel says the “war will end only if Hamas surrenders”, frees Israeli prisoners, disarms and disbands. Hamas says it will not disarm until a Palestinian state is established. A total of 48 of the 251 Israelis taken prisoner on Oct 7, 2023, are yet to be released, but 28 are thought to be dead. Hospital director traumatised As Israel presses on with its offensive to capture the territory’s largest urban centre, Palestinians are going through unimaginable trauma. The director of Al Shifa hospital was shocked and devastated when two victims killed in a strike were delivered to his ward: his brother and sister-in-law. “I was shocked and devastated to see the bodies of my brother and his wife,” said Mohammed Abu Salmiya, who was working in the emergency department of the territory’s main hospital at the time. “Anything is possible now, as you receive your dearest ones as martyrs or wounded,” he said. “The occupation’s crimes continue, and the number of martyrs keeps rising.” A journalist saw ambulances with sirens blaring into the hospital compound, bringing more bodies of people killed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza City.

      "summary_orig": "• Price control secretary says geotagging, verification of wheat stock decided for proactive planning; defends inter-provincial curbs to ensure ample supply • Mills barred from using wheat for manufacturing poultry feed LAHORE: The Punjab government has stepped up measures, including geotagging of stocks, to avert a potential wheat crisis in the province after floods in the eastern rivers washed away farmlands and destroyed stockpiles in its central districts. The move comes amid restrictions on the interprovincial movement of the commodity by the provincial government, which has raised prices in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by up to 68 per cent, also prompting protests by Sindh and KP. Sources told Dawn that the decision to restrict the wheat trade was taken to ensure an ample supply of the grain in the province and to avert a looming crisis. Besides this measure, the Punjab Price Control and Commodities Management also decided to start geotagging and physically verifying wheat stocks in warehouses across the province. Its secretary Dr Kiran Khurshid notified a four-member departmental monitoring committee led by Deputy Secretary Shazia Rehman to collect data from all districts in collaboration with the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) and the food directorate. Through this practice, the wheat stocks stored in government and private warehouses will be registered to meet the food crisis feared in the aftermath of the floods. Dr Khurshid said her department would implement the government policy to avert the unpredictable and unforeseen crisis post-floods. She said people had lost massive wheat stocks in the recent floods and now it was the government’s responsibility to take care of its citizens. She said the price control and commodities department was geotagging wheat warehouses to gather information about the actual stocks and resources for predictive analysis and anticipative planning. “The geotagging is just an intervention, not a solution,” she said, adding that it would take time to trace wheat. She said the department had established a strategic management wing (SWM) to digitise the department’s assets, resources and activities of the department’s eight directorates. “All the scattered information would be available for the department and higher authorities in one dashboard for monitoring and taking informed decisions,” she said. The Punjab Home Department, at the request of the price control department, had also imposed Section 144 and prohibited the mills in the province from using 10,184 metric tonnes of wheat for feed manufacturing. Interprovincial curbs Sources said the provincial government was keeping a strict check on the movement of wheat at the exit points of the province. They claimed that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had made it clear that her foremost duty was to stave off a food crisis in her province and ensure that the citizens got their due wheat share through government packages or other means. She had also been quoted as saying that some four million people had been affected by floods and the executive machinery needed to ensure the availability of wheat for the flood survivors. The price control secretary, Dr Khurshid, also acknowledged that Punjab was monitoring the wheat movement at the Sindh and KP borders because “businessmen would always like to sell their commodities, where they would get a better price”. “In this situation, the government’s role is to ensure that wheat stocks in the province meet the needs of its people. It will be insane if the government lets its wheat go to other provinces at a lower price and later purchase it at a higher cost for its own people,” Dr Khurshid said. It may be mentioned that the government had not purchased wheat and there were no hefty stocks in government warehouses. Meanwhile, the department arrested 107 profiteers, fined 12,043 profiteers, and registered cases against seven individuals. In the matter of over-charging in wheat flour prices, the department officials arrested 18 officials, registered cases against four individuals and fined 1,074 persons. In a crackdown on hoarders, the department has already recovered 334,000 metric tonnes of wheat across the province. These measures helped increase wheat stocks in flour mills by 165,000 metric tonnes this month alone. Additionally, the grinding of 360,000 metric tonnes of wheat has ensured a steady supply of flour and brought down wheat prices from Rs3,800 to Rs3,000 per 40kg.

      "title_orig": "Female camel tortured for ‘destroying crops’ in Sukkur handed over to Karachi shelter",
      "summary_orig": "A female camel, tortured allegedly by a landowner in Sukkur, was handed over to a private animal shelter in Karachi on Saturday, officials said. A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Sukkur’s Kandhra police station under sections 114 (abettor present), 428 (mischief by killing or maiming animal with value of Rs10 or more), 429 (killing or maiming cattle, etc, of any value), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the complaint of Ghulam Mustafa. The incident took place at 2pm yesterday, according to the FIR, wherein three suspects were nominated. According to the complainant, when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond on the land, one of the suspects hit one of them with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor. The complainant said he kept pleading with the suspects to spare the camel, but they did not listen. According to the FIR, the suspects reacted angrily, saying that the camel had destroyed crops. Sukkur Senior Superintendent of Police Azhar Mughal said while speaking to the media that police had arrested two of the suspects. This was also confirmed in a post on X by the  Sindh Chief Minister House’s official account. It said that police had so far arrested two suspects and the hunt for a third suspect was under way. The statement also condemned the “the gruesome” attack, adding that the CM had ordered strict action against the culprits. On the CM Murad Ali Shah’s directive, Sukkur District Council Chairman Syed Kumail Hyder Shah was “supervising” the injured camel’s treatment, it added. Kumail Shah also posted about the incident on X, saying: “Heartbreaking to witness such cruelty against a helpless camel in Rohri. “I’ve personally spoken to the owner, the wounded camel has been shifted to Karachi for immediate treatment. No animal should ever suffer such cruelty, every life, human or voiceless, deserves compassion and care.” Separately, Sukkur Commissioner Abid Saleem told Dawn.com on the phone that the camel was shifted to Karachi after coordination with a private sector organisation that deals with such cases of injuries. He said the camel would undergo surgery on its leg, adding that she had also sustained injuries on her jaw. Meanwhile, the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) Benji Project for Animal Welfare in Karachi, which had helped another mutilated camel stand back with a prosthetic leg, said earlier today that its veterinary doctors would examine the camel. “On Friday, September 19, a two-year-old female camel suffered unspeakable abuse in Sukkur. She had wandered onto land in search of water, where the landowner viciously broke her leg and then dragged her with a tractor,” the CDRS project wrote in a post on Instagram. The organisation said it “immediately began coordinating with the Government of Sindh to rescue her”, adding that it was extremely grateful to Faryal Talpur, Sukkur MPA Awaiz Shah and MPA Sumeta Syed “for their efforts in helping us secure this camel […] and for so vehemently taking action”. “Once our vets have examined her properly, we will share an update,” CDRS said, affirming that its team will try its “very best to give her love, comfort, and some semblance of peace”. View this post on Instagram “There are no words left to explain the cruelty we continue to see. It is unimaginably painful to witness these beautiful, voiceless beings — created in such perfection and innocence — suffering at the hands of humans who were meant to protect them. All we can do is keep standing up for them and take one day at a time,” CDRS wrote. A statement from CM Shah’s office said the camel was moved to the CDRS shelter and named “Sumi”. It added that as per the shelter administration, her leg was crushed, jaw was broken, tongue was burnt and there were serious injuries on her body. The chief minister was told that she could not eat and was being administered intravenous fluids. “On the instructions of the Sindh CM, Livestock Secretary Kazim Jatoi has been entrusted with the responsibility of providing the best treatment for Sumi,” the statement said. The shelter posted various videos on its Facebook page of the treatment being provided to her. The recent incident bears similarity to that of Cammie, a camel who had her front leg chopped off allegedly by a landlord in June 2024 as punishment for foraging in his field for fodder. She was taken in by the CDRS Benji Project, where she got her prosthetic leg in July and is still in care . Additional reporting by Imtiaz Ali.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Saturday cancelled their pre-match press conference ahead of their second encounter with India in the men’s Asia Cup tomorrow, according to a statement by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). “Pakistan will not be holding their pre-match press conference today,” ACC said in a short statement. Andy Pycroft will be officiating the match as the referee again after last week’s controversy . A senior Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official confirmed to Dawn.com that the board had moved on after Pycroft’s ‘ apology ’ and had no issue with his appointment for the Pakistan-India match. The Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday ended on a bitter note when Indian players refused to shake hands with their opponents. It was the first meeting between the regional neighbours since a four-day conflict in May left more than 70 people dead. While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end. Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country. PCB called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Yadav before the match. Pakistan’s last group game — which they won easily against the United Arab Emirates — was delayed for an hour due to the stand-off before the matter was resolved with Pycroft’s apology. Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for Sunday’s clash. India won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively. Ramiz Raja says Pakistan need to ‘reset’ strategy Former PCB chairperson Ramiz Raja said Pakistan “need to reset their strategy as it’s not working out.” Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan , “This strategy, which is akin to a sparkler that fizzles out quickly, is not working out at all,” the former Pakistan men’s captain said. The team needs to get to a 150+ score first, Ramiz said, adding that the over-reliance on all-rounders was not the way to go. “If Saim Ayub or Hassan Nawaz are critical players and if they fire tomorrow, then I see Pakistan competing with India,” Ramiz said. He also said that the dot-ball percentage needed to go down for the Green Shirts. Speaking on the Indian team’s refusal to shake hands, he said, “Who resorts to things like this in this day and age?” PCB chairperson Mohsin Naqvi also met the team ahead of the Pakistan-India clash in Dubai.

      "title_orig": "Pentagon imposes new restrictions on US media",
      "summary_orig": "The Pentagon has unveiled new restrictions on United States’s media covering American military, requiring them to pledge not to disclose anything not formally authorised for publication and limiting their movements within the Department of War. The new guidelines, laid out in a lengthy memo distributed to reporters on Friday, require them to sign an affidavit promising to comply, or risk losing their media credentials. The move is the latest by the administration of President Donald Trump to control media coverage of his policies, after he suggested that negative stories could be “illegal.” The Pentagon “remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust,” the memo says. But it adds: “Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorising official before it is released, even if it is unclassified”, effectively barring material sourced to unnamed officials. This new restriction would apply to both classified and “controlled unclassified information.” The memo also details sweeping new restrictions on where Pentagon reporters can actually go without official escorts within the military’s vast headquarters just outside Washington. “The ‘press’ does not run the Pentagon — the people do,” Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. “The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules — or go home.” The new rules come months after Hegseth faced stark criticism for revealing timings of US air strikes on Yemen’s Houthis in a Signal group chat that inadvertently included a reporter. Hegseth, a former Fox News co-host and Army National Guard veteran, was also reported to have shared those details in a separate Signal group chain that included his wife. A spokesperson for The New York Times — a frequent target of Trump’s ire — called the new rules “yet another step in a concerning pattern of reducing access to what the US military is undertaking at taxpayer expense.” National Press Club President Mike Balsamo hit out at the new rules, and called on the Pentagon to quickly rescind them. “If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting,” Balsamo said in a statement. “It is getting only what officials want them to see. That should alarm every American.” Trump terms his negative media coverage ‘illegal’ A day prior, Trump bashed US media coverage that he claimed was unduly negative and therefore “illegal,” stoking a debate over free speech following the suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s TV show by ABC . “They’ll take a great story and they’ll make it bad. See, I think it’s really illegal, personally,” Trump, who has sued multiple major news organisations this year, told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. The 79-year-old Republican, an avid television watcher, chiefly focused his diatribe on US television networks, reiterating a claim that coverage of him and his administration is “97 per cent bad”. He also defended the head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, whose threats against broadcasters have sparked a national debate over free speech and caused some unease even among Republicans. Carr on Wednesday criticised Kimmel’s remarks on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and threatened broadcasters who carry his show with possible sanctions.

      "summary_en": "The Pentagon has unveiled new restrictions on United States’s media covering American military, requiring them to pledge not to disclose anything not formally authorised for publication and limiting their movements within the Department of War. The new guidelines, laid out in a lengthy memo distributed to reporters on Friday, require them to sign an affidavit promising to comply, or risk losing their media credentials. The move is the latest by the administration of President Donald Trump to control media coverage of his policies, after he suggested that negative stories could be “illegal.” The Pentagon “remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust,” the memo says. But it adds: “Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorising official before it is released, even if it is unclassified”, effectively barring material sourced to unnamed officials. This new restriction would apply to both classified and “controlled unclassified information.” The memo also details sweeping new restrictions on where Pentagon reporters can actually go without official escorts within the military’s vast headquarters just outside Washington. “The ‘press’ does not run the Pentagon — the people do,” Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. “The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules — or go home.” The new rules come months after Hegseth faced stark criticism for revealing timings of US air strikes on Yemen’s Houthis in a Signal group chat that inadvertently included a reporter. Hegseth, a former Fox News co-host and Army National Guard veteran, was also reported to have shared those details in a separate Signal group chain that included his wife. A spokesperson for The New York Times — a frequent target of Trump’s ire — called the new rules “yet another step in a concerning pattern of reducing access to what the US military is undertaking at taxpayer expense.” National Press Club President Mike Balsamo hit out at the new rules, and called on the Pentagon to quickly rescind them. “If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting,” Balsamo said in a statement. “It is getting only what officials want them to see. That should alarm every American.” Trump terms his negative media coverage ‘illegal’ A day prior, Trump bashed US media coverage that he claimed was unduly negative and therefore “illegal,” stoking a debate over free speech following the suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s TV show by ABC . “They’ll take a great story and they’ll make it bad. See, I think it’s really illegal, personally,” Trump, who has sued multiple major news organisations this year, told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. The 79-year-old Republican, an avid television watcher, chiefly focused his diatribe on US television networks, reiterating a claim that coverage of him and his administration is “97 per cent bad”. He also defended the head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, whose threats against broadcasters have sparked a national debate over free speech and caused some unease even among Republicans. Carr on Wednesday criticised Kimmel’s remarks on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and threatened broadcasters who carry his show with possible sanctions. Hours later, ABC announced Kimmel’s show was suspended indefinitely. On Friday, Trump called Carr “an incredible American patriot with courage.” Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a close Trump ally, meanwhile, said he believes it’s dangerous for a government to put itself in a position to say what speech it may or may not like.
