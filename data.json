Citing data submitted by the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA), Rep. Kim Jang-kyom of the main opposition People Power Party said the watchdog received 1,887 reports of security breaches from South Korean companies in 2024, up 47 percent from a year earlier. During the January-August period of 2025, the number of breach reports stood at 1,501, the data showed. Despite the surge in cyberattacks reported by businesses, the number of response personnel came to just 132, up only nine from 2022. Over the same period, South Korea's budget for hacking and virus response systems rose 22 percent to 73.6 billion won ($52.4 million), according to the lawmaker. \"The fact that the number of investigators at KISA increased by a single digit over the years indicates the country lacks readiness against such threats,\" Kim said.",

      "summary_orig": "ANY halt in the genocide unfolding in Gaza is welcome. After nearly two years of relentless bombardment, the prospect of a truce — following Hamas’s conditional acceptance of US President Donald Trump’s peace plan , which includes releasing all hostages and handing Gaza’s administration to a technocratic Palestinian body, and Israel’s readiness to implement its first phase — offers a sliver of hope. For a population living amid mass displacement, collapsed infrastructure, and the loss of over 66,000 lives, even a pause in the violence carries meaning. Yet history teaches that such truces often collapse under Israel’s obstinacy. If this opening is to amount to more than a tactical lull, it must be anchored in lasting commitments. The Netanyahu government has already signalled it will calibrate operations rather than halt them outright. Reports from Gaza confirm bombardment continuing despite Mr Trump’s demand for Israel to “immediately stop bombing.” Mr Trump has also set Hamas a deadline, warning that if it fails to accept the deal by Sunday night, “all hell” will break out. Such ultimatums underscore both the fragility of the moment and the dangers of coercion in a process that should prioritise justice and peace. Israel is notorious for backtracking once international attention drifts. This time must be different. The guarantors of the truce — Washington, Arab capitals, and the UN — must ensure commitments are not quietly abandoned, and that violations invite consequences. Without sustained pressure, Tel Aviv has little incentive to comply beyond exchanging hostages for prisoners. Accountability cannot be sacrificed for expedience. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023 — figures the UN considers credible. That most of the dead are women and children underscores the monstrous scale of Israel’s actions. International law obliges states to investigate such crimes. If there is no accountability for the massacre of tens of thousands, peace will rest on sand, and impunity will pave the way for repetition. Equally central is Gaza’s future. The blockade that has strangled the Strip for nearly two decades must be permanently lifted. Aid convoys cannot replace the right of Palestinians to move freely, rebuild homes, and recover their economy. Without freedom of movement, Gaza remains an open-air prison. In the end, no ‘technocratic committee’ or transitional board will address the root cause. Only a two-state solution, long sabotaged by Israeli settlement expansion, can provide dignity and security. Yet Israel’s leadership has already said it does not accept Palestinian statehood, pledging to retain “security control” while denying Palestinians sovereignty. Unless Palestinians are granted the means to build a viable state, violence will recur. This fragile pause may offer a chance. But unless it is built on accountability, freedom, and self-determination, it will remain just that — a pause before the next round of devastation. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Security forces killed 14 terrorists of the Indian proxy group Fitna al-Hindustan in an operation conducted in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district on Saturday. The state designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Security officials said the forces launched the operation on the basis of intelligence reports about the presence of the group’s militants in the mountainous area of Zehri tehsil. According to the officials, the area was cordoned off before the action was launched. Heavy firing took place between the security forces and the terrorists, which continued for several hours. “As many as 14 terrorists were killed in the gun battle, while 20 others were injured,” the officials said, adding that a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and other equipment was seized from their possession. The Zehri operation, they added, was carried out days after security forces killed seven India-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Sherani district of Balochistan. They said several hideouts established by the militants in the mountainous terrain were destroyed during the operation. “Residents of the Zehri area praised the operation, acknowledging the efforts of the security forces in restoring peace and order to the region, which had been disturbed for a long time,” the officials said, adding that the terrorists had been harassing and blackmailing local residents. Officials reaffirmed that the security forces remain fully committed to elimina­ting the remaining milita­nts of Fitna al-Hindustan. On Oct 1, security forces had killed 13 other alleged terrorists in separate operations in Quetta and Kech districts of Makran. The operation in Aghbarg, on the outskirts of Quetta, was conducted a day after a car suicide attack on the headquarters of Frontier Corps (North) that claimed 10 lives, including four security personnel, and left 33 others injured. Security forces foiled the attackers’ attempt to enter the FC headquarters and killed all five terrorists. FIR registered Meanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan Police has registered an FIR against the terrorists involved in the car suicide attack outside the FC headquarters and has lau­nched an investigation. Official sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters. According to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established. Sources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said. Investigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records. “The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added. Meanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices. The offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces. Heavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

Official sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters. According to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established. Sources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said. Investigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records. “The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added. Meanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices. The offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces. Heavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Just a day before leaving for Malaysia on a two-day official visit , Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his elder brother and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday and discussed with him the ‘ growing tensions ’ between the PPP and PML-N, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers. The meeting that took place at their Jati Umra residence covered governance issues, including the ongoing acrimony with the PPP-led Sindh government over flood and canal issues. “The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn. The source said PM Shehbaz wanted his elder brother to speak to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and convince her “to let go and reconcile with the PPP”. He said the premier “urged Nawaz Sharif to ask Maryam Nawaz to adopt a reconciliatory approach and end the ongoing acrimony with the PPP leadership over flood and canal issues. Shehbaz, Dar to leave for Malaysia today “Nawaz Sharif was also briefed on the PPP’s grievances over administrative and development-related matters, with both leaders agreeing that unity within the coalition was essential to sustain the government’s stability.” However, in its official statement, the PML-N said the prime minister briefed the party chief on his recent foreign visits and provided a detailed update on the situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including the outcome of successful negotiations with the protesters. The war of words between the two coalition partners began over flood compensation , expanded to water rights on the Indus River (six canals issue). Maryam Nawaz told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself, while the latter had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sessions to protest her diatribe and demanded apology from her. However, CM Maryam declared she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst over flood and canal issues. As the tensions escalated further, the PPP publicly repeated Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) allegations that Maryam Nawaz did not represent the people of Punjab stating that her government was a “by product of Form 47”. PPP’s central information secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan said Maryam Nawaz, who called those raising public issues ‘the enemies of Punjab’, was herself the real problem of Punjab. “The CM Punjab is demonstrating racist thinking to hide her failure to save the people from floodwaters,” he remarked. PM’s Malaysia visit Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz would leave for Malaysia for a two-day visit at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim from Oct 5 to 7, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday. The FO said PM Shehbaz, Foreign Minister and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior government officials will depart for Malaysia on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” it added. A PML-N statement said Mr Ibrahim had also extended an invitation to party chief and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif to visit Malaysia, but he said he would consider the visit at a more suitable time.

      "summary_orig": "ANKARA: A total of 137 activists detained by Israel for taking part in the flotilla seeking to deliver aid to Gaza arrived in Turkiye on Saturday after being deported, with two alleging that Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg was mistreated during her detention. Israel did not immediately comment on the latest allegation, but its foreign ministry earlier described reports that detainees had been mistreated as “complete lies”. The 137 activists who landed at Istanbul Airport included 36 Turkish nationals, as well as citizens from the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Switzerland, Tunisia and Jordan. Two of them, Hazwani Helmi, a Malaysian citizen, and Windfield Beaver, an American, said at the airport that they had witnessed Thunberg being mistreated, saying she was shoved and forced to wear an Israeli flag. “It was a disaster. They treated us like animals,” said Helmi, 28, adding that detainees were not provided with clean food or water and that medication and belongings were confiscated. Beaver, 43, said Thunberg was “treated terribly’’ and “used as propaganda”, describing how she was pushed into a room as Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir arrived. Israel has faced international condemnation after its military intercepted all of about 40 boats in the Gaza-bound aid flotilla and detained more than 450 activists. Its foreign ministry wrote on X that all detained activists were “safe and in good health”, adding it was keen to complete the remaining deportations “as quickly as possible”. Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said 26 Italians were on board the Turkish Airlines flight, with another 15 still held in Israel and set to be expelled over the next few days. “I have once again given instructions to the Italian embassy in Tel Aviv to ensure that the remaining compatriots are treated with respect for their rights,” Tajani wrote on X. A first group of Italians from the flotilla — four parliamentarians — arrived in Rome on Friday. “We were brutally stopped … brutally taken hostage,” said Benedetta Scuderi, one of the parliamentarians. ‘Zip-tied for five hours’ According to Adalah, an Israeli group offering legal assistance to flotilla members, some detainees were denied access to lawyers, water and medications. They were also “forced to kneel with their hands zip-tied for at least five hours, after some participants chanted `Free Palestine’,” Adalah said. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• US envoys leave for Cairo to work out arrangements for release of Israeli prisoners • Dozens arrested in London after protesting against ban on a pro-Palestinian group CAIRO: Over 60 people were killed in Gaza on Saturday as Israel went ahead with its bombardment in defiance of US President Donald Trump’s demand it stop bombing in response to a declaration by Hamas that it was ready to free prisoners under his plan to end the two-year-old conflict. According to witnesses on the ground, 11 people died in sporadic incidents, while 10 people, including children, were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli strike on a house in Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. The attack damaged several other buildings nearby. The Gaza health ministry said in a morning update that Israeli fire had killed at least 66 Palestinians across the enclave over the past 24 hours. Despite the Israeli action, President Trump said “I appreciate Israel has temporarily stopped the bombing”, and he urged Hamas to move quickly on his plan “or else all bets will be off”. “I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Hamas had drawn a welcoming resp­onse from Trump on Friday by saying it accepted certain key parts of his 20-point peace proposal , including ending the conflict, Israel’s withdrawal and the rele­ase of prisoners, both Israeli and Palestinian. In Washington, a White House official said Trump was sending his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Egypt to finalise technical details regarding the release of Israeli prisoners and discuss a lasting “peace deal’. Egypt’s state-affiliated television channel Al QaheraNews said Palestinian and Israeli delegations would also be present for “indirect talks” on the Trump plan. Hamas’s response to the plan drew a chorus of optimistic statements by world leaders, who urged an end to the conflict. Another possible boost to hopes came with a supportive statement from the Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which is smaller than Hamas but seen as more hardline. The group, which also holds Israeli prisoners, endorsed Hamas’s response — a move that could help pave the way for the release of Israelis still held by both parties. ‘Immediate implementation’ Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli prisoners following Hamas’s response. Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce “offensive activity” in Gaza. Trump has invested significant political capital in efforts to end a conflict that has left Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage. Dozens held in London Police arrested an unspecified number of protesters for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group at a demonstration in London on Saturday which went ahead despite requests to call it off after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester two days ago. Two people were killed in the attack in the north-western English city on Thursday and police shot dead the suspect, a British man of Syrian descent. Organisers refused requests by police to call off Saturday’s demonstration, which had been announced before the Manchester attack, to protest the banning of pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws. Calling for calm on X, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognise and respect the grief of British Jews. “This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain. It is a time to stand together.” Police arrested protesters at Trafalgar Square, in central London, as they wrote slogans on placards declaring support for Palestine Action, which was proscribed in July after its members broke into an airbase and damaged military planes. Hundreds gathered for the protest, applauding and cheering those arrested as they were carried through the crowd by police without resisting. Onlookers chanted “shame on you” at officers. “I’m disgusted by the police actually, they shouldn’t be arresting non-violent protesters here,” said Angie Zelter. “We have a right to protest and Palestine Action is not a violent organisation, should never have been proscribed in the first place.” The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests, during which hundreds have been arrested for defying the ban which makes it an offence to show support for Palestine Action. Police said Saturday’s protests would draw resources away from security they have tightened around synagogues and mosques following the attack in Manchester. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

      "summary_en": "• US envoys leave for Cairo to work out arrangements for release of Israeli prisoners • Dozens arrested in London after protesting against ban on a pro-Palestinian group CAIRO: Over 60 people were killed in Gaza on Saturday as Israel went ahead with its bombardment in defiance of US President Donald Trump’s demand it stop bombing in response to a declaration by Hamas that it was ready to free prisoners under his plan to end the two-year-old conflict. According to witnesses on the ground, 11 people died in sporadic incidents, while 10 people, including children, were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli strike on a house in Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. The attack damaged several other buildings nearby. The Gaza health ministry said in a morning update that Israeli fire had killed at least 66 Palestinians across the enclave over the past 24 hours. Despite the Israeli action, President Trump said “I appreciate Israel has temporarily stopped the bombing”, and he urged Hamas to move quickly on his plan “or else all bets will be off”. “I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. Hamas had drawn a welcoming resp­onse from Trump on Friday by saying it accepted certain key parts of his 20-point peace proposal , including ending the conflict, Israel’s withdrawal and the rele­ase of prisoners, both Israeli and Palestinian. In Washington, a White House official said Trump was sending his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Egypt to finalise technical details regarding the release of Israeli prisoners and discuss a lasting “peace deal’. Egypt’s state-affiliated television channel Al QaheraNews said Palestinian and Israeli delegations would also be present for “indirect talks” on the Trump plan. Hamas’s response to the plan drew a chorus of optimistic statements by world leaders, who urged an end to the conflict. Another possible boost to hopes came with a supportive statement from the Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which is smaller than Hamas but seen as more hardline. The group, which also holds Israeli prisoners, endorsed Hamas’s response — a move that could help pave the way for the release of Israelis still held by both parties. ‘Immediate implementation’ Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli prisoners following Hamas’s response. Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce “offensive activity” in Gaza. Trump has invested significant political capital in efforts to end a conflict that has left Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage. Dozens held in London Police arrested an unspecified number of protesters for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group at a demonstration in London on Saturday which went ahead despite requests to call it off after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester two days ago.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The import of used cars in Pakistan is much higher than its regional peers and other countries. However, different countries have implemented various strategies to balance consumer demand, environmental concerns, and industrial priorities. Experiences from India, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines provide practical insights. Measures such as age limits, pre-export inspections, phased implementation, fiscal incentives, and administrative controls can guide Pakistan in maintaining quality, safeguarding the environment, and balancing consumer access with industrial protection. As per a report of the Institute of Cost and Management (ICMA), Pakistan’s average import of used cars per year stood at 34,000 units followed by 21,802 by Thailand, 532 by Vietnam and 235 units by India. Bangladesh permits the import of used cars under specific conditions to balance consumer demand with quality control and revenue generation. As of June 2025, vehicles must be no more than four years old, imported directly from the country of origin, and accompanied by a previous registration or de-registration certificate. The importation process involves customs duties, VAT, and mandatory inspections to ensure compliance with national standards. Neighbours curb influx of old vehicles through age caps and safety checks Sri Lanka lifted its five-year ban on private car and motorcycle imports in February 2025, allowing personal use vehicle imports under specific conditions. Individuals are permitted to import one vehicle per year, provided they use a registered vehicle importer. This phased reopening aims to stabilise the market and manage foreign exchange reserves while meeting consumer demand. India enforces stringent regulations on the importation of used vehicles to protect its domestic automotive industry and ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards. As of 2024, used vehicles must be under three years old, right-hand drive, and meet specific engine capacity restrictions. The import ­process involves extensive documentation, high import duties (up to 125pc for used cars), and mandatory compliance testing. Additionally, a minimum ­roadworthiness period of five years is required from the date of ­importation. Kenya has implemented a controlled liberalisation approach to used car imports, aiming to balance affordability with environmental and safety considerations. As of July 2025, only vehicles manufactured from July 2018 onward are eligible for import, effectively enforcing a rolling seven-year age limit. This policy is designed to improve air quality, reduce reliance on older vehicles, and support local vehicle assembly. Importers must comply with pre-export inspection requirements and domestic roadworthiness certification. South Africa restricts used car imports to protect its domestic automotive manufacturing sector. Importation is generally allowed only under specific circumstances, such as for returning nationals or immigrants with permanent residence status. These individuals may import one vehicle per family, subject to compliance with import duties and VAT. The importation process requires obtaining a permit and adhering to documentation requirements. Nigeria has tightened its used vehicle import regulations to reduce the influx of older, potentially polluting cars. As of May 2025, only vehicles manufactured in 2015 or later are eligible for import without facing punitive duties. Vehicles older than 10 years are either barred or subjected to heavy import penalties. The import process requires specific documentation, including a bill of lading, bill of entry, marine insurance, and evidence of VAT payment. In the Philippines, only qualified individuals may import used vehicles, and they must secure a Certificate of Authority to Import (CAI) from the Fair-Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) before the actual importation. Imported vehicles are subject to a 40pc customs duty, 10pc VAT, and an ad valorem tax ranging from 15pc to 100pc, depending on the vehicle’s piston displacement. In the early 1990s, commercial imports of cars were largely prohibited to protect local assemblers. This resulted in fewer cars in the market, higher prices, and limited options for buyers. In the early 2000s, growing demand for affordable cars led the government to allow imports under special schemes such as the Gift Scheme, Baggage Scheme, and Transfer of Residence Scheme, mainly for overseas Pakistanis. While these cars were meant for personal use, many entered the local market through dealers. Consumers gained more choice and prices dropped slightly, but local carmakers protested, saying these imports hurt their sales and investment. In 2,005, the government reduced duties, making it easier to import used cars. Consumers accessed small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, and imports rose quickly. By 2,008, local carmakers lobbied for tighter restrictions, leading to increased duties and a lower age limit for imports. This reduced imports and strengthened local manufacturer protection. In 2012, the maximum age of imported used cars was cut from five years to three years, sharply reducing inflows. Simultaneously, the Automotive Development Policy (ADP) encouraged investment in local assembly. Some new entrants joined, but car prices remained high and choice limited. During 2012-2020s, ongoing push and pull consumers continued to complain about high prices, limited choice, and lower safety standards than regional peers. Industry groups warned that too many imports could reduce local investment, slow parts production, and increase pressure on foreign exchange. The government alternated between relaxing and restricting imports, creating a cycle of\npolicy shifts. In September 2025, the federal government had allowed commercial imports of used cars up to five years old. Duties will be reduced gradually. The policy aims to protect local manufacturers, offer consumers more affordable choices, and ensure imported cars meet safety and environmental standards. This is a key step toward a more balanced automotive market. Passenger vehicles under five years old can be imported commercially until June 30, 2026. A 40pc regulatory duty applies in the first year, reducing by 10pc each year until it reaches zero by FY30. This phased approach helps balance consumer benefits with protection for local manufacturers. All imported vehicles must meet safety and emission standards, ensuring that older, unsafe, or inefficient vehicles do not enter the market. Published in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",

In a statement , the FO said that a high-level delegation comprising the PM, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and other federal ministers and senior government officials will depart on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” the statement read. According to the FO, PM Shehbaz will hold bilateral talks with Malaysian PM Ibrahim and discuss key regional and global developments, as well as enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, the Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people ties. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of Agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. Earlier this month, Malaysian High Commissioner to Pakistan Dato’ Mohammad Azhar Mazlan said that there is a great deal of commonality and potential for bilateral exchanges between Kuala Lumpur and Islamabad. “Malaysia takes pride in its association with Pakistan since August 31, 1957, when we gained independence. Pakistan was one of the earliest countries to recognise Malaysia as a nation. Justice Abdul Hamid of Pakistan also helped Malaysia in drafting its constitution,“ Mazlan said at an event in Karachi.",

      "title_orig": "Conspiracy by ‘ill-wishers’ failed in AJK following govt-JAAC agreement: minister",
      "summary_orig": "Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Saturday that the conspiracy hatched by the ill-wishers of Pakistan has failed in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and the government will fully implement the commitments it has made with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC). “The scenes that Pakistan’s ill-wishers wanted to see, the unrest, chaos and disorder in AJK, their conspiracy has failed. The federal government will fully implement the commitments it has made, and with the 15-day mechanism that has been established, I am confident that there will be no further opportunity for such grievances to arise again,” said the minister while addressing a press conference following the agreement between the two sides. Iqbal was accompanied by Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira. The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between the high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Since then, rival groups since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. Iqbal added that following the successful conclusion of talks between the two sides, peace has been restored in the region. Iqbal expressed satisfaction over the dialogue process and said it was “conducted keeping in view the interests of the people of Azad Kashmir and the interests of Pakistan”. Acknowledging administrative weaknesses, the minister said government organs should be more responsive. “The people are now more aware, the media has made them more informed and their expectations have increased greatly.” Kaira said following the agreement, the people of AJK “breathed a sigh of relief today” and added that the mechanism established must succeed as “we have no other option other than to ensure its success”. A high-level federal government delegation earlier today signed an agreement with JAAC to end days of unrest in AJK, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying that “all issues have been resolved amicably”. A day earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said it was “deeply alarmed“ by the ongoing violence in AJK, and condemned the “use of excessive force” and the communications blackout. In a post on social media platform X during the early hours of Saturday following day-long talks, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said — who was part of the government negotiating committee — said: “Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened.” “This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added. Chaudhry also shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”. Under the agreement, it was decided that first information reports (FIRs) would be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protestors”, with a judicial commission appointed where required. “Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the pact read, adding that gunshot injuries would be compensated with Rs1 million per person, while a government job would be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days. Chaudhry, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team. From the AJK government’s side, Education Minister Diwan Ali Chugtai and Local Government Minister Faisal Rathore took part in the talks, according to a copy of the signed pact shared by Chaudhry. Raja Amjad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir and Anjum Zaman Awan represented the JAAC. On September 25, a deadlock emerged between the AJK government and the JAAC over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir. Subsequently, a shutter-down strike had paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continued for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands . Conspiracies now stand buried as issues resolved amicably: PM Shehbaz Welcoming the agreement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said “all conspiracies and rumours now stand buried and issues have been resolved amicably”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported . He appreciated the members of the federal government’s negotiation committee and the JAAC for signing the pact to “settle all issues”. Terming it an achievement for Pakistan and AJK, the premier said the “restoration of peace and normalcy is a good gesture”, the report added. PM Shehbaz asserted that the government “is ever ready to resolve issues of Kashmiri brethren as public interest and service are among our top priorities”. He appealed to Kashmiris not to pay heed to rumours, affirming that the government had “always protected” their rights and will also ensure them in the future. On Thursday, PM Shehbaz had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues. ‘Pakistan, AJK & democracy wins’: Ahsan Iqbal Iqbal also welcomed the development, writing on X: “Pakistan, AJK and democracy wins.” He stressed that the people of AJK had “always stood at the frontlines of Pakistan’s national cause, and their voice carries immense weight”. Noting that the nation “saw a difficult situation emerge due to legitimate public concerns”, the planning minister commended the “wisdom of local and national leadership and the spirit of dialogue that enabled us to resolve this stand-off peacefully, without violence, without division, and with mutual respect”. He highlighted that the resolution of the issue showed that “when the government listens, and when the people engage constructively, we can find solutions together”. “The Joint Action Committee raised voice of citizens, and the government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took these voices seriously. Instead of confrontation, we chose consultation. Instead of egos, we chose empathy. We commit to work together for good governance and development in AJK,” Iqbal added.",

      "summary_orig": "PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro on Saturday assailed Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks regarding the contentious canals issue as a violation of the decision made by the Council of Common Interests (CCI). The war of words between the two sides, that kicked off over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP had lawmakers stay away from parliamentary proceedings to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad on Wednesday to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces. However, she declared a day ago that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47. In a statement issued today, the PPP leader said her remarks regarding the controversial canal project were a “violation of the CCI’s decision and an insult to the constitutional forum”. The party demanded that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif take notice of her remarks and clarify the party’s policy. It also demanded that the Punjab government disclose the aid provided to flood victims. The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. “The CCI, a constitutional forum, has already rejected and buried the controversial canal project,” reiterated the PPP leader. “Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz is not above the CCI’s constitutional forum, and Maryam Nawaz holds no standing alone against the CCI.” He said it was the CCI’s unanimous decision that no canal project would be built until all provinces agreed, adding that Sindh would not accept the project under any circumstances. Khuhro further said that Maryam was violating the forum’s decision and insulting it with her remarks about the project, adding that she “lacks political wisdom”, which is why she was criticising a constitutional forum. He said Nawaz was the PML-N’s leader and should take notice of his daughter’s remarks and clarify the party’s stance on the issue. “Sindh will not allow anyone to plunder the water of its Indus River, nor will it allow any dam to be built on the Indus River. “Constitutionally, the province of Sindh, being at the tail end, has the first right to water, and any attack on Sindh’s water share will be considered an attack on the unity of Sindh and the country.” He further alleged that CM Maryam was “frightened by the growing popularity” of the PPP in Punjab, which is why she was opposing the process of providing relief to flood victims through the Benazir Income Support Programme. “Punjab is not the fiefdom of any single party; the PPP, along with every political party, has the right to engage in political activities in Punjab.” Criticising her administration’s flood relief and rescue efforts, he added her “hollow claims” about her performance are “limited to TV channels only” and stood “exposed”. “Punjab’s flood victims are still waiting and yearning for aid and relief.” “If the Punjab CM is providing complete relief and aid to flood victims, she should disclose it to the nation,” he said. US commits $1m to Unicef flood response Meanwhile, a press release from Uncief issued a day ago said the United States has committed $1 million to support the organisation’s emergency response for children and families affected by the recent floods in Pakistan. Unicef said it would reach over 65,000 people, including pregnant women and children, with life-saving nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene support through the contribution. It explained that it would screen 32,500 children for malnutrition, provide treatment to 2,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition and deliver multi-micronutrient supplements to 32,500 children and 32,500 pregnant and breastfeeding women and caregivers. Furthermore, over 50,000 people would gain access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, including restoration of damaged water systems, installation of temporary toilets, and distribution of hygiene kits. “Children are always the most vulnerable in emergencies, facing the compounded threats of malnutrition and deadly waterborne diseases. This timely support from the United States enables us to deliver life-saving services and help restore dignity and hope to families who have suffered loss and displacement, as they begin the difficult journey of recovery,” the press release quoted Pernille Ironside, Unicef representative in Pakistan, as saying.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country will “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) comes in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in such a case. “In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint.” Indian media outlet NDTV reported a day ago that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion. The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed , without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said : “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.” In its statement today, the ISPR said that this time, “we shall shatter the myth of geographic immunity, hitting the farthest reaches of the Indian territory. “As for the talk of erasing Pakistan from the map, India must know that if the situation comes, the erasure will be mutual.” It added that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”. The military’s media wing warned that the nation and military had the “capability and resolve to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy’s territory” in the face of unwarranted threats and reckless aggression. The ISPR further said the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”. It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia. “For decades, India has benefitted from playing the victim card and painting Pakistan in negative light, while stoking violence and perpetrating terrorism in South Asia and beyond.” The military’s media wing added that India’s narrative has been sufficiently debunked and “now the world recognises India as the true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability”. “Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war.  However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.” The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale . New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command, that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India. The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army. The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.",

      "summary_orig": "The death toll in an Indonesian school collapse rose to 17 on Saturday, officials said, as rescuers deployed heavy machinery to recover dozens more victims believed still buried under the rubble. Part of the multi-storey boarding school collapsed suddenly on Monday as students gathered for afternoon prayers. Rescuers retrieved two bodies and a body part from the rubble today, bringing the death toll to 17, National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) operation director Yudhi Bramantyo said in a statement. “The evacuation process is still ongoing. Debris removal is focused to the north side in an area not integrated with the main structure,” Yudhi said. Local search and rescue agency head Nanang Sigit confirmed the updated toll in a separate statement. Earlier today, authorities said they had recovered nine bodies on Friday. Rescuers were searching for 49 people still missing, National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) chief Suharyanto said before prior to the retrieval of the latest bodies. More victims could be found, said Suharyanto, who, like many Indonesians, only goes by one name, as rescuers brought heavy machinery to clear locations where the victims were believed to be buried underneath the rubble. “After the last victim was found last night, we are focusing on a massive cleanup, with heavy equipment entering the collapsed areas,” he said, as reported by broadcaster Kompas TV . The school collapse was so violent that it sent tremors across the neighbourhood, according to residents. Investigators have been looking into the cause of the collapse, but initial signs pointed to substandard construction, experts have said. The rescue operation was complex because vibrations in one place could affect other areas, officials said. But the families of the missing agreed on Thursday for heavy equipment to be used, after the 72-hour “golden period” for the best chance of survival came to an end. The rescue operation was complicated by an earthquake that struck overnight on Tuesday, briefly halting the search.",

This comes a day after the Pakistan High Commission in London announced that the national carrier would resume flight operations to the UK this month as PIA received its Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and Third Country Operator approval , but no exact date was given. PIA announced its “historic return” to British skies with a post on X today, which read: “The wait is finally over! Pakistan International Airlines proudly reconnects Manchester and Islamabad, bringing loved ones closer once again.” In yesterday’s announcement, the high commission said flight operations to Manchester would be resumed during the first phase, after which Birmingham and London would follow suit. In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. The national carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”. The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.",

Earlier, a statement issued on X by state broadcaster PTV News said security forces “foiled an attempt to harass peaceful people in the Zehri area” of the district and destroyed multiple terrorist hideouts during an operation while killing over 14 Fitna al-Hindustan members and injuring over 20. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. Congratulating the security forces, Naqvi hailed the operation as a “major success”, saying that the nation was “proud of the professional capabilities and courage of the security forces”. He further said: “Security forces are determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists in Balochistan. The people of Balochistan stand with the security forces. Indian-sponsored terrorists will not be allowed to hide anywhere.” Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also said operational successes such as the above were “proof that the people of Balochistan and the forces are together grinding the nefarious designs of the country’s enemies into the dust. I am proud of the bravery of my youth and people. Long live Pakistan!” Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakistan and Balochistan.
