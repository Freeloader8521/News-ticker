      "summary_orig": "A report on journalism in Balochistan has highlighted how pressure, intimidation and violence from multiple actors have caused the space for press freedom to shrink in the province. The report, titled State of Media Freedoms, Access to Information and Safety of Journalists and Media Professionals in Balochistan – The Way Forward, was released by Freedom Network (FN) on Sunday and examines Balochistan’s overall media landscape, threat actors, service structures, gender dynamics, legal cases and challenges, including censorship, harassment, intimidation and dismissals from service. It notes that national television channels and newspapers have steadily reduced their bureau presence in Quetta, as digital distribution becomes the norm, leaving coverage outside the provincial capital sparse or non-existent. “Drawing on desk research, focus group discussions and key informant interviews, it (the report) finds a chronically constrained information environment in which local media are financially brittle, structurally peripheral to ‘national mainstream’ agendas, digitally disadvantaged, and exposed to overlapping coercive pressures from state and non-state actors,” the report stated in its executive summary. “The cumulative effect is systematic under-coverage of public-interest issues, heightened self-censorship, and a steady erosion of citizens’ right to know.” The province still lacks a terrestrial current affairs television channel. State-run outlets such as PTV and Radio Pakistan operate mainly from urban centres, and their multilingual mandate complicates both content production and audience reach. The report highlighted privately-owned TV channels based in Karachi, which have positioned themselves as 24/7 satellite channel for Balochistan audiences with national and diasporic reach. Additionally, print media is largely concentrated in Quetta and struggles with high costs, long distances and low literacy rates in rural areas. The report also traces how security conditions, governance failures, economic constraints and demographic realities have shaped the media ecosystem and journalists’ safety in Balochistan. An image of various Pakistani newspapers. — AFP/File It noted that journalists in the province face threats from separatist and militant groups, political and tribal elites and mobs, creating an environment where independent reporting is no longer possible. “Journalists face pressure from both the state and non-state actors to be on their side, while the state cannot provide them safety in a place where its writ is challenged; nor is such security desirable because it naturally makes them an easy target for the militants,” the report stated, quoting Balochistan Minister for Planning and Development Zahoor Ahmad Buledi. The report added that over two decades, “40 journalists have been killed in Balochistan; roughly 30 were targeted killings, the rest collateral to bombings/attacks“. “Journalists are frequently coerced to carry militant claims or assist security services in tracing callers; refusal or cooperation can each trigger threats,” it added. “Over the years and decades, Baloch militant organisations suspended the distribution of local and national newspapers in southern and central Balochistan, demanding coverage of their activities in media.” Additionally, the report noted that intimidation comes not just from militant groups, but also from influential tribal leaders. “Sans a few political parties that react to media coverage with restraint and patience, expressing their anger and grievances in a civil manner, others resort to tribal traits,” the report read. FN noted in the report that aside from physical threats to their safety, journalists are also at risk of facing “structural barriers to reporting”, such as closing down offices and preventing the circulation of newspapers. They also face a dearth of government or federal advertising, causing financial insecurity. Furthermore, it highlighted severe gender disparities in the media, noting that female journalists remain very few in number, largely confined to Quetta. The report said they face layered constraints, including limited mobility, hostile field conditions, newsroom sexism, pay gaps, lack of basic facilities and harassment. Editors often bar women from district assignments in the name of safety, reinforcing stereotypes while still expecting output without adequate support. As a result, many women journalists work off-camera or have their reports voiced by male colleagues. FN Executive Director Iqbal Khattak said journalism is “lost” in Balochistan, where enforced and self-imposed censorship prevail to stay safe and avoid any mishap. He expressed hope that the findings would draw the attention of all stakeholders to reverse the situation and ensure the safety of media practitioners so that citizens can access credible information.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan‘s Kalat district, killing four terrorists, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Saturday’s IBO took place on the reports that terrorists belonging to Fitna al Hindustan were present. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “During the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in the statement. It added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who had been actively involved in terrorist activity in the area. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored terrorist found in the area. [The] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under [the] vision “Azm-i-Istehkam” (as approved by [the] Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the ISPR stated. A map shows the location of a counter-terrorism operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district on December 27. — Photo courtesy ISPR President Asif Ali Zardari commended the security forces for the successful operation. “The war against terrorism perpetrated by external interference will continue,” he said, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) . Yesterday, the ISPR said in a statement that four terrorists had been killed in an IBO in Balochistan’s Panjgur district. The IBO, launched on Friday, saw security forces engage terrorists belonging to Fitna al Khawarij , a term designating members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The statement added during the operation, “own forces effectively engaged the khawarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored khawarij were sent to hell”. Following the skirmish, a sanitisation operation was initiated in the area to “eliminate any other Indian sponsored Khawarij present in the area”. Earlier this month, 12 terrorists were killed during an IBO in Balochistan’s Kalat. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025 , published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI on Sunday denied opting to engage in dialogue with the government as an underdog but said that it will do so “after ensuring a level-playing field is provided to it through street movements“, according to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and the PTI Secretary-General, Salman Akram Raja. CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, was in Lahore to launch a new street movement, as per the directives of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. He left for the motorway at about 6:40pm. In a discussion with senior journalists at a private residence in Lahore’s Defence Housing Authority earlier in the day, Afridi asserted that reconciliation was impossible without resistance. “We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said. Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without yielding any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.“ Secretary-General Raja said no political party could go into a blind alley. “We are seeing that the government want the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?” Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed – otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted. Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi visited the residences of party leaders Mirza Afridi, but was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassan Niazi. The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.” “The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented. “I have been asking to go to the party leaders’ residences in the cantonment but was told that I was not permitted,” he said and demanded that he be given a reason “in writing” as to why he was stopped. “The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had offered talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. ‘Street movement failed to attract public’: Azma On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister, Azma Bokhari, ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.” In a statement on X, Bokhari remarked that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day. She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, Bokhari said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return. “Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead. She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.",

Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, Bokhari said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return. “Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead. She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.",

      "summary_orig": "LONDON: A demonstration outside the Bangladeshi High Commission in London on Saturday briefly turned tense when pro-Khalistan Sikh activists and a small group of Hindu protesters confronted each other, prompting police intervention. The Khalistan Movement wants an independent Sikh state carved out of India and dates back to India and Pakistan’s independence in 1947, when the idea was pushed forward in negotiations preceding the partition of the Punjab region between the two new countries. The protest was held in connection with reports of violence against Hindus in Bangladesh. During the gathering, Paramjeet Singh Pamma, identified by organisers as a coordinator of the Khalistan Referendum campaign, was involved in a brief scuffle with an Indian Hindu protester. Metropolitan Police officers on duty intervened quickly, separating the individuals and dispersing the groups from close proximity to the mission building. No injuries were reported. Following the incident, pro-Khalistan Sikh protesters formed a cordon near the embassy entrance and continued their demonstration. They raised political slogans, accusing the Indian government of involvement in the killings of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and others. Police maintained a presence to prevent further confrontation and said the situation was brought under control. India has designated Pamma as a “most wanted terrorist” — a charge he and his supporters reject. He currently resides in the United Kingdom. UK authorities have not announced any charges against him, and previous Indian requests related to his extradition have not resulted in court action. The Metropolitan Police did not issue any immediate statement on arrests or further action. Nijjar was shot dead at the age of 45 by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. His murder in June 2023 near his home in Vancouver sparked a diplomatic storm between India and Canada. Similarly, in November 2023, US authorities thwarted a plot to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States and issued a warning to India over concerns the government in New Delhi was involved, the Financial Times (FT) reported. In October 2024, an Indian intelligence official and an Indian national indicted for their role in the plot to kill Pannun, according to the US Justice Department. Meanwhile, in March this year, India asked the US to list Sikhs For Justice, a separatist group, as a terrorist organisation — a point that came up during talks between Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and visiting US national intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in rejecting Israel‘s recognition of self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”. The statement also registered the countries’ rejection of any “potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land”. The joint statement has been issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Iran, Iraq Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye, Yemen and the OIC. Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords. Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy — and relative peace and stability — since 1991, when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country. Israel’s decision could reshape regional dynamics and test Somalia’s longstanding opposition to secession. The Foreign Office (FO) released the joint statement by 21 nations, including Pakistan, and the OIC on Sunday, underscoring their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of the Federal Republic of Somalia. The statement said that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”. The 21 nations and the OIC condemned the measure in the strongest terms, saying that it “constitutes a grave violation of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, which explicitly stipulates the imperative of protecting the sovereignty of states and their territorial integrity, and reflects Israel’s expansionist” policy. They underscored their full support of the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and the unequivocal rejection of any measures that undermine the unity of Somalia, its territorial integrity or its sovereignty over its entire territory. “The recognition of parts of states constitutes a serious precedent and threatens international peace and security, and violates the cardinal principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,” their joint statement read. They registered their “full rejection of any potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land, which is unequivocally rejected in any form as a matter of principle”. In a separate statement on Saturday, the FO termed Israel’s recognition of Somaliland an attempt to undermine Somalia’s sovereignty. “Pakistan strongly condemns any attempts to undermine the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia, and rejects, in this regard, the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” the FO said in a statement. Islamabad called on the international community to step in to reject any such actions, and “prevent and deter Israel from undermining the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the broader region”. Meanwhile, in a call with Somali Foreign Minister Abdisalam Abdi Ali, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s full support for Somalia’s sovereignty and condemned actions undermining it, the FO said in a post on X. “The Somali Foreign Minister thanked the DPM/FM (Dar) for standing by Somalia and for Pakistan’s continued and sustained support,” the post read. “He also sought Pakistan’s assistance in raising Somalia’s concerns at the UNSC.” The FO said that Dar affirmed Pakistan’s full support for Somalia at the UN and other multilateral fora. Similarly, in another call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Dr Badr Abdelatty, Dar discussed regional and global developments, with Somalia and Yemen in particular, the FO said in another social media post. For its part, Somalia has declared the Israeli decision a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty. Meanwhile, the African Union has warned the move risks “setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent”. The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said on the social media platform X on Saturday that Israel had previously identified Somaliland “as a destination for the forced displacement of our Palestinian people, particularly from the Gaza Strip”. It warned against any “complicity” with such plans. While several other nations, as well as the European Union, have called for respecting Somalia’s sovereignty, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has characterised the recognition as a continuation of the “spirit of the Abraham Accords”. However, the United States signalled it would not follow Israel’s lead. When asked by the New York Post whether the US planned to recognise Somaliland, President Trump said, “No.” “Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?” Trump said, distancing Washington from the move.",

      "summary_orig": "At a Thai university-turned-shelter for displaced people, Kanlaya Somjettana is reluctant to go home even after a truce halted weeks of border clashes with Cambodia, fearing the violence may not be over. She said some people forced to flee the fighting began returning home on Sunday, a day after the ceasefire was announced, but many evacuees on both sides of the border preferred waiting for an official word that it was safe. Some cited a lack of trust that the neighbouring country would respect the truce, after previous ones had been broken. “I really hope this ceasefire will last long and we can return home,” 21-year-old homemaker Kanlaya told AFP from the university campus in Thailand’s Surin city. “But I will not go back home as long as authorities do not confirm that it is safe,” she said, adding that the evacuation centre was now less crowded, although hundreds remained there. On the Cambodian side, 35-year-old So Choeun said she expected to give birth within days and hoped to then take her baby home, about one kilometre (0.6 miles) from the border. But not yet, said the woman sheltering with family under makeshift tents at a Buddhist pagoda in Banteay Meanchey province. “Despite the ceasefire, we dare not return home yet. We are still frightened,” she told AFP . “We will wait to see the situation for a few days, if it will stay calm.” Officials on both sides said the day-old ceasefire was holding on Sunday, but for most areas, there has been no all-clear notice just yet. The truce follows three weeks of renewed cross-border fighting that killed at least 47 people and displaced more than a million on both sides. A previous round in the decades-old conflict — five days of fighting in July — killed dozens before a truce was brokered, and then broken. Many of those displaced by the latest violence had evacuated in July, too. ‘Good sign’ Rice and cassava farmer Saichon Wongpitak said she could not afford to wait any longer, planning to return to her home in Thailand’s Sisaket province on Sunday afternoon. “I talked to our neighbour who said there was no gunfire since yesterday,” Saichon, 38, told AFP , adding that her family would evacuate again if necessary. “We have fear… but we have jobs to do at home, we have cattle at home, we have our farm,” she said. Saichon said she was glad to hear of the truce, but did not expect it to last long “before Cambodia starts a new round of fighting”. “I live on the border, and what I have learned is not to trust Cambodia,” she said. Under the truce, the two countries agreed to cease fire, freeze troop movements and allow civilians living in border areas to return home as soon as possible, while Thailand was to return 18 Cambodian soldiers captured in July within 72 hours. Kot Ngik, 43, from another camp for displaced people in Cambodia’s Banteay Meanchey, said she was thankful for the truce since it may allow children to soon return to school. But “we don’t trust the Thai military yet”, she said. “At this point, we are not sure about the situation. They can fight again at any time.” While many evacuees, including Kot Ngik, were still too fearful to leave shelters, So Choeun said the ceasefire at least offered some hope. “Yesterday morning, I could hear loud bangs, but I have not heard it since 12pm yesterday,” she said. “This is a good sign.”",

      "summary_orig": "PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari highlighted on Sunday the significance of the politics of reconciliation, urging the opposition to play a “responsible” role and also called for the ruling party and its allies to take the necessary steps in this regard. Bilawal expressed these views while speaking to the media at the inauguration ceremony of the Sindh Institute of Child Health and Neonatology in Larkana. View this post on Instagram He recalled that former prime minister Benazir Bhutto had given the message of “truth and reconciliation” and “reconciliation in politics”. Linking it with the country’s progress and economic prosperity, he said the ruling party and its allies would have to play their part for this while the opposition would also have to play a “responsible role”. “If stringent [measures] are taken in response to the politics of extremism, then there should be no complaints,” he remarked, quoting the English idiom “if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen”. He added, “If you (the PTI) attack a national institution just because of a small NAB (National Accountability Bureau) case against your leader and because of a small arrest, then don’t complain. Action will be taken against you in accordance with the law and Constitution.“ Bilawal maintained that if the PPP had been in PTI’s place, it would have faced more severe consequences. He advised the PTI to let go of the “politics of extremism”, saying that it would not benefit the party itself and its workers, but it would also have a positive impact on the country’s politics. The PPP chairperson then went on to say that while Benazir’s philosophy was that of the politics of reconciliation, President Asif Ali Zardari had played the “biggest role” in its implementation. “From the first day after the election till yesterday in my speech, and even within the party, my stance has been that President Zardari will have to play his role. “President Zardari not just has a [track record] but also the people’s confidence that he is capable of playing a role for reconciliation in politics,” Bilawal said. However, he pointed out there was a “unique dynamic” that had to be considered in current circumstances. “The situation on frontiers with India and Afghanistan is before you, and internally terrorism is increasing,” he said, adding that in this situation, the role of opposition parties was of most importance. “If they have to operate like an extremist party, then the state’s response would be in accordance with that […] But if they adopt a political attitude, [other] parties may get some political space to play a role in reducing the political division and polarisation in the country.” He said political reconciliation was the way forward and an environment conducive to that would have to be created, else the people and the country would face the consequent loss. In response to a question about Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who recently demanded fresh elections across the country, Bilawal said all political parties should play their role to ensure that free and fair elections were held, whenever they were to be held. “And if any amendments, any changes in the law are required for that, we will have to increase people’s trust in the Election Commission. “There is no point in holding elections if allegations of rigging are to be made again. So, now that there is time and the writing on the wall is that elections will not be held early, serious political parties should try to bring electoral reforms aimed at increasing the trust of people, as well as the political parties in the election commission,” Bilawal said. Referring to the complaints regarding recent by-elections, he said he wouldn’t want polls, be it by-polls or general elections, to be held in such a situation and become a cause of “more political instability”. Again highlighting the need for the opposition to work towards reconciliation, Bilawal said that the government would also have to take some measures. “Parliament should be made functional. The [platform] of Parliament should be used — politicians and political workers will have to take several measures for us to be able to create space for tolerance in politics,” he added. Earlier in the media talk, Bilawal said that while the government had been claiming that the economy was improving and economic indicators on paper seemed to be improving, there was a “crisis of affordability” in the country. He also said that the PPP’s views on privatisation were that a successful model in this area was that of public-private partnership. In response to a question, he again stressed that political parties should find political means to resolve issues. “Long-term solutions to our issues, economic difficulties and questions of national security lie in genuine political stability and in the lasting innings of one political party,” he asserted. “And all political forces and our senior politicians should think about what measures need to be taken to establish genuine political stability.“",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh police on Sunday said the alleged killers of popular student leader Sharif Osman Hadi had fled to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with its neighbour. Hadi, a vocal India critic who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was shot by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore. His death set off violent protests with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution. With protests being held across the country almost daily, pressure has been growing on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the general elections in February next year. “The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference. He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border with India shortly after attacking Hadi on December 12. “They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.” Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said. “We are communicating with Meghalaya police, who have confirmed the arrest of two Indian nationals,” he added. Two senior Meghalaya police officers, however, did not comment when contacted by AFP . The Indian foreign ministry had earlier said it rejects “false narratives” about New Delhi’s involvement in Hadi’s killing. Ties between the neighbours have deteriorated since ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled the pro-democracy uprising and sought refuge in India. India says it is still considering Dhaka’s requests to extradite Hasina, who was sentenced to death in absentia for orchestrating a deadly crackdown on the uprising. The lynching of a Hindu garment worker by a mob on December 18 has also hit ties. Amid the deteriorating security situation in the Muslim-majority country, Khuda Baksh Chowdhury, special assistant to interim leader Muhammad Yunus, overseeing the home department, stepped down on Wednesday.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The government has declared YouTuber Adil Farooq Raja, who is also a former Pakistan Army officer and currently resides in the United Kingdom, a proscribed person under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. “The federal government has reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Adil Farooq Raja has been demonstrating his sustained involvement in activities posing a serious threat to the security, integrity, and public order of Pakistan. “He has consistently misused online platforms to promote, facilitate, and amplify anti-state narratives and propaganda associated with proscribed terrorist organisations, thereby acting in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty and defence of Pakistan,” read the notification declaring the YouTuber a proscribed person. The notification was issued by the interior ministry and is dated December 27. It said, “In exercise of powers conferred by Section 11ee of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, the federal government is pleased to direct to list Mr Adil Farooq Raja in the Fourth Schedule to the said Act as a proscribed person for the purposes of the said Act.” The notification was issued after the federal cabinet approved the summary for Raja‘s proscription, the summary for which had been submitted by the interior ministry on December 23. The development came roughly 20 days after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi handed over the extradition papers for Raja — who has positioned himself as a whistleblower — former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar to UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott. Prior to that, Naqvi had announced a crackdown on those involved in fake news, declaring that the government would repatriate from the UK YouTubers involved in this activity or the targeting of state institutions. Raja had reacted to the development in a post on X, saying: “They may call the British High Commissioner to complain, but such a complaint is itself unlawful under UK statutes, as we have committed no wrongdoing.” On December 10, Raja had also been ordered to pay £350,000 in damages and legal costs after a London high court ruled he had defamed a former intelligence officer with unfounded allegations of corruption and electoral interference. In 2023, Raja was handed 14 years of jail sentence following his Field General Court Martial for “inciting sedition” and stripped of his military rank. While the military’s media affairs wing did not directly link the convictions to the events of May 9, Raja and Mehdi had been accused by the Islamabad police of playing a significant role in fomenting rebellion and inciting attacks on military installations during widespread protests that followed PTI leader Imran Khan’s arrest on that day.",

      "title_orig": "Zelensky to meet Trump in Florida for talks on Ukraine peace plan",
      "summary_orig": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump will meet in Florida on Sunday to hammer out a plan to end the war in Ukraine, but face major differences on crucial issues and provocations from Russian air attacks. Russia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelensky called it Russia’s response to the ongoing US-brokered peace efforts. Zelensky has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine’s contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump’s Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics. The Ukrainian president and his delegation arrived in Florida late on Saturday, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya said on X. “Good evening, Florida!” Kyslytsya wrote, accompanying the post with a photo of an aircraft bearing the US president’s surname on the fuselage. Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv’s control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday’s talks might produce. The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelensky said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote. Axios said US officials viewed Zelensky’s willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan. Zelensky’s in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1pm (11pm PKT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States. Sticking points over territory Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelensky said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90 per cent finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved. While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines. The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms. Zelensky, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km of its territory per day in 2025. Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12pc of its territory, including about 90pc of Donbas, 75pc of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates. Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join Nato. Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack Nato members. The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan , which emerged from talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November. Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan. Canada, European allies rally behind Kyiv Saturday’s air attacks show that Putin does not want peace, Zelensky said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney said peace “requires a willing Russia”. “The barbarism that we saw overnight — the attack on Kyiv — shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time,” Carney said, pledging C$2.5 billion (US$1.83bn) in additional economic aid to Ukraine. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelensky along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained “a just and lasting peace” that preserved Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country’s security and defence capabilities. Zelensky said he would speak with European leaders again after he meets with Trump.",

      "summary_orig": "All-rounder Shadab Khan has been recalled to Pakistan’s T20I set-up, while senior players Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi have been left out as the national selectors on Sunday announced a 15-member squad for next month’s three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka. The squad will be led by Salman Ali Agha, who enjoyed a heavy workload in the format this year, featuring in a record 34 T20Is — the most by any Pakistan player in a calendar year. Shadab, 27, last played a T20I for Pakistan in June before undergoing shoulder surgery earlier this year. After completing a successful rehabilitation programme at the National Cricket Academy, the leg-spinning all-rounder is currently in action in Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL), a factor that appears to have aided his return to international contention. While Babar and Shaheen’s omission is notable, both players are also currently featuring in the BBL, and their absence is understood to be part of a broader rotation policy rather than a permanent exclusion. With the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup approaching, the selectors appear keen to assess different combinations and expand the pool of players available for the global event. Another notable inclusion is uncapped wicketkeeper-batter Khawaja Nafay. The 23-year-old, who has been part of the Pakistan Shaheens set-up, has played 32 T20 matches and scored at a strike rate of 132.81, earning his first senior call-up. Pakistan are scheduled to depart for Sri Lanka in the first week of January, with all three T20Is to be played at the Rangiri Dambulla International Cricket Stadium in Dambulla on January 7, 9 and 11. The series forms part of Pakistan’s preparations for the T20 World Cup, which will be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8. Pakistan are set to play all their World Cup fixtures in Colombo. Squad: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abdul Samad, Abrar Ahmad, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Nafay (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan (wicket-keeper), Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Usman Khan (wicket-keeper), Usman Tariq",

      "summary_orig": "KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said on Saturday they were working with neighbouring Tajikistan to investigate a border clash earlier this week that killed five people, including two Tajik guards. Tajikistan announced on Thursday that three members of a “terrorist” group had crossed into the Central Asian country “illegally” at Khatlon province, which borders Afghanistan. Tajik security forces killed the trio, but two border guards also died in the clash, the Tajik national security committee said. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said on Saturday that “we have started serious investigations into” the recent “incidents” on Tajik soil. “I spoke to the foreign minister of Tajikistan and we are working together to prevent such incidents,” he told an event in Kabul. “We are worried that some malicious circles want to destroy the relations between two neighbouring countries,” the minister added, without elaborating. Tajikistan shares a mountainous border of about 1,350 kilometres with Afghanistan and has had tense relations with Kabul’s Taliban authorities, who returned to power in 2021. Unlike other Central Asian leaders, Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, who has been in power since 1992, has criticised the Taliban and urged them to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks in Afghanistan. At least five Chinese nationals were killed and several wounded in two separate attacks along the border with Afghanistan in late November and early December, according to Tajik authorities. According to a UN report in December, the jihadist group Jamaat Ansarullah “has fighters spread across different regions of Afghanistan” with a primary goal “to destabilise the situation in Tajikistan”.

      "summary_orig": "RIYADH: The Saudi-led coalition warned on Saturday it would back Yemen’s government in any military confrontation with separatist forces and urged them to withdraw “peacefully” from recently-seized provinces. The statements came a day after reported Saudi air strikes on separatist positions in Yemen’s Hadramawt province — and after Washington called for restraint in the rapidly escalating conflict. General Turki al-Malki, the spokesman for the coalition, said they would act “directly and at the appropriate moment… to protect civilian life”, according to the Saudi news agency SPA . Saudi Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman posted on X that troops from the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) should “peacefully hand over” two regional governorates to the government. Rubio calls for restraint, diplomatic efforts on Yemen “It’s time,” he posted, “at this sensitive moment, to let reason prevail by withdrawing from the two provinces and doing so peacefully.” The STC had warned on Friday that they were undeterred after strikes blamed on Saudi Arabia hit their positions, in the latest escalation since they seized large swathes of territory in the Hadramawt and Mahrah provinces. There were no immediate reports of casualties in the strikes. In recent weeks, separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates and seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen have made territorial gains. On Saturday, hundreds of Yemeni tribesmen gathered in Aden to ask the STC’s leaders to announce the independence of South Yemen, according to the separatist-affiliated Aden Independent Channel. The channel aired footage of a large crowd marching and waving the South Yemen independence flag alongside the UAE’s flag. Experts say their successes have embarrassed regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia, the main backer of the internationally-recognised Yemeni government. Farea al-Muslimi, from the Chatham House think tank in London, said that the STC had crossed Riyadh’s “red lines” and that the situation could quickly get worse. “It is one bad thing to humiliate Saudi Arabia. And it is another much worse thing to humiliate Saudi Arabia publicly. And that’s exactly what they did,” he said. US urges restraint In Washington, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: “We urge restraint and continued diplomacy, with a view to reaching a lasting solution.” Following Friday’s raids, Yemen’s government urged the Saudi-led coalition to support its forces in Hadramawt, after separatists seized most of the country’s largest province. The government asked the coalition to “take all necessary military measures to protect innocent Yemeni civilians in Hadramawt province and support the armed forces”, the official Yemeni news agency said. A Yemeni military official said that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were amassed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory. The areas where they were deployed are located at the edges of territory seized in recent weeks by the UAE-backed STC. “We have not received military instructions to move towards the two provinces,” the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Separatist advances have added pressure on ties between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which support rival groups within Yemen’s government. Published in Dawn, December 28th, 2025",

General Turki al-Malki, the spokesman for the coalition, said they would act “directly and at the appropriate moment… to protect civilian life”, according to the Saudi news agency SPA .

The truce took effect after a declaration signed by the neighbours’ defense ministers at a border checkpoint on the Thai side. The agreement applies to “all types of weapons, including attacks on civilians, civilian objects and infrastructures, and military objectives of either side, in all cases and all areas”. The three weeks of fighting, which utilised artillery, tanks, drones and jets, had spread to nearly every border province. The violence shattered a previous truce brokered in October, for which US President Donald Trump had taken credit. Thai Defence Minister Nattaphon Narkphanit described the initial three-day window as an “observation period to confirm that the ceasefire is real”. “A door to a peaceful resolution,” Nattaphon called the agreement in a speech on Saturday. Under the terms of the deal, both sides agreed to freeze troop movements and allow civilians in border areas to return home. The nations also pledged to cooperate on demining efforts and combatting cybercrime. Additionally, Thailand agreed to return 18 captured Cambodian soldiers within 72 hours. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the announcement “as a positive step towards alleviating the suffering of civilians … and creating an environment conducive to achieving lasting peace,” according to UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric. The conflict is rooted in a long-standing territorial dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of the 800-kilometre border, where both nations claim ancient temples based on a vague 1907 French map. Official tallies indicate at least 25 Thai soldiers and one Thai civilian were killed in the recent hostilities. Cambodia, facing a military with superior firepower, reported 21 civilian deaths. Phnom Penh has reported no military deaths, though an official Facebook post showed first lady Pich Chanmony atte­nding a funeral for troops. This ceasefire follows three days of talks convened after a crisis meeting of foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. International powers also pressed for a resolution. In Beijing, the foreign ministry stated that the ceasefire “demonstrates that dialogue and consultations are a realistic and effective way of resolving complex disputes”. China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, is scheduled to host the Cambodian and Thai foreign ministers for talks in Yunnan province on Jan 28-29. UN human rights chief Volker Turk said he hoped the ceasefire “will pave the way for confidence building and peace”. Despite the halt in combat, the countries still must resolve the border demarcation. An earlier agreement in October, witnessed by Trump, broke down within months as each side accused the other of instigating fresh violence. Published in Dawn, December 28th, 2025",
