      "summary_orig": "Nigeria on Sunday suggested a meeting between its President Bola Ahmed Tinubu and his US counterpart Donald Trump, after the United States’ leader threatened military action over what he described as a threat to Nigerian Christians. In an explosive post, Trump said on social media on Saturday that he asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack in Nigeria, one day after warning that Christianity was “facing an existential threat” in Africa’s most populous country. Nigeria, which is almost evenly divided between a Muslim-majority north and a largely Christian south, is embroiled in numerous conflicts that experts say have killed both Christians and Muslims without distinction. In his post, Trump said that if Nigeria does not stem the killings, the United States will attack and “it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our cherished Christians”. Screengrab from Donald Trump’s Truth Social post Tinubu’s spokesman Daniel Bwala told AFP on Sunday that “Nigeria is the US’s partner in the global fight against terrorism. When leaders meet, there would be better outcomes. Nigeria welcomes US support to fight terrorism as long as it respects our territorial integrity. “We do not see the [Trump’s social media post] in the literal sense. We know that Donald Trump has his own style of communication,” he added, suggesting the post was a way to “force a sit-down between the two leaders so they can iron out a common front to fight their insecurity”. Earlier, Bwala had suggested in a post on X that the two leaders could meet soon. “As for the differences as to whether terrorists in Nigeria target only Christians or in fact all faiths and no faiths, the differences if they exist, would be discussed and resolved by the two leaders when they meet in the coming days, either in State House or White House”. Bwala, who was speaking on the phone from Washington, declined to disclose details of any potential meeting Although the US Department of Defence referred Reuters to the White House for comment on Trump’s threat, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth released a social media post of his own. “The Department of War is preparing for action,” Hegseth wrote on X. “Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.” Trump’s post on Nigeria came a day after his administration added Nigeria back to a “Countries of Particular Concern” list of nations that the US says have violated religious freedom. Other nations on the list include China, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, and Pakistan. Before Trump posted his attack threat, Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back against claims of religious intolerance and defended his country’s efforts to protect religious freedom. “The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality, nor does it take into consideration the consistent and sincere efforts of the government to safeguard freedom of religion and beliefs for all Nigerians,” Tinubu said in a statement, citing “constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.” Nigeria’s Foreign Ministry, in a separate statement, vowed to keep fighting violent extremism and said it hoped Washington would remain a close ally, saying it “will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion. Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.” The US military footprint in West Africa was significantly diminished when about 1,000 troops withdrew from Niger last year. While the US sometimes has small groups of troops in the region to take part in drills, the largest US military base on the continent is in East Africa in Djibouti, which hosts over 5,000 troops and is used for operations in the region. Trump put Nigeria on ‘concern list’ during first term Trump had designated Nigeria a country of concern during his first term in the White House. His Democratic successor, Joe Biden, removed it from the US State Department list in 2021. On Friday, Trump said “thousands of Christians” were being killed in Nigeria by “radical Islamists”, but offered no details. Nigeria, which has 200 ethnic groups practising Christianity, Islam and traditional religions, has a long history of peaceful coexistence, but it has also seen flare-ups of violence among groups, often exacerbated by ethnic divisions or conflict over scarce resources. The extremist armed group Boko Haram has also terrorised northeast Nigeria, an insurgency that has killed tens of thousands of people over the past 15 years. Human rights experts have said most Boko Haram victims have been Muslims. US lawmakers such as Representative Tom Cole, a Republican who chairs the US House of Representatives Appropriations Committee, hailed Trump’s move on Friday, citing what they called “the alarming and ongoing persecution of Christians across the country.” The committee’s fiscal 2026 national security appropriations bill included increased funding for international religious freedom programs and support for programs supporting communities in Nigeria targeted by extremist violence. Trump’s redesignation of Nigeria as a country of concern opens the door to a range of policy responses, such as sanctions or waivers, but they are not automatic. Some religious groups pressed Trump for the redesignation in a letter last month, according to a copy on the Hudson Institute think tank’s website. “Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria. Thousands of Christians are being killed. Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter,” Trump wrote without offering any specifics. He also called on the US House of Representatives Appropriations Committee to investigate.",

They also visited PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a hospital in Lahore on Thursday to convince him to join their campaign, but Qureshi is said to have rebuffed their move. However, Fawad claimed on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ today that Qureshi, Ejaz Chaudhry, Yasmin Rashid and Mehmoodur Rasheed — all of whom were jailed following action by authorities over May 9, 2023 riots — had written a letter around three months a ago and shared their stance. He also claimed that he had been meeting Qureshi, Ejaz and Rasheed on multiple occasions. And those who did not visit any of the PTI members in jails were finding this development strange, he added. “Primarily, we agree with the [contents] of the letter written by Shah sahib himself, the letter written by Ejaz Chaudhry sahib ,” he said. He further questioned that if the government would not engage in dialogue with the PTI, what option would the party have other than to stage sit-ins or carry out a protest march. “And the government will stop them.” Fawad also stressed only Qureshi, Rashid, Ejaz, Rasheed, and another PTI leader Omar Cheema, could talk to Imran as they have a “stature”. He said other leaders in the party were also fairly good, but “there is distance between them and Imran”. He said first, political temperatures had to be brought down, for which the “government may take a step forward and the PTI a step backward”. “Let [incarcerated PTI leaders] be out on bail. Give A-class facilities to Imran Khan […] and Bushra Bibi in jail, so that the temperatures come down.” He further claimed that when he met Imran in jail, he told him that people were making money in his name on YouTube and funds were being collected in the name of paying lawyers. He also said he conveyed to Imran that “even these people will not let him come out of jail”. Fawad emphasised that until the PTI and the government would show flexibility in their stances, hostilities between the two would remain. To a question about allegations that Fawad and other leaders part of the political outreach initiative wanted to stay relevant in politics by associating themselves with Imran, he said: “It is true that we want to keep ourselves relevant with Imran Khan. Because whatever the PTI is today, it is because of us. […] All the difficulties and pain was borne by the PTI prior to May 9. I myself stayed in jail for seven months.” On the other hand, he said, neither Sheikh Waqas Akram nor Salman Akram Raja — who are part of the PTI’s current leadership — went to jail even for a day. “They don’t fear minus Imran Khan. What they fear is that our formula is about Imran Khan plus and excludes them,” Fawad alleged. He also claimed that Imran had chosen Usman Buzdar and Mehmood Khan as chief ministers because the ex-premier wanted “nobodies” in positions of authority and wanted to run the provinces himself. Similarly, he said, Imran had appointed “nobodies” in leadership positions in the party so that he could run the PTI himself. Fawad also said that “we have been requesting the [National Assembly] speakers, Senate chairperson and two to four senior ministers. […] We will request them to make the first move. [We will tell them] that when you will give [the PTI’s incarcerated leadership relief], the political temperature will come down then.” He said the best people in the PTI’s leadership were those in jail. “They and the PTI’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leadership together can talk to Imran.” “And even I can talk to Imran Khan. But I will not be allowed [to meet him],” he added. To a question about Qureshi’s lawyer, Rana Mudassar, denying that two other ex-PTI leaders had had no political discussion with the former foreign minister during their visit to the hospital on Thursday, Fawad claimed he had spoken to Mudassar himself and he told him he had given no such statement. Imran Ismail claim Earlier today, Imran Ismail — who was among the three ex-PTI leaders who visited Qureshi on Thursday — insisted that the former foreign minister had agreed that the stalemate in Pakistan’s politics must end. Ismail’s claim has come even when Qureshi’s lawyer Rana Mudassar maintained that no political discussion had taken place between his client and the three former PTI leaders during the “surprise” visit. However, Ismail posted on X today that some had begun to “portray our recent political outreach as a ‘minus formula’ designed to weaken Imran Khan or hijack [the] PTI. Let me be clear: there is no PTI without Imran Khan. He is its founder, face, and force. “Our initiative — undertaken by Mehmood Moulvi, Fawad Chaudhry, and myself — is not a conspiracy. It is a conscious effort to move Pakistan’s politics away from confrontation and back toward reconciliation. The politics of defiance and endless agitation has brought PTI only shrinking space, arrests, and exhaustion. It’s time to pause, reflect, and rebuild.” He claimed that the three of them — who were among several party members left the PTI following a crackdown on the party in the aftermath of May 9 protests — had “privately consulted a number of PTI stalwarts. Almost all admitted that confrontation has failed and that reconciliation is the only way forward.” “When we met Chaudhry Ijaz in Kot Lakhpat Jail and Shah Mehmood Qureshi at PKLI (Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute), both — while firmly standing with Khan — agreed that the stalemate must end. They sought normal political breathing space, not surrender,” Ismail maintained. Qureshi has been indicted in multiple cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots and has remained behind bars since August 2023. He has been hospitalised at PKLI for gallbladder stone complications, his daughter said on Friday. Ismail further stated in the post: “Unfortunately, communication gaps, fear, and the constant social-media heat have blocked any honest conversation within PTI. Meanwhile, self-proclaimed anchors sitting abroad have made a business out of fuelling hostility and confusion, keeping divisions alive for personal gain.” He went on to say that internationally, “Field Marshal Asim Muneer’s growing diplomatic stature has reshaped perceptions of Pakistan. The expectation that foreign powers would automatically align behind Imran Khan did not materialise. The world sees a strong, stable Pakistan — and that strength comes only through political stability at home.” “Let it also be said: if any PTI leader believes that continuing agitation and confrontation is the right path, he should come forward and convince the rest of us who think otherwise. Debate is welcome — but blind confrontation cannot be a permanent political strategy. “Our effort is independent, sincere, and driven purely by conscience. We want normal politics to return, institutions to function, and the temperature to come down. If reconciliation is considered betrayal, so be it. We are thinking from the heart — for PTI’s survival and Pakistan’s stability,“ he added. Later, Fawad also posted on X that “our formula” included Imran and excluded “snakes” in the PTI. “It is moving towards implementation,” he added. Political outreach efforts Ismail, Moulvi and Fawad visited Qureshi at the hospital, ostensibly to convince the incarcerated party vice chairman to join their ‘release Imran Khan campaign’. According to his lawyer Mudassar, the three ex-PTI leaders managed to gain access to Qureshi on Thursday when he was alone in his room. “Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” Mudassar earlier said, adding by the time he got back, the ex-PTI leaders had already gone. He said the visitors stayed only a little over 10 minutes and left without any political discussion with Qureshi. A Dawn report quoted sources as saying that the three former PTI leaders also attempted to give the impression that another ex-party leader, Asad Umar, was also on board with their decision to launch an outreach campaign for Imran’s release. Umar, however, said he was not part of this group. He said he advised the trio against the hospital visit, as it would create friction in the party, while Qureshi’s family would also be disturbed. Similarly, another former PTI leader, Ali Haider Zaidi, has also refuted reports of him “planning a political relaunch”, saying that he had no plans of doing so anytime soon. His clarification came after Daily Ausaf and The Express Tribune reported, citing sources, that senior politicians who were part of the PTI’s “old leadership” were planning to relaunch a political movement calling for Imran’s release. On the other hand, Fawad, in a video message, said the trio of former PTI leaders were trying to bring the political temperature down in the country and make the release of Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, possible, besides getting the right of bail for political prisoners acknowledged in the country. He said they were trying to create an environment in which a dialogue could take place. “The political temperature can come down in the country only if the PTI takes one step back and the government takes a step forward.” He claimed that he had also met Ejaz Chaudhry and other leaders and was happy that they too agreed that the political temperature should come down in the country. He said his group members would meet PML-N senior ministers as well as Maulana Fazlur Rehman. Qureshi’s lawyer, however, termed the remarks by Fawad “deception” and said the former PTI leader did not even visit the incarcerated PTI leadership in the Kot Lakhpat jail, either on Thursday or Friday. He said PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and Omer Sarfraz Cheema were united and standing by Imran Khan, who had repeatedly announced that he would not make any deals with the establishment or the government and would fight his cases on legal grounds. Besides Qureshi, who is expected to undergo a surgical procedure for gallbladder stones next week, Omer Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed are also hospitalised.",

Those heading to the capital had less than an hour left as it pulled out of Peterborough station, at shortly after 7.30pm. But the unremarkable scene soon turned to horror, as bloodied passengers fled through carriages and sought refuge in toilet cubicles. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "New Yorkers will pick a new mayor on Tuesday after an unpredictable race that has drawn attention from far beyond the largest city in the United States, with President Donald Trump branding frontrunner Zohran Mamdani “a communist”. Breakout Democratic Party candidate Mamdani, a naturalised Muslim American who represents Queens in the state legislature, leads former governor and sex assault-accused Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing his party’s primary contest to Mamdani. The Republican party candidate polling in third place is Curtis Sliwa, 71, who has a colourful past as the founder of the Guardian Angels vigilante group, a prolific broadcaster and cat lover. The latest Quinnipiac University poll , conducted from October 23 to 27, gives Mamdani 43 per cent of the vote, followed by Cuomo on 33pc and Sliwa on 14 pc. The race has centred on the cost of living, crime and how each candidate would handle Trump, who has threatened to withhold federal funds from the city. “Mamdani is an unusual political figure and really captures the spirit of the moment. This is a moment where a loud anti-Trump voice in America’s biggest city is going to get news,” Lincoln Mitchell, a politics professor at Columbia University, told AFP . “Frankly, a Muslim candidate for mayor of New York is an enormous story.” Mamdani, 34, has attacked his opponents for Islamophobic rhetoric and smears, calling out both Republicans and Democrats for “anti-Muslim sentiment that has grown so endemic in our city”. New York City Board of Elections data showed 275,006 registered Democrats had cast ballots, as had 46,115 Republicans, along with 42,383 voters unaffiliated with any party in the first five days of early voting, which ends on November 2. Mamdani’s ascent has highlighted the gulf between the left and centre-right of the Democratic Party. New York’s state governor, centrist Kathy Hochul, appeared at a Mamdani rally on October 26 but was drowned out by “tax the rich” chants, an AFP correspondent saw. Hochul has been critical of Mamdani’s proposals to impose a 2pc income tax on New Yorkers making more than $1 million. Mamdani’s rise Mamdani’s unlikely ascent has been fueled by young New Yorkers canvassing for him, with his campaign claiming 90,000 people have volunteered. “It really comes back to people speaking to other New Yorkers about the city that we all love,” Mamdani told ‘The Daily Show’. Teenager Abid Mahdi, a Queens native who leads canvases for Mamdani, told AFP that “when I think of Zohran, I think of what Bernie Sanders was to many Americans in 2016 and 2020. He is my Bernie Sanders in a lot of ways.” Mamdani appeared with leftist standard-bearer Senator Bernie Sanders at a Queens rally on October 26. “I’m 15 right now, I’ll be an adult and paying taxes at 18, right? The majority of laws will apply to me in about three years. So, why should I start caring then?” added Mahdi. Underscoring the importance of older voters who typically turn out in greater numbers than youngsters, Mamdani attended a “paint and pour” session at an elder care home in Brooklyn on Thursday. Torrential rain at the end of the week slowed canvassing, with the three leading candidates touring TV studios in a final push to woo wavering voters. Ahead of the vote, Sliwa appeared in a surreal conservative rap video wearing a suit and his signature red beret. Cuomo, 67, sought on Thursday to court Black and Muslim voters, campaigning in Harlem with current mayor Eric Adams, a corruption-accused Democrat who bowed out, eventually endorsing his former foe Cuomo. There was a stir in the week when a British newspaper published what claimed to be an interview with former mayor and Mamdani backer Bill de Blasio in which he appeared to question the affordability of the Democratic socialist’s spending plans. The article was removed after the former mayor denied speaking to the journalist. A day prior, former Democrat president Barack Obama called Mamdani and offered to be a sounding board if the frontrunner wins the election. He also praised Mamdani’s campaign. The call, first reported by The New York Times , was confirmed by Mamdani’s spokesperson. “Zohran Mamdani appreciated President Obama’s words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city, said Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec.

      "summary_orig": "Half-centuries by Shafali Verma and Deepti Sharma helped India post a competitive 298-7 against South Africa in the Women’s World Cup final in Mumbai on Sunday. Put into bat in a rain-delayed match, India rode on an opening stand of 104 between Smriti Mandhana (45) and Verma, who top-scored with 87, to stay in the hunt for their first title in front of a sell-out home crowd. Sharma hit 58 off 58 balls at the 45,000-capacity DY Patil Stadium - a venue that has produced big runs, including India’s record chase of 339 in the semi-final against Australia. The ODI World Cup is awaiting a new champion with South Africa also eyeing their first crown. Rain held up the start of the match by two hours before South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt won the toss in her team’s first final in the tournament. Hosts India soon took charge with the left-handed Mandhana and Verma hitting regular boundaries to take the attack to the opposition bowlers. South Africa introduced spin in the 17th over and Chloe Tyron struck in the next over with her left-arm orthodox bowling to send back in-form Mandhana, caught behind. Swashbuckling opener Verma, who came in as replacement for injured Pratika Rawal in the semi-final, reached her fifty. Verma survived a reprieve on 56 when Anneke Bosch dropped a simple catch at deep mid-wicket off spinner Sune Luus, to the delight of the Indian fans. Medium-pace bowler Ayabonga Khaka dismissed Verma when she got the batter holed out at mid-off . In the next over took down semi-final hero Jemimah Rodrigues, for 24, to check India’s surge. Sharma and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur got down to the grind to rebuild the innings, in the face of tidy South African bowling. Harmanpreet and then Amanjot Kaur departed as India seemed to fall behind on a high-scoring pitch but Sharma was joined by Richa Ghosh, who hit 34, and the two took on the bowling. India, runners-up in 2005 and 2017, are playing their in third final. Earlier, rain and a wet outfield delayed the toss by 30 minutes to 3pm (2:30pm PKT) with the start revised to 3:30pm. India have been runners-up twice, in 2005 and 2017, and reached their third final after beating seven-time champions Australia in a thriller. South Africa’s women are in their first ODI World Cup final after they beat four-time winners England in the other semi-final. Speaking ahead of the decider, Harmanpreet Kaur said winning the World Cup could be a turning point for the women’s game in the cricket-crazy country. “Last time when we reached the final and came back to India we saw a big change,” Kaur told reporters on Saturday. “Women’s cricket moved ahead and we saw many girls on the ground. “So I am sure that if we win this final, we will see many more changes and we will see more cricket, not only on the international level but also on the domestic level.” “So I think we are really looking forward to that moment when we will see women’s cricket in a more serious manner and we will see more girls (playing),” she said. View this post on Instagram Indian players like Kaur and Smriti Mandhana have become household names in the world’s most populous nation since the Women’s Premier League T20 tournament began in 2023. Jemimah Rodrigues played a champion’s knock with an unbeaten 127 to help India chase down a record 339 against holders Australia in the semi-finals. “I think it’s a proud moment for me and the entire team,” Kaur said. “I am sure the entire country must be also very proud of the way we have played the last two games and, yeah, it’s a big day.” Wolvaardt said the pressure on the home team could work in South Africa’s favour at DY Patil Stadium, which has a capacity of 45,000. “I think with the whole crowd behind India, probably a sold-out stadium, it’s going to be a very exciting opportunity,” Wolvaardt said. “But at the same time, I think it puts a lot of pressure on them as well. So yeah, I think it sort of plays in our favour, hopefully.” Only Australia, England and New Zealand have ever won the tournament since it began in 1973. Kaur said a new champion will be good for the sport. “Because of that we are seeing more excitement,” she said. “And for us to reach the final is also very special, not only for us but for the Indian fans who have been a big support for us.”",

      "summary_orig": "Three cops, including a station house officer (SHO), were injured in a blast caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Doaba area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu district on Sunday, police said. Abbas Majeed, the regional police officer in Kohat division, confirmed these details to Dawn , further stating that a police convoy was targeted in the IED attack. He added that SHO Imranuddin was among the three injured policemen. Separately, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Office said the provincial chief executive, Sohail Afridi, had taken notice of the incident and sought a\ndetailed report from the KP inspector general of police. He directed that the injured policemen be provided immediate medical treatment, the statement said, adding that the CM paid tribute to the police personnel’s “courage and sense of duty”. The CM further directed that security in the province be tightened and strictly monitor suspicious elements. “Elements involved in [such] cowardly attacks will be taken to task,” the statement quoted him as saying. Today’s incident has taken place as Pakistan continues to grapple with terrorism. A rise in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan, was particularly witnessed after banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022. Ending the agreement, the TTP had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel. In one such incident, three cops, including a superintendent of police (SP), were martyred when back-to-back blasts rocked Hangu on October 24. According to the police, the TTP was behind those blasts as well. Previously, on Oct 19, law enforcers had foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in KP’s Bannu district. According to police, the failed attack was carried out by the TTP and targeted the Baka Khel police station, and three terrorists were killed as cops opened fire on them. A day prior to that, on Oct 18, unkn­own assailants had launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan. According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the Frontier Corps personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident. On the night of Oct 17, police had also intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.",

On the night of Oct 17, police had also intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.",

      "summary": "Three cops, including a station house officer (SHO), were injured in a blast caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Doaba area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu district on Sunday, police said. Abbas Majeed, the regional police officer in Kohat division, confirmed these details to Dawn , further stating that a police convoy was targeted in the IED attack. He added that SHO Imranuddin was among the three injured policemen. Separately, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Office said the provincial chief executive, Sohail Afridi, had taken notice of the incident and sought a\ndetailed report from the KP inspector general of police. He directed that the injured policemen be provided immediate medical treatment, the statement said, adding that the CM paid tribute to the police personnel’s “courage and sense of duty”. The CM further directed that security in the province be tightened and strictly monitor suspicious elements. “Elements involved in [such] cowardly attacks will be taken to task,” the statement quoted him as saying. Today’s incident has taken place as Pakistan continues to grapple with terrorism. A rise in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan, was particularly witnessed after banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022. Ending the agreement, the TTP had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel. In one such incident, three cops, including a superintendent of police (SP), were martyred when back-to-back blasts rocked Hangu on October 24. According to the police, the TTP was behind those blasts as well. Previously, on Oct 19, law enforcers had foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in KP’s Bannu district. According to police, the failed attack was carried out by the TTP and targeted the Baka Khel police station, and three terrorists were killed as cops opened fire on them. A day prior to that, on Oct 18, unkn­own assailants had launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan. According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the Frontier Corps personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident. On the night of Oct 17, police had also intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.",

      "summary_orig": "British police said on Sunday that a knife attack on a train, which put 11 people in hospital, was not a terrorist incident, adding that two men —  both British nationals —  had been arrested. Counterterrorism police had helped with the initial investigation after the mass stabbing of passengers on a train in eastern England on Saturday. “At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,” Superintendent John Loveless from British Transport Police told the media on Sunday. The two men arrested on suspicion of attempted murder were a 32-year-old male, a Black British national, and a 35-year-old British national of Caribbean descent, Loveless said. Both were born in the UK, he added. “We continue to work to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident,” he said. “It would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause.” Armed police board train The arrests were made by armed police after the train made an emergency stop at Huntingdon, around 80 miles (130 km) north of London. Of the 11 people hospitalised, four have since been discharged, and two patients remain in a life-threatening condition, police said. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it an “appalling incident” which was “deeply concerning”, while King Charles said he was “truly appalled and shocked”. Knife crime in England and Wales has risen 87 per cent over the past decade, with 54,587 offences last year alone, a two per cent rise from 2023 and among the highest rates in Europe, according to figures from Britain’s interior ministry show. In her statement, Interior Minister Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened”, while urging people to avoid speculation about the incident. The government is keen to stop rumours spreading on social media following an incident in Southport in northwest England in 2024, when internet claims over the murder of three young girls sparked days of rioting across the country. Blood on all the chairs Witness Olly Foster told the BBC that he was on the train which was heading towards London on Saturday evening when someone ran past him saying a man was stabbing “everyone, everything”. “I put my hand on this chair…and then I look at my hand, and it’s covered in blood. And then I look at the chair, and there’s blood all over the chair. And then I look ahead and there’s blood on all the chairs,” he said. Another witness told Sky News that a suspect was seen waving a large knife before being tasered by police. Britain’s current threat level from terrorism is rated as “substantial” by security services, meaning an attack is considered “likely”. After a number of serious attacks in 2017, Britain has had some quieter years in the 2020s, although last month three people were killed when a synagogue was attacked in Manchester.",

Hamas and Israel signed a ceasefire agreement on October 9, agreeing to free the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. Pakistan was one of the eight Muslim countries, along with Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt, that worked with Trump’s administration on the plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. Despite signing the deal, Tel Aviv has resumed its attacks on Gaza. On Friday, the Israeli military attacked the Gaza Strip for a fourth consecutive day, killing three people. During the Istanbul meeting, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza, as well as the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, the FO statement said. “Pakistan will also reiterate the need for collective efforts aimed at achieving an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative,” it added. Pakistan has been, and will continue to be, committed to efforts to restore peace, justice, and dignity to the Palestinian people, as well as to ensure the realisation of their right to self-determination, the statement further stated.",

Pakistan was one of the eight Muslim countries, along with Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt, that worked with Trump’s administration on the plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. Despite signing the deal, Tel Aviv has resumed its attacks on Gaza. On Friday, the Israeli military attacked the Gaza Strip for a fourth consecutive day, killing three people. During the Istanbul meeting, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza, as well as the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, the FO statement said. “Pakistan will also reiterate the need for collective efforts aimed at achieving an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative,” it added. Pakistan has been, and will continue to be, committed to efforts to restore peace, justice, and dignity to the Palestinian people, as well as to ensure the realisation of their right to self-determination, the statement further stated.",

Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period. “In view of security threats, public processions and sit-ins can be soft targets for terrorists,” the home department said in its statement. “Malignant elements can take advantage of public protests and carry out anti-state activities to fulfil their nefarious intentions.” It added that a complete ban has been imposed on the display of all types of weapons across Punjab. “There is also a complete ban on the use of loudspeakers under Section 144,” it said. Furthermore, as per the statement, there is a complete ban on the publication and distribution of inflammatory, hateful or sectarian material. The department detailed that the decision to extend the implementation of Section 144 was taken to maintain law and order as well as to protect human lives and property. “The Punjab government issued orders in view of the concerns of terrorism and public order,” it said, clarifying that the ban does not apply to wedding ceremonies, funerals, and burials. Moreover, officers and officials present on official duties and courts are also exempted from the ban, while loudspeakers can be used only for Azan and Friday sermons, the statement added. The ban was initially imposed on October 8 for 10 days and then for further seven days on October 18. The decision to extend the ban for another seven days was taken by the Cabinet Committee for Law and Order in its 39th meeting held at the home department due to security threats amid continuing tensions with the banned religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). Later on October 25, the Punjab government extended the imposition of Section 144 for another week.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday said the government would take steps to ensure effective investigation, justice, and prosecution in cases of crimes against journalists. His remarks came on the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. The day, observed on November 2, highlights the need for justice in cases where journalists are attacked or killed. This year’s observance draws attention to the online threats faced by women journalists and the broader chilling impact these have on freedom of expression. “Today reminds us that a free, informed, and responsible press is the foundation of any democratic society,” the prime minister said in a statement. “Journalists enable public access to facts and are torchbearers of truth. Violence, threats, or reprisals against them while performing their duties are attacks on freedom of expression. “I pay tribute to journalists who faced hardships for truth and solidarity with families of media workers who lost loved ones in the line of duty.” He added that the Government of Pakistan was committed to protecting press freedom and providing a safe environment for journalists. “We will take measures to ensure effective investigation, justice, and prosecution of crimes against journalists. “I appeal to the international community, media organisations, and civil society to play their role in protecting journalists and promoting freedom of expression. A free press guarantees a strong, transparent, and democratic Pakistan.” Pakistan is consistently ranked as one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists due to frequent threats, physical attacks, and a pervasive culture of impunity for perpetrators. In the 2025 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Pakistan was ranked 158th out of 180 countries. A day prior, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) condemned the worsening situation for media professionals in Pakistan. A delegation from the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) held talks with IFJ President Dominique Pradalié and Secretary General Anthony Bellanger at the Syndicat National des Journalistes (SNJ) headquarters in Paris, according to a statement issued from Islamabad on Saturday. “The IFJ leaders expressed deep concern over targeted killings of journalists, misuse of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) to file cases against media workers, undeclared censorship, harassment by state and non-state actors, forced layoffs, and non-payment of salaries,” the statement said. “They urged Pakistan’s president, prime minister, and top judge to take immediate notice, warning that inaction could prompt an appeal to the United Nations for intervention.” During the meeting, the PFUJ delegation, including Secretary General Shakeel Ahmed, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists President Tariq Usmani, and Foreign Committee Head Waseem Shahzad Qadri, briefed the IFJ leaders on ground realities.",
