      "summary_orig": "• At least one person killed, policeman among dozen injured • JKJAAC, ‘peace rally’ participants accuse each other of fomenting violence • Protest leaders call for another gathering at Lal Chowk today MUZAFFARABAD: At least one person was killed and over a dozen others were injured — including a policeman — in the Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) capital on Monday, as the region observed a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike amid a communications blackout. The strike, called by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) over the issue of its unfulfilled charter of demands, saw rival groups stage simultaneous protests, which accused each other of fomenting violence during an otherwise peaceful demonstration. Mobile and internet services have remained suspended in AJK since Sunday noon, and sources said the curbs could continue until Wednesday. The casualties occurred around Neelum Bridge after midday, when a ‘peace rally’ led by Muslim Conference leader Raja Saqib Majeed clashed with the JKJAAC protesters who were gathered there. The strike was announced last week, after JKJAAC-government negotiations remained deadlocked over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Witness accounts Witnesses claimed that participants of the peace rally fired upon peaceful JKJAAC demonstrators “without any provocation”. Ghulam Mustafa, a bystander, said one bullet hit Mohammad Sudheer, 30, who owned a crockery shop at Tahli Mandi Road. “By the time we reached CMH, he had lost consciousness due to excessive bleeding,” he said. An official at the Combined Military Hospital confirmed that Sudheer died during treatment. Mohammad Basharat, 50, a shopkeeper in Shokat Lines, was wounded by shrapnel. He claimed that demonstrators had tried to make space to let Mr Majeed’s convoy pass, but said that members of his posse came out of their vehicles and attacked them. According to another eyewitness, the peace rally was protected by police and paramilitary troops. Police lobbed tear-gas shell on JAC demonstrators, and fired at them. People at the hospital showed spent bullet casings, which they said they had collected them from the ground while trying to rescue injured people. “When the action committee had already given a call for lockdown for Sept 29, why was Mr Majeed allowed to hold a so-called peace march on the same day?” questioned 20-year-old shopkeeper Raja Safeer, who was among those in the emergency ward. Due to the communications blackout, neither local officials nor Mr Majeed could not be reached for comment. Incidentally, some local media reports suggested that the peace rally had been fired upon by JAC protesters, but this could not be independently verified. Another gathering today Later in the evening, hundreds of people gathered at Muzafarrabad’s Lal Chowk, where JAC leaders including Shaukat Nawaz Mir delivered charged speeches. Mr Mir alleged that some elements wanted to create a May 9- like situation in AJK for reasons best known to them, and urged the army chief to take stock of the situation. Mr Mir called on the charged crowd to reassemble at the same spot at 11am today (Tuesday) for the next course of action. All businesses and shops remained shuttered and street vendors away almost across the AJK, while roads also remained deserted. Reports also suggested that similar gatherings were staged in Rawalakot and Sudhnoti, while in Bhimber, a rally was led by PM Chaudhry Anwarul Haq’s brother, Ehsanul Haq, who is associated with the PTI.

      "summary_orig": "Gaza will be a de-radicalised terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors. Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough. If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal. Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all [prisoners], alive and deceased, will be returned. Once all [prisoners] are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1,700 Gazans who were detained after Oct 7, 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans. As released by the White House Once all [prisoners] are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries. Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the Jan 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads. Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the Jan. 19, 2025, agreement. Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the “Board of Peace,” which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump’s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment. A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza. A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries. No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza. Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors. A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people. The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A de-confliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties. Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the United States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat. In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF. An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence to try and change mind-sets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace. While Gaza redevelopment advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people. The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence. Published in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",

A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people. The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A de-confliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties. Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and time frames linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the United States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat. In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF. An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful coexistence to try and change mind-sets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace. While Gaza redevelopment advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people. The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence. Published in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",
      "title": "Full text of ‘Comprehensive Plan to End Gaza Conflict’",
      "summary": "Gaza will be a de-radicalised terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors. Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough. If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal. Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all [prisoners], alive and deceased, will be returned. Once all [prisoners] are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1,700 Gazans who were detained after Oct 7, 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans. As released by the White House Once all [prisoners] are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries. Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the Jan 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads. Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the Jan. 19, 2025, agreement. Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the “Board of Peace,” which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump’s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment. A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza. A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries. No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza. Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed on a proposal to end the Gaza conflict and thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for their support of the plan. In less than two years, Israel’s onslaught on Gaza has killed at least 65,549 people and wounded 167,518, besides displacing millions from their areas. Earlier this month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement. Trump announced Netanyahu’s agreement to his plan at a press conference in Washington, DC, ahead of which the White House had released Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza. Addressing the press conference, Trump said this was a “big, big day”. “The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were\nwith us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a\nstatement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump stated. “They\nback this 100 per cent. “Things that have been going on for hundreds of years, thousands of years … at minimum, we are very, very close and beyond very close,” Trump said, thanking Netanyahu for his role in the peace process. “We worked well together, and have with many other countries, which is how this situation gets solved.” Trump said that he was aiming for peace in the Middle East at large, not just the Gaza Strip. He added that he and Netanyahu discussed issues like Iran, the Abraham Accords and ending the Gaza conflict. “This is part of the bigger picture, which is peace in the Middle East … let’s call it ‘eternal’ peace in the Middle East,” he said. @dawn.today United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is visiting the White House, is “very close” to agreeing on a deal to end the Gaza conflict. Addressing a press conference, Trump said this was a “big, big day”. “The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump stated. “They back this 100 per cent.” The US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for “trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction” in the region.

The US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for “trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction” in the region. “If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages immediately, but in no case, more than 72 hours,” Trump said. “The hostages are coming back.” Trump said this means “an immediate end to the war itself”. “Under the plan, Arab and Muslim countries have committed … to demilitarise Gaza quickly, decommission the military capabilities of Hamas and all other terror organisations and we are relying on the countries we named and others  to deal with Hamas and I’m hearing Hamas wants to get this done too.” ‘New transitional authority’ Trump added that as part of the agreement, “terror infrastructure”, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, would be dismantled and local police forces would be trained in the Gaza Strip. “Working with the new transitional authority in Gaza, all parties will agree on a timeline for Israeli forces to withdraw in phases … no more shooting hopefully,” Trump stated. “Arab and Muslim nations need to be allowed a chance of fulfilling these commitments of dealing with Hamas. They are the one group I have not dealt with,” he added. “If Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible … I have a feeling that we’re going to have a positive answer, but if not, as you know Bibi (Netanyahu) you have my full backing to do what you have to do. The US president emphasised that ultimately, the goal is to eliminate any danger in the reason, which he attributed to Hamas. “To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for the creation of a new international oversight body,” he said, calling it the ‘Board of Peace’ and stating that it would be led by Arab leaders, Israel and Trump himself. “We’re going to do it right, we’re going to put leaders from other countries on and leaders who are very distinguished,” Trump said. “One of the people who wants to be on the Board is the UK former prime minister Tony Blair.” Trump said there would be more leaders and that their names would be announced in the coming days. He added that the World Bank would be charged with training and recruiting a new government made up of Palestinians and “highly qualified experts from around the world”. “Hamas and other terror organisations will play no role in the governance of Gaza, at all,” he stated. “It’s time to get our hostages back and try to build something very great and very important.” However, Trump noted that Netanyahu remains opposed to a Palestinian state but said what he is doing today would be good for Israel. He added that the Israeli public wanted an end to the fighting and the return of the hostages. “Some other countries have foolishly recognised a Palestinian state … but I think they’re very tired of what’s [been] going on for so many decades,” he said. “The people of Israel want it (an end to the fighting). “I challenge the Palestinians to take charge of their destiny,” Trump added. “If the Palestinian Authority does not complete my reforms … they only have themselves to blame.” ‘Maybe, Iran can join the Abraham Accords’ Trump added that this agreement would bring a sustainable, long-term peace and added that “maybe Iran can even get in there”, in relation to the Abraham Accords. “They could be a member,” Trump added. “I long ago said that Iran would be a member of the Accords. “This is the closest we’ve ever come to real peace.” “The leaders discussed a proposal for ending the war in Gaza, prospects for a more secure Middle East, and the need for greater understanding between their countries,” the White House said before a news conference with Trump and the Israeli prime minister. Trump added that Netanyahu expressed regret for an Israeli attack in Doha to Qatar’s leader in a three-way call in the Oval Office. “Bibi was talking to Prime Minister al-Thani of Qatar … they really had a heart-to-heart conversation,” the US president said. “We agreed to launch a formal trilateral mechanism between Israel, Qatar and the United States to begin a dialogue to enhance mutual security, correct misperceptions and avoid future misgivings.” Trump said it was time for Hamas to accept the terms of the proposal, noting that with their leadership mostly killed during the Gaza conflict, Hamas were “not the same people” the US was dealing with. “Everybody who wants to see an end to the violence and destruction should be united and calling for Hamas to accept the extremely fair proposal, so that we can end the war and get us back our hostages right now and have everlasting peace,” Trump declared. A new beginning for Gaza and the region: Netanyahu Taking the floor, Netanyahu thanked Trump for his hospitality and for his friendship and leadership. “While you focus at home on making America great again, your leadership abroad is changing the world for the better: ending wars and advancing peace,” the Israeli PM said. “I believe that today, we are taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East and I think beyond the Middle East — very important Muslim countries. “I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims,” Netanyahu said to Trump. “It will bring back to Israel all of our hostages, dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities and its political rule and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a joint press conference with US President Donald Trump (not pictured) in the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, DC, the US on September 29. — Reuters Netanyahu added that the plan would not have been achieved without the “courage and sacrifice of our incredibly brave soldiers”, calling the conflict “a war between civilisation and barbarism”. “We are taking the next step to win the war and expand the peace,” he stated. “Your (Trump’s) plan is consistent with the five principles my government set for the end of the war and the day after Hamas. “Here’s our plan: all of our hostages, both those who are alive and those who died, will return home immediately. Hamas will be disarmed. Gaza will be demilitarised. Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter for the foreseeable future. And lastly, Gaza will have a peaceful civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas, or the Palestinian Authority.” Netanyahu said that if Hamas agrees to the plan, the first step would be a “modest withdrawal” and the release of all hostages within 72 hours. “The next step will be the establishment of an international body charged with fully disarming Hamas and demilitarising Gaza,” he added, expressing appreciation for Trump leading the body. “If this international body succeeds, we will have permanently ended the war. Israel will conduct further withdrawals linked to the extent of disarmament and demilitarisation, but will remain within the security perimeter for the foreseeable future.” However, Netanyahu said that if Hamas rejects or violates the agreement, then Israel “will finish the job by itself”. “This can be done the easy way … or the hard way, but it will be done. We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done.” Netanyahu added that after Trump’s statement at the UN General Assembly, he was encouraged against recognising Palestine, stating that it would “reward terrorists, undermine security and endanger Israel’s very existence”. “I appreciate your (Trump’s) firm position that the PA can have no role in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,” he stated. Netanyahu said that there needs to be a fundamental change, which would include ending “pay-to-slay”, changing Palestinian textbooks that “teach hatred [of] Jews”, ending “lawfare” at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court and stopping incitement in the media among “many, many other reforms”. He added that Trump’s proposal presents a “practical and realistic path forward” in which Gaza would be administered by “those committed to genuine peace with Israel”. “I think this can be not only a new beginning for Gaza [but] a new beginning for the entire region,” the Israeli PM said, adding that the plan could reenergise the Abraham Accords. PM Shehbaz welcomes Gaza plan Earlier, PM Shehbaz said in a post on X that he welcomed Trump’s plan to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end. His statement came as the US president greeted Netanyahu at the White House for talks on the US-led peace plan.

Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz posted on X: “I welcome President Trump’s 20-point [ sic ] plan to ensure an end to the war in Gaza. “I am also convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region,” the PM wrote. He added, “It is also my firm belief that President Trump is fully prepared to assist in whatever way necessary to make this extremely important and urgent understanding to become a reality.” PM Shehbaz also lauded “Trump’s leadership and [his] special envoy Steve Witkoff for their efforts in bringing an end to the nearly two-year-long conflict”. “I also strongly believe that the implementation of the two-state proposal is essential to ensure lasting peace in the region,” he added. Earlier in the day, he also spoke to Pakistani journalists in London, where he spoke about Trump’s meeting with Muslims leaders on Gaza in New York last week. The meeting on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia, who discussed Trump’s proposal for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. During his interaction with journalists in London today, PM Shehbaz “a very constructive discussion took place” at the meeting. He added, “As a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire.” Additional input from AFP and Reuters",

He added, “As a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire.” Additional input from AFP and Reuters",

      "title_orig": "‘It is Punjab’s water’: Maryam resurrects Cholistan canals issue amid rift with PPP",
      "summary_orig": "In her latest censure of the PPP, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday resurrected the issue of the contentious Cholistan canals project , saying the water that would have been diverted towards the desert belonged to her province. “If Punjab wants construct canals for its water, why are you bothered? It is Punjab’s water. It belongs to the people, farmers and fields of Punjab,” she said at the inauguration ceremony of an electric bus service in Faisalabad. “If I want to create canals, why do you object to it?” she questioned. “I wouldn’t have stolen water. I would have [used] them to create waterways and developed Cholistan,” she continued, taking a fresh jibe at her party’s coalition partner in the Centre. The now-shelved canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between the Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. The project aimed to irrigate a total of 4.8 million acres of barren land by constructing six canals — two each in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab. Five of those canals would have been built on the Indus River, while the sixth would have been constructed along the Sutlej River, supplying approximately 4,120 cusecs of water to irrigate the Cholistan desert in Punjab. Maryam and Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir had inaugurated the project to irrigate south Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh. What was being hailed as a game-changer for Punjab had triggered an uproar in Sindh, which believed the scheme would have further disturb the ecological balance in the province and deprived it of its mandated water share. After months of protests from various fragments of society as well as opposition from Sindh , the federal government had announced on April 23 that it was halting the project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the Council of Common Interests — a key body tasked with resolving power-sharing disputes between the federal and provincial governments. The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Then, on April 28, CCI meeting had endorsed the federal government’s move to halt the initiative until “mutual understanding” could be achieved among provinces. As Maryam resurrected the issue during her speech again, the Punjab CM mentioned flood relief and the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) — the latest cause of dispute between the PPP and PML-N over flood relief. The PPP and PML-N have lately been arguing over the means for flood relief, with the PPP insisting on the use of BISP and the PML-N disapproving the proposition. Reiterating her argument that funds given under the BISP were insufficient for flood relief, she, once again rejected the PPP’s proposition to seek international assistance to help people affected by recent floods in Punjab. “Keep your advice to yourself,” she rebuked, adding the seeking international help was not the only solution. “Punjab never interferes in your matters, so you don’t interfere in Punjab’s matters,” she said.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said his government nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize because “he helped save the region from destruction” during a period of Pakistan-India escalation. The Pakistani government in June had decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” to end the India-Pakistan escalation in May. The conflict began after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, launched airstrikes in Pakistan, and faced retaliation . Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations. Responding to a reporter’s question about Pakistan nominating Trump for the Nobel Prize during a press conference in London today, the PM said, “Mr Trump eased tension between Pakistan and India and has saved the region from major destruction.” He emphasised that if Trump had not intervened in the Pakistan-India escalation, “there would be more destruction and loss of lives.” The premier added that Trump has eased tension between Ethiopia and Egypt, and even in Ukraine.” ‘Washington visit very fruitful’ Speaking about his recent meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, PM Shehbaz said that his visit to Washington “was very fruitful; it was very successful.” He said the best thing that happened was that in the UN building, President Trump co-chaired a meeting on Gaza, and he invited Pakistan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia. “There, a very constructive discussion took place, and as a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire,” he said. “Since 2023 in Gaza, the market of oppression and tyranny has been heated, and innocent Muslims are being martyred, including children, mothers, sisters, and youngsters. I believe that this much cruelty and intensity has rarely been witnessed in modern times, and for that, alhamdulillah, we have raised a strong voice at the UN and expressed complete solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.” Conflict with India PM Shehbaz said that during his meeting with Trump, he also talked about the escalation with India, and how New Delhi weaponised the Indus Waters Treaty against the people of Pakistan. “[I talked about] the way our forces defeated India and, by the grace of Almighty Allah, made India learn a lesson which they will remember for a lifetime,” he said. “I also said that Pakistan won the war, by the grace of God, through our brave armed forces, who fought with great courage and outstanding professional equipment, led by Field Marshal Saeed Asim Munir, who led from the front and whose resolve was unwavering, and the entire nation was behind our own forces. “And our air forces, led by Air Marshal Zaheer Babar and his brave fighters, made a strong defence. The world came to realise that not only is Pakistan a nuclear power, but purely meant for our defence. And now the purpose: Pakistan is also very accomplished in traditional warfare, conservative warfare.” 2025 floods The premier said that while the country’s economy had become stabilised on a macro level, the effects of climate change were taking their toll. He talked about the massive floods in the country that have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery. “Unfortunately, due to climate change, which caused the recent floods, there has been much destruction,” he said. “In 2022, it caused devastation in Sindh; this time Punjab became the target of this flood due to which more than 1,000 people lost their lives, hundreds of thousands of people were injured, thousands of remote areas were submerged, farms were destroyed, and installations suffered immense damage, for which, at this time, we are collecting data to see how much loss has occurred. “But our spirits are high and we are facing this completely, and Inshallah we will overcome this and move forward,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Members of the Parliamentary Reporters Association of Pakistan (PRA) on Monday staged a mass walkout from a session of the National Assembly, over senior journalist Ijaz Ahmed allegedly being subjected to misbehaviour by PTI founder Imran Khan. According to Ahmed, who spoke to Dawn.com , the walkout was organised by the PRA Pakistan’s Election Committee. “[The] PTI founder hurled abuse at me for asking questions,” Ahmed said. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq directed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to hold talks with PRA. During the walkout, the speaker noted that the PRA submitted a written complaint over the issue, which Tarar spoke about during his address. Later, the National Assembly released visuals of Ahmed meeting with Speaker Sadiq in his office. “It is your (reporters) right to protest and politics and journalism have a deep relationship,” the minister said, requesting that the reporters listen to what he has to say. “You have a valid complaint.” “A senior member of the PRA was involved in a verbal altercation at Adiala Jail with a senior leader who hurled foul language at him,” the law minister stated, not mentioning the PTI founder by name. “It is the job of reporters and journalists to criticise us and show us our reflection in the mirror. We should take this criticism to heart and not silence or attack them.” Tarar said that Ahmed requested the speaker’s office for permission to speak with Imran at Adiala and requested protection. “After the discussion and the way he (Ahmed) was abused, there was a social media onslaught targeting him,” Tarar added. “Posts said ‘Look at this man’s face’, ‘don’t forgive him’ and ‘look what he said about our Quaid ’. “This is a distinguished House and I must request that we behave democratically,” he said. “We need to prove through our own attitudes that we listen to other people and that there is room for decency and politics in this House.” PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri noted in her address that Ahmed is a renowned journalist in Islamabad and has links to Sindh. “In terms of his reporting, he is a decent journalist,” she said. “We may have differences of opinion, but in terms of his reporting and ethics, he is commendable.” Marri added that journalists expose problems plaguing the country and face issues while doing so. She also condemned people posting Ahmed’s face on social media and “making him a target of hate”. “We keep saying that they criticise politicians, but we criticise each other for not protecting journalists. Why do we forget to offer them protection?” After a recess, Ahmed himself spoke on the floor of the House and said that he had gone to Adiala Jail on the speaker’s request and heard from Khan about his treatment at Adiala Jail. “We told him that we would speak about this on the floor of the House,” Ahmed said. “He (Imran) had two demands: the first being that Ahmed speak about how no PTI members were part of an opposition delegation to visit him in jail. The other was that he wanted a resolution passed about this incident.” Imran also demanded that the Sindh government launch a “high-level investigation” into the murder of anchorperson Imtiaz Mir. Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) MNA Syed Aminul Haque, who was a part of the delegation, alleged that Imran hurled threats and foul language at Ahmed. “Immediately afterwards, we saw him being trolled on social and digital media,” Haque said, adding that the MQM condemned the incident. “People were trying to get his address and threaten his family. Journalists have a right to ask questions. People are free not to answer, but to threaten them and be rude is undemocratic.” A resolution was presented before the House condemning the verbal altercation and stating that not only did Imran use harsh language, but also launched a social media campaign against Ahmed and other senior journalists. It demanded that Ahmed and other journalists receive immediate protection, legal action be taken against those responsible and also condemned Mir’s murder in Karachi, demanding an investigation into the shooting. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, however, requested that the resolution not be presented because it would “ruin the atmosphere of the House”. “We pay tribute to the media; they have played a key role in highlighting our struggles and raising their voices for the people,” he said. “I was not able to meet [Imran] Khan sahib , so I wanted to know what happened. I reached to three of their (PRA) people. “A limited number of people are allowed at Adiala Jail,” he added. “We don’t know the exact words he used. We do not know what happened, we don’t even know what happens during jail trials.” The resolution was adopted after a vote, however, there was booing and hollering heard in the House. “If you are saying no, does that mean you are saying that what happened with Ijaz Ahmed was right?” Speaker Sadiq asked after the resolution was passed. Tarar took the floor once again, stating that he is one of those who has always tried to ensure that there is no pressure on the media. “We heard what the PTI chairman said and we will not say anything distressing, but a journalist came and spoke in parliament saying that he was called an ‘agent’,” he said. “We need to see how people who raise their voices are treated.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in May 9 cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act.",

PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, however, requested that the resolution not be presented because it would “ruin the atmosphere of the House”. “We pay tribute to the media; they have played a key role in highlighting our struggles and raising their voices for the people,” he said. “I was not able to meet [Imran] Khan sahib , so I wanted to know what happened. I reached to three of their (PRA) people. “A limited number of people are allowed at Adiala Jail,” he added. “We don’t know the exact words he used. We do not know what happened, we don’t even know what happens during jail trials.” The resolution was adopted after a vote, however, there was booing and hollering heard in the House. “If you are saying no, does that mean you are saying that what happened with Ijaz Ahmed was right?” Speaker Sadiq asked after the resolution was passed. Tarar took the floor once again, stating that he is one of those who has always tried to ensure that there is no pressure on the media. “We heard what the PTI chairman said and we will not say anything distressing, but a journalist came and spoke in parliament saying that he was called an ‘agent’,” he said. “We need to see how people who raise their voices are treated.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in May 9 cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act.",

It invokes Sections 395 (punishment for dacoity), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy a house), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 324 (attempt to commit murder), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of a common object) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. In the FIR, the complainant said he, along with other policemen, was patrolling and checking security arrangements at Bhalowali Chowk on Sunday when they received reports around 8pm of some people having riled others up against the Ahmadi community and gathering them in large numbers at Piro Chak village. There were also reports of them looting and setting properties on fire. “When I reached the spot, around 200-250 people armed with weapons and sticks were present there,” he said, adding that upon seeing the police, they lunged toward them and snatched weapons from two of the policemen. According to the FIR, it was not possible for the police to immediately control the mob as law enforcement personnel were few in number. “So, I contacted the control room after which more personnel were sent,” the FIR quoted the complainant as saying. He added that there was commotion at the site of the incident as residents were “terrorised”. The complainant said the initial probe revealed that on September 21, a woman from the Ahmadi community had died in the village whose burial was not allowed. Meanwhile, he continued, “hatred on basis of religion and enmity” was promoted against the community, causing the law and order situation to deteriorate. Five people were injured during this, the complainant said, adding that they were sent to the hospital. The FIR said further facts of the incidents would become clear after the injured and affected people would be included in the inquiry. It alleged the suspects of “deliberately promoting enmity against the Ahmadi community”, hurting their sentiments, setting their properties on fire, looting them, opening fire on them with the intention to kill, attacking a police party and snatching weapons from them and spreading fear among the residents of the area where the incident took place. The complainant asked for an investigating officer to be assigned to probe the incident. Meanwhile, Sialkot District Police Officer (DPO) Faisal Shehzad told Dawn.com on Sunday night that eight people were injured in the incident, “five of whom are from the Ahmadi community and three from the TLP (Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan)”. He said among the injured from the Ahmadi community, one person was shot at, adding that condition of all the injured was stable. The DPO also said the issue began when the burial of an Ahmadi woman was not allowed at a graveyard established in 1945. Later, some members of the Ahmadi community tortured some others. Two cases were registered — one against the members of the Ahmadi community and another against their adversaries, he added. On Saturday, he continued, some members of the Ahmadi community “beat another person, following which TLP members set two to three of their farm houses and a shop on fire”. The official said they also “tortured” members of the Ahmadi community. “Anti-riot police were called and situation is now normal,” he said, adding that “a case will be registered against (members of) the TLP”. Sunday’s incident comes less than a months after 300 people were booked on terrorism charges in two cases for setting two worship places of the Ahmadi community on fire in Faisalabad. According to the FIRs, TLP ticket-holder Hafiz Rafaqat led the mob, which was armed with rods and bricks. Members of the community who tried to resist were severely beaten, leaving several injured. Previously in July, 51 people were arrested and 142 booked for attacking police and an Ahmadi place of worship in Daska. In April, a 46-year-old businessman was lynched when a few hundred supporters of the TLP had stormed a place of worship belonging to the Ahmadi community in Karachi’s Saddar area to prevent it from observing religious rituals.",

The strikes on the Venezuelan boats allegedly carrying narcotics, which the administration has claimed were necessary because interdiction did not work, have been orchestrated through the homeland security council (HSC), which Miller leads as the homeland security adviser.

      "summary_orig": "Afghan political leaders and women activists on Monday opened a two-day dialogue in Islamabad to explore ways for “shaping a collective, regionally supported vision for Afghanistan’s peaceful future”, according to organisers. Pakistan and Afghanistan have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee and upgrading diplomatic ranks. This is the first ever gathering of political opponents of the Afghan Taliban since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, which organisers insist is “not against the Taliban government.” They argued that the primary aim of the moot was to “promote inclusive and constructive discussions among leaders, including men and women from diverse segments of society in Afghanistan, to develop a shared understanding and identify common principles for Afghanistan’s future stability, inclusivity, and peaceful settlement,” the organisers said in a statement. The dialogue was previously scheduled on Aug 25-26 but was postponed, apparently over criticism by some known personalities, including Zalmay Khalilzad, the former United States special envoy. Khalilzad had termed the meeting “unwise” due to the participation of some who oppose the Taliban. “Afghan citizens are entitled to their political views, but Pakistan’s seeming support of them by hosting their conference is hugely unwise and an intended provocation,” he wrote on X. Former Afghan parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi opposed the remarks, saying, “Isn’t it time to let us craft what is good for us?” The first day of the closed-door meeting was dedicated to Afghan leaders to “engage openly, exchange perspectives and define shared principles for stability, rule of law, and reaffirming the support to women’s rights and inclusion”, according to the organisers. Dawn.com has seen a list of 37 Afghans invited to the event. They were part of the previous governments of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, including governors, ministers, lawmakers and women activists. A participant said some of the invitees were not attending the meeting due to visa issues. “The aim of this timely and important dialogue is to promote an inclusive dialogue among diverse groups of Afghan leaders (women and men) alongside Pakistani counterparts to foster inclusive dialogue, mutual understanding and lasting cooperation,” the organisers said. Women for Afghanistan (WFA) and the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (Sassi) University jointly held the first Regional Dialogue titled “Towards Unity and Trust”. Koofi, who leads WFA, lives in exile and has organised a series of meetings, mainly comprising women activists against the Taliban policies. She is one of the critics of Taliban rule. Dr Maria Sultan, a defence analyst, heads Sassi. On the second day, on September 30th, a Joint Pak-Afghan Session will hold “focused discussions aimed at building trust, identifying common ground and advancing a people-centric approach to address regional challenges”. The organisers, while explaining the objectives of the dialogue, say that the event is aimed at strengthening cooperation between Afghan and Pakistani leaders. The dialogue will also promote sustainable development, stability and peace rooted in shared values and highlight the importance of women’s participation and inclusive governance. The gathering would encourage regional cooperation with a focus on economic development and trust-building, the statement added. “The dialogue underscores a simple truth: peace between people leads to peace between nations. By prioritising dialogue, inclusivity and cooperation, WFA and SASSI University believe this initiative can pave the way for stronger, more mutually beneficial relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, grounded in unity and trust.“ In addition, the event will be helpful in fostering a deeper understanding between the people of the two nations for a more sustained development and peace in the region. “The commonality and the importance of the dialogue and the process stems from the need that Afghans must have the space to speak, engage and think together to promote their common values and interests for their country and their people,“ it added. The dialogue will also serve to identify common grounds for cooperation between Afghan leaders and their Pakistani counterparts on an engagement basis of developing people-centric approaches to find common solutions for regional challenges and to build trust and stability, the statement said. “We believe that a more people-centric approach focused on economic development and regional cooperation will lead to an enhanced and meaningful relationship between the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.” Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul in July, where an agreement was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity. Later that month, Dar said Pakistan received “recent assurances” from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be used for terrorism. Islamabad has repeatedly demanded that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). In January, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the only point of contention between the two countries was the presence of the TTP and cross-border attacks.",

      "summary_orig": "Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Mohsin Naqvi on Monday warned India against “dragging war” into sports, saying that doing so only exposed the neighbouring country’s “desperation” in a response aimed at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who politicised India’s Asia Cup final win against Pakistan. In a post on X on Sunday night, Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on scoring a win in the final against the Green Shirts, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor — an operation that was launched against Pakistan during the four-day military conflict between the two countries in May. “ #OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he said. In response to Modi’s post, Naqvi said, “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”. “Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he said. The exchange also follows the Indian cricket team refusing to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. “I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said on Sunday night. PCB donates match fee to May 7 victims Separately, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday that it would donate the team’s match fees to the civilians martyred during the May 7 Indian attack on Pakistan, after India’s SuryaKumar Yadav announced that he would donate his match fee to victims on the Indian side. In a post on X, the the cricketing board said, “The Pakistan Cricket Team has dedicated its Asia Cup final match fees to the innocent victims martyred in the May 7 attack, in which civilians, including children, lost their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.” India’s actions ‘disrespected cricket’: Salman Agha Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Agha said that India’s actions had “disrespected cricket” while speaking to reporters after the match, accroding to AFP . “I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” Agha said. “If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.” “What they did today, a good team doesn’t do that. Good teams do what we have done. We waited for our medals and took them. “It’s been seen for the first time. I do not know where it will stop. What has happened in this tournament is bad for cricket,” he said. Meanwhile, Yadav claimed that India was “denied” the trophy, but then went on to say that the team “took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy”. “If you tell me about the trophies, my trophies are sitting in my dressing room — all the 14 players and support staff. They are the real trophies for me,” said Yadav. ‘Lack of sportsmanship’ Although the Pakistan-India matches went ahead despite calls from the Indian side to boycott them, all three were marred by controversy and high tensions between the two countries in the wake of their four-day military standoff in May. India displayed consistent hostility towards the Pakistan team throughout each of their clashes, including refusing to shake hands with the players at the end of the games. In addition, after the first victory against Pakistan on September 14, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was accused of politicising the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May, for which India blamed Islamabad without evidence. Naqvi had expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X and lodged a complaint with the ICC, which launched a probe into the remarks. Further, during the September 21 match , when the rivals met for the second time, Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the match. The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention . Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.",

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Imran Nazir said on Monday that the province was extending the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign until Wednesday, hoping to achieve a target of 100 per cent. Earlier in September, Pakistan rolled out the HPV vaccine nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities. “Success rate in Punjab has been 72pc,” Punjab’s health minister said during an interview with Geo News show “Geo Pakistan”. “But we have not ended the campaign; instead, we have extended it for three days.” He added, “The primary reason is that if we administer this vaccine to our girls now, those aged 9 to 14 will get it for free. But after the campaign ends, people will have to pay money for it, and only 9-year-old girls will be able to get it free of charge.” Referring to the attacks on women health workers while administering vaccines in Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin district, the minister said he has ensured the suspects were arrested and that security measures have been put in place to protect health workers. In the latest incident this week, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor. He said the rate of refusals was greater at the beginning of the campaign, with only 250,000 girls receiving the vaccine on the first day. However, towards the end, the number of refusals dropped to 90,000 from 300,000 after counselling was provided through their teams. “More than 5.2 million girls have been vaccinated; however, our target was 7.2 million, which we hope to achieve by Wednesday,” the minister said.",

      "summary_orig": "The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Asian Cricket Council chief Mohsin Naqvi, as politics continued to spill over the pitch. India had earlier beaten Pakistan by five wickets in the last over after a close contest to win a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, but they caused the post-final formalities to be inordinately delayed due to their refusal to budge from their stance. There were no customary handshakes between the teams after India refused, with tensions high from their previous two clashes in the competition, which witnessed political posturing and aggressive on-field behaviour. The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naqvi, who is also the Interior Minister, was supposed to present the winners’ trophy, but there were indications that India would resent that when their captain Suryakumar Yadav did not participate in the customary pre-toss photoshoot before the final. “I have been informed by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said. When asked about his refusal to collect the trophy at the post-match press conference and their actions leading to the politicisation of the game, the Indian skipper declined to answer the question. The post-final ceremony saw Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha receive the runners-up trophy while Indian players Tilak Varma, Kuldeep Yadav and Abhishek Sharma collect their respective individual awards. India’s refusal to collect the trophy from Naqvi marks a historic low in the cricketing relations between the neighbours, with the game having acted as a stage for diplomacy in the past. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a political reference in his post on X congratulating the Indian team. “Operation Sindoor on the game’s field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he wrote. Suryakumar’s men had earlier capped a remarkable unbeaten run with their third victory against Pakistan at the Asia Cup. Put into bat, Pakistan could not capitalise on an 84-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) and were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings. Pakistan lost their last nine wickets for 33 runs in a spectacular meltdown, with India’s left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) being the wrecker-in-chief. The Green Shirts struck back to leave India reeling at 20-3 with their top 3, including captain Suryakumar Yadav, back in the dugout. India lost their in-form opener Abhishek Sharma, also the tournament’s leading scorer, and the skipper inside the first 10 deliveries of their innings. Varma and Sanju Samson (24) got to rebuilding the innings. Even that recovery would not have been possible but for the reprieve Samson, then on 12, got when Hussain Talat dropped him in the deep. Abrar Ahmed dismissed Samson to break the 57-run stand, but Shivam Dube (33) combined with Varma to take India closer to the target before falling in the penultimate over. Needing 10 runs from the last over from Haris Rauf, Varma hit the second ball for a six to effectively seal India’s thrilling victory and triggering wild celebrations in the Indian camp. “It’s a tough pill to swallow,” Pakistan captain Salman said at the presentation ceremony. “We could not finish well in the batting. Bowling, we gave everything. If we could have finished well, it would have been a different story. “We could not rotate the strike properly, and we lost too many wickets. That was the reason we could not score what we wanted. We have to sort out our batting very soon. They bowled really well, outstandingly well. They needed 63 off six overs. I thought we had the game. The bowlers bowled really well; we have to give them credit, but the batting was a concern. “We fought really well. We are proud as a team. So much to look forward to, we will improve and come back stronger.”",
