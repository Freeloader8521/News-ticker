      "summary_orig": "A fatal accident involving a bus filled with Indian pilgrims killed at least 45 people near Saudi Arabia’s holy city of Madina, Indian police said on Monday, one of the deadliest crashes in the Gulf kingdom in years. “The tragic bus accident involving Indian pilgrims in Saudi Arabia is deeply distressing,” VC Sajjanar, police commissioner for the city of Hyderabad, where many of the Indian citizens were reported to have come from, told reporters. “According to preliminary information, 46 people were travelling in the bus at the time of the incident, and heartbreakingly, only one person survived,” he said. Saudi officials have not provided a toll for the crash. Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences in a post on social media, saying the Indian embassy was working with Saudi officials on the ground. “Deeply saddened by the accident in Medina involving Indian nationals. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones,” the prime minister wrote on X. “I pray for the swift recovery of all those injured. Our Embassy in Riyadh and consulate in Jeddah are providing all possible assistance,” he added. Road crashes were one of the greatest causes of injuries and fatalities in Saudi Arabia, according to a 2023 UN statement, which also said the kingdom had retained a high road fatality rate compared to other high-income countries. Transporting worshippers around Saudi Arabia’s holy sites has frequently proven dangerous, particularly during the Haj, when roads can be chaotic with buses creating interminable traffic jams. Millions also visit Saudi Arabia for the Umrah pilgrimage, which happens outside of the Haj period. In March 2023 , a bus ferrying pilgrims to the holy city of Mecca burst into flames after a collision on a bridge, killing 20 people and injuring more than two dozen others. And in October 2019 , some 35 foreigners were killed and four others injured when a bus collided with another heavy vehicle near Madina. Pilgrimages are an essential component of Saudi Arabia’s burgeoning tourism sector that officials hope will help diversify the kingdom’s economy away from fossil fuels. The Gulf kingdom is also home to more than two million Indian nationals who have long played a pivotal role in its labour market, helping construct many of the country’s mega-projects while sending billions of dollars in remittances back home each year. Saudi Arabia and India have fostered a close relationship for decades. India’s rapidly developing economy relies heavily on petroleum imports, with Saudi Arabia ranked as its third-largest supplier, according to the Indian foreign ministry.",

      "summary_orig": "Indian army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday issued a pointed warning to Pakistan, comparing the brief May conflict to a “trailer” rather than a full-length film. The Indian army chief’s remarks come a week after an explosion near the Red Fort in New Delhi on November 10, leaving 12 people dead in the first such explosion in the Indian capital since 2011 . Delivering a speech at a defence conference in New Delhi, Gen Dwivedi said, “I’d like to say that the movie hasn’t even started — only a trailer was shown, and, after the trailer, it was over within 88 hours.“ “So, we’re fully prepared for the future, and if Pakistan gives us such an opportunity, we’d like to provide them with a thorough education on how a responsible nation should behave with its neighbours.“ The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Delhi blast suspect presented in court Indian anti-terrorism investigators presented a suspect linked to the bombing in court, one of two men accused of involvement in the suicide attack. Officials have not disclosed any details on the motives or organisational backing of the alleged attackers, both of whom they claim came from India-occupied Kashmir. India’s National Investiagtion Agency (NIA) alleged that Amir Rashid Ali “conspired with the alleged suicide bomber, Umarun Nabi, to unleash the terror attack” last Monday. It remains unclear whether Nabi is included in the tally. Security personnel escort the suspect from a police vehicle at the Patiala House Court, a day after his arrest, in New Delhi, India on November 17. — AFP An AFP photographer saw Ali being taken under heavy guard from a police truck to a New Delhi court to face charges. Indian media reported that the court had ordered that he be held in custody for 10 days by the NIA. Nabi was a medical professor at a university in Haryana state, just outside the capital, while Ali had allegedly travelled to Delhi to “facilitate the purchase of the car which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED)”, according to the NIA. India has provided no further information on the alleged motives or network behind the two suspects. The Indian government has since branded the Delhi car blast a terrorist attack, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowing not to spare anyone involved in the “conspiracy” the day after the blast. Yesterday, the NIA said the blast was a “ suicide bombing ”.",

      "summary_orig": "A Bangladesh court sentenced ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year. The ruling comes months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February. Hasina’s Awami League party has been barred from contesting and it is feared that Monday’s verdict could stoke fresh unrest ahead of the vote. The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court located in the capital Dhaka, delivered the guilty verdict amid tight security and in Hasina’s absence after she fled to India in August 2024. View this post on Instagram Hasina, 78, defied court orders that she return from India to attend her trial about whether she ordered a deadly crackdown against the student-led uprising that ousted her. She called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”. “The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,” Hasina said in a statement issued from hiding in India. “They are biased and politically motivated. “ The verdict can be appealed in the Supreme Court. But Hasina’s son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed , told Reuters on the eve of the verdict that they would not appeal unless a democratically elected government took office with the Awami League’s participation. View this post on Instagram After the verdict, Bangladesh urged India to extradite Hasina and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. Dhaka said New Delhi was obliged to do so under an extradition treaty. Worst violence since 1971 During the trial, prosecutors told the court that they had uncovered evidence of her direct command to use lethal force to suppress a student-led uprising in July and August 2024. According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most of them by gunfire from security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence. Hasina was represented by a state-appointed defence counsel who told the court that the charges against her were baseless and pleaded for her acquittal. Ahead of the verdict, Hasina dismissed the accusations and the fairness of the Tribunal proceedings, asserting a guilty verdict was “a foregone conclusion”. Bangladesh has been tense ahead of the verdict, with at least 30 crude bomb explosions and 26 vehicles torched across the country over the past few days. There have been no casualties, however.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina, sentenced to death in absentia on Monday for her deadly crackdown on student protesters last year, has been a dominant figure in the South Asian nation for half a century, a career rooted in bloodshed. Thrust into prominence with the assassination of her father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and much of her family in a military coup, Hasina early on fought for democracy, but her long reign as prime minister became marked by arrests of opposition leaders, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent. She was found guilty of ordering lethal force by a tribunal in the capital Dhaka 15 months after resigning and fleeing to India in the face of a student-led uprising that killed hundreds or more. Students celebrate after the verdict on cases against ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on November 17, 2025. — Reuters Joined rival to seek democracy before feud Despite criticism of her years in power, Hasina, 78, was credited with turning around the economy and the massive garments industry of the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million, while winning international praise for sheltering Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in neighbouring Myanmar. But her downfall — she was ousted less than seven months after winning a fifth term as leader — was the protests that began over job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her removal. Hasina, from her exile in India, has denied the allegations against her, saying the verdict was “biased and politically motivated”. “I am not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal where evidence can be weighed and tested fairly,” Hasina said in a statement after the verdict. Her state-appointed defence counsel told the court the charges were baseless. A UN report in February said up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests, most from gunfire by security forces, and cited evidence that it was official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters and sympathisers. The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal — a court Hasina set up to try war crimes from Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence from Pakistan — marks a dramatic turn for a political career that began when she avoided death during the 1975 coup because she happened to be in Europe. Born in 1947 in the southwest of the country, which was then East Pakistan, Hasina was the eldest of five children. After getting a degree in Bengali literature from Dhaka University in 1973, she gained political experience as a go-between for her father and his student followers. Exiled to India after the coup, she returned in 1981 and was elected head of the Awami League, Bangladesh’s oldest political party and a force in the struggle for independence. Hasina joined political foe Khaleda Zia, chief of the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990. But the alliance did not last. The bitter rivalry between the two — called the “battling begums”, using an Urdu honorific for prominent women — went on to dominate Bangladeshi politics for decades. Hasina first led the Awami League to victory in 1996, serving a five-year term, then regained power in 2009, never to lose it again. A man holds a poster in front of the court demanding the capital punishment ahead of the verdict on charges of crimes against humanity for a deadly crackdown on student-led protests in 2024 against the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on November 17, 2025. — Reuters Claims of abuses, downfall, exile As time went on, critics said, she became increasingly autocratic and her rule was marked by mass arrests of political opponents and activists, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Rights groups warned of a virtual one-party rule by the Awami League. Hasina defended her tenure as a period of stability and development, arguing that strong, uninterrupted leadership was needed to keep Bangladesh on track. Khaleda — herself a former prime minister and the widow of an assassinated former president — was jailed in 2018 on graft charges that her party said had been trumped up. She was freed after Hasina’s ouster. Hasina and Khaleda accused each other of trying to create chaos and violence to jeopardise a democracy that had yet to take firm root in Bangladesh. The once-racing economy has slowed sharply since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine pushed up prices of imported fuel and food, forcing Bangladesh to turn last year to the International Monetary Fund for a $4.7 billion bailout. After Hasina fled the uprising in August last year with her sister on a military helicopter, jubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent presidential residence, carrying out looted furniture and televisions. Since then, Bangladesh has been governed by an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus — a figure Hasina had attacked for years, who was convicted of graft under her government.

      "summary_orig": "Information Attaullah Tarar took notice after journalist Benazir Shah said that an account he followed on the social media platform X had made an AI-generated video of her. He asserted that nobody had the right to make “fake videos” or try to harass journalists by defaming them. Shah posted on Sunday on X that an account on the social media platform followed by Tarar had “made an AI video of me”. “But as we’ve said before, we’ll say it again: #AttacksWontSilenceUS ,” she added. Her post was in response to the video in question, shared by an account called PakVocals. The description with the clip claimed that it was a “leaked video” of Shah “dancing in a club in London”. Subsequently, Tarar responded to Shah on Sunday night, saying, “Totally unacceptable and highly condemnable. Notice taken, please. “Nobody has the right to make fake videos and then disseminate them or try to harass any journalist by defaming them. I follow more than 1,900 accounts. I do not condone the behaviour of this account and also assure you that action will be taken,” the minister said. Later, Shah said she appreciated the minister taking the matter seriously. However, she said that she did not want to pursue a case under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) through the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) as “doing so would lend legitimacy to a law and an institution that have been used to harass journalists, silence private citizens, and suppress dissent”. “If the minister and his government are serious about ensuring safety for journalists and citizens, they should scrap Peca and the NCCIA and begin a genuine consultation process to draft legislation that truly addresses journalists’ concerns,” she said. Journalists also rallied behind Shah as the matter garnered attention on social media. “Deep fake, condemnable, culpable crime, should be investigated and the one who doctored the video must be brought to the court of law. My sincere support to fellow brilliant journalist Benazir Shah who always stands by facts, neutrality and truth. More power to you. Stand firm, please,” posted journalist Zahid Gishkori on X. Journalist Asad Ali Toor said he was sure that the person in the video was not Shah. He said he was also certain that the account that shared the video was a “pro PML-N account followed by pro PML-N journalists and the minister”. “This is [a] shameful and disgusting campaign, and I strongly condemn it. At the same time, I want to say all political parties have their own pool of dirt which they time to time launch against their critics. Shameful,” he commented. Journalist Meher Bokhari, referring to the video in question and the accosting of Geo News anchor Shahzeb Khanzada in a separate incident, called for more respect. “This is not who we were meant to become. Whether it’s PTI supporters harassing Shazeb Khanzada or or PML-N supporters circulating fake AI videos of Benazir Shah, none of it reflects who we are. “Both are hardworking journalists, people who have dedicated their lives to informing the public despite constant pressure. Sure, nothing makes sense here anymore, but the least we can do is hold on to our values and our respect for one another. Character is what you choose to keep intact when everything around you falls apart,” she said.",

Sure, nothing makes sense here anymore, but the least we can do is hold on to our values and our respect for one another. Character is what you choose to keep intact when everything around you falls apart,” she said.",

      "summary_orig": "Health Minister Mustafa Kamal expressed confidence on Monday that the changes pertaining local governments sought by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) would be addressed in the next constitutional amendment slated for the “coming months”. Kamal made the remarks while addressing a press conference in Karachi, less than a week after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was enacted into law amid protests by the opposition and other quarters. When the 27th Amendment was tabled in the National Assembly on Nov 11, Kamal had referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of the 28th Amendment. Speaking to the media today, he said that changes were initially pitched to be included in the 26th Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year. Kamal then thanked other parties, including the ruling PML-N, and “individual friends from the PPP” and “many friends from the PTI” for “vocally backing” the MQM-P’s changes related to local governments. He said the proposed changes were extensively discussed for over six hours in the parliamentary standing committee meeting called to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment. “We had enough numbers […] We had won our case in the standing committee. We had the numbers. We had the support of the PML-N and others,” he maintained. “But the PPP was not ready to support the [inclusion of] our bill [on local governments] in the 27th Amendment, which resulted in a deadlock,” he added, clarifying that he was not making any allegations in saying so. Kamal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the ruling PML-N then requested the MQM-P to postpone its proposed changes once again as the 27th Amendment included crucial provisions pertaining to the Pakistan Army and the judiciary. “We were assured that they all supported the bill. They asked for one more chance, assuring that this would be included in the next amendment,” he added. Subsequently, the MQM-P decided to accept the request in the “larger interest of the country,” he said. Stressing the importance of changes pertaining to local government, Kamal further stated: “In Pakistan, […] in the coming months, this constitutional amendment will be introduced in the assembly and get approved, and the people will get resources at their doorstep.” Kamal also referred to the Punjab As­­sembly unanimously passing a resolution last month, calling for an amendment to Article 140-A of the Constitution to ensu­­re empowerment and protection of local bodies, along with mandatory and timely elections for effective governance. He deemed the development a success of the MQM-P. Kamal’s remarks come a day after Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said the ruling coalition could introduce another constitutional amendment if the need was felt to “maintain stability” in the country.",

      "title_orig": "Politicians, journalists jump to Shahzeb Khanzada’s defence after anchorperson accosted in public",
      "summary_orig": "Politicians and journalists have jumped to the defence of anchorperson Shahzeb Khanzada after videos emerged on social media of him being accosted in public by a man accusing him of acting against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi. The video, which has been circulating on social media since Sunday night, shows a man following Khanzada in what appeared to be a clothing store. In the video, the man told the journalist he should be “ashamed” of “what he has done against Imran” and his wife. For his part, Khanzada — who appeared to be present with his family — did not engage with the man and walked away. While the man did not provide an explanation for the allegations he was levelling against the journalist, PTI’s Shahbaz Gill shared an old clip of Khanzada talking about the Iddat case, filed against Bushra Bibi and Imran by her former husband Khawar Maneka, on his show. The case pertains to Imran and Bushra Bibi’s marriage during the latter’s Iddat period. “This is the filth Shahzeb did,” he said. He added that if the condemnation had come from the media fraternity, then the situation would not have reached this point, an apparent reference to the harassment of the journalist. The incident comes two days after The Economist published an article covering Imran’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as premier, which the party has termed recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary. Many on social media came to Khanzada’s defence, terming the incident “condemnable”. Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the incident was “yet another filthy reminder of the mob mentality Imran Khan has carefully bred within PTI”. “This crowd does not [have] manners, they were never taught dignity, decency or basic humanity. Their entire existence feeds on confrontation, chaos, and bullying. This is not politics, it is brute thuggery masquerading as activism. They know that they can only survive when society is torn down,” said the minister. PPP leader and Sindh Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said he strongly condemned the incident. “You can certainly disagree, but do so within the bounds of decency and respect. Your actions have not affected Shahzeb Khanzada’s honour, but rather [of] those who taught you this behaviour,” he said. Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Senator Faisal Subzwari said the incident was “another glimpse into the filth that had taken root in politics over the past decade”. “When national leaders praise the abuse brigade and give bad names to everyone except their own kind, then these lamentable traditions take root,” he said. Journalist Waseem Abbasi called the incident harassment, adding that this was “no crusade”. “This is disgusting and utterly condemnable,” said Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousufzai. “Khanzada is an honourable man and an outstanding journalist. This incident exposes the ugly face and behaviour of an intolerant cult,” he said. Journalist Asad Ali Toor termed the incident a “shameful campaign” against Khanzada. “I still maintain that Shahzeb in that interview completely exposed Khawar Maneka that his ‘Iddat’ case is a politically motivated case and he is just a disgusting proxy,” he said, adding that the PTI should be thanking him, rather than harassing him. Journalist Matiullah Jan said that Imran’s supporters should learn that harassing a journalist in this manner in the presence of his family members was condemnable. “There are a hundred civilised ways of protesting. Shahzeb Khanzada has left the government and its ministers speechless on many occasions,” he said. Journalist Zahid Gishkori, who has previously worked with Khanzada, said it was “extremely painful to see a strange man” harassing the latter and his family, adding that he stood with the journalist during this difficult time. “This is unacceptable and outright shameful. Harassing someone in a public place is not freedom of expression, it’s intimidation and thuggery,” said sports journalist Faizan Lakhani. “Shahzeb Khanzada is a respected, credible journalist, and this behaviour towards him is shameful. This incident exposes the true face of an intolerant society,” he said. “I strongly condemn the worst kind of fascism and the targeted harassment being inflicted on Shahzeb Khanzada by zombies of a political party,” said journalist Asma Shirazi. The Pakistan Daily founder Hamza Azhar Salam said the PTI had not taken Khanzada to court for defamation because “it knows they will be taken to the cleaners”. “Instead, PTI workers unleashed to harass Pakistan’s most credible journalist in front of his family. We stand by Khanzada and condemn this campaign of harassment,” he said. Meanwhile, Khanzada responded to PTI leader Gill on X, accusing him of lying. “This is classic Shahbaz Gill. When he was a minister, he was caught lying several times and here again he is lying,” he said, adding that he was responsible for reporting court proceedings. “These trolls actually don’t care about facts even if they go in favour of Imran Khan,” he said. “We didn’t just expose the Iddat case but also spoke for Shahbaz Gill, condemned his torture under custody and the use of the outdated treason law against him even when his own party and leaders were refusing to speak for him,” he said. The PTI founder and his wife — who are both currently under arrest — were convicted by an Islamabad court in the Iddat case and sentenced to seven years in jail each on Feb 3, 2024, five days before the general elections. In July the same year, they were acquitted in the case but then arrested on charges related to the sale of state gifts.",

The incident comes two days after The Economist published an article covering Imran’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as premier, which the party has termed recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary. Many on social media came to Khanzada’s defence, terming the incident “condemnable”. Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the incident was “yet another filthy reminder of the mob mentality Imran Khan has carefully bred within PTI”. “This crowd does not [have] manners, they were never taught dignity, decency or basic humanity. Their entire existence feeds on confrontation, chaos, and bullying. This is not politics, it is brute thuggery masquerading as activism. They know that they can only survive when society is torn down,” said the minister. PPP leader and Sindh Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said he strongly condemned the incident. “You can certainly disagree, but do so within the bounds of decency and respect. Your actions have not affected Shahzeb Khanzada’s honour, but rather [of] those who taught you this behaviour,” he said. Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Senator Faisal Subzwari said the incident was “another glimpse into the filth that had taken root in politics over the past decade”. “When national leaders praise the abuse brigade and give bad names to everyone except their own kind, then these lamentable traditions take root,” he said. Journalist Waseem Abbasi called the incident harassment, adding that this was “no crusade”. “This is disgusting and utterly condemnable,” said Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousufzai. “Khanzada is an honourable man and an outstanding journalist. This incident exposes the ugly face and behaviour of an intolerant cult,” he said. Journalist Asad Ali Toor termed the incident a “shameful campaign” against Khanzada. “I still maintain that Shahzeb in that interview completely exposed Khawar Maneka that his ‘Iddat’ case is a politically motivated case and he is just a disgusting proxy,” he said, adding that the PTI should be thanking him, rather than harassing him. Journalist Matiullah Jan said that Imran’s supporters should learn that harassing a journalist in this manner in the presence of his family members was condemnable. “There are a hundred civilised ways of protesting. Shahzeb Khanzada has left the government and its ministers speechless on many occasions,” he said. Journalist Zahid Gishkori, who has previously worked with Khanzada, said it was “extremely painful to see a strange man” harassing the latter and his family, adding that he stood with the journalist during this difficult time. “This is unacceptable and outright shameful. Harassing someone in a public place is not freedom of expression, it’s intimidation and thuggery,” said sports journalist Faizan Lakhani. “Shahzeb Khanzada is a respected, credible journalist, and this behaviour towards him is shameful. This incident exposes the true face of an intolerant society,” he said. “I strongly condemn the worst kind of fascism and the targeted harassment being inflicted on Shahzeb Khanzada by zombies of a political party,” said journalist Asma Shirazi. The Pakistan Daily founder Hamza Azhar Salam said the PTI had not taken Khanzada to court for defamation because “it knows they will be taken to the cleaners”. “Instead, PTI workers unleashed to harass Pakistan’s most credible journalist in front of his family. We stand by Khanzada and condemn this campaign of harassment,” he said. Meanwhile, Khanzada responded to PTI leader Gill on X, accusing him of lying. “This is classic Shahbaz Gill. When he was a minister, he was caught lying several times and here again he is lying,” he said, adding that he was responsible for reporting court proceedings. “These trolls actually don’t care about facts even if they go in favour of Imran Khan,” he said. “We didn’t just expose the Iddat case but also spoke for Shahbaz Gill, condemned his torture under custody and the use of the outdated treason law against him even when his own party and leaders were refusing to speak for him,” he said. The PTI founder and his wife — who are both currently under arrest — were convicted by an Islamabad court in the Iddat case and sentenced to seven years in jail each on Feb 3, 2024, five days before the general elections. In July the same year, they were acquitted in the case but then arrested on charges related to the sale of state gifts.",
      "title": "Politicians, journalists jump to Shahzeb Khanzada’s defence after anchorperson accosted in public",
      "summary": "Politicians and journalists have jumped to the defence of anchorperson Shahzeb Khanzada after videos emerged on social media of him being accosted in public by a man accusing him of acting against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi. The video, which has been circulating on social media since Sunday night, shows a man following Khanzada in what appeared to be a clothing store. In the video, the man told the journalist he should be “ashamed” of “what he has done against Imran” and his wife. For his part, Khanzada — who appeared to be present with his family — did not engage with the man and walked away. While the man did not provide an explanation for the allegations he was levelling against the journalist, PTI’s Shahbaz Gill shared an old clip of Khanzada talking about the Iddat case, filed against Bushra Bibi and Imran by her former husband Khawar Maneka, on his show. The case pertains to Imran and Bushra Bibi’s marriage during the latter’s Iddat period. “This is the filth Shahzeb did,” he said. He added that if the condemnation had come from the media fraternity, then the situation would not have reached this point, an apparent reference to the harassment of the journalist.

Then you'll be able to add custom layer, which can be enabled in the default map and select 'ADS-B Stations' layer. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XixSD-JtK-yZMro0nMqTVrLOBPtiWcGk/view?usp=sharing submitted by /u/Fluid_Perspective525 [link] [comments]",

      "summary_orig": "• Kabul wants to bolster trade with C. Asia states • Afghan traders say Islamabad still shortest, cheapest route to seaports • Uzbek president proposes new bloc AFGHANISTAN is seeking to significantly bolster trade with the oil-rich countries of Central Asia as it attempts to end its economic dependence on Pakistan, which has historically been Kabul’s biggest trading partner. However, experts warn that geography, high costs, and political constraints will hinder efforts by Afghanistan’s cash-strapped and unrecognised Taliban government to shift trade to Central Asia, according to a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty report. Kabul’s attempts to find new trade partners come after the worst outbreak of hostilities with Islamabad in years. The neighbours exchanged military attacks last month, killing dozens of people and leading to Pakistan closing its border with Afghanistan. The month-long border closure has inflicted some $200 million in losses for Afghan traders, who rely on Pakistani seaports to access international markets. Similarly, Pakistan had been exporting fresh fruits, cement, medicines, surgical items, agricultural tools, fabrics, shoes, plastic pipes and sanitary items, cosmetics, and a variety of other locally manufactured products valued at around $100–200m per month to the neighbouring country. ‘Trade alternatives’ Senior Taliban officials have urged Afghan traders and investors to end their activities in Pakistan and find new business and trade opportunities in Central Asia. “We are actively working with our northern neighbors to find reliable trade alternatives,” Taliban Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi said last week. Abdul Ghani Baradar, a Taliban deputy prime minister, accused Islamabad of using trade as a “tool of political pressure” and framed the ongoing border closure as evidence that Kabul must reduce its reliance on its neighbour. Swiss-based Afghan expert Torek Farhadi said the Taliban’s new emphasis on trade with Central Asia is “largely political posturing”. Central Asia is landlocked, and Afghanistan must rely on long-distance overland corridors to reach markets. The region’s tariff structures impose high costs on many Afghan exports, especially agricultural goods. The logistics of handling, storing, and transporting perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables remain underdeveloped. “To make the northern route commercially viable, Afghanistan would need to remove tariffs and offer incentives to its Central Asian partners,” Mr Farhadi told RFE/RL. “But for the government in Kabul, customs revenue is one of their primary income sources.” Meanwhile, several railway projects, crucial for scaling cross-border trade, remain unfinished or lack financing. The Taliban’s lack of international recognition also prevents it from accessing funds from global institutions like the World Bank and IMF, limiting investment in the infrastructure needed to support northbound trade, Farhadi said. Those factors have ensured that Afghanistan’s trade with Central Asia, although growing, has remained modest. Trade between Afghanistan and the five Central Asian states — Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan — has grown steadily, reaching nearly $1.7 billion, according to Afghan officials. Still dependent Despite Afghanistan’s growing trade with Central Asia, Kabul remains dependent on Pakistan as Islamabad has long provided its neighbor with the fastest and most affordable access to global markets. The border crossings at Torkham and Chaman remain the backbone of Afghanistan’s commercial lifelines, but the repeated skirmishes in recent months caused frequent border closures. The most recent closures following armed clashes between Pakistani and Taliban forces left thousands of trucks stranded for weeks. But for Afghan traders, few alternatives can match Pakistan’s proximity or port infrastructure. Shifting trade away from those routes means higher transport costs, longer transit times, and increased logistical risks, experts say. “The reality is that Afghanistan’s shortest and cheapest route to seaports as well as India and other South Asian markets is through Pakistan,” said Azarakhsh Hafizi, the former head of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce. “We need all transit routes to remain open. It would benefit not only Afghanistan and Pakistan, but it is also important for the regional economic integration,” said Hafizi, who previously held membership in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Saarc. Regional bloc proposed Uzbek President Shavkat Mirzi­yoyev proposed on Sunday forming a regional co-operation organisation he called the “Community of Central Asia”, in what he said was a bid to promote economic integration in the region of more than 80 million people, Reuters reported. In a speech at a meeting in Tashkent of the leaders of the five post-Soviet republics of Central Asia, as well as Azerbaijan, Mirziyoyev suggested transforming regular meetings between the leaders of the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia into a formal regional bloc. He also stressed the need to boost economic, security and environmental cooperation. There was no immediate indication of the other countries’ response to the Uzbek proposal, but all five countries have in recent years said they want greater regional integration, where ties were sometimes testy in decades past. All five leaders visited Washington in unison for talks with US President Donald Trump earlier this month. Two of the countries, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, earlier this year settled a longstanding border conflict that had claimed hundreds of lives. Published in Dawn, November 17th, 2025",
