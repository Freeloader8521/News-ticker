      "summary_orig": "The United States hopes talks with Iran in Geneva will produce an agreement to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and President Donald Trump has amassed forces in the Middle East to increase pressure on Iran to reach a deal. What is at stake? Iran has, over decades, developed an advanced and large-scale uranium enrichment programme. While enriched uranium can be used as fuel in power plants at various purity levels, at high levels it can be used to make nuclear weapons. Until Israel and the US attacked its nuclear facilities last June, Iran was enriching uranium to up to 60 per cent purity, a short step from the roughly 90pc that is weapons grade. It had enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for 10 nuclear weapons, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency yardstick, and more at lower levels. The IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, has not, however, been able to verify how much of that uranium stock remains. Iran has yet to declare what happened to it or allow the agency to inspect its bombed nuclear facilities. Iran’s enrichment plants were destroyed or badly damaged in the attacks, though their exact status, like that of the uranium stock, has yet to be verified. What do both sides want? After the June bombings, the two sides expressed incompatible demands: the US said it wanted Iran to give up enrichment, and Iran said it would never do that. As a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran has the right to enrich uranium as long as it does not use it to produce nuclear weapons, which it says it would never do. While an agreement might include an initial phase in which Iran suspends enrichment, there are limited options in terms of what any deal might let it do with its enrichment programme: Enrich elsewhere In previous rounds of talks, the idea was floated of a regional enrichment consortium, which would involve setting up a joint venture outside Iran with one or more other countries from the Middle East. Tehran has always rejected that as an alternative to enriching on its soil. Enrich for other purposes Centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium, can be used for other purposes, such as the production of so-called stable isotopes, which have a range of applications in medicine and scientific research. The landmark 2015 deal between Iran and major powers, which Trump pulled the US out of in 2018, allowed centrifuges at Iran’s underground Fordow site to be used only for the production of stable isotopes. One retaliatory step by Iran after Trump’s withdrawal was to start enriching uranium at Fordow, which the US bombed in June. Enrich to a low level It becomes exponentially easier to enrich to weapons-grade uranium, the more highly enriched uranium you start with. In terms of effort, once you have enriched to 5pc purity, you are more than halfway to weapons grade. Keeping Iran at arm’s length from being able to race towards nuclear weapons will involve limiting the purity it can enrich to and how much enriched uranium it can amass. The 2015 deal let Iran enrich to 3.67pc purity. Diplomats have said only half-jokingly that Trump’s rejection of that deal is so great that 3.67pc is the one enrichment level he will not accept now. What else needs to be addressed? Any deal would also have to require thorough accounting for Iran’s stock of enriched uranium. Any doubts about that could trigger a new conflict. As in 2015, a deal would most likely require the dilution or removal of enriched uranium and limit the number of centrifuges and where they can be used. Since Iran knows how to enrich with advanced centrifuges, and has an unknown number of those centrifuges stored at unknown locations, the risk of it enriching in secret could hang over any future deal. That makes verification, most likely by the IAEA, a central issue.",

Questions remain over what this could mean for the wider region, with Iran warning it would retaliate and even attack Israel. The state-run Oman News Agency has posted photos on social media showing the Omani foreign minister Badr Albusaidi sat with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Geneva. Continue reading...",

      "title_orig": "Strikes in Afghanistan carried out to ensure safety of Pakistani citizens, prevent imminent terrorist attacks: FO",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday said that Pakistan’s recent strikes against neighbouring Afghanistan were carried out to ensure the “safety of Pakistani citizens” and to prevent “imminent terrorist attacks”. FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi made the statement while responding to a question during his weekly press briefing . Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year. During Thursday’s press briefing, the FO spokesperson was asked about civilian casualties in the strikes, the total number of terrorists killed, and the locations of the camps targeted. In his response, he said, “Let me begin by reiterating that the intelligence-based selective targeting of these seven terrorist camps and their hideouts in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, was primarily to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions”. Andrabi stressed that the strikes were “proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence and were directed solely against identified terrorist camps and hideouts”. “We exercised utmost caution to prevent any harm to civilians,” the spokesperson said. He recalled statements made by the UN Security Council in reaction to terrorist attacks against Pakistan, with the latest being about the February 6 attack on an imambargah in Islamabad. The spokesperson maintained that the UNSC had “repeatedly underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, abettors, sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”. He further added that the UNSC had also urged states to cooperate with Pakistan in the matter, stressing that Pakistan’s actions must be viewed through the above-mentioned context. He said that Pakistan “remained committed to peace in the region” and called on the Afghan Taliban government to “comply with these obligations”. However, FO maintained that Pakistan would take “all necessary measures in the exercise of the right to self-defence against terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan”. Responding to the third part of the question regarding the location of the terrorist camps, the spokesperson recalled the Feb 21 statement issued by the Ministry of Information in the aftermath of the strikes and said he had “nothing to further add in terms of either the location or numbers of terrorists killed”. During the briefing, the FO spokesperson was also asked about India’s response to the strikes, specifically the statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wherein it had condemned Pakistan for the move. The FO spokesperson said that Pakistan “rejected” the statement and maintained that the statement vindicated Pakistan’s stance that “India continues to aid and abet terrorism” in the country through its support for Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist organisations in the region. The spokesperson further said that Pakistan held “concrete evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring and abetting terrorism”. The spokesperson maintained that the statement issued by the MEA and another issued after the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan , “reinforce this conclusion”. “These statements provide additional evidence, circumstantial evidence, of India’s complicity in promoting terrorism in Pakistan,” FO said. He maintained that the message that Pakistan “will respond swiftly, strongly in exercise of our right to self-defence” had been put across “through all international stakeholders”. He reiterated Pakistan’s demand for action against “terrorist outfits operating with impunity and with freedom from Afghan soil”. In response to another question, the FO spokesperson also said that he was not aware of “any structured dialogue” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Asked if Qatar was playing any diplomatic role between the two countries, given the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Doha, the FO spokesperson said: “On the role of Qatar, the issue may have come up in a broader context”. Referring to PM Shehbaz’s recent meeting with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, he said that the two leaders exchanged views on regional and national developments, emphasising the importance of dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful resolution of disputes. “To that extent, of course, we would welcome Qatar’s role in settling all these issues, including Afghanistan,” he said. Pakistan demands fair trial for perpetrators of Samjhota Express attack In response to being asked to comment on the 19th anniversary of the Samjhota Express attack, the spokesperson said, “We express our severe disappointment at the Indian government’s callousness towards the plight of families of Pakistani nationals and others, including Indian nationals, I believe, who await justice even after the passage of so many years.” On February 18, 2007, two crude incendiary bombs exploded inside the security-sealed Samjhota Express train headed from Delhi to Lahore, killing 68 people, including 44 Pakistanis. Andrabi maintained that the Indian government’s response confirmed its “role as an official and political accomplice in the heinous terrorist attack carried out on its soil against innocent civilians, Pakistanis and others alike”. FO also condemned the “shameless acquittal and exoneration” of the four perpetrators behind the attack. He expressed concern that the “Hindutva extremism and saffron terror had motivated this inhumane attack 19 years ago, has intensified manifold under the current regime in India”. On that note, the spokesperson demanded a “fair trial” of the perpetrators, stressing that the “families of innocent Pakistani nationals mercilessly killed at the hands of the Hindutva-motivated extremists deserve justice”. He further added: “India routinely indulges in anti-Pakistan propaganda, including by exploiting the bogey of terrorism. And in this backdrop, India’s own systemic exoneration of the perpetrators of the Samjhauta terrorist attack is yet another example of Indian duplicity and state sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan.“",

      "title_orig": "Criminal negligence with Imran’s health will further aggravate country’s political crisis, TTAP warns",
      "summary_orig": "The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Thursday warned that any criminal negligence with regard to the health of PTI founder Imran Khan could further aggravate the political crisis in the country. According to a statement issued by the alliance on the social media platform X, the opposition leaders voiced their concerns during TTAP’s central committee meeting, including an Iftar gathering at the residence of TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar in Islamabad. The gathering was attended by National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) Sahibzada Hassan, and others. According to the statement, the TTAP leaders demanded that Imran be provided immediate medical treatment at Shifa International Hospital, be examined by his personal doctors, and that restrictions on his access to his lawyers and meetings with family members be lifted forthwith. It added that the ex-premier had been unjustly imprisoned and should be released. In the statement, the TTAP leaders also condemned the “government’s continued illegal secrecy” regarding Imran’s health and medical treatment, and reiterated the demand that he be shifted to Shifa International Hospital for specialised treatment and be examined by his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf. “Opposition leaders expressed grave concern over the continued concealment of Imran’s medical reports and test results from his family, saying that such actions were further increasing doubts and fears about the PTI founder’s health condition,” the statement said. “The TTAP leaders further warned that criminal negligence regarding the former prime minister’s health could push the country’s political crisis onto an even more dangerous path,” it said. The statement reiterated that Imran Khan, who had been incarcerated in false cases, must be released, as this was the demand of the majority of the people of Pakistan. The statement also drew attention to incarcerated SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza, and demanded his release as well the release of other political prisoners, including Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry, Ali Wazir, and Mahrang Baloch. Meanwhile, the statement also expressed serious concerns over the “alarming increase” in terrorism across the country, deteriorating ties with Afghanistan, the prospects of war in the region, the worsening economy, and growing repression and lawlessness. Expressing deep concern over the increase in terrorist attacks across the country in recent weeks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the statement said that the federal government, in collaboration with provincial governments, all political stakeholders, and the public, should formulate a concrete national strategy to address the issue. The statement further urged the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to “avoid further confrontation and to initiate concrete, sincere, and meaningful negotiations to seriously address the problem of terrorism”. “They also demanded that contacts be made with neighbouring countries and friendly governments such as Saudi Arabia and Türkiye to find a solution to the crisis that would save Pakistan and the entire region from further bloodshed and sabotage by external and hostile forces,” it added. During the meeting, TTAP also expressed concern over the worsening economic conditions caused and drew attention to recently released figures showing that poverty in the country had risen to 29pc and unemployment has reached a 21-year high, the statement said. “Contrary to the government’s claims of major economic agreements, both foreign and domestic investment have declined sharply,” it said. “The exit of hundreds of major multinational companies from the Pakistani market in recent months was evidence of the country’s deteriorating risk profile,” it said. The statement said that the government had no concrete plan to deal with the economic crisis. It added that opposition leaders in the coming months would present an alternative budget and a series of economic and policy proposals with the help of experts, offering concrete solutions to the economic and legal crises facing the country. The statement also cautioned against threats of a US attack on Iran and termed any such move as a cause of devastation for the region. “The government should play a diplomatic role to prevent any such American action,” it said. It stated that US and Israel were attempting to encircle Iran and destroy and divide it through military attacks. “At this moment, Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran is the need of the hour in order to protect Pakistan and the region from the destructive consequences of Zionist aggression.” The TTAP leaders also condemned the current government’s joining of Donald Trump’s Board of Peace. “Board of Peace is an attempt by the US to establish a non-representative alternative to the United Nations, and the exclusion of Palestinians from the board exposes the sinister intentions behind the plan … something Pakistan must not be part of under any circumstances,” they said.",

      "title_orig": "Iran, US hold talks in Geneva in push to avert war",
      "summary_orig": "Iran and the United States held talks in Switzerland on Thursday, in a last-ditch bid to avert war under the shadow of the biggest American military build-up in the Middle East in decades. The Oman-mediated discussions follow repeated threats from Donald Trump to strike Iran, with the US president last Thursday giving Tehran 15 days to reach a deal . The US and Iranian delegations arrived at the venue at the Omani ambassador’s residence amid tight security, following a protest by Iranian exiles at their talks last week who threw objects at the Iranian motorcade. Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi confirmed that discussions had begun, saying the two sides expressed “unprecedented openness to new and creative ideas and solutions”. He later said the talks had been paused but would resume later in the day. Iran’s president insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic republic was not “at all” seeking a nuclear weapon. “Our Supreme Leader has already stated that we will not have nuclear weapons at all,” President Masoud Pezeshkian said, in a reference to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. United Nations nuclear chief Rafael Grossi would likely also attend the discussions in Geneva, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman said. While Iran has insisted the talks focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran’s missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region curtailed. As part of the dramatic US build-up, the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week, left a naval base in Crete Thursday, an AFP photographer said. The developments follow massive protests in Iran that rights groups say saw thousands of demonstrators killed after the movement called for the end of the Islamic republic. Trump makes case for invasion of Iran In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes. Trump also claimed Tehran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”. The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”. The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed. However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000km — less than a third of the distance to the continental United States. Trump’s State of the Union accusations in Congress were delivered in the same forum in which then-president George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Ahead of Thursday’s talks, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran’s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons “a big, big problem”. He followed up by saying that the “president wants diplomatic solutions”. But US Vice President JD Vance told Iran to take Trump’s threats “seriously”, saying the US president had a “right” to use military action. “You can’t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,” Vance told ‘ America’s Newsroom ’ on Fox News . ‘People would suffer’ Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, had called them “a historic opportunity”, adding that a deal was “ within reach ”. The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka. The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week. A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. In January, Tehran launched a crackdown on nationwide protests that have posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception. Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities. Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict. “There would be famine and people would suffer a lot. People are suffering now, but at least with war, our fate might be clear,” 60-year-old homemaker Tayebeh said.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on Information Technology on Wednesday was informed that reports about the shutdown of the so-called internet firewall ahead of the 5G spectrum auction were incorrect. At the outset of the meeting, Syed Aminul Haque, the committee chairman, noted that there were reports regarding the firewall. Meanwhile, Sadiq Memon called for a briefing on this system and its utility for the nation. He also enquired about the difference between an internet firewall and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s Web Monitoring System (WMS). Information Technology Secretary Zarar Hashim Khan denied that any such system had been dismantled. “The PTA’s WMS is fully operational,” Khan said, adding that neither a firewall nor the WMS had caused any delay in internet services. After the initial briefing by the IT secretary, the floor was given to PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman, who clarified that the word firewall was a colloqial term for the WMS, adding that it had been in place in Pakistan since 2006. “This system has been upgraded four times, with the most recent upgrade carried out in 2023,” he said. The PTA chairman said that like firewalls, the WMS was meant to provide security for digital connectivity in the country. He informed the committee that the WMS was installed to eradicate grey traffic in telephony, block social media platforms, and illegal websites within the country’s jurisdiction. “Our digital borders must also be protected,” the PTA chairman said, adding that cyberattacks originating from India were thwarted during periods of heightened tension between the two countries. “However, social media platforms are blocked on the directives by the government or under court orders,” he asserted. Rehman further informed the committee that social media platforms had been blocked seven times so far on orders either from the government and or the court. “But this does not mean that the internet speeds experience a slowdown or anything else happens due to the WMS,” he added. The committee was told that regulatory mechanisms were in place to safeguard the national cyber infrastructure while ensuring continuity of telecom services, particularly ahead of the upcoming 5G rollout. The committee was also briefed on preparations regarding the upcoming 5G spectrum scheduled for March 10. It was also told that all three telecom operators in the country — Jazz, Ufone and Zong — had expressed the will to participate. The PTA chairman said that in the past 12 years, a total of four spectrum auctions had been held and the government had released 69 megahertz (MHz). He said that in the upcoming auction, 597 MHz was being offered and each participant had to obtain a minimum of 100 MHz each. He added that the availability of more spectrum would not only help introduce 5G in Pakistan but also help improve and increase 4G coverage across the country. Meanwhile, a senior official of the IT ministry told Dawn that the WMS was not designed to block any particular social media account and referred to the X account of PTI founder Imran Khan, highlighting that it continued to operate while the ex-premier was in prison. “If the WMS could stop individual accounts, why did the government wait so long and finally approach the X management to block this account?” the official asked. The development comes amid reports and speculation on social media regarding the government’s decision to shut down the so-called firewall ahead of the 5G spectrum auction. In August 2024, after months of speculation about the installation of a so-called firewall that could be leading to internet disruptions, the country’s IT minister finally confirmed that the government was indeed upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats. Despite the rather ambiguous terminology used by Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja, this was the first time an official had acknowledged the government’s actions, which were blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds , the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data. Up until then, official stakeholders — Khawaja’s ministry and the PTA — had either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta.",

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday arrived in Saudi Arabia on a two-day visit to attend an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Council’s (OIC) Executive Committee. The Extraordinary Open-Ended Ministerial Meeting of the OIC Executive Committee is set to be held tonight in Jeddah. It will “consider the illegal decisions of the Israeli occupation authorities aimed at expanding settlements, pursuing annexation, and attempting to impose Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied West Bank”, according to the Foreign Office (FO). Dar was received at Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the OIC Ambassador Fawad Sher, Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq, and Consul General in Jeddah Syed Mustafa Rabbani, FO said. The meeting is taking place against the backdrop of the Israeli government approving a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the occupation of the territory in 1967.

      "title_orig": "Concerns about Imran’s health echo across UK Parliament",
      "summary_orig": "The imprisonment and reported deteriorating health of former prime minister Imran Khan came under sustained scrutiny in the UK Parliament on Tuesday. Peers across party lines pressed the Labour government to intensify diplomatic engagement with Islamabad and consider linking aid and trade to human rights benchmarks. The issue was raised during oral questions led by Labour peer Baroness Alexander of Cleveden, who asked about discussions with the government of Pakistan regarding Imran’s incarceration. Responding on behalf of the Foreign Office, Minister of State Baroness Chapman of Darlington reiterated that while Pakistan’s judicial processes are a matter for its own authorities, the UK had consistently raised concerns over fundamental rights. “While Pakistan’s judicial processes are, of course, a matter for Pakistan, we are clear that the Pakistani authorities need to respect fundamental freedoms, including the right to a fair trial, due process, humane detention and access to appropriate medical treatment,” she said. “This applies to Imran Khan as it does to all Pakistani citizens.” The minister added that UK ministers and officials had “regularly raised” with their Pakistani counterparts the need to uphold Pakistan’s constitution and international human rights obligations, including in relation to Imran. Family access and medical concerns Several peers highlighted reports that Imran had been denied access to lawyers, family members and doctors, and was being held in solitary confinement. Conservative peer Zac Goldsmith — also the former brother-in-law of Imran — described the situation as “an international outrage”, later writing on X that peers had urged the UK foreign minister to “step up”. During the debate, he said: “We understand that Imran Khan has been denied access to lawyers, denied access to his family, including his two sons, denied access to doctors, and that he has been kept in solitary confinement, with his health deteriorating rapidly.” Goldsmith asked whether the UK should reconsider its aid contribution to Pakistan, noting that it has often been among the top recipients of British assistance. He suggested that aid should be contingent on Islamabad demonstrating a clear commitment to the Commonwealth Charter, including judicial independence and the rule of law. In response, Baroness Chapman said the UK maintained a consistent position that all prisoners should have access to healthcare and family visits, and that this message would continue to be conveyed to Islamabad. On development spending, she noted that the UK had already reduced its aid budget by 40 per cent and that further announcements regarding country allocations would follow shortly. Comparisons with other cases The debate also touched on comparisons with other high-profile cases. The minister drew a distinction between the case of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai and Imran, noting that Lai is a British citizen, giving the UK specific consular responsibilities that do not apply in the same way to foreign nationals. Labour peer Lord Sikka said there was “very soft criticism” when authoritarian acts were committed by countries regarded as Britain’s trade and defence partners. Arguing that the government possessed the tools to exert pressure on the country’s military leadership, he suggested ending aid and imposing trade sanctions. He asked what moral principle guided UK foreign policy in such cases, compared to its approach towards states such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. In response, Baroness Chapman said it would not be right to end all aid to Pakistan, stressing that such a move was not the government’s position. She said British assistance addressed genuine need and supported UK interests, including cooperation on climate issues and counter-terrorism , which she described as “absolutely in the interest of our country”. Crossbench peer Lord Shaffaq Mohammed referred to the case of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was allowed to travel to London for medical treatment in 2019 while serving a sentence in Pakistan. He asked what the government’s response would be if Imran sought permission to travel to the UK for medical care. Baroness Chapman replied that any such request would fall under the jurisdiction of the Home Office and immigration authorities. Conservative peer Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon asked whether the government could facilitate access for Imran’s sons to visit their father during medical treatment. The minister said that, in principle, prisoners undergoing medical treatment should have access to family, but decisions relating to immigration and prison access ultimately rested with Pakistani authorities. Military courts and trade ties Concerns about Pakistan’s wider democratic trajectory and the role of the military also featured prominently. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Purvis of Tweed said that several opposition figures had been prosecuted and sentenced following protests, and warned of “significant worry about the extent of state capture of the Pakistani economy by the military”. He asked whether human rights would be explicitly integrated into the UK-Pakistan trade dialogue. Baroness Chapman acknowledged “very real concerns” about the operation and transparency of military courts , and said that human rights were integral to the UK’s trading relationships. “It would not be the right thing to do to end all aid to Pakistan,” she said. “The need is there, British interests are there, and we work with Pakistan on counter-terrorism, which is absolutely in the interest of our country.” Democracy and elections The debate concluded with broader reflections on Pakistan’s political future. Conservative peer Lord Hannan of Kingsclere said no British government could be indifferent to developments in Pakistan, describing it as a Commonwealth ally with 1.5 million Britons of Pakistani origin. He argued that Pakistan would struggle to achieve stability and attract investment without the restoration of democratic norms. Baroness Chapman said the UK had raised concerns about Pakistan’s 2024 elections and would continue to engage with Islamabad on inclusive politics and rule of law, while maintaining trade and development ties. “There are many countries where we have concerns about rule of law and democracy and yet maintain close relationships,” she said, adding that Britain does not limit its foreign relations only to countries that mirror its own governance model.",

During the debate, he said: “We understand that Imran Khan has been denied access to lawyers, denied access to his family, including his two sons, denied access to doctors, and that he has been kept in solitary confinement, with his health deteriorating rapidly.” Goldsmith asked whether the UK should reconsider its aid contribution to Pakistan, noting that it has often been among the top recipients of British assistance. He suggested that aid should be contingent on Islamabad demonstrating a clear commitment to the Commonwealth Charter, including judicial independence and the rule of law. In response, Baroness Chapman said the UK maintained a consistent position that all prisoners should have access to healthcare and family visits, and that this message would continue to be conveyed to Islamabad. On development spending, she noted that the UK had already reduced its aid budget by 40 per cent and that further announcements regarding country allocations would follow shortly. Comparisons with other cases The debate also touched on comparisons with other high-profile cases. The minister drew a distinction between the case of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai and Imran, noting that Lai is a British citizen, giving the UK specific consular responsibilities that do not apply in the same way to foreign nationals. Labour peer Lord Sikka said there was “very soft criticism” when authoritarian acts were committed by countries regarded as Britain’s trade and defence partners. Arguing that the government possessed the tools to exert pressure on the country’s military leadership, he suggested ending aid and imposing trade sanctions. He asked what moral principle guided UK foreign policy in such cases, compared to its approach towards states such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. In response, Baroness Chapman said it would not be right to end all aid to Pakistan, stressing that such a move was not the government’s position. She said British assistance addressed genuine need and supported UK interests, including cooperation on climate issues and counter-terrorism , which she described as “absolutely in the interest of our country”. Crossbench peer Lord Shaffaq Mohammed referred to the case of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was allowed to travel to London for medical treatment in 2019 while serving a sentence in Pakistan. He asked what the government’s response would be if Imran sought permission to travel to the UK for medical care. Baroness Chapman replied that any such request would fall under the jurisdiction of the Home Office and immigration authorities. Conservative peer Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon asked whether the government could facilitate access for Imran’s sons to visit their father during medical treatment. The minister said that, in principle, prisoners undergoing medical treatment should have access to family, but decisions relating to immigration and prison access ultimately rested with Pakistani authorities. Military courts and trade ties Concerns about Pakistan’s wider democratic trajectory and the role of the military also featured prominently. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Purvis of Tweed said that several opposition figures had been prosecuted and sentenced following protests, and warned of “significant worry about the extent of state capture of the Pakistani economy by the military”. He asked whether human rights would be explicitly integrated into the UK-Pakistan trade dialogue. Baroness Chapman acknowledged “very real concerns” about the operation and transparency of military courts , and said that human rights were integral to the UK’s trading relationships. “It would not be the right thing to do to end all aid to Pakistan,” she said. “The need is there, British interests are there, and we work with Pakistan on counter-terrorism, which is absolutely in the interest of our country.” Democracy and elections The debate concluded with broader reflections on Pakistan’s political future. Conservative peer Lord Hannan of Kingsclere said no British government could be indifferent to developments in Pakistan, describing it as a Commonwealth ally with 1.5 million Britons of Pakistani origin. He argued that Pakistan would struggle to achieve stability and attract investment without the restoration of democratic norms. Baroness Chapman said the UK had raised concerns about Pakistan’s 2024 elections and would continue to engage with Islamabad on inclusive politics and rule of law, while maintaining trade and development ties. “There are many countries where we have concerns about rule of law and democracy and yet maintain close relationships,” she said, adding that Britain does not limit its foreign relations only to countries that mirror its own governance model.",
      "title": "Concerns about Imran’s health echo across UK Parliament",
      "summary": "The imprisonment and reported deteriorating health of former prime minister Imran Khan came under sustained scrutiny in the UK Parliament on Tuesday. Peers across party lines pressed the Labour government to intensify diplomatic engagement with Islamabad and consider linking aid and trade to human rights benchmarks. The issue was raised during oral questions led by Labour peer Baroness Alexander of Cleveden, who asked about discussions with the government of Pakistan regarding Imran’s incarceration. Responding on behalf of the Foreign Office, Minister of State Baroness Chapman of Darlington reiterated that while Pakistan’s judicial processes are a matter for its own authorities, the UK had consistently raised concerns over fundamental rights. “While Pakistan’s judicial processes are, of course, a matter for Pakistan, we are clear that the Pakistani authorities need to respect fundamental freedoms, including the right to a fair trial, due process, humane detention and access to appropriate medical treatment,” she said. “This applies to Imran Khan as it does to all Pakistani citizens.” The minister added that UK ministers and officials had “regularly raised” with their Pakistani counterparts the need to uphold Pakistan’s constitution and international human rights obligations, including in relation to Imran. Family access and medical concerns Several peers highlighted reports that Imran had been denied access to lawyers, family members and doctors, and was being held in solitary confinement.

      "summary_orig": "The district administration on Thursday imposed Section 144 in the districts of Upper South Waziristan and Lower South Waziristan due to rising security concerns and to facilitate the movement of logistics for security forces. Officials said the move aims to ensure public safety, maintain law and order, and facilitate the uninterrupted operational movement of security personnel. Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir confirmed that Section 144 has been enforced in the tehsils of Sarvekai and Sararogha from 6am to 6pm. During this period, all movement will be strictly prohibited, and all markets and commercial centres will remain closed. The affected routes include Makin, Sararogha, Kot Kai and Spinkai Raghzai up to Nazar Khel. Additionally, the route from Dargai Bridge through Madi Jan, Sheen Warsak and Moley Khan Sarai to Chagmalai will also remain closed. Officials said in the statement that residents have been instructed to stop their vehicles at least 50 metres before approaching security forces and to ensure that all passengers exit the vehicle if required. The DC emphasised that violators will be held personally accountable and that strict compliance with security directives is mandatory. Meanwhile, Lower South Waziristan DC Musarat Zaman announced that Section 144 has also been enforced in various parts of Wana. The curfew, effective from 6am to 6pm, prohibits all non-essential movement. The measure comes in response to security threats and the movement of security forces. Officials said that restricted routes include Wana, Tiarza Gate, Karb Kot, Tanai, and Azizabad Chowk up to Dargai Bridge. Movement is only allowed for emergency purposes with prior permission from police or security forces and submission of valid identification and travel documents. The deputy commissioner urged citizens to strictly adhere to security instructions and avoid non-essential travel. Any violation will be the sole responsibility of the individual concerned, he said. During the enforcement of Section 144 in both districts, only approved emergency movement will be permitted. Citizens were advised to cooperate fully with security forces, remain patient, and avoid any activities that may compromise public safety. Markets, shops, and commercial centres will remain closed to maintain law and order. Officials stressed that these measures were essential to maintain sustainable peace, support security operations, and ensure the safety of residents. The South Waziristan region has seen a deteriorating security situation in the past few months, alongside a spike in terrorist activities across the province. Earlier this month, Mehsud tribal elders and jirga members called on the Upper South Waziristan DC to highlight the lack of basic facilities and raise law and order concerns. On Nov 10, 2025, the Cadet College in Lower South Waziristan’s Wana had come under attack by terrorists, who the government identified as Afghan nationals. The attackers had targeted the college’s main gate and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy. While all students and teachers were safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed , the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals.",

Eyewitnesses reported that 10–12 armed men entered the mosque, held worshippers hostage, and abducted three brothers before fleeing to an unknown location. The abducted individuals were identified as Saeed Akhtar, a clerk at the commissioner’s office, and Amjad and Hazratullah serving in the Wazir subdivision’s police force. Police officials confirmed that the two abducted police personnel were later brutally killed and their bodies were dumped along Marwat Canal Road, while the third brother remains missing. Local Chairman Masoom Wazir said he received information about two bodies and, upon reaching the site, found both victims covered in blood. The bodies were immediately taken to the District Headquarters Hospital. RPO Bannu Sajjad Khan stated that the kidnappers were affiliated with a militant group and that a full-scale operation is underway against them. He vowed that the martyrs’ blood would not be in vain and that the perpetrators would be brought to justice at all costs. He strongly condemned the terrorists for violating the sanctity of a mosque, describing it as a deeply tragic and reprehensible act. The RPO added that terrorist elements have previously used mosques as hideouts, but police continue to carry out operations against such groups to ensure the protection of places of worship and the lives and property of citizens. The senior police official stated that police and other security agencies are jointly conducting search operations at various locations to recover the third abducted individual. He urged the public to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement authorities immediately. Funeral prayers offered for martyred policemen Funeral prayers for the two martyred police personnel were offered with full state honours at the Police Lines in Bannu today, bringing the community together in grief and solidarity.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: A government high school building in North Waziristan was severely damaged in a suspected drone strike late on Wednesday night, just days before educational institutions were scheduled to reopen. Fortunately, no casualties were reported. The incident occurred in the Miami Kabul Khel Dorazinda area of the Shewa tehsil. Government High School Shamazan Kot sustained extensive damage, with nearly 80 per cent of its structure reportedly reduced to rubble. According to local sources, a powerful explosion was heard across the surrounding villages, triggering panic and fear among residents. However, the blast took place at night while the school was closed, ensuring that students and staff remained unharmed. A senior district administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that an investigation has been launched to determine the exact nature and cause of the explosion. Authorities are collecting evidence from the site to ascertain whether it was a drone strike or another form of attack. District police and security personnel have cordoned off the area and initiated a search operation. In an official statement, authorities said security around educational institutions would be further tightened, and emergency measures would be taken to rehabilitate and reconstruct the damaged school building. Local residents expressed deep concern over the incident, particularly as schools across the region were due to reopen on March 1. Parents and students fear the attack may disrupt the fragile return to normalcy in the conflict-affected district. “Education here is already struggling. If schools themselves are targeted, what future will our children have?” said an elderly tribal elder while speaking to this correspondent. A parent of one of the students told Dawn that the government must not only ensure the immediate reconstruction of the school, but also establish lasting peace in the area so that children can pursue their education without fear. Educational institutions in North Waziristan and adjoining tribal districts have previously been targeted in various incidents. In some cases, militant elements have blown up school buildings using explosive materials, while in others, structures have reportedly sustained damage during security operations. Only a few weeks ago, another alleged drone strike in the same area left students and a teacher injured. Investigations into that incident are still underway. While attacks targeting infrastructure are fairly common in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has also seen a rise in such incidents in recent months. In May 2024, a private girls’ school in Shewa was also blown up by unidentified militants. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up . No loss of life was reported in the incidents.",

      "summary_orig": "The US Justice Department announced the arrest on Wednesday of a former Air Force fighter pilot who allegedly trained Chinese military personnel without authorisation. Gerald Brown, 65, was arrested in Indiana after having recently returned to the United States from China, where he had been since December 2023, a Justice Department statement said. He is accused of having “conspired with foreign nationals to provide combat aircraft training to pilots in the Chinese Air Force” without a required license from the US State Department, the statement said. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel posted on X: “Major story… the FBI and our partners have arrested a former US Air Force Pilot who was allegedly training pilots in the Chinese military.” Brown had a 24-year career in the US Air Force during which he “commanded sensitive units with responsibility for nuclear weapons delivery systems, led combat missions, and served as a fighter pilot instructor and simulator instructor on a variety of fighter and attack aircraft”. He had retired from the military in 1996 and worked as a cargo pilot, the statement said, but he later began a role as a US defence contractor training pilots to fly the A-10 and state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets. He allegedly began negotiating a contract in August 2023 with Stephen Su Bin — a Chinese national who was imprisoned in the United States for four years beginning in 2016 over another espionage scheme — and travelled in December 2023 to China to begin his training job. “The Chinese government continues to exploit the expertise of current and former members of the US armed forces to modernise China’s military capabilities,” said Roman Rozhavsky, an official with the FBI’s Counterintelligence and Espionage Division. “This arrest serves as a warning that the FBI and our partners will stop at nothing to hold accountable anyone who collaborates with our adversaries to harm our service members and jeopardise our national security,” he added.",

Sifting through technical data, establishing coordinates and isolating the target,” a senior security official said. “It didn’t take long before we knew the location.” By late evening, they had already laid siege to the residence, taken up position and called out those inside to come out, hands raised, and surrender. For a moment, there was no movement. But then, someone showed a raised hand from behind the door, indicating their willingness to surrender. Except that he didn’t. Aiming a 9mm gun straight at the security cordon, the lone gunman fired straight shots, hitting an assistant sub inspector of the police right in the chest, killing him on the spot, and injuring two intelligence officers. The exchange of fire didn’t last long, though. Within minutes, the gunman, said to be in his mid-thirties, was shot and killed. But the brief distraction offered by the gun battle gave those inside the house sufficient time to destroy cellphones and any other evidence of communication that could possibly betray them. The gunman turned out to be a high-value target — identified as Yousaf alias Qasim aka Idrees — the leader of the militant Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group in the Bajaur region, and the main handler of the Imambargah suicide bomber, carrying a reward of Rs12 million. What followed was more startling, as the counter-terrorism department dug further into this cell’s activities. The gang, it turned out, had been involved in a series of assassinations and suicide bombings before stepping out of the tribal district to relocate to Gujranwala, Lahore and finally to Nowshera’s Hakimabad. Investigators now have enough evidence to link them to the targeted assassination of all 20 men involved in the lynching to death of an IS-K operative, out to kill a local JUI-F leader for issuing a scathing attack against it. They were also linked to the assassination of senior JUI-F figure Mufti Sultan Mahmood in Bajaur in October 2019, a suicide bombing at the party’s convention on July 30, 2021 that left more than 54 dead and over a hundred wounded, and the bombing and assassination of ANP leader Maulana Khanzeb on July 10, 2025. Additionally, investigators say, the group was involved in the killings of at least 15 policemen, as well as the murder of the Nawagai assistant commissioner in a bombing on July 2, 2025. Investigators say that Idrees — a tailor by profession — had been on their radar for some time, but had managed to evade capture by changing locations, moving with women and children, and avoiding staying at one location for longer periods. “Pretty much living like nomads, leaving whatever little they had behind before moving onto the next location without notifying the landlord,” was how one official described his movements. What surprised investigators the most was the role of the women in the group. Investigators have now established that not only did the suicide bomber travel to Afghanistan’s Kunar in May 2025, the women had also crossed the border using tampered passports. Not only that, but one of the women had carried the suicide vest from Bajaur to Islamabad, and handed it over to another woman in the group. “They are all indoctrinated. The whole family is radicalised,” a senior investigator said. As investigators dig deeper into the working and operations of IS-Khorasan, there is a realisation that its network is far bigger and more spread out than previously thought — from the Middle East to Central Asian Republics, and onwards into Afghanistan and Pakistan. They use cryptocurrency for money transfer and employ encrypted communication apps, making their communications very hard to break. Based on what they have learned, investigators now consider IS-Khorasan a much bigger threat than the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan in terms of its capability for mass killing, compartmentalisation, commitment to ideology, resources and the sophistication of their operations.

The past few months had been a nightmare, with passengers travelling abroad from Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad routinely complaining of long queues, repeated questioning by security personnel, and extremely long waits for immigration clearance. It seems that some unscrupulous elements had also jumped at the opportunity to fleece time-stressed travellers by furtively offering ‘facilitation services’ in exchange for extortive ‘fees’. Some passengers had even complained on social media that the free-to-use luggage trolleys meant to facilitate travellers had ‘disappeared’ from their usual drop-off spots, and they were forced to pay to use one. Then there were the reports of passengers being denied boarding on flimsy pretexts, or for no reason at all. It seems that the growing discontent finally forced the authorities to restore some order. While there is no question that Pakistan needs to crack down on human smuggling and prevent unscrupulous elements from travelling abroad for less-than-legitimate reasons, the way the authorities went about it has left a bad taste. There was never any good reason to subject all foreign travellers to dehumanising and distressing checks and interrogation at the final stage of departure. If the authorities were serious, they would have launched a comprehensive drive against criminals running human smuggling networks, as well as the shysters and ‘immigration advisers’ who sell promises of employment abroad in return for exorbitant fees. That they chose to inconvenience countless travellers — including the old, the sick and those travelling with little children — just so that they could ‘look good’ in the eyes of those passing the orders goes to show what little consideration is accorded to ordinary citizens. One can only be grateful that sense seems to be prevailing at last. Otherwise, this could just as easily have become standard operating procedure. Published in Dawn, February 26th, 2026",
