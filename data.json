      "summary_orig": "Police on Saturday registered a first information report (FIR) over the devastating Gul Plaza inferno, citing the incident as an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”. The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished , has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some sections collapsed. It has so far claimed 71 lives. South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the FIR had been registered on behalf of the state, through a police official, under relevant laws. According to the FIR, Nabi Bux Station House Officer (SHO) Inspector Nawaz Ali Zardari said the police received information about the fire in the plaza at around 10:30pm on January 17. The FIR added that the fire was “rapidly spreading and engulfed the entire plaza” while firefighters and other rescue personnel were engaged in efforts to extinguish the blaze. It further stated that the fire erupted in shop number 193, a flower and gift shop, located on the ground floor, and quickly spread in the shopping plaza. “Rescue work is ongoing and there are apprehensions of more deaths,” said the FIR. The police also blamed the lack of firefighting equipment and “no reasonable arrangements” in the case of an emergency for the tragedy. The report added that there were “no emergency exits” and that electricity had been switched off, complicating the evacuation of those inside the shopping plaza. “Due to these reasons, precious human lives were lost and substantive financial losses also occurred.” The FIR has been registered under Sections 322 (murder without intention), 337-H(i) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). Police have not nominated anyone in the case; therefore, the FIR has been registered against unknown persons. Need to learn lessons: Khaqan Abbasi Separately, Awaam Pakistan Convenor Shahid Khaqan Abbasi paid a visit to Gul Plaza, where he stressed the need to “learn lessons” from the incident and take corrective measures. “This has been a complete failure […] There are thousands of such buildings in Karachi. What will the government do about those?” he said while speaking to the media. The ex-premier remarked that possibly replacing a “few officials” after an investigation was “no compensation” for the loss of lives and property caused by the fire. During the media talk, a citizen decried that the relatives of the deceased who had come for shopping were “not getting any information” or propoer responses. “We had given our DNA report from the first day [of the incident], but we have got nothing so far.” Responding to him and another query, Abbasi said, “Whenever such incidents take place, the government institutions come and analyse how many people have been martyred and how their relatives can be helped. “[…] It takes some time but it appears that such a procedure has not been employed […] how they can be consoled, helped in the identification.” Addressing a press conference at Karachi Press Club later, the Awaam Pakistan chief stressed that it was the responsibility of the government to “at least listen” to the affected people. CM Murad announces major relief, accountability measures On Friday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah briefed the provincial assembly on the incident, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab in attendance. Recalling that Rs10 million had been announced for the family of each deceased individual, CM Murad said the required funds have been released and handed over to the Karachi commissioner for distribution. About the committee formed to estimate the losses faced by the businesses at Gul Plaza, he said the Sindh Assembly would compensate the affected people. The Sindh CM announced Rs500,000 in “immediate” financial assistance for the 1,102 shops approved by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) at Gul Plaza, and if any others had any proper documentation. “This is for their sustenance so that they can stand back on their feet, as the rest of the programme can take two to three months,” he noted. The chief minister further revealed that after some ministers’ efforts, 500 shops were made available in one building and 350 in another, whose owners have said they will not take any rent for one year. “My effort is to make arrangements for them (shop occupants/renters) to get makeshift shops for two years,” Murad said. He went on to announce that the Sindh government, through the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund, would arrange the “security/collateral” for the affected people and pay the interest if someone wanted Rs10m in loans. The Sindh CM said Gul Plaza would likely be demolished and then rebuilt, with each shop getting the same area size it previously had. He added that the Sindh government would aim to reconstruct them within two years. The chief minister also stated that an audit will be conducted and non-compliant buildings would be given a “brief period” to comply, failing which they would be sealed. He further said that he has directed the provincial law minister to draft legislation for making insurance mandatory.",

      "title_orig": "Imaan-Hadi arrest and a state at war with dissent",
      "summary_orig": "“As dissenters challenge existing ideas, social consciousness grows, the condition of human existence and rights improve and society progresses …Thus, it is in society’s collective interest that the right to dissent be upheld, even though critical ideas might seem unpalatable. It is in the state’s own interest to tolerate ideas critical of it. Criticism of the state and its policies is a natural outcome of the democratic system of governance … the security of the state must not be projected by the state itself to be so fragile that critical speech would shake its foundation.” — Justice Babar Sattar in the case of Shoukat Ali vs. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2024 Islamabad 135) On Friday, lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were arrested while they were reportedly on the way to the Islamabad district courts. The multiple cases registered against them invoke provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), anti-terrorism legislation, and laws regulating public assembly. Their arrest demonstrates how the law is being employed to silence opposition, revealing a state increasingly at war with dissent. The allegations against Imaan include ‘offensive tweets’ against ‘important state institutions’. While Imaan is being prosecuted for posting content, Hadi is being prosecuted for reposting and resharing her content. Even clicking ‘repost’ on content that the state finds objectionable can subject an individual to criminal prosecution. A state that treats criticism as a crime undermines both democracy and the rule of law. When lawyers are punished for challenging state excesses, it is not just an attack on individuals, but on the legal system itself. Peca: an instrument of control When Peca was amended last year to include a punishment for “false and fake information” through Section 26-A, the government claimed the aim was to counter misinformation. The intent was clear then, and it is clear now: the amendment has nothing to do with fake news. It is an instrument of control. The Peca case against Imaan and Hadi includes provisions of cyberterrorism and the offence of fake/false information. The fundamental problem with Peca is that it has been structured in a manner to shield state institutions from criticism. By defining “unlawful content” as “aspersions against any person, including members of the judiciary, the armed forces, parliament or a provincial assembly”, the amendment seeks to elevate members of these institutions above public scrutiny or accountability. Constitutional democracies do not insulate individuals from criticism; they protect a citizen’s right to free speech. Freedom Network, a media watchdog that works on freedom of speech, reported that as per the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, 150 journalists faced charges under Peca in December 2024 alone, “often for allegedly spreading false narratives against state institutions”. When a law is enforced primarily against lawyers, journalists, and human rights defenders, its purpose is clear. Case after case, the reliance on a vague charge of propagating a “false narrative against the state” reveals the true function of Peca: it is not about countering misinformation, but transforming lawful dissent into a punishable offence. No society can claim to be governed by the rule of law when those defending it are themselves under attack. A mockery of the justice system When the Islamabad High Court granted Imaan and Hadi time to appear before the trial court in the Peca case and expressly ordered that they shall not be arrested in the case, another first information report (FIR) suddenly emerged against them, levelling absurd allegations. The state’s conduct exposes a dangerous and unlawful pattern. When courts provide protection, coercive machinery is redeployed through new FIRs to nullify that relief. This creates a situation where court orders are rendered meaningless. If such conduct is permitted, the courts cease to operate as a check on executive power and judicial orders are immediately undone by executive action. According to reports, an FIR against Imaan was registered for a protest in February 2025, the day the Judicial Commission of Pakistan convened to appoint judges to the Supreme Court pursuant to the 26th Amendment . It also names several other lawyers who were at the protest. The FIR alleges, among other things, that slogans were raised against the constitutional amendment, the higher judiciary, and other state institutions. No action was taken at the time (nearly a year ago). Instead, criminal cases purportedly lodged months earlier are allowed to remain dormant, without investigation, only to be suddenly revived when judicial protection is granted in an unrelated case. The latest FIR also includes provisions of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act 2024 , an oppressive law that effectively does away with the right to protest in Islamabad. The law defines ‘assembly’ as any gathering of more than 15 people, and makes assemblies subject to prior permission from the district magistrate. Authorities have the power to “recall” or “amend” permission. A police officer, on the instructions of the district magistrate, can order dispersal of a protest “likely to disturb the public peace”. The law imposes criminal penalties of imprisonment of up to three years or fines for being a member of an assembly classified as unlawful. The message that is being sent through these cases is that no form of dissent — whether online or on the streets — is acceptable. Legal resistance will be met with retaliation. Speaking out against enforced disappearances on social media is being treated as a criminal offence. Protesting against the destructive constitutional amendments can lead to criminal cases being registered. The anti-terrorism law was introduced as a special law to address terrorism offences, and special courts were created to hear terrorism cases. Using this law against human rights defenders, journalists, and lawyers subverts its very purpose. There are reports of a spike in terrorism incidents, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Yet, the state is focusing its resources on categorising human rights defenders and lawyers as terrorists. The misuse of power is a betrayal of the state’s responsibility. And this conduct reflects a deliberate strategy of intimidation designed to silence voices that hold state power accountable. The visuals and manner of the arrest were equally shameful. “Eyewitnesses report that law enforcement officials used undue force against both the lawyers, and no reasons were provided at the time of arrest, raising serious concerns about their safety,” per Amnesty International. Imaan’s mother, former federal minister for human rights Dr Shireen Mazari said: “I have no idea where my daughter and her husband have been taken”. The state’s actions signal a breakdown of the law and the increasing capacity of the state to act with complete impunity. Arresting individuals without informing them of the charge and withholding information from their legal counsel and families is a clear violation of due process. Such actions are the hallmarks of authoritarianism, not lawful governance. Post-amendment judiciary While two officers of the court are subjected to legal harassment, the post-amendment judiciary serves its intended purpose by allowing it to continue. A society in which the judiciary does not defend rights and prevent blatant abuse of power is a frightening place, leaving citizens entirely unprotected and vulnerable to arbitrary executive action. As per the 26th and 27th amendments, the Judicial Commission, including members of the executive, shall conduct an “annual performance evaluation” of the judges of high courts. If judges are to be “evaluated” by a commission that has government representatives on it, independent decision-making is compromised. If a judge renders a decision against the government, the government representatives in the commission may render a negative evaluation against the judge. The provision effectively places a sword of Damocles over the judiciary and allows the executive to intimidate judges. Imaan and Hadi are among the few lawyers in Pakistan who consistently represent the most vulnerable victims of state abuse, from families of victims of enforced disappearances to those caught up in blasphemy cases. Pakistan’s fear of its human rights defenders is a confession: the truth is more threatening than anything else. This is not just about two individuals facing legal harassment. It is about the reality that tomorrow it could be any lawyer, journalist, or citizen who speaks out and challenges state excesses.",

      "title_en": "Imaan-Hadi arrest and a state at war with dissent",
      "summary_en": "“As dissenters challenge existing ideas, social consciousness grows, the condition of human existence and rights improve and society progresses …Thus, it is in society’s collective interest that the right to dissent be upheld, even though critical ideas might seem unpalatable. It is in the state’s own interest to tolerate ideas critical of it. Criticism of the state and its policies is a natural outcome of the democratic system of governance … the security of the state must not be projected by the state itself to be so fragile that critical speech would shake its foundation.” — Justice Babar Sattar in the case of Shoukat Ali vs. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2024 Islamabad 135) On Friday, lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were arrested while they were reportedly on the way to the Islamabad district courts. The multiple cases registered against them invoke provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), anti-terrorism legislation, and laws regulating public assembly. Their arrest demonstrates how the law is being employed to silence opposition, revealing a state increasingly at war with dissent. The allegations against Imaan include ‘offensive tweets’ against ‘important state institutions’. While Imaan is being prosecuted for posting content, Hadi is being prosecuted for reposting and resharing her content. Even clicking ‘repost’ on content that the state finds objectionable can subject an individual to criminal prosecution. A state that treats criticism as a crime undermines both democracy and the rule of law. When lawyers are punished for challenging state excesses, it is not just an attack on individuals, but on the legal system itself. Peca: an instrument of control When Peca was amended last year to include a punishment for “false and fake information” through Section 26-A, the government claimed the aim was to counter misinformation. The intent was clear then, and it is clear now: the amendment has nothing to do with fake news. It is an instrument of control. The Peca case against Imaan and Hadi includes provisions of cyberterrorism and the offence of fake/false information. The fundamental problem with Peca is that it has been structured in a manner to shield state institutions from criticism. By defining “unlawful content” as “aspersions against any person, including members of the judiciary, the armed forces, parliament or a provincial assembly”, the amendment seeks to elevate members of these institutions above public scrutiny or accountability. Constitutional democracies do not insulate individuals from criticism; they protect a citizen’s right to free speech. Freedom Network, a media watchdog that works on freedom of speech, reported that as per the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, 150 journalists faced charges under Peca in December 2024 alone, “often for allegedly spreading false narratives against state institutions”. When a law is enforced primarily against lawyers, journalists, and human rights defenders, its purpose is clear. Case after case, the reliance on a vague charge of propagating a “false narrative against the state” reveals the true function of Peca: it is not about countering misinformation, but transforming lawful dissent into a punishable offence. No society can claim to be governed by the rule of law when those defending it are themselves under attack. A mockery of the justice system When the Islamabad High Court granted Imaan and Hadi time to appear before the trial court in the Peca case and expressly ordered that they shall not be arrested in the case, another first information report (FIR) suddenly emerged against them, levelling absurd allegations. The state’s conduct exposes a dangerous and unlawful pattern. When courts provide protection, coercive machinery is redeployed through new FIRs to nullify that relief. This creates a situation where court orders are rendered meaningless. If such conduct is permitted, the courts cease to operate as a check on executive power and judicial orders are immediately undone by executive action. According to reports, an FIR against Imaan was registered for a protest in February 2025, the day the Judicial Commission of Pakistan convened to appoint judges to the Supreme Court pursuant to the 26th Amendment . It also names several other lawyers who were at the protest. The FIR alleges, among other things, that slogans were raised against the constitutional amendment, the higher judiciary, and other state institutions. No action was taken at the time (nearly a year ago). Instead, criminal cases purportedly lodged months earlier are allowed to remain dormant, without investigation, only to be suddenly revived when judicial protection is granted in an unrelated case. The latest FIR also includes provisions of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act 2024 , an oppressive law that effectively does away with the right to protest in Islamabad. The law defines ‘assembly’ as any gathering of more than 15 people, and makes assemblies subject to prior permission from the district magistrate. Authorities have the power to “recall” or “amend” permission. A police officer, on the instructions of the district magistrate, can order dispersal of a protest “likely to disturb the public peace”. The law imposes criminal penalties of imprisonment of up to three years or fines for being a member of an assembly classified as unlawful. The message that is being sent through these cases is that no form of dissent — whether online or on the streets — is acceptable. Legal resistance will be met with retaliation. Speaking out against enforced disappearances on social media is being treated as a criminal offence. Protesting against the destructive constitutional amendments can lead to criminal cases being registered. The anti-terrorism law was introduced as a special law to address terrorism offences, and special courts were created to hear terrorism cases.

A large number of displaced families leaving Tirah in preparation for an operation in the valley were stranded in a snowstorm in Khyber district on Friday. KP’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said in a statement that the rescue operations were ongoing for those trapped in the valley. “Rescue 1122 has so far rescued more than 1,500 people and 350 vehicles and shifted them to safe places during the rescue operation, while more than 100 people have also been provided medical assistance,” he said. Rescue 1122 teams conduct operations in the Tirah Valley to rescue over 1,500 people trapped due to heavy snowfall, in Khyber district on January 24. — photo via author The spokesperson added that over 100 personnel and officers from Khyber, Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera and Swabi’s Rescue 1122 divisions were participating in the operation. In a later statement, Faizi said that the rescue operation had been ongoing for more than 36 hours. “Despite the severe cold, sub-zero temperatures and difficult routes, rescue personnel are in the field and are carrying out rescue activities without interruption,” he said. The Khyber district administration on Thursday suspended the evacuation of more families from Tirah Valley in view of the heavy snowfall, asking them to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather. Citizens advised to avoid travel Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) said that the Murree Expressway had been opened to limited traffic due to an improvement in the weather conditions. “However, due to the changing weather conditions and increasing rush, there is a possibility of closing the Murree Expressway,” the spokesperson added, requesting the public to avoid unnecessary travel. The spokesperson said that the motorway police had performed their duties with diligence during the heavy snowfall and that traffic was controlled via the “best strategy according to the situation”, adding that the relevant officers themselves were in the field taking the lead. According to the motorways spokesperson, more rain and snowfall is predicted in Murree and Galiyat on Monday and Tuesday. NHMP’s media department requested that tourists cooperate with the Motorway Police, who would be on alert 24 hours a day to prevent any sudden disaster. “The Motorway Police will be present to guide and protect tourists,” it said. It advised citizens to contact its helpline at 130 in case of emergency and obtain guidance from the Motorway Police’s social media accounts before starting the journey.",

Citizens advised to avoid travel Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) said that the Murree Expressway had been opened to limited traffic due to an improvement in the weather conditions. “However, due to the changing weather conditions and increasing rush, there is a possibility of closing the Murree Expressway,” the spokesperson added, requesting the public to avoid unnecessary travel. The spokesperson said that the motorway police had performed their duties with diligence during the heavy snowfall and that traffic was controlled via the “best strategy according to the situation”, adding that the relevant officers themselves were in the field taking the lead. According to the motorways spokesperson, more rain and snowfall is predicted in Murree and Galiyat on Monday and Tuesday. NHMP’s media department requested that tourists cooperate with the Motorway Police, who would be on alert 24 hours a day to prevent any sudden disaster. “The Motorway Police will be present to guide and protect tourists,” it said. It advised citizens to contact its helpline at 130 in case of emergency and obtain guidance from the Motorway Police’s social media accounts before starting the journey.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran will treat any attack “as an all-out war against us,” a senior Iranian official said on Friday, ahead of the arrival of a US military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days. “This military buildup — we hope it is not intended for real confrontation — but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran,” said the senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “This time we will treat any attack — limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it — as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this,” the official said. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an “armada” heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program. “If the Americans violate Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond,” said the Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like. “A country under constant military threat from the United States has no option but to ensure that everything at its disposal can be used to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran,” the official said. The US military has, in the past, periodically sent increased forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive. However, the US military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran’s nuclear program. Air France suspends service to Dubai as KLM halts Middle East flights At least two European airlines suspended flights to cities in the Middle East on Friday, with Air France saying it will temporarily stop service to Dubai due to the geopolitical situation. Dutch airline KLM also halted flights until further notice to cities in the Middle East and would not fly through the airspace of several countries in the region, including Iraq and Iran, according to the Netherlands’ state broadcaster. “Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the company has decided to temporarily suspend its service to Dubai,” France’s national carrier said in a statement to AFP. The airline added it was “constantly monitoring the evolution of the geopolitical situation in the territories served and overflown by its aircraft” to ensure “the highest level of safety and security” for its flights. “Air France is monitoring the situation in real time and will provide further updates on its flight schedule,” the French airline said. KLM told Dutch public broadcaster NOS on Friday that it had suspended flights until further notice to Tel Aviv, Dubai, Dammam and Riyadh and would not fly through the airspace of Iraq, Iran, Israel and several countries in the Gulf. The airline did not disclose the reason for the suspensions and said it was in touch with Dutch authorities, according to NOS. Trump has repeatedly threatened US strikes on Iran over the crackdown on the protest movement that recently erupted across the Islamic republic. The prospect of military action appeared to recede last week after the White House said Tehran had halted planned executions of demonstrators, but Trump on Thursday confirmed continuing military preparations. “You know we have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case… We have a big force going toward Iran,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the United States will meet in Abu Dhabi on Saturday for the second day of negotiations on a plan being pushed by US President Donald Trump to end the almost four-year-long war. The first known direct contact between Ukrainian and Russian officials on the proposal began Friday. Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said the discussions focused “on the parameters for ending Russia’s war and the further logic of the negotiation process”. An initial US draft drew heavy criticism in Kyiv and western Europe for hewing too closely to Moscow’s line, while later iterations prompted pushback from Russia for floating the idea of European peacekeepers. Both sides say the fate of territory in the eastern Donbas region is one of the main outstanding issues in the search for a settlement to a war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and decimated parts of Ukraine. The UAE foreign ministry said in a statement that the talks were scheduled to last two days and were “part of ongoing efforts to promote dialogue and identify political solutions to the crisis”. Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday and US envoy Steve Witkoff later held talks with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. Donbas dispute The Emirates meeting began as thousands of people in Kyiv were without heating in sub-zero temperatures due to Russian strikes. The European Union, which has sent hundreds of generators, accused Moscow of “deliberately depriving civilians of heat”. Further Russian strikes killed one person and injured 22 others in Ukraine’s capital and the northeastern city of Kharkiv overnight, authorities said early Saturday. “Kyiv is under a massive enemy attack,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko posted on Telegram, adding that several non-residential buildings had been hit and telling residents to remain in shelters. While diplomacy to end Europe’s worst conflict since World War II has gained pace, Moscow and Kyiv appear deadlocked over the issue of territory. Hours after Putin met Witkoff — and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — in Moscow, the Kremlin said its maximalist demand that Kyiv withdraw from the eastern Donbas region still stood. “Russia’s position is well known on the fact that Ukraine, Ukrainian armed forces, have to leave the territory of the Donbas,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “This is a very important condition,” he added. Kyiv, which still controls around 20 per cent of the eastern region, has rejected such terms. ‘Desire to end the war’ Ahead of the talks Zelensky told reporters territory remained a “key issue” — with Moscow having said it is not dropping its demand that Kyiv pull out of its eastern Donbas region. In a post online, he later added: “It is necessary that not only Ukraine has the desire to end the war and achieve full security, but that a similar desire somehow emerges in Russia as well.” Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are last known to have met face-to-face in Istanbul last summer, in talks that ended only in deals to exchange captured soldiers. The Abu Dhabi meeting is the first time they have faced each other to talk about the Trump administration’s plan. Putin has repeatedly said Moscow intends to get full control of eastern Ukraine by force if talks fail. After the Russia-US talks in the Kremlin, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov insisted Moscow was “genuinely interested in resolving” the war diplomatically. But he added: “Until that happens, Russia will continue to achieve its objectives… on the battlefield.” Trump has in the past pressured Ukraine to agree to terms that Kyiv sees as capitulation. Trump repeated on Wednesday his belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal. “I believe they’re at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don’t, they’re stupid — that goes for both of them,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "India and Europe hope to strike the “mother of all deals” when European Union (EU) chiefs meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi next week, as the two economic behemoths seek to forge closer ties. Facing challenges from China and the United States, India and the European Union have been negotiating a massive free trade pact — and talks, first launched about two decades ago, are nearing the finishing line. “We are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week. Von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa will attend Republic Day celebrations on Monday before an EU-India summit on Tuesday, where they hope to shake hands on the accord. Securing a pact, described by India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal as “the mother of all deals”, would be a major win for Brussels and New Delhi as both seek to open up new markets in the face of US tariffs and Chinese export controls . But officials have been eager to stress there is more to it than commerce. “The EU and India are moving closer together at the time when the rules-based international order is under unprecedented pressure through wars, coercion and economic fragmentation,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on Wednesday. ‘Untapped potential’ Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and US President Donald Trump’s punitive tariffs have brought momentum to the relationship between India and the EU, said Praveen Donthi, of the International Crisis Group think tank. “The EU eyes the Indian market and aims to steer a rising power like India away from Russia, while India seeks to diversify its partnerships, doubling down on its strategy of multi-alignment at a time when its relations with the US have taken a downward turn,” he said. Spain’s Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares shakes hand with India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar during a visit to New Delhi, India on Jan 21, 2026. — Spain’s Foreign Ministry via Reuters The summit will offer Brussels the chance to turn the page after a bruising transatlantic crisis over Greenland — now seemingly defused. Together, the EU and India account for about a quarter of the world’s population and GDP. Bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion ($139bn) in 2024, an increase of nearly 90 per cent over the past decade, according to EU figures, with a further €60bn ($69bn ) in trade in services. But both parties are eager to do more. “India still accounts for around only around 2.5 per cent of total EU trade in goods, compared with close to 15 per cent for China,” an EU official said, adding the figure gave a sense of the “untapped potential” an agreement could unlock. EU makers of cars, machinery and chemicals have much to gain from India lowering entry barriers, said Ignacio Garcia Bercero, an analyst at Brussels think tank Bruegel, who led EU trade talks with New Delhi over a decade ago. “India is one of the most heavily protected economies in the world, with very, very high tariffs, including on many products where the European Union has a competitive advantage,” he told AFP . With its economy in the doldrums, the 27-member EU is also pushing to ease exports of spirits and wines and strengthen intellectual property rules. India — the fastest-growing major economy in the world — wants easier market access for products such as textiles and pharmaceuticals. Defence pact EU officials were tight-lipped about the deal’s contents as negotiations are ongoing. But agriculture, a sensitive topic in both India and Europe, is likely to play a limited role, with New Delhi eager to protect its dairy and grain sectors. Talks are focusing on a few sticking points, including the impact of the EU’s carbon border tax on steel exports and safety and quality standards in the pharmaceutical and automotive sectors, according to people familiar with the discussions. Still, EU officials said they were confident negotiations could be concluded in time for the summit. An accord on mobility to facilitate movement for seasonal workers, students, researchers and highly skilled professionals, is also on the menu, alongside a security and defence pact. The latter envisages closer cooperation in areas including maritime security, cybersecurity and counter-terrorism, an EU official said. It is also a “precondition” for the possible joint production of military equipment, said a second EU official. New Delhi, which has relied on Moscow for decades for key military hardware, has tried to cut its dependence on Russia in recent years by diversifying imports and pushing its own domestic manufacturing base . Europe is doing the same vis-à-vis the US. “We’re ready to open a new chapter in EU-India relationships, and really to unlock what we think is the transformative potential of this partnership,” said another EU official.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Iranian-American academic and political scientist Vali Nasr suggested on Friday that the war on Palestine had politically weakened Arab states and emboldened Israeli leaders, to the point that the latter had abandoned the two-state framework entirely. Speaking at a session titled ‘The Gaza War and the Remaking of the Middle East’, moderated by journalist Najam Sethi, Mr Nasr implied that the situation has proven detrimental to the Palestinian cause. He said Israel now believes it can pursue its objectives primarily through force. “With Arab states politically neutralised, Israeli leaders see little incentive to return to negotiations,” he added. According to him, Israeli leadership now views political compromise with the Palestinians as a security liability rather than a pathway to stability, effectively abandoning the two-state framework. Following the Gaza war, Israel moved against Hezbollah in Lebanon, significantly weakening the group’s operational capacity. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024 further altered the regional balance. Scholar notes Pakistan currently enjoying ‘diplomatic honeymoon’ with Washington, which won’t last for long Hamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian government, long aligned with Iran and regarded as part of the so-called “axis of resistance”, were effectively dismantled. “With this strategic buffer around Israel gone, Israeli policymakers believed they could confront Iran more directly,” the political scientist said, referring to Israeli-US military strikes on Iran in October 2024. He said Arab states have also seen their influence in regional affairs diminish, leaving them increasingly sidelined. Israel, Mr Nasr argued, has concluded that military strength is now its primary guarantee of security. As Iran’s regional influence declined, Arab and Muslim countries reassessed Tehran’s strategic importance as a symbol, pillar, and financier of resistance. “Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey moved to restore and strengthen ties with Iran, recognising its symbolic and geopolitical counterweight to Israel,” he said. Mr Nasr also said the events of Oct 7, 2023 marked a turning point that reshaped regional politics and power dynamics. “In many ways, everything in the Middle East changed on that day,” he said. Until then, he explained, US strategy in the region centred on normalising Saudi-Israeli relations, expanding the Abraham Accords, building regional trade corridors, and linking Middle Eastern economies with Europe and India while bypassing China. “The events of October 7 pushed the Palestinian issue, which the US and many regional allies had put on the back burner, back to the centre of global attention,” Mr Nasr said, adding that Israel’s security doctrine has since undergone a fundamental shift. He also criticised the “ Board of Peace ” initiative announced by US President Donald Trump, calling it ineffective because it excludes Palestinians. According to Mr Nasr, several participating countries joined mainly to maintain favourable relations with Trump rather than to advance a genuine peace process. Despite the shifting landscape, the political scientist said key questions remain unresolved. “The future of Gaza is still unclear. There are also uncertainties surrounding the role of a potential Pakistan-Saudi defence partnership and how Iran and Turkey will manage their competing interests in Syria,” he said. However, he concluded that the regional balance of power has already undergone a historic shift. “The Middle East has entered a new phase, and this transformation may well be permanent,” he said. ‘Diplomatic honeymoon’ In a separate discussion, titled ‘Pakistan: Between the USA and China’, Mr Nasr argued against the view that China’s rise is irreversible and America’s decline is inevitable, advising middle powers such as Pakistan to focus on strengthening their own technological and economic foundations. Sharing the stage with former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and journalist Raza Rumi, Mr Nasr described Pakistan’s current relationship with Washington as a diplomatic “honeymoon”, which had so far helped shield Islamabad from difficult questions regarding its strategic ties with China and its defence cooperation with Saudi Arabia. “This relationship has also helped Pakistan avoid scrutiny over its conflict with India, largely because it played its diplomatic cards well,” he said. Noting that Pakistan had also benefited from the recent strain in US-India ties, Mr Nasr cautioned that this favourable phase may not last long. “The United States effectively has two centres of power — one represented by the White House and the other by permanent institutions such as the State Department and the Pentagon,” he said. “Pakistan is currently engaging mainly with the White House and benefiting from it, but the institutional system is likely to reassert itself and reopen uncomfortable discussions.” Ms Khar largely agreed with Nasr’s assessment, and called for Pakistan to deepen its alignment with China — which she described as more predictable and consistent in its diplomacy — while maintaining constructive relations with the United States. “The US remains a global superpower and Pakistan must remain on the right side of Washington,” she said, but warned policymakers not to assume that this situation would last.

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least five people were killed while 10 others were injured in a suicide attack at the residence of a peace committee member near Qureshi Morr on Friday night, according to officials. According to Dera Ismail Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada, the explosion occurred during a wedding celebration at the residence of the peace committee chief, identified as Noor Alam Mehsud. The participants were reportedly dancing to the beat of a drum when the attack was carried out. The blast caused the room’s roof to collapse, hampering rescue operations and making it difficult to reach those trapped under the debris. “The explosion was a suicide blast,” the DPO told Dawn . He said that an emergency had been imposed at the District Headquarter Hospital. In a statement, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said five bodies and 10 injured had been taken to the hospital. He said that seven ambulances, a fire vehicle and a disaster vehicle reached the site of the incident soon after it was reported, adding that a rescue operation was under way. Authorities cordoned off the area and launched an investigation into the incident. Initial reports said peace committee leader Waheedullah Mehsud alias Jigri Mehsud was among the dead. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi strongly condemned the blast and sought a report from the KP inspector general of police. According to a statement, he also directed law enforcement agencies to investigate the incident and identify those responsible. He said the responsible parties would be brought to justice. “The provincial government shares the grief of the martyrs’ families. All possible assistance will be provided,” he said. Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report into the incident, according to a statement from his office. “All possible medical assistance should be provided to the injured in the Dera blast,” he was quoted as saying, expressing grief over the incident. Earlier this month, armed assailants had killed four members of a peace committee in KP’s Bannu district. In November 2025, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked , also in KP’s Bannu district. Police officials told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Talib’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Hours after the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha on Friday, the couple was sent to jail on judicial remand by an anti-terrorism court. The development came in a case registered against the two for protesting outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and allegedly manhandling the IHC Bar Association (IHCBA) president. Strict security was enforced during the proceedings and lawyers and media persons were not allowed to enter the courtroom. The case was heard by ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Muhammad Zulqarnain. It should be mentioned that prior to Imaan and Hadi’s arrest on Friday morning, the two had spent three nights at the office of IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani. Their arrest subsequently prompted lawyers’ bodies to announce a complete strike, strongly condemning the action. Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court on Friday in the controversial social media posts case, in which Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Afzal Majoka had cancelled their bail on January 15 and issued their arrest warrants on January 16. According to IHCBA officials, Imaan and Hadi, along with the bar association’s president, had gone to surrender before IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfaraz Dogar today. However, they were informed by court staff that the chief justice was not present. They then returned to the bar association and later left for the district courts in an IHCBA vehicle, the officials said. As the convoy left the IHC premises, police vehicles already deployed outside the building for the past three days began following them. Near the underpass located in front of Serena Hotel, police intercepted the vehicle, arrested the couple and shifted them to an undisclosed location. Outside the Women Police Station, IHCBA President Gilani said that a new first information report (FIR) had been registered three days earlier against the two lawyers. He said that while the IHC had granted relief in one case, other matters were pending before Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, where the accused were required to appear. Meanwhile, IHCBA members alleged that despite assurances from the administration that the lawyers would not be arrested, police intercepted them and used force during the arrest. They claimed that police personnel assaulted the lawyers, forcibly opened vehicle doors, and manhandled Imaan during her arrest. The IHCBA expressed concern for her safety and alleged misconduct by law enforcement officials. IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said he was assured that the couple would not be arrested until they surrendered before the trial court. He resigned in protest over the arrest. Talking to Dawn , Jajja said that he has submitted his resignation to the Islamabad Bar Council. He said that the quarters concerned assured them of giving the couple a safe passage to face the trial. “Following the arrest, I have decided to quit from the office,” he said. Meanwhile, Additional District and Sessions Judge Majoka adjourned the hearing of the controversial social media posts case against the couple due to their absence. The court observed that the right to cross-examination could be closed if the accused failed to appear. Prosecutor Rana Usman informed the court that the accused were deliberately avoiding proceedings. Judge Majoka directed that cross-examination be completed by 3:30pm on Saturday, stating that sufficient time had already been granted. On Tuesday, the IHC — which Imaan and Hadi had approached for their bail in the social media posts case — had declared Judge Majoka’s arrest order against the two null and void and directed that the accused be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. The court categorically clarified that Imaan and Hadi should not be arrested in the case. However, the court had also observed that if the accused failed to appear before the trial court, the protection granted by the IHC would stand automatically terminated. ‘Fascism at its peak’ Earlier today, former minister and Imaan’s mother, Shireen Mazari, confirmed in a series of posts on X that her daughter had been arrested by police personnel, saying that she and her husband “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations.” The former lawmaker claimed that no first information report (FIR) was shown by the police and the bar association, “sadly, could do nothing”. “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!” Mazari added in a post on X. Mazari also shared videos showing police vehicles trailing the lawyers’ car, with officers stopping the vehicle and opening its doors. In a separate post, Mazari claimed the police “used violence on the bar leaders, [including] breaking the windows of the car, etc”. “All [because] the Twitter case had been exposed and more embarrassment would have followed in further [cross-examination] today,” the former minister said. “Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari alleged in another post. In a post at around 4:15pm, Mazari shared today’s court order and said: “So Imaan and Hadi were covertly presented in ATC just now, but lawyers were not allowed in and no one has been allowed to see this FIR, although the judge has ordered it be given to their lawyers. But they are being denied. Also no idea to which jail they will be taken.” In a subsequent post , she alleged: “Just learnt they were never even presented before the judge — kept in vehicle and taken away in the same vehicle so one could see what state they are in after violence was done on them during the arrest and maybe after arrest too. As good as a forced disappearance.” At around 5:30pm, Mazari posted that she had no idea where “my daughter and her husband have been taken or what state they are in after the violence perpetrated on them during the arrest and possibly after arrest also”. “Our lawyers had taken water and some dry fruits for them and medicine for Imaan but were denied access. Enforced Disappearance!” she claimed. ‘Illegal and unconstitutional move’ Earlier, Mazari also shared a video message of IHCBA President Gilani, who was with Imaan at the time of the arrest. “We spoke to the authorities yesterday and other institutions, and they made a commitment that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha will not be arrested and will be given safe passage to go to the district court,” said the bar president in a video posted on X. He said that, fearing arrest, the lawyers went to IHC Chief Justice Dogar and “informed him that there was a possibility we would be stopped; however, the chief justice did not hold court today.” Gilani said Imaan and Hadi, along with their lawyers, were on their way to the sessions court when their vehicles came “under attack by police” as soon as they passed by Serena Chowk. The IHCBA president claimed that the police subjected the lawyers to violence and broke the vehicles’ windows, forcing Imaan and Hadi out of the car. He further said that male personnel grabbed Imaan and pushed her into the police vehicle. Gilani also alleged that the police officials “pushed down [IHCBA] Secretary Jajja and beat him”. He called on the lawyers of both the IHC and the sessions court to reach the Sitara Market Women’s Police Station — where he said Imaan was being held — and observe a strike. “The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani asserted. Calling it a “very major incident for Islamabad”, Gilani emphasised that lawyers “guard the country’s integrity and law”. The IHCBA, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrest of the lawyer couple. The IHCBA and Islamabad Bar Association announced a strike for Friday, while the IBC called on lawyers to observe a strike on Saturday. The IBA added that it held an emergency meeting in light of the “illegal and unconstitutional move” to arrest the duo. The body called on authorities to “immediately release” the arrested lawyers. “The Islamabad Bar Association believes that every Pakistani has the right to defend themselves in the court,” the statement read, terming the arrest a “violation of fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and law”. The IBC condemned the “highly reprehensible conduct, including misbehaviour, assault and torture, perpetrated by the police officials” against Gilani and Jajja during the incident. It considered such actions “to be a blatant misuse of authority, aimed at harassing advocates and creating an atmosphere of fear and coercion within the legal community”. The IBC demanded Imaan and Hadi’s unconditional release, a transparent and independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved, and “strict disciplinary action against all those responsible for the misbehaviour, high-handedness and use of force”. Separately, eight newly elected members of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) called on lawyers’ bodies, including the PBC and the Supreme Court Bar Association, to condemn the “malicious persecution” of Imaan and Hadi. In a joint statement, Abid Shahid Zuberi, Shafqat Mehmood Chohan, Qazi Muhammad Arshad, Munir A Khan Kakar, Salman Akram Raja, Salahuddin Ahmad, Abdus Sattar Khan and Muhammad Maqsood Buttar urged lawyers’ bodies to protest the duo’s arrest and stand in solidarity with them at all forums. “We call upon the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and all other lawyers’ bodies to perform their duty and unequivocally condemn this malicious persecution of human rights defenders and to vigorously protest and stand in solidarity with Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha before all forums,” said the single-page statement. It added: “We are absolutely clear this brave couple is being punished solely for the sins of professionally representing victims of state oppression and speaking out against ongoing human rights abuses in Pakistan in order to set an example for others.” Cases against the duo Imaan and Hadi have recently mainly defended themselves in a case that pertains to controversial social media posts. The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad. They were indicted in the case on October 30 last year. ADSJ Majoka had issued arrest warrants for the couple on January 16, a day after cancelling their interim bail following repeated non-appearances. Subsequently, Imaan and Hadi challenged their arrest orders before the IHC. The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Earlier this week, a case dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo, relating to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case. Separately, on Thursday, Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra dismissed Imaan and Hadi’s pre-arrest bail applications in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025 — the same case in which they were arrested today.

Separately, eight newly elected members of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) called on lawyers’ bodies, including the PBC and the Supreme Court Bar Association, to condemn the “malicious persecution” of Imaan and Hadi. In a joint statement, Abid Shahid Zuberi, Shafqat Mehmood Chohan, Qazi Muhammad Arshad, Munir A Khan Kakar, Salman Akram Raja, Salahuddin Ahmad, Abdus Sattar Khan and Muhammad Maqsood Buttar urged lawyers’ bodies to protest the duo’s arrest and stand in solidarity with them at all forums. “We call upon the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and all other lawyers’ bodies to perform their duty and unequivocally condemn this malicious persecution of human rights defenders and to vigorously protest and stand in solidarity with Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha before all forums,” said the single-page statement. It added: “We are absolutely clear this brave couple is being punished solely for the sins of professionally representing victims of state oppression and speaking out against ongoing human rights abuses in Pakistan in order to set an example for others.” Cases against the duo Imaan and Hadi have recently mainly defended themselves in a case that pertains to controversial social media posts. The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad. They were indicted in the case on October 30 last year. ADSJ Majoka had issued arrest warrants for the couple on January 16, a day after cancelling their interim bail following repeated non-appearances. Subsequently, Imaan and Hadi challenged their arrest orders before the IHC. The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Earlier this week, a case dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo, relating to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case. Separately, on Thursday, Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra dismissed Imaan and Hadi’s pre-arrest bail applications in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025 — the same case in which they were arrested today.

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Hours after the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha on Friday, the couple was sent to jail on judicial remand by an anti-terrorism court. The development came in a case registered against the two for protesting outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and allegedly manhandling the IHC Bar Association (IHCBA) president. Strict security was enforced during the proceedings and lawyers and media persons were not allowed to enter the courtroom. The case was heard by ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Muhammad Zulqarnain. It should be mentioned that prior to Imaan and Hadi’s arrest on Friday morning, the two had spent three nights at the office of IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani. Their arrest subsequently prompted lawyers’ bodies to announce a complete strike, strongly condemning the action. Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court on Friday in the controversial social media posts case, in which Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Afzal Majoka had cancelled their bail on January 15 and issued their arrest warrants on January 16. According to IHCBA officials, Imaan and Hadi, along with the bar association’s president, had gone to surrender before IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfaraz Dogar today. However, they were informed by court staff that the chief justice was not present. They then returned to the bar association and later left for the district courts in an IHCBA vehicle, the officials said. As the convoy left the IHC premises, police vehicles already deployed outside the building for the past three days began following them. Near the underpass located in front of Serena Hotel, police intercepted the vehicle, arrested the couple and shifted them to an undisclosed location. Outside the Women Police Station, IHCBA President Gilani said that a new first information report (FIR) had been registered three days earlier against the two lawyers. He said that while the IHC had granted relief in one case, other matters were pending before Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, where the accused were required to appear. Meanwhile, IHCBA members alleged that despite assurances from the administration that the lawyers would not be arrested, police intercepted them and used force during the arrest. They claimed that police personnel assaulted the lawyers, forcibly opened vehicle doors, and manhandled Imaan during her arrest. The IHCBA expressed concern for her safety and alleged misconduct by law enforcement officials. IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said he was assured that the couple would not be arrested until they surrendered before the trial court. He resigned in protest over the arrest. Talking to Dawn , Jajja said that he has submitted his resignation to the Islamabad Bar Council. He said that the quarters concerned assured them of giving the couple a safe passage to face the trial. “Following the arrest, I have decided to quit from the office,” he said. Meanwhile, Additional District and Sessions Judge Majoka adjourned the hearing of the controversial social media posts case against the couple due to their absence. The court observed that the right to cross-examination could be closed if the accused failed to appear. Prosecutor Rana Usman informed the court that the accused were deliberately avoiding proceedings. Judge Majoka directed that cross-examination be completed by 3:30pm on Saturday, stating that sufficient time had already been granted. On Tuesday, the IHC — which Imaan and Hadi had approached for their bail in the social media posts case — had declared Judge Majoka’s arrest order against the two null and void and directed that the accused be granted four days to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. The court categorically clarified that Imaan and Hadi should not be arrested in the case. However, the court had also observed that if the accused failed to appear before the trial court, the protection granted by the IHC would stand automatically terminated. ‘Fascism at its peak’ Earlier today, former minister and Imaan’s mother, Shireen Mazari, confirmed in a series of posts on X that her daughter had been arrested by police personnel, saying that she and her husband “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations.” The former lawmaker claimed that no first information report (FIR) was shown by the police and the bar association, “sadly, could do nothing”. “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!” Mazari added in a post on X. Mazari also shared videos showing police vehicles trailing the lawyers’ car, with officers stopping the vehicle and opening its doors. In a separate post, Mazari claimed the police “used violence on the bar leaders, [including] breaking the windows of the car, etc”. “All [because] the Twitter case had been exposed and more embarrassment would have followed in further [cross-examination] today,” the former minister said. “Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari alleged in another post. In a post at around 4:15pm, Mazari shared today’s court order and said: “So Imaan and Hadi were covertly presented in ATC just now, but lawyers were not allowed in and no one has been allowed to see this FIR, although the judge has ordered it be given to their lawyers. But they are being denied. Also no idea to which jail they will be taken.” In a subsequent post , she alleged: “Just learnt they were never even presented before the judge — kept in vehicle and taken away in the same vehicle so one could see what state they are in after violence was done on them during the arrest and maybe after arrest too. As good as a forced disappearance.” At around 5:30pm, Mazari posted that she had no idea where “my daughter and her husband have been taken or what state they are in after the violence perpetrated on them during the arrest and possibly after arrest also”. “Our lawyers had taken water and some dry fruits for them and medicine for Imaan but were denied access. Enforced Disappearance!” she claimed. ‘Illegal and unconstitutional move’ Earlier, Mazari also shared a video message of IHCBA President Gilani, who was with Imaan at the time of the arrest. “We spoke to the authorities yesterday and other institutions, and they made a commitment that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha will not be arrested and will be given safe passage to go to the district court,” said the bar president in a video posted on X. He said that, fearing arrest, the lawyers went to IHC Chief Justice Dogar and “informed him that there was a possibility we would be stopped; however, the chief justice did not hold court today.” Gilani said Imaan and Hadi, along with their lawyers, were on their way to the sessions court when their vehicles came “under attack by police” as soon as they passed by Serena Chowk. The IHCBA president claimed that the police subjected the lawyers to violence and broke the vehicles’ windows, forcing Imaan and Hadi out of the car. He further said that male personnel grabbed Imaan and pushed her into the police vehicle. Gilani also alleged that the police officials “pushed down [IHCBA] Secretary Jajja and beat him”. He called on the lawyers of both the IHC and the sessions court to reach the Sitara Market Women’s Police Station — where he said Imaan was being held — and observe a strike. “The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani asserted. Calling it a “very major incident for Islamabad”, Gilani emphasised that lawyers “guard the country’s integrity and law”. The IHCBA, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrest of the lawyer couple. The IHCBA and Islamabad Bar Association announced a strike for Friday, while the IBC called on lawyers to observe a strike on Saturday. The IBA added that it held an emergency meeting in light of the “illegal and unconstitutional move” to arrest the duo. The body called on authorities to “immediately release” the arrested lawyers. “The Islamabad Bar Association believes that every Pakistani has the right to defend themselves in the court,” the statement read, terming the arrest a “violation of fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and law”. The IBC condemned the “highly reprehensible conduct, including misbehaviour, assault and torture, perpetrated by the police officials” against Gilani and Jajja during the incident. It considered such actions “to be a blatant misuse of authority, aimed at harassing advocates and creating an atmosphere of fear and coercion within the legal community”. The IBC demanded Imaan and Hadi’s unconditional release, a transparent and independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved, and “strict disciplinary action against all those responsible for the misbehaviour, high-handedness and use of force”. Separately, eight newly elected members of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) called on lawyers’ bodies, including the PBC and the Supreme Court Bar Association, to condemn the “malicious persecution” of Imaan and Hadi.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Barbs flew in the Senate on Friday with the opposition taking the government to task over its policies and demanding a parliamentary probe into “institutional overreach” and “election fraud”. In response, the government accused the opposition of committing “economic terrorism” while also chiding it for the Results Transmission System (RTS) fiasco in the 2018 general polls. Speaking on a calling-attention notice, PTI’s Ali Zafar, the party’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, said Parliament had been made irrelevant and meaningless. His speech was interrupted several times by the members of the treasury benches, who loudly objected to his remarks. “Matters pertaining to the country’s economy, security and foreign policy are not brought before Parliament; [instead] decisions are taken in drawing rooms,” he said, regretting that even agreements linked to the country’s future were signed while keeping Parliament in the dark. “This is a betrayal of the constitutional concept of civilian supremacy,” he asserted. Noting that all the lawmakers were under oath to protect the Constitution, he called for regaining lost civilian space. “Will this Senate remain a rubber stamp or will it rise to face the storm? Let us ensure that the law is not merely the law of the powerful but the law of the land,” he remarked. Zafar said that a full-blown constitutional crisis had occurred after the February 8, 2024 general election. He said that despite the country’s people giving a clear decision on election day, an “attack” was carried out on democracy. “The people’s mandate was not only ignored but was systematically destroyed through violence and manipulation,” he said, adding that this struck at the heart of democracy itself. “This is against the very principle articulated by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah when he addressed the first Constituent Assembly on August 11, 1947 and said, ‘The authority of the government is conditional upon the will and consent of the people’,” he said. “The same was also stated by our first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, who said, ‘The greatest pillar of democracy is the free will of the people. The will is the foundation of the Constitution’.” Zafar went on to say that he was not raising the complaint as the representative of a particular political party. “This is the bell [signalling] national danger,” he said. Zafar stressed that when the mandate of the people was crushed, the government that would be “installed” would lack both legal power and moral authority. “Such a government cannot take hard decisions, cannot unite the nation, and can not lead the country through a crisis,” he remarked. He termed the incumbent government a “house built on sand”, saying it was bound to collapse. The PTI parliamentary leader also raised alarm over what he called the “economic slaughter” of the people of Pakistan. “Inflation is not a mere statistic or economic indicator. It is a sword hanging over the head of every citizen,” he said. The PTI leader further said that public debt was not just increasing, it was also ensuring that future generations would wear the “shackles of slavery”. “This government survives only on debt … they are not here to distribute progress, they are here to distribute misery,” he said, pointing out that public debt had risen to Rs80 trillion. “What is their plan? Is the plan only to tax those who are already burdened with taxes? … What is the vision for increasing exports? What arrangements have been made to create jobs for our youth? Where is the strategy to harness our immense potential in information technology? Where is the support for small and medium enterprises, the backbone of our economy?” he asked. “This government doesn’t have a policy or governance … only drift, confusion, and the dark clouds of an approaching storm,” he said. Expressing concern over the ongoing brain drain, he said, the best minds in the country were leaving because they saw no hope, no justice, and no future. He also said industries were relocating, production was decreasing and investment was fleeing the country. In his speech, Zafar also said that the country’s laws were being weaponised. “Cases are not being filed, they are being manufactured. A court case has become a punishment itself. This is political victimisation which is destroying the last remnants of public trust in the state,” he asserted. Zafar said the consequences of this were visible in the country’s foreign policy. “We have abandoned our principled stance on Kashmir,” he said, pointing out that Pakistan did not have a clear position on Venezuela or Iran. He said that a new world order was emerging and in the face of this new reality, every nation needed to defend its sovereignty and its “strategic autonomy”. “Every step we take, we have to think it through. The government will be required Parliament’s guidance at every step; you cannot go forward without Parliament’s guidance,” he said. However, at the same time, it was important for the government to have the public’s trust. “Without the public’s trust, you cannot take any step. And this you can only get when Imran Khan comes because the nation stands with him,” he said. Zafar continued that the PTI was not just the opposition but rather an “alternative government”, and had the plans to steer the country out of the economic quagmire. He demanded that a special parliamentary committee be constituted to investigate the serious allegations of election fraud and “institutional overreach”. He also said the House should pass a resolution rejecting the government’s policies that crush the country’s poor and deepen inequality. In response to Zafar’s speech, Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani sharply criticised the economic policies pursued by the PTI government between 2018 and 2022, saying repeated policy failures during that period pushed millions of Pakistanis below the poverty line and brought the country to the brink of default. He said the past PTI-government changed four finance ministers, noting that while an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme was initially rejected, it was later accepted on weak terms and eventually sabotaged for political reasons. Kayani alleged that when the PTI- led government realised it was losing power, it deliberately undermined the IMF agreement despite being aware that such actions could push the country towards default. The minister said the present government, after assuming office, took difficult but necessary decisions to revive the IMF programme, rebuild trust with international partners and avert sovereign default. Despite resistance and repeated attempts to derail the process, he said, the government succeeded in stabilising the economy. He said former ministers belonging to the PTI resorted to “economic terrorism” by writing letters to the IMF to derail the programme. The minister said that the government was committed to ensuring sustainable economic growth, expanding employment opportunities and putting Pakistan on a stable and resilient economic path. Kayani claimed that the government had successfully steered the country away from default, restored economic stability and was now focused on achieving sustainable growth and creating jobs. Kayani also said the PTI should apologise to the nation for their repeated attempts to push Pakistan towards default and trying to derail the IMF programme.",

Kayani claimed that the government had successfully steered the country away from default, restored economic stability and was now focused on achieving sustainable growth and creating jobs. Kayani also said the PTI should apologise to the nation for their repeated attempts to push Pakistan towards default and trying to derail the IMF programme.",
