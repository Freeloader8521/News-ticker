Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti condemned the incident in a statement and ordered the immediate arrest of the suspects. “All resources will be used to provide justice to the affected family,” the CM said, according to a statement issued by his office. According to the statement, the CM had sought a report from police regarding the incident. Dawn.com has reached out to the police for further details. Meanwhile, the NP also strongly condemned the incident in a statement, adding that the party would observe three days of mourning. It added that at the time of the incident, Waleed was celebrating his wedding. It said that the incident was not only “the murder of an ordinary citizen but also the murder of a person belonging to a dignified and political family who has always believed in peace, non-violence, patience and tolerance and political values ​​and traditions”. “The government has completely failed to protect the lives and property of citizens, and such incidents clearly indicate this failure,” the statement added, further calling the murder “a deep shock for the […] people and political classes of entire Balochistan”. “Such violent incidents are conspiracies of anti-peace elements who are enemies of peace, development and political stability in Balochistan,” the NP said. PPP leader Haji Ali Madad Jattak and adviser to the CM Dr Rubaba Khan Buledi also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and alarming incident” that threatened the peace of the entire province. Today’s incident comes around two months after another brother of Rehmat Saleh Baloch was injured in an attack at the Quetta-Karachi National Highway near Mastung. He was travelling along with the Panjgur deputy commissioner, who was killed in the attack.",

      "summary_orig": "Law enforcers foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Sunday, police said. Police said in a statement that terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)  — tried to attack the Baka Khel police station from a distance. However, it added, police personnel opened fire on them after detecting their movement using the “latest technology”. As a result, the statement said, the terrorists couldn’t come near the police station and fled. According to police, “residents from nearby areas also fired at the attackers” and helped law enforcers. The statement did not mention any loss of lives or property in the incident, which was earlier confirmed by Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan. He told Dawn.com that the attackers had used a hand grenade to target the police station. “Unidentified attackers threw a hand grenade toward the police station, but it fell at a distance, causing no damage,” he said. The RPO added that the attackers fled after the attempt and a search operation to hunt them was under way. Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel. On Friday night, police intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station. On Saturday, unkn­own assailants launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan’s According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the FC personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi briefed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the law and order situation in the country as the two met on Sunday, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said. The statement added that PM Shehbaz was also briefed on the development projects under way in Islamabad. Today’s meeting between the premier and the interior minister comes a week after they had met ahead of a police operation to dismantle the protest camp of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in Muridke. The TLP planned to march on Islamabad and hold a demonstration outside the US embassy there in “solidarity with Gaza”. Naqvi had briefed PM Shehbaz on the overall law and order situation across the country during last week’s meeting as well and had told him that measures were being undertaken by the Ministry of Interior to strengthen internal security. For his part, the premier had appreciated the efforts of the interior minister and his team, directing that coordinated and effective actions must continue to ensure the protection of citizens’ lives and property. Reaffirming his government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz had said that safeguarding the lives and property of the people, upholding the rule of law and eradicating terrorism remained the government’s top priorities. Following the operation in Muridke, which resulted in deaths and led to arrests of the protesters, the Punjab government has taken stringent measures regarding law and order. Meanwhile, Section 144 also remains imposed in the province —  a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period. Punjab Police on high alert at Christian services Earlier today, Punjab police said it remained on high alert and performed security duties at churches across the province during Christian worship and prayer services. On the orders of Punjab Inspector General of Police (IG) Dr Usman Anwar, regional and district police officers were instructed to enhance the security at churches, a police statement said. “He (Punjab IG) said that supervisory officers should personally inspect the security arrangements of churches and other important places,” the statement read. “Additional police personnel and snipers should be deployed at sensitive churches, while Dolphin Squad, PRU (Police Response Unit) and Elite Force teams should ensure effective patrolling around churches.” According to the statement, all deployed police officers and personnel were instructed to remain vigilant and closely monitor any “suspicious or miscreant elements”. It added that search and sweep operations around churches, Christian communities and sensitive locations should continue. “Dr Usman Anwar said that religious scholars, the Christian community, and members of peace committees should play their active role in promoting interfaith harmony,” the statement read. “He further added that [the] Punjab Police has established Mesaaq Centres for addressing the issues of the Christian community and all other minorities so that their problems can be resolved on a priority basis.”",

For his part, the premier had appreciated the efforts of the interior minister and his team, directing that coordinated and effective actions must continue to ensure the protection of citizens’ lives and property. Reaffirming his government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz had said that safeguarding the lives and property of the people, upholding the rule of law and eradicating terrorism remained the government’s top priorities. Following the operation in Muridke, which resulted in deaths and led to arrests of the protesters, the Punjab government has taken stringent measures regarding law and order. Meanwhile, Section 144 also remains imposed in the province —  a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period. Punjab Police on high alert at Christian services Earlier today, Punjab police said it remained on high alert and performed security duties at churches across the province during Christian worship and prayer services. On the orders of Punjab Inspector General of Police (IG) Dr Usman Anwar, regional and district police officers were instructed to enhance the security at churches, a police statement said. “He (Punjab IG) said that supervisory officers should personally inspect the security arrangements of churches and other important places,” the statement read. “Additional police personnel and snipers should be deployed at sensitive churches, while Dolphin Squad, PRU (Police Response Unit) and Elite Force teams should ensure effective patrolling around churches.” According to the statement, all deployed police officers and personnel were instructed to remain vigilant and closely monitor any “suspicious or miscreant elements”. It added that search and sweep operations around churches, Christian communities and sensitive locations should continue. “Dr Usman Anwar said that religious scholars, the Christian community, and members of peace committees should play their active role in promoting interfaith harmony,” the statement read. “He further added that [the] Punjab Police has established Mesaaq Centres for addressing the issues of the Christian community and all other minorities so that their problems can be resolved on a priority basis.”",

      "summary_orig": "Liverpool slumped to a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time in 11 years as Manchester United won 2-1 on Sunday to end their near decade-long wait for victory at Anfield. Harry Maguire’s 84th-minute header secured back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time in Ruben Amorim’s tenure as United boss. Twelve minutes from time, Cody Gakpo had cancelled out Bryan Mbeumo’s opener after just 61 seconds. Defeat leaves Liverpool four points adrift of Arsenal at the top of the table and Arne Slot still searching for answers in how to get the right blend after splashing out nearly £450 million ($604 million) on new players in the transfer market. United close to within two points of their historic rivals and up to ninth in the table to ease the pressure on Amorim after his biggest win in nearly a year in charge. Liverpool had only lost one of the previous 14 Premier League meetings between the sides and United had not tasted victory at Anfield since the early days of Jurgen Klopp’s reign in January 2016. However, the Reds are in a state of flux after transforming the squad that stormed to the title last season and the tragic loss of Diogo Jota, who died in a car accident in July. After three consecutive defeats for the first time in Slot’s reign, Liverpool could barely have imagined a worse start. Mbeumo sped past Virgil van Dijk with ease before firing past Giorgi Mamardashvili from Amad Diallo’s pass after barely a minute. The home side and support were furious that play was not stopped in the build-up after Alexis MacAllister went down with a head injury, inflicted by his own captain Van Dijk. Slot left £100 million signing Florian Wirtz on the bench for the second consecutive game as he looked in vain to find the right balance between defence and attack. Gakpo should have levelled for the defending champions when he hit the post from Mohamed Salah’s through ball in Liverpool’s one flowing move of the first half. However, it was United who should have been further in front by half-time. Bruno Fernandes spurned a glorious chance to double the Red Devils’ lead when he hit the outside of the post when unmarked from the edge of the area. At the other end, Senne Lammens was rarely troubled in the first 45 minutes, but produced a big save when called upon to deny Alexander Isak his first Premier League goal since joining Liverpool for a British transfer record £125 million. A Gakpo deflected cross then came back off the post and the Dutchman rattled the woodwork for a third time early in the second half. Slot turned to his near £200 million in forward options off the bench as Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike were introduced on the hour mark to join Salah, Gakpo and Isak in a five-man attack. Salah has scored more goals than any other player in this fixture, but his lack of form showed in a wild finish to slice wide with just Lammens to beat at the back post. Liverpool’s wealth of attacking talent finally broke the door down when Federico Chiesa, who had replaced Isak moments earlier, drilled in a low cross that Gakpo converted from point blank range. Yet, their defensive frailties meant parity only lasted six minutes as Maguire was left unmarked to head in Fernandes’s looping cross. Gakpo should still have rescued a point when he headed wide with the goal gaping from Jeremie Frimpong’s inviting delivery. But Liverpool fell to their first league defeat at Anfield in over a year in another blow to their hopes of usurping United with a record 21st English top-flight title.",

When a ceasefire was announced last week, Baba thought he could finally relax. Though his home was still plagued by chaos, at least he knew his family would not be struck by an Israeli bomb. The fleeting peace, however, was shattered on Sunday morning by a wave of Israeli airstrikes across Gaza , after Israel claimed Hamas militants targeted its troops in southern Gaza.

      "summary_orig": "The newly elected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has called for a grand peace jirgah on October 25, in the province’s Khyber district, in a bid to discuss avenues for “establishment of peace” in the province. In a statement on X, Afridi said, “For the establishment of peace, a grand peace jirga of tribal elders, leaders, and youth — transcending  political affiliations — will be held on Saturday, October 25, 2025, in Khyber District, Bara Tehsil.” Stressing the need for prioritising the will of KP’s people in deciding the matters of the province, he said, “The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will themselves decide their lives and their future.” “No one will be allowed to impose decisions made in closed rooms on the people,” he said, vowing that the KP government “will stand with Imran Khan’s ideology and the interests of the people.” The development comes as the province witnesses a rise in terrorist attacks, which escalated after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel. In July, Security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‘ Operation Sarbakaf ’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund in KP, which was then opposed by the provincial government of KP. In July, a jirga was organised by the Awami National Party (ANP) at its headquarters in the provincial capital rejected any new military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, demanded an end to terrorism and restoration of peace across the province thro­ugh a political leadership-driven jirga. In August, former KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced a series of jirgas to oppose the military operation in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre. The recommendations by the Jirga were to ensure unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”",

      "summary": "The newly elected Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has called for a grand peace jirgah on October 25, in the province’s Khyber district, in a bid to discuss avenues for “establishment of peace” in the province. In a statement on X, Afridi said, “For the establishment of peace, a grand peace jirga of tribal elders, leaders, and youth — transcending  political affiliations — will be held on Saturday, October 25, 2025, in Khyber District, Bara Tehsil.” Stressing the need for prioritising the will of KP’s people in deciding the matters of the province, he said, “The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will themselves decide their lives and their future.” “No one will be allowed to impose decisions made in closed rooms on the people,” he said, vowing that the KP government “will stand with Imran Khan’s ideology and the interests of the people.” The development comes as the province witnesses a rise in terrorist attacks, which escalated after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel. In July, Security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‘ Operation Sarbakaf ’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund in KP, which was then opposed by the provincial government of KP. In July, a jirga was organised by the Awami National Party (ANP) at its headquarters in the provincial capital rejected any new military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, demanded an end to terrorism and restoration of peace across the province thro­ugh a political leadership-driven jirga. In August, former KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced a series of jirgas to oppose the military operation in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre. The recommendations by the Jirga were to ensure unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”",

Although the border crossings at Chaman and other entry points have closed for the past six days, Pakistan partially reopened the border in the Red Zone area to facilitate the repatriation of undocumented Afghan refugees. “Under tight security, several hundred Afghan refugee families, including women and children, along with their belongings crossed into the Afghanistan over the past three days, a senior official said. The border was opened for three days, while it remained closed for the other three due to intense fighting at four locations in the Chaman sector,” he added. Following the ceasefire , no firing or attack was reported from either side. “Forces equipped with heavy weapons remain on high alert to respond to any situation,” the official said. The Friendship Gate at the Pak-Afghan border remains intact on the Pakistani side, while the Afghan Taliban damaged the gate on their side. The Inspector General of Fron­t­ier Corps (North) Balochistan re­­c­e­ntly visited the Chaman border, where he was briefed by senior Frontier Corps commanders on the situation following the armed cla­shes. He also visited Pakistani border posts and the Friendship Gate. The border, however, remains completely closed for all other purposes — including Afghan transit trade, imports, exports, and cross-border business — for the past six days. Hundreds of loaded trucks and trailers carrying Afghan transit goods, fresh fruits, vegetables, and other commodities have been stranded on both sides of the border. “Around 140 trucks loaded with grapes and pomegranates are waiting in the Vesh Mandi area of Afghanistan to transport consignments to Quetta and other Pakistani cities,” officials said. Similarly, over 500 loaded trucks carrying Afghan transit goods and import-export items have been stranded on the Pakistani side of the border in Chaman since the clashes began. The business community engaged in cross-border trade has reported heavy financial losses, as perishable goods — particularly fruits and vegetables — are spoiling due to the prolonged closure. Traders’ organisations, including the Chaman Chamber of Commerce and Industry, have expressed serious concern over the situation and urged authorities to reopen the border to prevent further economic losses.

The meeting, held in a cordial atmosphere, continued well into the night behind closed doors in Doha. Participants of the Doha dialogue reportedly kept shifting their stance on the continuation of talks. Initially, both sides considered adjourning the negotiations for a week, but later agreed to reconvene on Sunday. However, the latest word from sources familiar with the closely guarded proceedings suggested that the discussions, held in deep secrecy, continued late into the night, with a joint communique expected to be issued. The talks were opened by a senior Qatari intelligence official before the Pakistani and Afghan delegations began direct discussions on outstanding issues. The Pakistani side was led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, accompanied by National Security Adviser and ISI Chief Lt Gen Asim Malik. The Afghan side was represented by Acting Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob Mujahid and Inte­lligence Chief Maulvi Abdul Haq Wasiq. According to diplomatic sources, Pakistan pressed that the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Afghan soil was “not acceptable” and urged verifiable action against the group. The Taliban delegation, while signalling willingness to cooperate, reportedly asked Pakistan to provide verified details of TTP hideouts and promised to address the concerns “to Pakistan’s satisfaction”. However, Taliban representatives also cautioned that it was “unrealistic” to expect Kabul to entirely stop TTP operations inside Pakistan. Afghan negotiators further complained that Pakistan’s public narrative had negatively impacted the Taliban’s international recognition prospects and alleged that militants of the Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K) captured in Afghanistan had claimed to have received training in Pakistan. Taliban negotiators, during the course of the meeting, kept consulting their leadership in Afghanistan, according to a source. In a statement issued earlier in the day, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the high-level delegation would “urge the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities”, including the Fitna Al-Khawarij (TTP) and Fitna Al-Hindustan (Balochistan Liberation Army). Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have been high for the past two years over what Islamabad calls Kabul’s failure to curb cross-border terrorism. The situation escalated sharply on Oct 9 when Pakistan launched airstrikes on TTP sanctuaries inside Afghanistan, and reportedly sent fighter jets over Kabul after which explosions were heard. The Taliban then launched attacks on Pakistani border posts on Oct 11 in which at least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred. Pakistan’s counter-response left about 200 Taliban fighters dead, according to security officials. The two sides afterwards agreed on a 48-hour ceasefire and to hold dialogue during that break. The ceasefire was later extended. Friday night’s cross-border exchange, in which Pakistani forces targeted Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group positions across the border, briefly threatened to derail the Doha dialogue. However, both sides decided to proceed with the talks as planned. The Afghan government spokesperson claimed that Pakistan had conducted airstrikes in Afghanistan hours after the ceasefire was extended on Friday for as long as the talks continued. He claimed that the attacks targeted civilians. Afghanistan withdrew from the Twenty20 international tri-series in Pakistan next month following the alleged death of three local cricketers that the Afghanistan Cricket Board claimed were due to military strikes in Paktika. Govt rebukes ICC However, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that Pakistan has targeted verified camps of the “Khawarij-affiliated” Gul Bahadur group in the border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border. In a post on X, the minister stated that during a 48-hour ceasefire, militants affiliated with the group and operating from Afghanistan attempted multiple terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. He said all such attempts were effectively thwarted by the security forces. “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan, he said. In a later post, the minister said that Pakistan rejected the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) “selective, biased and premature comment that advances a disputed allegation, as established, that three ‘Afghan cricketers’ died in an ‘airstrike’. The ICC has cited no independent verification to substantiate these claims.” “Pakistan strongly rejects the characterisation and contests the ICC’s claim and call for immediate correction,” he added. “Pakistan has consistently held that politics must not contaminate the sport, especially cricket, and urges the ICC to uphold its independence and the spirit of the game… Pakistan expects the ICC, led by its current Chair (Jay Shah), who happens to belong to India, to restore its neutrality, international standards of fair play and unbiased conduct.” Amid the ongoing discussions, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim spoke separately with both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Afghan Prime Minister Muhammad Hasan Akhund, offering Malaysia’s assistance in mediating the conflict.

      "summary_orig": "• Says Palestinians want dignity, calls northern Gaza a ‘wasteland’ • Relief stalled as Israel insists Rafah crossing to stay shut until Hamas returns remains of all prisoners • Nine members of a family killed when Israeli forces fired at bus JERUSALEM: The United Nations aid chief on Saturday took stock of the monumental task of restoring dignity and hygiene for Palestinians struggling to survive amid Gaza’s devastation, as he witnessed residents digging latrines among the ruins, while Israel and Hamas exchanged more bodies. A convoy of white UN jeeps carried relief coordinator Tom Fletcher and his team through the twisted rubble of shattered homes to see a wastewater treatment plant in Sheikh Radwan, north of Gaza City. “I drove through here seven to eight months ago when most of these buildings were still standing and, to see the devastation — this is a vast part of the city, just a wasteland — and it’s absolutely devastating to see,” he told AFP . The densely populated cities of the Gaza Strip, home to more than two million Palestinians, have largely been reduced to ruins by two years of bombardment and intense fighting between Hamas and the Israeli army. Digging latrines Surveying the damaged pumping equ­i­pment and a grim lake of sewage at the Sheikh Radwan wastewater plant, Fle­t­cher said the task ahead for the UN and aid agencies was a “massive, massive job”. The British diplomat said he had met residents returning to destroyed homes trying to dig latrines in the ruins. “They’re telling me most of all they want dignity,” he said. “We’ve got to get the power back on so we can start to get the sanitation system back in place. Fletcher outlined an ambitious relief plan. “We have a massive 60-day plan now to surge in food, get a million meals out there a day, start to rebuild the health sector, bring in tents for the winter, get hundreds of thousands of kids back into school.” Bodies exchange and Rafah crossing Meanwhile, Hamas has returned the final 20 surviving prisoners it was holding and has begun to hand over the remains of another 28 who died. On Saturday, in line with the terms of the ceasefire deal, Israel returned the bodies of 15 more Palestinians to Gaza, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said. As aid trickles in, the situation surrounding the Rafah border crossing remains disputed . On Saturday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the crossing would remain closed until Hamas hands over the bodies of all deceased prisoners still held in Gaza. This contradicted an earlier announcement by the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo that the crossing would reopen on Monday. Israeli authorities, who had multiple times over the past few days delayed the border’s opening, said that when the crossing does reopen, it will permit only the movement of people, not aid. The Gaza health ministry said that some of the bodies returned on Saturday bore signs of “abuse, beatings, handcuffing and blindfolding”. Nine family members killed Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed nine members of a single Palestinian family when they shelled a bus on Friday, after the military confirmed it had targeted a vehicle that crossed the so-called “yellow line”. “Our teams recovered the bodies of nine martyrs, including four children and two women, after Israeli occupation forces directly targeted the vehicle they were travelling in,” Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for the Gaza Civil Defence agency, said in a statement to AFP on Saturday. Bassal said Israeli forces fired “two tank shells at the vehicle,” and noted that the bodies of two children remained missing, as their “remains were scattered due to the intensity of the bombardment”. He said recovering the rem­­­­­ains has been particularly challenging because of the “difficult field and environmental conditions” in the area. Published in Dawn, October 19th, 2025",

A convoy of white UN jeeps carried relief coordinator Tom Fletcher and his team through the twisted rubble of shattered homes to see a wastewater treatment plant in Sheikh Radwan, north of Gaza City. “I drove through here seven to eight months ago when most of these buildings were still standing and, to see the devastation — this is a vast part of the city, just a wasteland — and it’s absolutely devastating to see,” he told AFP . The densely populated cities of the Gaza Strip, home to more than two million Palestinians, have largely been reduced to ruins by two years of bombardment and intense fighting between Hamas and the Israeli army. Digging latrines Surveying the damaged pumping equ­i­pment and a grim lake of sewage at the Sheikh Radwan wastewater plant, Fle­t­cher said the task ahead for the UN and aid agencies was a “massive, massive job”.
