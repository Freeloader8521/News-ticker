      "summary_orig": "The search for two missing workers entered its fifth day Monday after a boiler tower collapsed at a thermal power plant in the southeastern city of Ulsan. A total of seven workers were initially trapped at the plant of the Ulsan branch of Korea East-West Power, a state-run utility company, on Thursday. Three bodies have been recovered, while four people are still trapped, including two who are presumed dead. Firefighting authorities said drones were sent inside the debris overnight to aid in the search but failed to locate the missing.

Once the two towers are demolished, sometime early this week, officials plan to use heavy equipment to lift the debris from the collapse, speeding up the search for the missing.

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s ousted premier, Sheikh Hasina’s written interviews flaunt an utter lack of contrition. There is not a hint of remorse, not a sliver of guilt. The interviews published by Indian outlets last week — The Hindustan Times , New Indian Express and The Hindu — or the ones by Reuters , AFP and the UK’s Independent (published on October 29) show that former prime minister, in exile in India since August 5, 2024, remains thoroughly unencumbered by even a touch of introspection or self-doubt. Going a step further, The Week , also based in India, published a column by Hasina where she deplores the ineptitude of the very institutions her regime had meticulously destroyed. She flails against the interim government for not having the people’s mandate, which she had manufactured to stay in power for years through rigged elections. She berates the BNP for trying to manipulate the caretaker government system, which her regime had abolished. Her deluded sense of being wronged pervades the entire article. The closest Hasina comes to acknowledging some error of her administration in the article is one that she had already mentioned in her written interviews. She writes, “I mourn the life of every Bangladeshi that has been needlessly lost since the protests in the summer of 2024. While the vast majority of law-enforcement officers acted within their guidelines, mistakes were very clearly made in the way some members of the security forces responded to the rapid upsurge of violence.” Hasina goes on to write that it was a very fluid and “febrile situation”, and clearly there were “breakdowns of discipline within the chain of command”. She then states, “However, the Awami League categorically rejects the allegations that we were directly responsible for, or commanded the use of, lethal force against our own citizens. To characterise what happened as a plot by a democratically elected government to commit violence against its own people is entirely wrong. Indeed, I personally took steps to ensure that no firearms were used.” Throughout all her interviews Hasina maintains that the evidence against her, audio clips of phone calls, were either doctored or taken out of context. She also rejects the UN human rights office estimate that 1,400 people were killed during the July uprising as “inflated”. She told in her interview with The Hindustan Times rejecting her role in the crackdown , “But to suggest that I was directing minute-by-minute tactical responses from the prime minister’s office is to fundamentally misunderstand how security forces work. I repeat, at no point did I authorise security forces to fire on crowds.” The Daily Star ’s own investigation found Hasina to have personally authorised the use of lethal weapons. This newspaper had reported on a phone recording from July 18, 2024 where Hasina tells her nephew, former Dhaka South Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, “I have given instructions, now I have given direct instructions; now they will use lethal weapons. Wherever they find them [protesters], they will shoot directly.” The 78-year-old former leader took the opportunity to express her gratitude to India for offering refuge. “I am deeply grateful to the Indian people for providing me with a safe haven,” she said. “The connections between our two countries are broad and deep. We pride ourselves on being India’s reliable partner.” While her interviews with the international agencies and the UK newspaper appeared to be somewhat balanced, the ones carried by the Indian outlets are far more incendiary. Sheikh Hasina’s lack of self-reproach aside, the latest round of interviews shirks from providing any context that explain Hasina’s hasty departure. There is little that sheds light on the weeks of untold violence preceding her flight. There is hardly any mention of Hasina’s 17 years of misrule when Bangladesh descended into an autocracy. Her interviews and the writeup attempts to portray the Yunus-led government as a usurper without any acknowledgement of how the Awami League regime had fuelled discontent among the protesters as well as the general populace. The underlying message has been the next election will not be inclusive without the Awami League, whose activities are currently banned, taking part. The publication of these interviews and column could not have happened without the knowledge or consent of Hasina’s host country. Together with the former premier’s write-up, this move can only be seen as an attempt to somehow influence the ensuing election. Hasina is still seen as the one responsible for hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries during the July uprising alone. She would do well to remember that such interviews will not even begin to restore Awami League’s image. Her hosts would do well to remember that under the current circumstances they should refrain from activities that will further their distance from the people of Bangladesh.

I repeat, at no point did I authorise security forces to fire on crowds.” The Daily Star ’s own investigation found Hasina to have personally authorised the use of lethal weapons. This newspaper had reported on a phone recording from July 18, 2024 where Hasina tells her nephew, former Dhaka South Mayor Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, “I have given instructions, now I have given direct instructions; now they will use lethal weapons. Wherever they find them [protesters], they will shoot directly.” The 78-year-old former leader took the opportunity to express her gratitude to India for offering refuge. “I am deeply grateful to the Indian people for providing me with a safe haven,” she said. “The connections between our two countries are broad and deep. We pride ourselves on being India’s reliable partner.” While her interviews with the international agencies and the UK newspaper appeared to be somewhat balanced, the ones carried by the Indian outlets are far more incendiary. Sheikh Hasina’s lack of self-reproach aside, the latest round of interviews shirks from providing any context that explain Hasina’s hasty departure. There is little that sheds light on the weeks of untold violence preceding her flight. There is hardly any mention of Hasina’s 17 years of misrule when Bangladesh descended into an autocracy. Her interviews and the writeup attempts to portray the Yunus-led government as a usurper without any acknowledgement of how the Awami League regime had fuelled discontent among the protesters as well as the general populace. The underlying message has been the next election will not be inclusive without the Awami League, whose activities are currently banned, taking part. The publication of these interviews and column could not have happened without the knowledge or consent of Hasina’s host country. Together with the former premier’s write-up, this move can only be seen as an attempt to somehow influence the ensuing election. Hasina is still seen as the one responsible for hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries during the July uprising alone. She would do well to remember that such interviews will not even begin to restore Awami League’s image. Her hosts would do well to remember that under the current circumstances they should refrain from activities that will further their distance from the people of Bangladesh.

      "title": "Hasina drops no hint of remorse",
      "summary": "Bangladesh’s ousted premier, Sheikh Hasina’s written interviews flaunt an utter lack of contrition. There is not a hint of remorse, not a sliver of guilt. The interviews published by Indian outlets last week — The Hindustan Times , New Indian Express and The Hindu — or the ones by Reuters , AFP and the UK’s Independent (published on October 29) show that former prime minister, in exile in India since August 5, 2024, remains thoroughly unencumbered by even a touch of introspection or self-doubt. Going a step further, The Week , also based in India, published a column by Hasina where she deplores the ineptitude of the very institutions her regime had meticulously destroyed. She flails against the interim government for not having the people’s mandate, which she had manufactured to stay in power for years through rigged elections. She berates the BNP for trying to manipulate the caretaker government system, which her regime had abolished. Her deluded sense of being wronged pervades the entire article. The closest Hasina comes to acknowledging some error of her administration in the article is one that she had already mentioned in her written interviews. She writes, “I mourn the life of every Bangladeshi that has been needlessly lost since the protests in the summer of 2024. While the vast majority of law-enforcement officers acted within their guidelines, mistakes were very clearly made in the way some members of the security forces responded to the rapid upsurge of violence.” Hasina goes on to write that it was a very fluid and “febrile situation”, and clearly there were “breakdowns of discipline within the chain of command”. She then states, “However, the Awami League categorically rejects the allegations that we were directly responsible for, or commanded the use of, lethal force against our own citizens. To characterise what happened as a plot by a democratically elected government to commit violence against its own people is entirely wrong. Indeed, I personally took steps to ensure that no firearms were used.” Throughout all her interviews Hasina maintains that the evidence against her, audio clips of phone calls, were either doctored or taken out of context. She also rejects the UN human rights office estimate that 1,400 people were killed during the July uprising as “inflated”. She told in her interview with The Hindustan Times rejecting her role in the crackdown , “But to suggest that I was directing minute-by-minute tactical responses from the prime minister’s office is to fundamentally misunderstand how security forces work.

      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN’S slide into authoritarianism has been unmistakable over the past three years or more. Now a fresh move will reinforce the trend of democratic regression. The 27th constitutional amendment tabled in parliament will alter the country’s judicial structure with significant implications for governance and democracy. Last year, when parliament adopted the 26th Constitutional Amendment , it was done in the darkness of night, without providing the final text to lawmakers before being tabled. The entire legislative process lacked transparency and was over in hours in parliament. Official coercion to secure the required two-thirds vote robbed the process of legitimacy. But the controversial amendment passed, making the judiciary subservient to the executive and undermining the rule of law. Consequently, the government won every case concerning constitutional interpretations. The proposed 27th constitutional amendment seems to follow a similar path. It was kept under wraps until PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari disclosed the government had sought his party’s support and revealed the amendment’s key elements. This set off a public furore with constitutional lawyers calling this ‘state capture of the judiciary’, opposition leaders dubbing it as a ‘power grab’ directed by the establishment and others deeming it as a ‘threat to democracy’ and ‘assault on the notion of separating justice from politics’. As presented in the Senate, the 27th Amendment consists of the following core elements. Establishment of a federal constitutional court, transfer of high court judges between courts and changes to Article 243 which concerns the control and command of the armed forces. The 27th constitutional amendment is part of the broader trend towards democratic backsliding. Establishment of a federal constitutional court was also attempted by the government in the 26th Amendment. But due to fierce opposition, constitutional benches were instead set up in the Supreme Court and high courts. That too was criticised because the composition of benches, influenced by the executive, empowered the government to choose which judges could hear constitutional cases of concern. It all but took away that jurisdiction from regular benches. Objections to a constitutional court rest on solid ground. Packed with judges chosen by the government it will set up a parallel executive-compliant court. This will denude the Supreme Court of its jurisdiction in constitutional cases and those relating to fundamental rights. Meanwhile, the proposal to transfer high court judges between courts, without their consent, will mean the executive will be able to sideline ‘independent judges’ through its influence on the judicial commission, empowered to do this. Originally the proposed amendment also included rollback of constitutional safeguards for provincial shares in state revenues determined by the National Finance Commission Award, which guarantees they are not reduced. While the fiscal logic for this was understandable as the federal government is left with limited resources to meet its expenditure, the PPP opposed this as unacceptable erosion of the 18th Amendment. This was then dropped from the amendment but with ministers indicating it might be taken up later. Modification of Article 243 of the Constitution, which gives the government control and command of the armed forces, is predicated on the argument that defence needs have changed as a result of modern warfare while the post of field marshal necessitates constitutional recognition. The amendment bestows wider constitutionally sanctioned powers and privileges to the top military leadership. The office of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (headed at different times by the army, air force and naval officers who were supposed to do so by rotation) is to be abolished. Instead, the new post of Chief of Defence Forces will be created, to be held by the army chief. The Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force and Admiral of the Fleet are all given legal immunity akin to the president’s and can only be removed by impeachment. They will remain in uniform and retain the rank for life with the same privileges and immunity. The effect of all this is to further shift the power balance to the military from the civilian system. Seen in the context of democratic erosion in recent years, the 27th amendment delivers another blow to democracy by further emasculating an independent judiciary. There have been a series of democratic reversals under the hybrid government-plus arrangement. Every indicator of democracy has shown regression. Parliament has been reduced to a rubber-stamp, freedom of assembly restricted, opposition suppressed, media controlled, independence of the judiciary compromised and the civil-military balance ske­wed to the latter’s advantage by a ruling coalition happy to act as a subservient junior ‘partner’. It can be argued that democratic backsliding is nothing new and similar to what happened in the past. Previous periods of civilian rule also saw governments take repressive measures — crackdowns on opposition, jailing of opposition leaders on trumped-up charges, marginalisation of parliament, muzzling the media and undermining judicial independence. While the present situation has echoes of the past, the nature and extent of democratic erosion makes it different. Previous civilian governments would persecute political opponents and take other autocratic measures including eroding judicial independence and controlling the media, but they would do so mostly on their own without the establishment’s direct involvement. That changed after 2018 and more so after 2022. The establishment became directly involved in efforts to ‘control’ the opposition, courts, media and digital space. This expanded its sphere of political interventions in an unprecedented way. Perhaps what ‘necessitated’ this was that the government installed after the 2024 election had little political weight as it rested on a dubious mandate. So, it needed to be shored up. Past periods of civilian democracy did not see continuous bans on political protests and public assembly as happens now. Moreover, targeting of political opponents is now accompanied by efforts at broader repression. Raids on opposition leaders’ homes and incommunicado detention of party activists are part of the present government’s inventory of repressive actions. Because there is more to control, the government has gone much further than its civilian predecessors in micromanaging the electronic media and imposing curbs on digital space. Against this backdrop the 27th constitutional amendment is part of a broader pattern of Pakistan’s slide to an undemocratic system. But as the country’s history shows, aggrandisement of power and manipulation of law neither makes a government secure nor guarantees its future. It only exposes its lack of self-confidence and absence of faith in democracy. i Published in Dawn, November 10th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "EFFORTS to find a permanent solution to differences between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime are locked in a frustrating cycle with no foreseeable solution on the horizon. The main reason for this is the Taliban’s obduracy, and lack of intention in stopping terrorist groups such as the TTP from staging cross-border attacks. The third round of talks in Istanbul wrapped up without any forward movement on Friday, with the extension of the ceasefire agreed to in Doha after hostilities last month as the only saving grace. Pakistan, indicating its seriousness, sent high-powered negotiators, including the ISI chief. But the Taliban’s refusal to budge from their stance, as in previous rounds of dialogue, resulted in no progress. As the defence minister put it, the talks are currently in an “indefinite phase”, though there are chances that further parleys are possible. The Taliban have described Pakistan’s demands as “unrealistic”. But there is nothing undoable about preventing militant groups active on Afghan soil from attacking Pakistan. The Kabul regime has vacillated between denying that any terrorist groups are active in Afghanistan, and saying that internal security is Pakistan’s own problem. While internal security is indeed Pakistan’s responsibility, Kabul has a duty to stop armed actors from crossing the border and carrying out acts of terrorism in this country. Complicating matters further is the fact that Kabul is unwilling to give written guarantees that it will prevent attacks. This recurring cycle of negotiations, followed by a breakdown in talks and the threat of renewed hostility, must end; a permanent solution needs to be found soon. Few in the international community will believe the Taliban when they claim that no TTP fighters, or militants belonging to other groups, are active on Afghan soil. Evidence proving the presence of such groups in Afghanistan is significant. The Taliban’s ideological affinity with the TTP is also no secret. If the Afghan Taliban seek international recognition, they must realise that this will elude them unless they muzzle their militant comrades, and stop them from attacking sovereign states.

The publication reported this on Thursday, citing a new directive from the Trump administration. According to the outlet, this new directive was outlined in a cable issued by the US State Department to embassy and consular officials. It “directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the US for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits”, KFF reported. “The guidance says that such people could become a ‘public charge’ — a potential drain on US resources — because of their health issues or age,” the report said. “You must consider an applicant’s health,” the cable read, according to KFF . It added: “Certain medical conditions — including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions — can require hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of care.” According to KFF , the cable also encouraged visa officers to consider conditions like obesity — which it noted could cause asthma, sleep apnea and high blood pressure —  while assessing whether an immigrant could become a public charge and should therefore be denied entry into the US. “All of these can require expensive, long-term care,” the cable read, additionally directing visa officers to determine if applicants had the means to pay for medical treatment without financial assistance from the US government. KFF reported that the instruction also directed visa officers to consider the health of the applicant’s family members, including children or older parents. Tommy Pigott, the US State Department’s principal deputy spokesperson, also said in a statement: “It’s no secret the Trump administration is putting the interests of the American people first. This includes enforcing policies that ensure our immigration system is not a burden on the American taxpayer.” Separately, the official told reporters that the decision to issue a visa had always been at the discretion of an officer. Officers are not being instructed to reject an applicant because they have a certain medical condition, but to consider the “overall impact” if someone would be unlikely to be able to pay for their own medical care, they clarified. “It’s addressed on an individual, case-by-case basis,” the official added.",

      "summary_orig": "In recent months, Pakistan has entered a renewed phase of engagement with the United States, characterised by expanding bilateral economic cooperation and commitments of investment in the country’s mining and energy sectors. Islamabad’s participation in the Gaza peace accord brokered by Washington has also strengthened political and diplomatic collaboration between the two nations. Pakistan’s renewed outreach to the US is hardly surprising given its trade dynamics. The US remains its single largest export market after Europe, where Pakistan maintains a consistent trade surplus; for a long time, it also was a major source of foreign direct investment in the country alongside the European Union and the United Kingdom until China replaced it with large investments in energy, port and transport infrastructure under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) during the last decade. Not just that, analysts say, Wash­ington’s support has traditionally been considered crucial, given Islamabad’s continued reliance on financial support from multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, controlled by the western powers, for repeated bailouts for its external sector stability. Islamabad’s new balancing act is being closely monitored in Beijing, where Pakistan’s apparent tilt towards Washington has raised questions, if not caused unease The goodwill of the country’s present military and political leadership with the current US administration of President Donald Trump has helped Islamabad secure a slightly better tariff deal compared to regional competitors, enabling Pakistan to retain and expand its export share in the world’s single largest market of consumer goods. While analysts view Pakistan’s renewed economic and diplomatic engagement with the US after more than a decade as a positive development, they also caution that it could pose a new foreign policy challenge for Islamabad given its deepening strategic alliance with China. They note that the reset in ties with Washington will be tested by Pakistan’s close relations with Beijing, which could pull the country in conflicting directions and require a careful diplomatic balancing act. Besides direct investment in infrastructure, Pakistan’s dependence on China for finished goods as well as raw and intermediary materials has increased manifold over time. Today, China stands as Pakistan’s largest trading partner and principal source of imports — excluding energy and edible oil — of around $20 billion or more. It is the country’s single largest investor and bilateral creditor, extending critical balance-of-payments support through currency swap arrangements, deposits kept with the central bank and debt rollovers. More than half of Pakistan’s bilateral external debt, nearly $24bn, is owed to China. Beijing also remains indispensable for Pakistan in technology transfer and as the primary supplier of military hardware and support. Though the country’s civil and military leadership has pledged not to “sacrifice one friend for another”, analysts argue that it is easier said than done. Some China watchers, including Dr Mahmood-ul-Hassan Khan, President of the Centre for Knowledge and Public Policy, say Islamabad’s new balancing act is being closely monitored in Beijing, where Pakistan’s apparent tilt towards Washington has raised questions, if not caused unease. Dr Khan maintains that Pakistan’s alleged offer to the US to build a new deep-sea port at Pasni, barely a hundred kilometres from the Gwadar Port developed by China under the CPEC initiative, and Islamabad’s silence on the matter have fuelled speculation in Beijing. He further points out that the expanding Pakistan-US cooperation in rare earth minerals and China’s growing concerns over the security of its workers in Pakistan have raised serious doubts about the future development of Gwadar and the next phase of CPEC. This became evident from the outcome of last month’s meeting of the CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) in Beijing, which ended without resolving key issues related to the security of Chinese personnel and payments to Chinese Independent Power Producers (IPPs), two major irritants hampering fresh Chinese investment in the country. Commitments for major projects such as the ML-1 railway upgrade also remain pending. The dispute over payments to Chinese IPPs persists, as Islamabad has sought to extend the repayment schedule. On the ML-1 project, Beijing has demanded a firm financial commitment from Pakistan before moving ahead with any agreement, particularly in light of the ongoing IMF programme. Even so, the meeting was hailed as a milestone for marking the formal start of CPEC Phase II. Yet, attracting fresh Chinese investment will remain difficult unless these long-standing concerns are addressed, Dr Khan cautions. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal’s proposal to hold JCC meetings every six months and convene Joint Working Groups quarterly during the first three years of CPEC Phase II underscores the delays and bottlenecks that continue to impede the corridor’s progress. Analysts argue that institutional strengthening, the resolution of pending issues, and enhanced security for Chinese personnel remain essential to sustain momentum and move Phase II forward. Dr Khan advises that Pakistan must take the Chinese policymakers into confidence to urgently dispel growing concerns that Islamabad is warming up to Washington at the expense of its strategic partnership with its time-tested friend. “Pakistan has to navigate its foreign policy challenges in a global geopolitical environment that is marked by growing multipolarity but weakening multilateralism and increasing US-China competition. The durability of this China-Pakistan partnership hinges on Islamabad’s ability to address these pressing concerns.” Analysts say Pak-US ties have been transactional and cyclical in nature, often fluctuating between estrangement and benign engagement. Washington has viewed Islamabad through a transactional lens, one largely shaped by its interests in the region, and has not hesitated to impose sanctions whenever those interests diverged. The most consequential factor today is America’s policy of containing China and its strategy to rally countries behind efforts to counterbalance Beijing’s growing global influence, analysts observe. “Pakistan’s relationship with China, by contrast, is strategic, historic, trouble-free and remains pivotal to the country’s foreign policy. While Islamabad may seek to strike a balance between the two powers, it cannot afford to be part of any anti-China strategy. This constraint limits the scope for expanding relations with Washington beyond a certain threshold,” concludes Dr Khan. Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, November 10th, 2025",

Dr Khan advises that Pakistan must take the Chinese policymakers into confidence to urgently dispel growing concerns that Islamabad is warming up to Washington at the expense of its strategic partnership with its time-tested friend. “Pakistan has to navigate its foreign policy challenges in a global geopolitical environment that is marked by growing multipolarity but weakening multilateralism and increasing US-China competition. The durability of this China-Pakistan partnership hinges on Islamabad’s ability to address these pressing concerns.” Analysts say Pak-US ties have been transactional and cyclical in nature, often fluctuating between estrangement and benign engagement. Washington has viewed Islamabad through a transactional lens, one largely shaped by its interests in the region, and has not hesitated to impose sanctions whenever those interests diverged. The most consequential factor today is America’s policy of containing China and its strategy to rally countries behind efforts to counterbalance Beijing’s growing global influence, analysts observe. “Pakistan’s relationship with China, by contrast, is strategic, historic, trouble-free and remains pivotal to the country’s foreign policy. While Islamabad may seek to strike a balance between the two powers, it cannot afford to be part of any anti-China strategy. This constraint limits the scope for expanding relations with Washington beyond a certain threshold,” concludes Dr Khan. Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, November 10th, 2025",
      "title": "Strategically evolving economic interests",
      "summary": "In recent months, Pakistan has entered a renewed phase of engagement with the United States, characterised by expanding bilateral economic cooperation and commitments of investment in the country’s mining and energy sectors. Islamabad’s participation in the Gaza peace accord brokered by Washington has also strengthened political and diplomatic collaboration between the two nations. Pakistan’s renewed outreach to the US is hardly surprising given its trade dynamics. The US remains its single largest export market after Europe, where Pakistan maintains a consistent trade surplus; for a long time, it also was a major source of foreign direct investment in the country alongside the European Union and the United Kingdom until China replaced it with large investments in energy, port and transport infrastructure under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) during the last decade. Not just that, analysts say, Wash­ington’s support has traditionally been considered crucial, given Islamabad’s continued reliance on financial support from multilateral institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, controlled by the western powers, for repeated bailouts for its external sector stability. Islamabad’s new balancing act is being closely monitored in Beijing, where Pakistan’s apparent tilt towards Washington has raised questions, if not caused unease The goodwill of the country’s present military and political leadership with the current US administration of President Donald Trump has helped Islamabad secure a slightly better tariff deal compared to regional competitors, enabling Pakistan to retain and expand its export share in the world’s single largest market of consumer goods. While analysts view Pakistan’s renewed economic and diplomatic engagement with the US after more than a decade as a positive development, they also caution that it could pose a new foreign policy challenge for Islamabad given its deepening strategic alliance with China. They note that the reset in ties with Washington will be tested by Pakistan’s close relations with Beijing, which could pull the country in conflicting directions and require a careful diplomatic balancing act. Besides direct investment in infrastructure, Pakistan’s dependence on China for finished goods as well as raw and intermediary materials has increased manifold over time. Today, China stands as Pakistan’s largest trading partner and principal source of imports — excluding energy and edible oil — of around $20 billion or more. It is the country’s single largest investor and bilateral creditor, extending critical balance-of-payments support through currency swap arrangements, deposits kept with the central bank and debt rollovers. More than half of Pakistan’s bilateral external debt, nearly $24bn, is owed to China. Beijing also remains indispensable for Pakistan in technology transfer and as the primary supplier of military hardware and support. Though the country’s civil and military leadership has pledged not to “sacrifice one friend for another”, analysts argue that it is easier said than done. Some China watchers, including Dr Mahmood-ul-Hassan Khan, President of the Centre for Knowledge and Public Policy, say Islamabad’s new balancing act is being closely monitored in Beijing, where Pakistan’s apparent tilt towards Washington has raised questions, if not caused unease. Dr Khan maintains that Pakistan’s alleged offer to the US to build a new deep-sea port at Pasni, barely a hundred kilometres from the Gwadar Port developed by China under the CPEC initiative, and Islamabad’s silence on the matter have fuelled speculation in Beijing. He further points out that the expanding Pakistan-US cooperation in rare earth minerals and China’s growing concerns over the security of its workers in Pakistan have raised serious doubts about the future development of Gwadar and the next phase of CPEC. This became evident from the outcome of last month’s meeting of the CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) in Beijing, which ended without resolving key issues related to the security of Chinese personnel and payments to Chinese Independent Power Producers (IPPs), two major irritants hampering fresh Chinese investment in the country. Commitments for major projects such as the ML-1 railway upgrade also remain pending. The dispute over payments to Chinese IPPs persists, as Islamabad has sought to extend the repayment schedule. On the ML-1 project, Beijing has demanded a firm financial commitment from Pakistan before moving ahead with any agreement, particularly in light of the ongoing IMF programme. Even so, the meeting was hailed as a milestone for marking the formal start of CPEC Phase II. Yet, attracting fresh Chinese investment will remain difficult unless these long-standing concerns are addressed, Dr Khan cautions. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal’s proposal to hold JCC meetings every six months and convene Joint Working Groups quarterly during the first three years of CPEC Phase II underscores the delays and bottlenecks that continue to impede the corridor’s progress. Analysts argue that institutional strengthening, the resolution of pending issues, and enhanced security for Chinese personnel remain essential to sustain momentum and move Phase II forward.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Calling the proposed 27th Constitutional Amen­dment a “9/11 on Pakistan”, Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai announced a nationwide protest, arguing the measure would “shatter the foundation of the country”. Mr Achakzai said the peaceful protest would be held under the slogan of a Habib Jalib ghazal: “Aise Dastoor Ko, Subh-i-BeNoor Ko, Me Nahi Manta, Mai Nahi Janta”. Speaking at a news conference at the National Press Club, he anno­unced two additional slogans: “death for dictatorship and democracy live long” and “free the prisoners”. Mr Achakzai described himself as a “true patriotic” who has taken the oath to protect the country five times, noting that the current National Ass­embly speaker, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, administered two of those oaths. Opposition alliance announces nationwide protests; plans to observe ‘Black Day’ He recalled an exchange from 1993 with then-speaker Gohar Ayub Khan. “I spoke to the speaker that he has taken an oath of protecting the Constitution from hundreds of people, but how will we protect the constitution,” Mr Achakzai said. “I suggested taking another oath from us that if any general violated the constitution, we will be on the roads. How­ever, my suggestion was not considered.” Mr Achakzai drew a parallel with Afghanistan, noting the shared language and blood. “We can only forgive them if there will be constitution and democracy in Pakistan,” he said. He criticised the country’s economic state, stating that 45 percent of people live below the poverty line while some seek lifetime impunity from the law. “Then who will be investigated, a drug addict who steals money for the drugs or food?” he asked, claiming that those who commit minor crimes will be punished while those who “loot the country will have impunity”. Mr Achakzai argued that the country cannot be protected by empowering a single individual but by stren­gthening its constitution and people. “We appeal to all sections of society that it is an attack on the foundation of the country, so all should rise and resist against the conspiracy to smash the Parliament,” he said. “We all should get united and make a system to protect the country before it gets too late, here people are being killed, and they are being pushed to take the weapons in their hands.” Another TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, said the 27th Amendment was designed to protect the interests of certain individuals and was disconnected from the issues facing the public. A draft of the TTAP’s plans detailed a National Conference to be held this week to strategise against the amendment. The day after the amendment is passed will be observed as a “Black Day,” with lawyers and citizens encouraged to wear black arm strips. It claimed that the 1973 constitution was no more representative of the masses and was being used to protect the power in Rawalpindi, Lahore and Larkana. The movement will also involve publishing articles in national and international newspapers and establishing committees to meet with stakeholders, including bar councils and retired Supreme Court judges.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump has been talking up the prospects of Saudi Arabia agreeing to normalise ties with Israel, but it is unlikely to happen when Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House this month. The establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia after decades of enmity could shake up the political and security landscape in the Middle East, potentially strengthening US influence in the region. Trump said last month he hoped Saudi Arabia would “very soon” join other Muslim countries that signed the 2020 Abraham Accords normalising ties with Israel. But Riyadh has signalled to Washington through diplomatic channels that its position has not changed: it will sign up only if there is agreement on a roadmap to Palestinian statehood, two Gulf sources told Reuters . Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman speaks with US President Donald Trump on the day of the Saudi-US Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 13. — Reuters/File The intention is to avoid diplomatic missteps and ensure alignment of the Saudi and US positions before any public statements are made, they said. One said the aim was to avoid any confusion at or after the White House talks on November 18. The Crown Prince, widely known as MBS, “is not likely to entertain any possible formalising of ties in the near future without at least a credible pathway to a Palestinian state”. said Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy US national intelligence officer on the Middle East. MBS is likely to try to use his influence with Trump to seek “more explicit and vocal buy-in for the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state,” said Panikoff, who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. Trump’s upbeat comments on Abraham Accords Next week’s visit is the Crown Prince’s first to Washington since the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, an MBS critic whose murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul caused global outrage. MBS denied direct involvement. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco have already normalised ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, and Trump has said he expects an expansion of the accords soon. “We have a lot of people joining now the Abraham Accords, and hopefully we’re going to get Saudi Arabia very soon,” he said on November 5, without offering a timeline. In a television interview broadcast on October 17, he said, “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in.” But the agreement signed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco sidestepped the issue of Palestinian statehood. The two Gulf sources said Riyadh had signalled to Washington that any move to recognise Israel must be part of a new framework, not just an extension of any deal. For Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and custodian of its two holiest sites, Makkah and Madina, recognising Israel would be more than just a diplomatic milestone. It is a deeply sensitive national security issue tied to resolving one of the region’s oldest and most intractable conflicts. Such a step would be hard to take when the Arab public’s mistrust of Israel remains high over the scale of its military offensive during the war against Hamas in Gaza, despite a fragile ceasefire in the conflict that followed the group’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Saudi Foreign Ministry official Manal Radwan has called for a clear, time-bound Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the deployment of an international protection force and the empowerment and return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza. These steps, she said, are essential to the establishment of a Palestinian state — the prerequisite for regional integration and the implementation of the two-state solution. With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu staunchly opposed to Palestinian statehood, Saudi Arabia sees no immediate prospect of satisfying Trump’s demand that it normalise ties with Israel, the sources told Reuters . Progress on that front depends on concessions neither Washington nor Israel is currently prepared to make, Saudi officials say. Trump and Crown Prince set to seal defence pact Saudi officials are intent on steering the Trump-MBS meeting towards defence cooperation and investment, wary that the politically charged issue of normalisation of ties with Israel could overshadow the agenda. The meeting is expected to seal a pivotal defence pact defining the scope of US military protection for the de facto ruler of the world’s top oil exporter, and to cement America’s military footprint in the Gulf. The prospective deal has, however, been scaled back. Two other Gulf sources and three Western diplomats said the defence deal falls short of the full, Congress-ratified treaty Riyadh once sought in exchange for the long-promised normalisation of ties with Israel. The agreement, loosely modelled on an arrangement with Qatar that was established through an executive order in September, expands cooperation to include cutting-edge technology and defence. Riyadh, according to the two Gulf sources, pushed for provisions to allow future US administrations to elevate the pact to a full treaty — a safeguard to ensure continuity for a non-binding pact, vulnerable to reversal by future presidents. “It’s not the treaty they want; they might not see it as perfect, but it’s a stepping stone [to a full treaty],” said David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute, where he directs a project on Arab-Israeli relations. The linkage between the defence pact, normalisation with Israel and Palestinian statehood has produced a complex negotiating equation, pushing Riyadh and Washington to settle for a limited defence deal in the absence of progress on the other two tracks, the Gulf sources and Western diplomats said. That compromise, they say, could eventually evolve into a full treaty if normalisation advances. “The Saudi-American negotiations have undergone a fundamental shift in environment and context following the developments in Gaza since October 7,” said Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Saudi-based Gulf Research Institute think tank. He said the direct linkage between normalisation of ties with Israel and Palestinian statehood remained, but Riyadh now wanted Saudi national security requirements addressed separately. “The Saudi position is clear: meeting the Kingdom’s national security demands will help shape its broader stance on regional issues, including the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” he said. Threat from Iran receding A Nato-style defence pact appears a distant prospect, given the shifting regional calculus and the political hurdles in Washington. Iran, the main threat once driving Riyadh’s pursuit of binding US guarantees, has been strategically weakened over the past year by Israeli strikes on its nuclear and military infrastructure. The Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen have also suffered heavy blows. With pressure from Iran easing, the appetite for a treaty requiring two-thirds congressional approval has diminished, especially in the absence of normalisation with Israel. The two Gulf sources said such a pact would likely come with conditions, including curbs on Saudi Arabia’s expanding economic and technology ties with China, complicating Riyadh’s drive to balance strategic autonomy with US security guarantees. The current deal would expand joint military exercises, deepen cooperation between US and Saudi defence firms, and include safeguards to limit Riyadh’s military-industrial ties with China, the sources said. It would also fast-track advanced US weapons sales to the kingdom, bypassing the delays and political hurdles that have stalled previous deals.",

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman speaks with US President Donald Trump on the day of the Saudi-US Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 13. — Reuters/File The intention is to avoid diplomatic missteps and ensure alignment of the Saudi and US positions before any public statements are made, they said. One said the aim was to avoid any confusion at or after the White House talks on November 18. The Crown Prince, widely known as MBS, “is not likely to entertain any possible formalising of ties in the near future without at least a credible pathway to a Palestinian state”. said Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy US national intelligence officer on the Middle East. MBS is likely to try to use his influence with Trump to seek “more explicit and vocal buy-in for the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state,” said Panikoff, who is now at the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington. Trump’s upbeat comments on Abraham Accords Next week’s visit is the Crown Prince’s first to Washington since the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, an MBS critic whose murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul caused global outrage. MBS denied direct involvement. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco have already normalised ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, and Trump has said he expects an expansion of the accords soon. “We have a lot of people joining now the Abraham Accords, and hopefully we’re going to get Saudi Arabia very soon,” he said on November 5, without offering a timeline. In a television interview broadcast on October 17, he said, “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in.” But the agreement signed by the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco sidestepped the issue of Palestinian statehood. The two Gulf sources said Riyadh had signalled to Washington that any move to recognise Israel must be part of a new framework, not just an extension of any deal. For Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and custodian of its two holiest sites, Makkah and Madina, recognising Israel would be more than just a diplomatic milestone. It is a deeply sensitive national security issue tied to resolving one of the region’s oldest and most intractable conflicts. Such a step would be hard to take when the Arab public’s mistrust of Israel remains high over the scale of its military offensive during the war against Hamas in Gaza, despite a fragile ceasefire in the conflict that followed the group’s attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023. Saudi Foreign Ministry official Manal Radwan has called for a clear, time-bound Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, the deployment of an international protection force and the empowerment and return of the Palestinian Authority to Gaza. These steps, she said, are essential to the establishment of a Palestinian state — the prerequisite for regional integration and the implementation of the two-state solution. With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu staunchly opposed to Palestinian statehood, Saudi Arabia sees no immediate prospect of satisfying Trump’s demand that it normalise ties with Israel, the sources told Reuters . Progress on that front depends on concessions neither Washington nor Israel is currently prepared to make, Saudi officials say. Trump and Crown Prince set to seal defence pact Saudi officials are intent on steering the Trump-MBS meeting towards defence cooperation and investment, wary that the politically charged issue of normalisation of ties with Israel could overshadow the agenda. The meeting is expected to seal a pivotal defence pact defining the scope of US military protection for the de facto ruler of the world’s top oil exporter, and to cement America’s military footprint in the Gulf. The prospective deal has, however, been scaled back. Two other Gulf sources and three Western diplomats said the defence deal falls short of the full, Congress-ratified treaty Riyadh once sought in exchange for the long-promised normalisation of ties with Israel. The agreement, loosely modelled on an arrangement with Qatar that was established through an executive order in September, expands cooperation to include cutting-edge technology and defence. Riyadh, according to the two Gulf sources, pushed for provisions to allow future US administrations to elevate the pact to a full treaty — a safeguard to ensure continuity for a non-binding pact, vulnerable to reversal by future presidents. “It’s not the treaty they want; they might not see it as perfect, but it’s a stepping stone [to a full treaty],” said David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute, where he directs a project on Arab-Israeli relations. The linkage between the defence pact, normalisation with Israel and Palestinian statehood has produced a complex negotiating equation, pushing Riyadh and Washington to settle for a limited defence deal in the absence of progress on the other two tracks, the Gulf sources and Western diplomats said. That compromise, they say, could eventually evolve into a full treaty if normalisation advances. “The Saudi-American negotiations have undergone a fundamental shift in environment and context following the developments in Gaza since October 7,” said Abdelaziz al-Sagher, head of the Saudi-based Gulf Research Institute think tank. He said the direct linkage between normalisation of ties with Israel and Palestinian statehood remained, but Riyadh now wanted Saudi national security requirements addressed separately. “The Saudi position is clear: meeting the Kingdom’s national security demands will help shape its broader stance on regional issues, including the resolution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,” he said. Threat from Iran receding A Nato-style defence pact appears a distant prospect, given the shifting regional calculus and the political hurdles in Washington. Iran, the main threat once driving Riyadh’s pursuit of binding US guarantees, has been strategically weakened over the past year by Israeli strikes on its nuclear and military infrastructure. The Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen have also suffered heavy blows. With pressure from Iran easing, the appetite for a treaty requiring two-thirds congressional approval has diminished, especially in the absence of normalisation with Israel. The two Gulf sources said such a pact would likely come with conditions, including curbs on Saudi Arabia’s expanding economic and technology ties with China, complicating Riyadh’s drive to balance strategic autonomy with US security guarantees. The current deal would expand joint military exercises, deepen cooperation between US and Saudi defence firms, and include safeguards to limit Riyadh’s military-industrial ties with China, the sources said. It would also fast-track advanced US weapons sales to the kingdom, bypassing the delays and political hurdles that have stalled previous deals.",

      "title_orig": "Afghan Taliban used talks to prolong temporary ceasefire, not take action against terrorism: FO",
      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Sunday stated that the Afghan Taliban only participated in talks with Pakistan this past week to prolong a temporary ceasefire between the two nations and did not take any action against terrorist elements operating from their soil. Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban followed weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month. On Friday, the talks broke down , with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying that the negotiations “entered an indefinite phase”, but a temporary ceasefire between Kabul and Islamabad still stands. In a lengthy statement published today, the FO said: “Anyone following the talks held under the mediation of brotherly countries of Turkiye and Qatar, could easily discern that the Taliban regime was only interested in prolonging the temporary ceasefire, but without taking concrete and verifiable actions against the TTP/FaK (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan/ Fitna-al-Khawarij ) and BLA/FaH (Balochistan Liberation Army/ Fitna-al-Hindustan ) elements present on Afghan soil.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “Instead of finding solutions to address Pakistan’s core concern, [the] Afghan regime used the opportunity to malign Pakistan through hypothetical accusations and jingoistic rhetoric,” the statement added. “It prolonged discussions and engaged in futile arguments to stonewall the efforts at reaching any concrete understanding.” The statement added that at the same time, the Afghan Taliban regime tried to paint the issue of Pakistani terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue. “In the aftermath of Pakistan’s ‘Operation Zarb-i-Azb’ in 2015, terrorists belonging to the so-called TTP/FaK fled to Afghanistan,” the statement read. “They abetted [the] Afghan Taliban in their fight against the ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) and [the] Afghan Government of the time. These terrorists and their families are now being harboured by [the] Taliban regime as a payback for their allegiance to Afghan Taliban.” Despite the breakdown of the negotiations, the statement emphasised that Pakistan has never turned down dialogue with “any government in Kabul”, but affirmed that it would not hold dialogue with any terrorist group. The FO noted that since the Taliban’s takeover in 2021, terrorist attacks in Pakistan surged, with the attacks “emanating from Afghan soil”. It added that despite the attacks, Islamabad maintained restraint and took no retaliatory action. “Pakistan’s expectation was that with [the] passage of time, [the] Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the TTP/FaK elements present on Afghan soil,” the statement read, adding that Pakistan tried to foster positive ties through providing humanitarian assistance and encouraging trade. “However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan in terms of trade, humanitarian assistance, educational and medical visas facilitation and efforts at international forums to encourage the international community to engage with [the] Taliban regime in the interest of regional peace and stability, and for the socio-economic development of Afghanistan and its people, the response from the Taliban regime has only been hollow promises and inaction.” The statement reiterated Pakistan’s demand that the Afghan Taliban hand over these terrorists to Islamabad’s custody, adding that Kabul repeatedly refused to do so, citing a lack of control. “More than being a matter of capability, it has become a matter of intent of [the] Taliban regime. Empty hopes and hollow promises rendered by Taliban regime so far have already outlived their efficacy,” the FO stated. “[The] Taliban regime is also trying to portray the TTP/FaK and BLA/FaH elements as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee issue, but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees.” The statement added: “Instead of acting upon the core expectation from Pakistan … not to allow Afghan territory to be used for attacks against Pakistan, the Taliban regime has always tried to shy away from taking concrete and verifiable actions.” The FO said Kabul has tried to “confuse the main issue with other relatively irrelevant and hypothetical issues” and keeps trying to “develop a narrative which absolves [the] Taliban regime of its commitments and responsibilities towards international community and its own people.” The statement affirmed that Pakistan’s response to attacks launched from Afghanistan’s territory would leave “no stone unturned” to safeguard its sovereignty and citizens, adding that anyone supporting or abetting terrorists is “not considered a friend” of Islamabad’s. Narratives and propaganda The statement added that the Afghan Taliban try to spread narratives about disagreements within Islamabad over Afghan policy. “Irrespective of this misleading propaganda, there is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that the ordinary people of Pakistan are the biggest victims of the terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan and their abettors,” the FO clarified, maintaining that Pakistan’s armed forces are fully capable of safeguarding the population against any acts of aggression. Moreover, the FO noted in its statement an attempt by elements in the Afghan Taliban to “instigate Pashtoon (Pakhtun) nationalism” in Pakistan. “It is a historical fact that Pashtoons in Pakistan are a vibrant part of the society and the state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of polity and bureaucracy,” the statement read. “More … Pashtoons live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan … therefore, instead of instigating pashtoonism in Pakistan, it would be wise for [the] Taliban regime to look into its own credentials of inclusivity of all segments of its population in its governance structures.” ‘Strong lobby’ The FO added that there are people within the Afghan Taliban who do not want war with Pakistan, but noted the presence of a “strong lobby, with monetary support from foreign actors that has been tasked to stoke tensions”. “In search for legitimacy and to unite their fractious government, certain elements in [the] Taliban regime, anti-Pakistan terrorist elements and their abettors have found raising the bogey of Pakistan quite useful,” the statement read. “These elements have engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan. By doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had within Pakistan.” Border clashes and talks The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held several rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement was not achieved. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks began on Friday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire. Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing. However, the talks failed as negotiators could not bridge deep differences between the two sides. “Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” said the defence minister while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’. The defence minister added that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and that they were not willing to sign a written agreement. “They said that they would only respect the verbal agreement, but there is no room to do that.”",

      "summary_orig": "Türkiye’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler, and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin will visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday. He made the announcement while speaking to reporters on his flight returning from Azerbaijan. Talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down on Friday without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism, officials and sources said. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif insisted that the negotiations were “over” and had “entered an indefinite phase”. “Right now, as we speak, negotiations are over,” Asif told Geo News , alleging that the Afghan Taliban delegation again came to Istanbul “without any programme” and was unwilling to sign a written agreement. A senior security source confirmed that discussions had hit an impasse. “The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” he said. However, it is understood that a fragile ceasefire between the two countries is still holding . The defence minister also said that the truce stands for the time being but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”. The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks began on Thursday in Istanbul and was planned to continue for two days. Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials. The Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib. Reports from Istanbul suggest that the Pakistani delegation had left the hotel for the airport after the talks broke down. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day. The ISI chief and some members of the Pakistan delegation have left Istanbul, but the Pakistani side is still not ruling out resumption of the process. A source said an attempt will be made to break the deadlock. It is believed that some senior officials have stayed behind to work with the mediators. For most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner”. He added, “The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism. They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.” The dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Turkiye and Qatar then stepped in to mediate. The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire , while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks. The latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism. Afghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed on Friday that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islama­bad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive”, suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications. According to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation”. A source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive”. Iranian FM calls Pakistani, Afghan counterparts Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday spoke to his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul, the Iranian and Afghan foreign ministries said. According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi announced Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries. “Expressing concern about the current situation between Afghanistan and Pakistan, he emphasised the need for continued dialogue between the two sides with the cooperation of influential countries in the region to resolve differences and reduce tension, and announced the readiness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide any kind of assistance to achieve this goal. FM Dar, while explaining the latest situation and the results of the talks between his country and Afghanistan following recent developments, stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region, according to IRNA . The two sides also agreed to continue consultations in this regard.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday ordered the withdrawal of proposed immunity for the PM as part of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, urging that the premier must remain “fully accountable”. Taking to X, he ordered the withdrawal of a clause seeking to grant immunity to the PM in the 27th Amendment and said, “On my return from Azerbaijan, I have learnt that some Senators belonging to our party have submitted an amendment regarding immunity for the prime minister.” “While I acknowledge their intent in good faith, the proposal was not part of the Cabinet-approved draft. I have instructed that it be withdrawn immediately,” PM Shehbaz wrote. “As a matter of principle, an elected prime minister must remain fully accountable, both before the court of law and the people.” Separately, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while speaking to reporters today, said that PM Shehbaz told him earlier that “he had no interest in getting immunity,” owing to the executive nature of his role as the prime minister. “The other positions being granted immunity do not have any executive functions,” Tarrar explained. The statement comes as Senate and National Assembly committees continue to hold discussions on the proposed bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), changes to the appointment process for high court judges, a higher cap on provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure. A set of clauses in the bill also proposes life-long constitutional protection to officers promoted to five-star ranks of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet. Such officers would “retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”, removable only through the impeachment-like procedure under Article 47. Immunities similar to those enjoyed by the president under Article 248 would apply in this case. Article 248 of the Constitution stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office.” On Saturday afternoon, the federal cabinet approved the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment, welcoming it to “the fullest extent.” Subsequently, it was tabled before the Senate, triggering noisy protests from the opposition over the pace and scope of the proposed changes. PM Shehbaz was elected as the 24th premier of Pakistan in the 2024 general elections. Article 95 of the Constitution of Pakistan allows for a prime minister to be impeached via a no-confidence motion. It states: “A resolution for a vote of no-confidence moved by not less than twenty per centum of the total membership of the National Assembly may be passed against the Prime Minister by the National Assembly.”",
