Waseem, who hit 69, and Sharafu, who made 51, put on 88 runs for the opening wicket to guide hosts UAE to a challenging 172-5 in Abu Dhabi. The home bowlers then combined to dismiss Oman for 130 in 18.4 overs for their first win in this edition of the regional tournament played in the T20 format. Medium-pace bowler Junaid Siddique stood out with figures of 4-23. Haider Ali and Muhammad Jawadullah took two wickets each. The batters had set up victory.  Waseem and Sharafu started cautiously but soon took the attack to the opposition with a flurry of boundaries. Sharafu fell for his 51, but Waseem kept up the charge and reached fifty with a six. The captain was run out in the final over. UAE play Pakistan, who went down to tournament favourites India in a key match, next on Wednesday, with the winner likely to move into the Super Four stage of the eight-nation event. Oman were never in the chase and lost five wickets for 50 runs with captain and opener Jatinder Singh scoring 20 as they slumped to a second straight defeat. Defending champions India, who won the previous edition played in a 50-overs format, lead the table in Group A with two wins in two matches are nearly through to the next stage. Along with regional bragging rights, the competition will serve as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against the match referee for yesterday’s Asia Cup game between Pakistan and India over his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket”, PCB Chairperson Mohsin Naqvi said. “The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket,” Naqvi posted on X, referring to referee Andy Pycroft. “The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the match referee from the Asia Cup,” he added. According to an earlier press release by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Pycroft was scheduled to be the match referee for the Pakistan-UAE match on Wednesday. The Asia Cup match between the two sides took place on Sunday in Dubai, where spinners led by Kuldeep Yadav helped India beat Pakistan by seven wickets as the neighbours met on the cricket pitch for the first time since a military conflict between them in May. After hitting the winning shot, Suryakumar and his teammates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts. The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government”. In the post-match presentation, Suryakumar said India took the match against Pakistan as “just another game” and dedicated the win to the Indian armed forces. “We stand with the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack, and we express our solidarity,” Suryakumar said. “We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.” The April 22 attack on civilians in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam triggered Pakistan-India hostilities in May. New Delhi, without evidence, accused Pakistan of backing the attack — a charge Islamabad strongly denies . After the match, the PCB confirmed to Dawn.com that Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema had “registered a protest against the match referees’ behaviour.” “It was against the sportsman spirit that the Indian team did not shake hands,” the PCB statement quoted the manager as saying. It alleged that the “match referee had asked the captains not to shake hands at the time of the toss”. Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony as a reaction to the Indian team’s move. Pakistan’s coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason Salman was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match. “It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said. Following the developments, PCB chief Naqvi earlier today said on X: “Utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today. Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports. “Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace.” The match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘ boycott ’ the fixture. The Indian cricket board had said it could not boycott an international event and that such a move would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”. New Delhi only cleared the match in a recently announced sports policy , saying the Indian national team can play Pakistan in multi-national events but not in bilateral competitions. Pakistan last played a bilateral series against India in 2012, when the Green Shirts toured India for an ODI and T20I series.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan captain Fatima Sana said on Monday that her team’s focus was on the Women’s World Cup ahead of the one-day international (ODI) series against South Africa in Lahore. The World Cup , to be hosted later this month under a hybrid model across India and Sri Lanka, will see all of Pakistan’s fixtures staged in Colombo, with political tensions ruling out travel between the two neighbours. Pakistan open their immediate run-in with a three-match ODI series against South Africa in Lahore from Tuesday, following the conclusion of a training camp at the National Cricket Academy and the Gaddafi Stadium. Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Lahore, Fatima said: “The specific aim is to prepare for the World Cup and execute our plans in this series.” “A series like this is very beneficial for the team ahead of the World Cup. It gives the players a good opportunity to put into practice all the preparation they have done in recent times,“ she was quoted as having said by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). She added that it is widely known that Pakistan rely on their bowling attack, so this time the Green Team’s focus will be on getting more support from the batting unit as well. “We worked a lot on batting during the camp,” the Pakistani skipper said. The ODIs will be staged at the Gaddafi Stadium on September 16, 19 and 22, with the first ball of all matches to be bowled at 3:30pm, according to the PCB. Pakistan’s 15-member squad will be captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt will lead the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches. The squad features one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August. In Pakistan, the fans will be able to watch the matches on A Sports , while live-streaming for viewers across the Pakistan region will be available on Tamasha. Cricbuzz and Sportainment (Middle-East and North Africa), Super Sports (Africa), Sports Central (Global outside Pakistan), and Willow TV (North America) will broadcast matches internationally, the PCB added. The forthcoming series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka. In head-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on September 14, 2023.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands of India, who beat them by seven wickets after beating the paltry 128-run target set by the Green Shirts during yesterday’s Asia Cup game. However, the match had been marred by controversy from the beginning due to calls from across the border to “ boycott ” the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands with their rivals at the toss and after the match. Furthermore, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was said to have “politicised” the win by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his nation. From cricketers and politicians to fans and analysts watching the game, social media was rife with their takes on the scene. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi expressed his disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X shortly after the match. “Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports. Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace,” he wrote. He later said that the PCB has also lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against the match referee for his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket” and sought his removal from the Asia Cup. Former Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez simply wrote on X: “sportsmanship”, followed by a broken heart emoji. Former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, during a show aired on tapmad platform, said, “Do not make this match political, it’s a cricket match.” “Do a handshake. I said this pre-match too, that shake hands; there is no issue in it. It’s a game of cricket. Show your grace.” Akhtar lamented how the Indian cricketers took matters to the “next level”, adding, “I would go and shake hands with my enemies.” The cricket legend further said he did not like the “post-match ceremony”, apparently referring to Suryakumar’s comments, and that Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha made the right move by skipping the ceremony in response. View this post on Instagram Meanwhile, Pakistan pacer Aamir Jamal stated that when it comes to sportsmanship, “India will always lack [in] these things”. Citing Suryakumar’s remarks about his not shaking hands being in alignment with the Indian government and its cricket board to “give a proper reply”, Jamal said: “That’s not a reply, it’s [a] game of cricket.” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif lamented how India had brought “cricket to this level”. “Loss of face and international humiliation suffered by India in the recent conflict cannot be compensated by such shabby and petty attempts,” Asif wrote. “Wounds inflicted by [Pakistan] armed forces, loss of IAF (Indian Air Force) planes, including mighty [Rafales] won’t heal by such cheap theatrics,” he said, referring to Pakistani forces downing six Indian jets during the May conflict. “India’s injection of politics into sports is shameful,” wrote PTI leader and ex-senator Faisal Javed Khan on X, as he criticised state-broadcaster PTV for purportedly airing Suryakumar’s “anti-Pakistan remarks”. Dr Khurram Abbas, director of the India Study Centre at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, recalled that Yadav was “trolled in India” after he shook hands with Salman at the trophy reveal ceremony . “Now under pressure and perhaps [on] instructions by the BCCI, Team India refused to shake hands with team Pakistan at the time of [the] toss and at the end of the match, which is against sportsman spirit,” he wrote. “This game is getting politicised … ICC should intervene.”",

      "summary": "Pakistan suffered an ignominious defeat at the hands of India, who beat them by seven wickets after beating the paltry 128-run target set by the Green Shirts during yesterday’s Asia Cup game. However, the match had been marred by controversy from the beginning due to calls from across the border to “ boycott ” the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands with their rivals at the toss and after the match. Furthermore, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was said to have “politicised” the win by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his nation. From cricketers and politicians to fans and analysts watching the game, social media was rife with their takes on the scene. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi expressed his disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X shortly after the match. “Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports. Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace,” he wrote. He later said that the PCB has also lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against the match referee for his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket” and sought his removal from the Asia Cup. Former Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez simply wrote on X: “sportsmanship”, followed by a broken heart emoji. Former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, during a show aired on tapmad platform, said, “Do not make this match political, it’s a cricket match.” “Do a handshake. I said this pre-match too, that shake hands; there is no issue in it. It’s a game of cricket. Show your grace.” Akhtar lamented how the Indian cricketers took matters to the “next level”, adding, “I would go and shake hands with my enemies.” The cricket legend further said he did not like the “post-match ceremony”, apparently referring to Suryakumar’s comments, and that Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha made the right move by skipping the ceremony in response. View this post on Instagram Meanwhile, Pakistan pacer Aamir Jamal stated that when it comes to sportsmanship, “India will always lack [in] these things”. Citing Suryakumar’s remarks about his not shaking hands being in alignment with the Indian government and its cricket board to “give a proper reply”, Jamal said: “That’s not a reply, it’s [a] game of cricket.” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif lamented how India had brought “cricket to this level”. “Loss of face and international humiliation suffered by India in the recent conflict cannot be compensated by such shabby and petty attempts,” Asif wrote. “Wounds inflicted by [Pakistan] armed forces, loss of IAF (Indian Air Force) planes, including mighty [Rafales] won’t heal by such cheap theatrics,” he said, referring to Pakistani forces downing six Indian jets during the May conflict. “India’s injection of politics into sports is shameful,” wrote PTI leader and ex-senator Faisal Javed Khan on X, as he criticised state-broadcaster PTV for purportedly airing Suryakumar’s “anti-Pakistan remarks”. Dr Khurram Abbas, director of the India Study Centre at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad, recalled that Yadav was “trolled in India” after he shook hands with Salman at the trophy reveal ceremony . “Now under pressure and perhaps [on] instructions by the BCCI, Team India refused to shake hands with team Pakistan at the time of [the] toss and at the end of the match, which is against sportsman spirit,” he wrote. “This game is getting politicised … ICC should intervene.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The interior ministry has asked manpower from five different departments and forces, including Islamabad police, Frontier Constabulary (FC), and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Dawn has learnt. A few months ago, AJK police initiated a strike with an 11-point charter of demands. These include increases in medical allowance, conveyance allowance, house rent, and the implementation of a career progression system similar to that of Punjab police. Additionally, there are demands for improved retirement policies, training, housing, and educational facilities for the children of police personnel. In July, AJK police observed a pen-down strike and subsequently organised a state-wide strike to demand better rights and facilities in major districts. The manpower for law enforcement in AJK should consider the police protests and strikes in the region. Moreover, the government suspects that the AJK police may extend their protests and strikes, potentially expressing further resentment. Sources within the interior ministry told Dawn that a few days ago, in a meeting, the heads of five departments and forces, including Islamabad Police, FC, and FIA, were instructed to mobilise forces for deployment in AJK, particularly at key, sensitive, and significant installations. They have also arranged the equipment resources currently used by the forces for deployment in AJK. The department heads were urged to assemble the forces promptly and prepare to respond positively. They requested time to organise the necessary manpower and equipment. They were instructed to expedite the process; however, they will have three days to reach AJK once the deployment order is issued. The sources revealed that 4,000 personnel from the capital police and FC were asked. In response, the capital police agreed to provide a force of 2,000 officers, and the FC and FIA also committed to arranging manpower. Subsequently, in line with their commitments to the interior ministry, the capital police are preparing to deploy 2,000 personnel to AJK. A letter issued by the office of the AIG Establishment on Saturday, addressed to the DG Safe City, DIGs of Operations, Law and Order, AIGs of Special Branch, Logistics, SSPs of Security, CTD, and Traffic, requested a “provision of strength”. It stated that, according to the directions of the IGP Islamabad, the specified police personnel must be sent to AJK temporarily. DG Safe City, DIGs of Operations, Law and Order, AIGs of Special Branch, Logistics, SSPs of Security, CTD, and Traffic were asked to submit their lists of suitable police officers and officials on Saturday to ensure the timely departure of the force to AJK. This team will include an SSP, four SPs, eight DSPs, 16 Inspectors, 88 Sub-Inspectors, Assistant Sub-Inspectors, 1,718 Head Constables and Constables, 132 lady constables, and 33 other staff members.

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed 31 terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, the military’s media wing said on Monday. “On 13-14 September, 31 khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in [the] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release. The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR said an IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat on the “reported presence of khwarij ”. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” it added. The ISPR added that another IBO was carried out in Bannu, where 17 more terrorists were killed in a gun battle. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored khwariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the ISPR stated. On Saturday, the ISPR said the military had killed 45 terrorists between September 10 and 13 and 19 soldiers were martyred during these operations in KP. Following those developments, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to continue responding to terrorism in the country with “full force”. He said terrorists and their facilitators responsible for attacks in Pakistan were operating from the Afghan soil with the backing of India. “The Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan,” he added. PM Shehbaz warned that “anyone facilitating or advocating” for terrorists or “acting as proxies for India” was essentially their agent and would be “dealt with accordingly”. Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022 , the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump said on Monday he would call a national emergency and federalise Washington DC after Mayor Muriel Bowser said its police would not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). At issue is the provision of information on individuals living in, or entering, the United States illegally. Trump’s threat adds to a move critics have seen as federal overreach, with more than 2,000 troops patrolling the city. The comments come after several thousand protesters hit the streets this month over Trump’s August deployment of National Guard troops to “re-establish law, order, and public safety“, after calling crime a blight on the capital. “In just a few weeks. The ‘place’ is absolutely booming … for the first time in decades, virtually no crime,” Trump said on Truth Social. Bowser’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s post. Earlier, he had put the metropolitan police department under direct federal control and sent federal law enforcement, including members of ICE, to police the streets. It is unclear when their mission will end. Trump blamed “radical left Democrats” for pressuring Bowser to inform the government about the non-cooperation with ICE, adding that if the police halted cooperation with ICE, “crime would come roaring back”. He added: “To the people and businesses of Washington DC, don’t worry, I am with you and won’t allow this to happen. I’ll call a National Emergency, and federalise, if necessary!!!” Bowser, who has previously praised Trump’s surge of federal law enforcement, bringing a sharp decline in crime, earlier signed an order for the city to coordinate with federal law enforcement. The National Guard serves as a militia answering to the governors of the 50 states, except when called into federal service. The DC National Guard reports directly to the president.",

      "summary_orig": "Indian security forces killed a top Maoist commander and two other rebels in a gun battle on Monday, officials said, as the government intensifies efforts to crush the decades-long conflict. India is waging an all-out offensive against the last remaining traces of the Naxalite rebellion, named after the village in the foothills of the Himalayas where the Maoist-inspired guerrilla movement began nearly six decades ago. More than 12,000 rebels, soldiers and civilians have been killed since a handful of villagers rose up against their feudal lords there in 1967. The latest gun battle took place early on Monday in the mineral-rich eastern state of Jharkhand, India’s Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) said in a statement. The federal police described the operation as a “major breakthrough”. Three “top Naxal commanders” were killed in the fight, the CRPF said, including Sahdev Soren, who was part of the central committee of the Maoist organisation. Authorities had issued a bounty of around $113,000 for his capture. Last week, forces killed another Maoist commander and nine others in a fierce gun battle along the forested border between the states of Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The Indian government has vowed to crush the rebellion by the end of March next year. The rebellion controlled nearly a third of the country with an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 fighters at its peak in the mid-2000s. A crackdown by Indian troops across the “Red Corridor” has killed more than 400 rebels since last year , according to government data. The group’s chief, Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, was gunned down in May, along with 26 other guerrillas. The conflict has also seen several deadly attacks on government forces. A roadside bomb killed at least nine Indian troops in January.",

India is waging an all-out offensive against the last remaining traces of the Naxalite rebellion, named after the village in the foothills of the Himalayas where the Maoist-inspired guerrilla movement began nearly six decades ago. More than 12,000 rebels, soldiers and civilians have been killed since a handful of villagers rose up against their feudal lords there in 1967. The latest gun battle took place early on Monday in the mineral-rich eastern state of Jharkhand, India’s Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) said in a statement. The federal police described the operation as a “major breakthrough”. Three “top Naxal commanders” were killed in the fight, the CRPF said, including Sahdev Soren, who was part of the central committee of the Maoist organisation. Authorities had issued a bounty of around $113,000 for his capture. Last week, forces killed another Maoist commander and nine others in a fierce gun battle along the forested border between the states of Odisha and Chhattisgarh. The Indian government has vowed to crush the rebellion by the end of March next year. The rebellion controlled nearly a third of the country with an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 fighters at its peak in the mid-2000s. A crackdown by Indian troops across the “Red Corridor” has killed more than 400 rebels since last year , according to government data. The group’s chief, Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, was gunned down in May, along with 26 other guerrillas. The conflict has also seen several deadly attacks on government forces. A roadside bomb killed at least nine Indian troops in January.",

According to eyewitness accounts, victim Z took cover behind an iron gate as two unidentified motorcyclists allegedly opened fire on him. The victim, however, escaped unharmed and the attackers managed to escape from the scene. The Harappa police registered a case under sections 506 and 34 of the PPC against two unknown suspects, based on Z’s complaint. Speaking to Dawn , Z said that he was standing near the gate of his house when two young men — estimated to be between 20 and 25 years old — approached on a motorcycle and fired directly at him. “It was dark, and I managed to hide. That’s what saved me,” he said. He claimed that he would be able to identify the attackers if he saw them again. Local villagers, who witnessed the incident, confirmed hearing multiple gunshots. The area has a documented history of communal tensions, particularly following the rise of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan. Notably, Z’s elder brother was also murdered by unknown assailants in a previous incident. At that time, police interrogated individuals affiliated with the Tehreek Tahafuz Khatm-e-Nabuwwat. ASP Raosen Taj Raisani confirmed his presence at the crime scene shortly after the incident. “We are pursuing two to three leads and hope to trace the suspects soon,” he said. WHEAT RECOVERED: Around 15,000 metric tons of wheat has been recovered from alleged hoarders during difierent raids conducted over the past three days at 15 warehouses across the Pakpattan and Sahiwal districts. Pakpattan Deputy Commissioner Asif Raza said that the district administration, special branch and the food department conducted joint operations based on intelligence reports. He said that while some warehouse owners had declared their wheat stocks, most were found to be storing large quantities without disclosure. A total of 9,860 metric tons of wheat had been confiscated in the district. Separately, Sahiwal Deputy Commissioner Shahid Mahmood confirmed the recovery of 4,285 metric tons of undeclared wheat from a rice mill located at 99/9-L, Sahiwal. Meanwhile, Commissioner Asif Tufail announced the official retail prices for flour in the Sahiwal division at Rs905 for a 10kg bag and Rs1,810 for a 20 kg bag. The price of roti had been fixed at Rs14, while the wheat support price was set at Rs3,000 per 40kg. The commissioner warned that strict action would be taken against those involved in illegal stockpiling. Despite these measures, ordinary consumers continue to face rising flour prices following the government’s announcement of the new wheat rates. Published in Dawn, September 15th, 2025",
