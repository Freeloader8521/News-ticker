The Seoul Central District Court issued the warrants at the request of a special counsel team that investigated various suspicions connected to the December 2024 martial law attempt. Kim's arrest had been set to expire Thursday, while Yeo's had been set to end Jan. 2. In granting the request, the court cited concerns the suspects would destroy evidence. By law, the maximum period of arrest for a first instance trial is six months, but it can be extended if a defendant is indicted on additional charges. Both Kim and Yeo, who have been held in custody since last December over their roles in the martial law plan, were additionally indicted last month on charges of aiding the enemy and power abuse for allegedly ordering the dispatch of drones to Pyongyang around October 2024. The dispatch, according to the team, was aimed at inciting the North's",

      "summary_orig": "The chief of the state arms procurement agency on Wednesday cited legality as the main factor behind a change in the bidding process for a multi-trillion won contract to build homegrown advanced destroyers. Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) Minister Lee Yong-cheol made the remarks after the Defense Project Promotion Committee announced that it will pick the winner of the estimated 7 trillion-won ($5 billion) bid to build six advanced destroyers through competitive bidding. The committee made the decision in a unanimous vote in a meeting Monday, also attended by Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back. The landmark project had been long delayed, due mainly to intensifying competition and a legal feud between rival shipbuilders Hanwha Ocean and HD Hyundai Heavy Industries that had respectively taken part in the concept design and basic design of the envisioned destroyer. HD Hyundai was initially expected to be chosen as the sole-source contractor to build the lead ship but faced protest from Hanwha Ocean over an alleged security leak involving HD Hyundai employees in the ship design",

      "summary_orig": "The Libyan army‘s chief of staff, Mohammed Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, died in a plane crash on Tuesday after leaving Turkiye’s capital Ankara, the prime minister of Libya’s internationally recognised government said, adding that four others were on the jet as well. “This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people,” Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement. He said the commander of Libya’s ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff’s office were also on the aircraft. Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT. He said authorities found the plane’s wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara’s Haymana district. He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established. The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation into the crash was under way. The Tripoli-based Government of National Unity said in a statement that the prime minister directed the defence minister to send an official delegation to Ankara to follow up on proceedings. Walid Ellafi, state minister of political affairs and communication for the GNU, told broadcaster Libya Alahrar that it was not clear when a crash report would be ready, but that the jet was a leased Maltese aircraft. He added that officials did not have “sufficient information regarding its ownership or technical history,” but said this would be investigated. Libya’s UN-recognised Government of National Unity announced official mourning across the country for three days. Turkiye’s defence ministry had announced Haddad’s visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders. The crash occurred a day after Turkiye’s parliament passed a decision to extend the mandate of Turkish soldiers’ deployment in Libya by two more years. Nato member Turkiye has militarily and politically supported Libya’s Tripoli-based, internationally recognised government. In 2020, it sent military personnel there to train and support its government and later reached a maritime demarcation accord, which has been disputed by Egypt and Greece. In 2022, Ankara and Tripoli also signed a preliminary accord on energy exploration, which Egypt and Greece also oppose. However, Turkiye has recently switched course under its “One Libya” policy, ramping up contacts with Libya’s eastern faction as well.",

      "summary_orig": "In a night of stark contrasts that laid bare the brutal beauty of mixed martial arts, Pakistan’s fighting corps experienced both a poignant end and a violent new beginning at Brave CF 103 on Tuesday. The nation witnessed its undefeated king, Rizwan ’The Haider’ Ali, dethroned, only to see another warrior, Ismail ‘The Volcano’ Khan, announce his arrival as a genuine global force with a breathtaking finish. The main event carried the hopes of a nation on the shoulders of its brightest star, Rizwan. Entering the Bukhara arena with an unblemished 11-0 record and seven first-round finishes, the PAKMMA superstar faced a daunting task: defeating the local hero, Nozim ‘The Bukhara Warrior’ Kalandarov, in his own fortress. Trouble appeared before the fight even began, with the 28-year-old Rizwan missing the lightweight limit, forcing the bout to a 72kg catchweight. In the cage, a more critical problem emerged. Kalandarov executed a flawless grappler’s game plan, securing takedowns with ease in every round. Despite a valiant defensive effort, Rizwan, a feared striker, had no answer for the relentless control and top pressure. After three rounds of one-sided dominance, the judges’ unanimous decision was a mere formality, ending Rizwan’s historic unbeaten run. In a display of true sportsmanship and resilience, Rizwan addressed the setback directly. “I was the only undefeated fighter of Pakistan fighting on the highest stage — I took a fight against a hero in Central Asia,” Rizwan stated while talking to Dawn . “I carried an injury throughout the camp but still decided to go ahead. My loss will go a long way in teaching me lessons that will help me rise. Big thanks to the people who supported me and I will come back stronger.” The eruption of the volcano Earlier in the evening, the Pakistani flag was flown with ruthless authority by Ismail. Facing Kyrgyz submission specialist Rayimbek Tazhibaev in a 60.5kg catchweight bout, ‘The Volcano’ delivered a performance that was anything but catchweight in its significance. Displaying terrifying fight IQ, Ismail masterfully neutralised his opponent’s strengths. He battered Tazhibaev with heavy leg kicks and crisp boxing, even out-grappling the grappler by securing takedowns and maintaining crushing top control. In the second round, after rocking his foe with a clean combination, Ismail smelled blood. He secured a takedown, advanced to full mount, and seamlessly locked in his signature move — a vicious head-arm triangle choke. The submission was so tight it rendered Tazhibaev unconscious, forcing the referee to stop the fight. Pumping his fists and roaring in triumph, Ismail climbed the cage, embodying the explosive promise of his moniker. “The arm triangle is my favourite submission,” stated a confident Ismail in his post-fight interview. “I train it constantly. When it’s on, I know I can put any fighter to sleep.” The victory extends Ismail’s undefeated streak and marks his fourth consecutive win under the Brave CF banner, solidifying his position as one of the promotion’s most dangerous rising talents. While the loss of Rizwan’s ‘0’ marks the closing of a legendary chapter for Pakistani MMA, his gracious response and determined vow to return set the stage for a compelling comeback saga. Simultaneously, the emphatic victory of Ismail forcefully turns the page to a new one. The night proved that the nation’s fighting spirit is not housed in one man, but is a resilient flame carried by many.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday rejected the comparison between Islamabad‘s actions against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and New Delhi’s unprovoked action against the country in May as “wrong and inappropriate”. The defence minister‘s remarks come a day after Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman questioned Pakistan’s objection to Indian attacks when the country also allegedly conducted cross-border strikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan. Pakistan has either denied or not commented on striking targets inside Afghanistan. In a post on X, Asif also said that India, to date, has “not been able to provide evidence” of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack, despite Pakistan’s offer of “neutral investigations”. “The report issued by the United Nations also clarifies that the Indian aggression was illegal and unsubstantiated, and Pakistan’s response was fully justified,“ said the defence minister. He elaborated that the international community and the United Nations are also concerned about terrorism under the regime of the Afghan Taliban, and maintained that the presence of terrorist formations and terrorists infiltrating Pakistan “are a clear proof of this”. He further stated that “any doubts raised by India, its proxies, and sympathisers” were addressed by the country “earlier and continue to be addressed today”. Relations with neighbours Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. However, two additional rounds of talks were held, but did not bear any fruit. Asif said that the talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase”. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Meanwhile, in May, tensions between Pakistan and India boiled over and led to a four-day military conflict. The fighting was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire . Pakistan initially said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat during the conflict, but later raised the tally to seven . Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after three air bases were targeted.",

However, two additional rounds of talks were held, but did not bear any fruit. Asif said that the talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase”. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Meanwhile, in May, tensions between Pakistan and India boiled over and led to a four-day military conflict. The fighting was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire . Pakistan initially said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat during the conflict, but later raised the tally to seven . Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after three air bases were targeted.",

      "summary_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan‘s sisters — Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan Niazi and Uzma Khan — ended their sit-in and left Rawalpindi’s Factory Naka on Tuesday night, hours after they were again barred from moving towards Adiala jail in a bid to meet the incarcerated ex-premier. Over the past several weeks, the PTI founder has been denied meetings in prison with his family, party members and lawyers, prompting them to stage sit-ins near or outside the prison complex every Tuesday and Thursday — the court-mandated days for visiting Imran. At times, police also used water cannons and baton charges to disperse them. A Dawn correspondent said that the PTI founder’s sisters left Factory Naka at around 9:30pm and moved towards Gorakhpur on foot, before heading home. Meanwhile, traffic resumed on the thoroughfare as soon as the 6-hour sit-in ended. Half an hour before that, the Saddar police station house officer arrived at the protest site and began negotiations with PTI’s Shaukat Basra and Meena Khan Afridi. After initial talks, the PTI leaders reached out to Imran’s sisters for consultation. An earlier post shared on the PTI’s official X account showed that the sit-in was ongoing at 7pm. In a video shared in the post, PTI workers are seen shouting slogans of “Prime Minister Imran Khan“. A Dawn correspondent confirmed that police had installed a riot fence near the Factory Naka in Rawalpindi, and upon reaching the spot, Imran’s sister, along with party workers, staged a sit-in. Earlier today, a PTI livestream showed crowds of party supporters marching towards the prison on Adiala Road, before being stopped in front of the riot fence, where they chanted slogans and waved Pakistani and PTI flags. On the occasion, Aleema said that Imran was being kept in “solitary confinement”, stressing that the “government had become so fearful of Imran’s message that they had resorted to breaking the law” — in a reference to the police presence at the scene. Speaking to reporters, Aleema said that the authorities are afraid of Imran, which is why they have jailed him. When asked about the statement issued after the TTAP’s two-day conference, she said it “was not a statement”. “The PTI people are saying that they want to negotiate (with the government), I responded by saying that Imran Khan has instructed Sohail Afridi to take to the streets and lead a movement,” she said. She added that this last message came from lawyer Salman Safdar, who represented the PTI founder when he was convicted in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday. “Whoever says that we should negotiate with the government after Imran gave these instructions, they cannot be a member of Imran Khan’s party,” Aleema stated. “We will sit here and we will not leave Imran Khan. She questioned what the government wants to negotiate when meetings with the PTI founder have been banned. “Tell me why I cannot have meetings (with Imran),“ she said. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja spoke to reporters and said that the party’s struggle is now a national one for democracy and judicial independence. “These punishments are unlawful and wrong,” Raja said when asked about Imran’s conviction. “Punishments have been handed out before. These are false cases. “We are standing against a system of lies and will file appeals. But the true cases will be fought in the public‘s court and Allah’s court,” he added. Raja said that Imran would be released when “the people decide on this case”. Asked about the street movement, the secretary general said that Imran instructed the KP CM to lead it in the province. “Sohail Afridi is ready and this will occur soon,” he replied, adding that when the time comes, there will be a similar movement in Punjab. In response to a question about negotiations with the government, Raja said: “These are false reports; Imran has given nobody in the party the power to start talks with the government. “Only [TTAP chief Mahmood Khan] Achakzai and [Senator] Allama Nasir have the power to do this,” he added. “Achakzai sahib gave his statement during the conference. He said that he will not negotiate with people who break into and rob his house.” Raja affirmed that the PTI would stand by its principles and their claim that the February 8 elections were “stolen”. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case. As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. On Monday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan would remain suspended till February 8. More to follow.",

A heated exchange was witnessed between Minister for Communications Aleem Khan and Senator Palwasha Khan last week during a meeting of the Senate Committee on Communications over a question related to the construction of a road project.

However, the responsible officials never responded, which subsequently led to this question being added to the agenda of the Senate’s Standing Committee.” Palwasha elaborated that she raised a question over a road built by the National Highway Authority and funded by the taxpayers’ money. “I asked whether it was built for public benefit or to give an advantage to a specific society.” “Raising questions on the utilisation of public resources is the fundamental duty of the legislators,” she added. “Time will decide who was at fault and who was subjected to injustice,” The senator said. PPP senator thanked her party leadership for “clearly” declaring that the party will never compromise on the “dignity of the parliamentarians and the democratic rights of lawmakers”. “A Senate committee is not a drawing room; it is the extension of the parliament in which everyone is answerable, where not the voice but the argument should be strong.” “Unfortunately, people mix up indecency and coarseness with courage,” she indicated. She further stated that the communication minister’s behaviour was neither “democratic” nor “up to the standards of parliament”. “The dignity comes through the practices, not the personalities.” She further said, “Politics is not a circus, but it has become one in our country. We will resist this.” The senator maintained that her party had always defended the dignity of the parliament, women’s rights and democratic values. “I am not against anyone,” she said. “However, PM Shehbaz Sharif has to consider the attitude of his cabinet members. It is a collective responsibility, and the PM is primarily responsible for it.” The senator further stated that “disrespecting women cannot become a routine“, and added that she would also release media which will ”further expose the minister“. She also demanded that the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) be constituted to conduct a forensic audit of all matters related to the Communications Ministry based on the revelations in the IMF report. The senator also lamented the conduct of the committee chairman for “not giving a ruling or interrupting”. Earlier, PPP leader Sherry Rehman had said that Aleem must apologise following his heated exchange with Palwasha. “He must apologise. I am not even going to say that it is necessary because she is a woman. She is due that basic right of respect as an honourable member of Parliament from a federal minister,” she said. PPP on Sunday also termed the verbal attacks by the minister “disappointing”. “Humiliation of a party woman is intolerable and the PPP will not sit silent on the matter,” he said. Without naming the minister, the PPP secretary general said: “The arrogance of power was speaking loudly. The sanctity of the (standing) committee was marred,” Mr Khan said.",

      "summary_en": "Pakistan Peoples Party Senator Palwasha Khan on Tuesday submitted a privilege motion in a Senate committee against Communications Minister Aleem Khan for reacting in a manner “highly unbecoming” to hold public office. A heated exchange was witnessed between Minister for Communications Aleem Khan and Senator Palwasha Khan last week during a meeting of the Senate Committee on Communications over a question related to the construction of a road project. Palwasha blamed Aleem for personal attacks as he reacted angrily to parliamentary scrutiny. “We will treat you the way we are treated,” Aleem had responded, saying that he cannot stand the allegations levelled against him.

      "summary_orig": "LAKKI MARWAT: Eight terrorists were killed in a search operation launched after five cops were martyred when their police mobile came under attack in Gurguri area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak on Tuesday. The district police spokesman, Shaukat Khan, confirmed the incident and the casualties, saying that all of the martyred personnel were constables. The martyred policemen were identified as constables Shahid Iqbal, Samiullah, Arif, Safdar and Muhammad Abrar, who was also the mobile’s driver, Khan added. He said that on the instructions of the Kohat Regional Police Office and the Karak district police officer, a joint operation between the Karak Police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) was launched in the area. “Eight terrorists were killed as they were pursued through tricky and mountainous terrain,” Khan said. “The bodies of the slain terrorists have been shifted to the hospital for a post-mortem, while the process of identifying them is underway.” While the exact details of the attack remain unclear, an image shared by the police spokesman showed what appeared to be the charred remains of the vehicle. Meanwhile, a press release from the Karak Police stated that funeral prayers had been offered for the five martyrs, who were presented with full honours. “In the funeral prayer ceremony, a decorated contingent of police offered a salute to the martyrs, while flowers were placed on the bodies of the martyrs wrapped in the national flag,” the press release read. Karak Police added that the funeral prayers were attended by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah and KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed, among other civilian and police officials. Karak Police offer funeral prayers for five personnel martyred in an attack on a police vehicle in Karak on December 23. — Photo courtesy Karak Police The CM and chief secretary “met the relatives of the martyrs, expressed their grief and sorrow and paid tribute to their great sacrifice”, the press release added. “The senior officers also assured the relatives of all possible cooperation, government benefits and welfare facilities.” The statement further said that IG stated that the martyred police personnel sacrificed their lives for the maintenance of law and order and the protection of the public, which will never be forgotten. He further clarified that the KP police would continue its fight against terrorism with full force, professionalism and determination, vowing retaliation for martyrs’ blood. CM Afridi was quoted as saying that the sacrifices of martyrs are expensive and that the police have always been on the front line in combating terrorism. He added that the government stands by the police, who are being provided with modern equipment. “Elements hostile to peace will not be forgiven under any circumstances. The sacrifices of the martyred police personnel are a source of pride not only for the police force but also for the entire nation, and their memories will always live on,” CM Afridi as quoted as saying. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the incident, expressing deep sorrow and grief over the lives lost and offering prayers for the martyred officers, according to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office. He extended his condolences to the bereaved families and assured them of the government’s full support during this difficult time. The prime minister paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police force, stating that police personnel had always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism and rendered “unparalleled” services to ensure peace and security in the country. “The entire nation salutes the martyrs who laid down their lives in the line of duty,” the prime minister said, adding that their sacrifices would never be forgotten. Reiterating the government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan remained fully committed to the complete elimination of terrorism in all its forms. Separately, district police spokesperson Asif Hassan told Dawn that an assistant sub-inspector, Rehmatullah, and a passerby were injured during an exchange of fire between police and wanted suspects in Lakki Marwat’s Tajori area. Today‘s attack on the vehicle is the latest in a series of incidents in which police personnel have been targeted in the province. Last week, a police official and his brother were martyred in a gun attack in KP’s Lakki Marwat. Earlier this month, a cop was martyred while five others were injured in a suicide blast targeting a police mobile in Lakki Marwat. In November, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in Hangu.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that he was reiterating his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. The proposition by the premier was made during a federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, where he referred to news reports of the opposition PTI and its “companions talking about dialogue“. He recalled that he had previously invited the opposition for talks on multiple occasions, including in the assembly. “If they are ready for this, the government of Pakistan is definitely ready,” he said, adding that harmony among all political parties was necessary for the progress and prosperity of the country. However, he continued, there should be no “blackmailing” under the guise of talks and dialogue could only move forward “in light of legitimate matters”. The need for dialogue between the government and the opposition has been stressed as Pakistan continues to face political and economic crises. On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. They were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before. The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence. This call for reconciliation among political actors was made at the Khawaja Rafique Shaheed reference in Lahore. Speaking on the occasion, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar urged a new national political charter rooted in tolerance and dialogue while PM’s Adviser Rana Sanaullah stressed that political stability could only be achieved through restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue. Recently, a similar proposal was also made by five PTI leaders currently incarcerated in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. In a letter, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed argued dialogue was the only viable path to steer the country out of its ongoing crises. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year. After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December 2024 to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations , the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024 , and the release of PTI prisoners. The Shehbaz government once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February this year as National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped. However, a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI. Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country. In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA. The PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue. More recently, Sadiq reiterated his offer on November 13 to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties. The offer was made by the speaker at a time when the opposition members belonging to the PTI were protesting in the assembly during the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill. He had again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on November 28 that dialogue was the way to resolve issues. On December 6, after a fiery speech in the Senate by a PTI-backed lawmaker, deploring the absence of rule of law and an unannounced ban on meetings with incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, the ruling party once again held out an olive branch to the PTI, reassuring it that all issues could be resolved through dialogue. Speaking in the upper house of parliament, Sana­ullah said the PTI had always rejected the path of negotiations, even though all issues could be reso­lved through dialogue rather than deadlock. He said the government was ready to hold a dialogue with the opposition to take the country forward, but the PTI leadership remained unwilling. Without naming the military establishment, the adviser to the premier said, “Those who they want [to have] dialogue [with] are not ready for talks with them.”",

      "summary_en": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that he was reiterating his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. The proposition by the premier was made during a federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, where he referred to news reports of the opposition PTI and its “companions talking about dialogue“. He recalled that he had previously invited the opposition for talks on multiple occasions, including in the assembly. “If they are ready for this, the government of Pakistan is definitely ready,” he said, adding that harmony among all political parties was necessary for the progress and prosperity of the country. However, he continued, there should be no “blackmailing” under the guise of talks and dialogue could only move forward “in light of legitimate matters”. The need for dialogue between the government and the opposition has been stressed as Pakistan continues to face political and economic crises. On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. They were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Proceedings in the controversial social media posts case against lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chatha took a tense turn on Tuesday as lawyers for the prosecution and defence nearly engaged in a physical altercation after a heated exchange during today’s hearing. A detailed cross-examination of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency’s (NCCIA) witnesses exposed procedural gaps and triggered heated exchanges inside the courtroom. The court began recording the statements of prosecution witnesses afresh last Tuesday in compliance with directives issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) the day prior, while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order. The hearing was conducted by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka at the District and Sessions Court in Islamabad, with the couple appearing along with their legal teams. During cross-examination, NCCIA Naib Qasid Afzal admitted that he did not have copies of his contract or service card and conceded that official letters received on October 16 and 20 did not mention the time of receipt. Chatha pointed out discrepancies between the signatures on official documents, raising questions about the authenticity of record-keeping. Another prosecution witness, Wasim, informed the court he had been a contract employee for the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for five years and had served with the NCCIA since its establishment. However, he admitted that he was carrying only an FIA service card and not an NCCIA card and that the USB provided by the investigating officer was not sealed. Wasim added that he had no written contract describing his job responsibilities and also stated he was unaware of any FIA circular barring the registration of first information reports (FIR) without prior notice. The most pointed exchange came during the cross-examination of technical expert Anis, who claimed to have prepared over 5,200 forensic reports and stated that he was the sole technical expert at NCCIA. He informed the court that his report was prepared using surface analysis techniques on seven screenshots and fourteen posts, based strictly on the scope letter issued by the investigating officer. Anis conceded that neither the complaint nor the scope letter mentioned the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), Manzoor Pashteen or Ali Wazir, and confirmed that the post under scrutiny dated back to October 31, 2021, while the cited individuals were declared proscribed in 2024. Despite this, he maintained that the accused were spreading a “state-hostile narrative” by referring to enforced disappearances — a position strongly contested by the defence. Chatha questioned whether references to enforced disappearances by the Supreme Court, high courts, cabinet members, or even former intelligence chiefs would also be considered anti-state. The witness declined to comment, stating such matters were outside his mandate and could only be assessed if presented to him as a case. Tempers flared when sharp remarks were exchanged between the prosecution and defence, resulting in an attempt at physical confrontation. Police intervened to restore order. Judge Majoka directed the prosecution to apologise for using inappropriate language and reminded both sides that objections must be addressed through the court. After a brief recess, further cross-examination revealed that dozens of other social media accounts had retweeted the same content, yet no investigation was conducted against them. The witness acknowledged that the scope of inquiry was limited to the accused. The court adjourned further proceedings till January 5, when cross-examination of the technical expert will resume. The controversy at the centre of the case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025, by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the NCCIA Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca). The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. Consequently, an inquiry was initiated, and following its conclusion on August 22, 2025, a first information report was registered against the two, alleging commission of offences under sections 9, 10, 11 and 26-A of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (PECA). They were indicted in the case on October 30. Last Thursday, the Supreme Court (SC) stayed trial proceedings against the couple until their pending appeals were decided by the Islamabad High Court (IHC). The court issued the directives as a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and comprising Justice Salahuddin Panwhar and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, heard Imaan’s appeal seeking to set aside the IHC’s Dec 1 order refusing to grant interim relief by staying the trial in the case.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh on Tuesday summoned India’s high commissioner in Dhaka to protest what it described as violent incidents targeting its diplomatic facilities in India, including vandalism at visa centres and protests outside its mission in New Delhi. Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it summoned Indian High Commissioner Pranay Verma to convey Dhaka’s grave concern over what it called “regrettable incidents” outside the Bangladesh High Commission and the ambassador’s residence in New Delhi on December 20, as well as vandalism at the Bangladesh Visa Centre in Siliguri on December 22 by “extremist elements.” The ministry condemned what it described as premeditated acts of violence and intimidation against diplomatic establishments. It said such acts not only “endanger the safety of diplomatic personnel but also undermine the principles of mutual respect and values of peace and tolerance.” Calling for a proper investigation, the ministry said: “Bangladesh expects the Government of India to immediately take appropriate steps in accordance with its international and diplomatic obligations to safeguard the dignity and security of diplomatic personnel and establishments.” According to Bangladeshi media, around 20 to 25 protesters had gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Saturday evening. According to mission officials, the protesters raised anti-Bangladesh slogans and issued threats against the Bangladesh high commissioner, Prothom Alo reported. India’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that the New Delhi demonstration consisted of “20-25 youths” who were dispersed by police after a few minutes, adding that India was “committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions”. Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also said that India had taken note of “misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident”. In response, the Bangldesh foreign ministry issued a statement, saying that the “unjustifiable incident at the Bangladesh High Commission residence in New Delhi on December 20 is highly regrettable and cannot be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’”. The tensions with India come as Bangladesh struggles to deal with domestic unrest over the death of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi, who was shot in the head while launching his campaign for February’s parliamentary election last week. His killing sparked widespread protests that spiralled into arson and vandalism targeting major media outlets and cultural institutions. Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star previously reported that around 100 protesters had gathered in the Chowhatta area and demanded that those responsible for Hadi‘s killing be brought to justice. “Addressing the gathering, protesters alleged that the killing had been carried out ‘at the behest of India’. Bangladesh has also halted all consular and visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi while the Indian Visa Application Centre in the Bangladeshi city of Chattogram has suspended its operations, citing security concerns at India’s mission there. Protests in India In another development connected to the tensions between the two countries, hundreds of people protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi today against the lynching of a Hindu man over allegations of blasphemy. Factory worker Dipu Chandra Das, 27, was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district last week by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). At least 10 people have been arrested in connection with his death. Tuesday’s demonstration, called by Hindu groups, involved people clashing with police personnel as they tried to push through barricades set up near the High Commission, television footage showed. They also chanted slogans and burnt pictures of Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, with some holding posters demanding “boycott Bangladesh”. “We needed to raise the voice of Hindus in Bangladesh in Delhi, and we have done that … as long as even one Hindu is being harmed there, we will be awake and will not stop,” a protester told broadcaster India Today. Demonstrations were also held in other parts of the country, as well as in India-occupied Kashmir.",

Political tensions in Albania have escalated in recent weeks after accusations were made against Deputy Prime Minister Belinda Balluku. Along with several officials and private companies, she has been accused of using state funds to favour some companies in major infrastructure projects. View this post on Instagram She referred to the accusations in parliament last month as “mudslinging, insinuations, half-truths and lies,” and stated that she would fully cooperate with the judiciary. The Special Prosecution Office, tasked with combating corruption and organised crime, has requested that parliament lift Balluku’s immunity this week and allow her arrest. It is not clear when the parliament, where Rama’s ruling party holds a majority, is expected to vote. As protesters threw petrol bombs on Monday, police in riot gear protected the government building but did not push back the protesters. “We have had enough because it’s a matter of tens and hundreds of millions of euros stolen, and she isn’t resigning. This is disgraceful,” said protester Arben Sulo. Balluku also heads the Ministry of Infrastructure, which manages hundreds of millions of euros in projects such as roads, bridges, and tunnels.",

Political tensions in Albania have escalated in recent weeks after accusations were made against Deputy Prime Minister Belinda Balluku. Along with several officials and private companies, she has been accused of using state funds to favour some companies in major infrastructure projects. View this post on Instagram She referred to the accusations in parliament last month as “mudslinging, insinuations, half-truths and lies,” and stated that she would fully cooperate with the judiciary. The Special Prosecution Office, tasked with combating corruption and organised crime, has requested that parliament lift Balluku’s immunity this week and allow her arrest. It is not clear when the parliament, where Rama’s ruling party holds a majority, is expected to vote.

This is disgraceful,” said protester Arben Sulo. Balluku also heads the Ministry of Infrastructure, which manages hundreds of millions of euros in projects such as roads, bridges, and tunnels.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump, who has now on several occasions in the past praised Chief of Defence Force and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, has now called him a “highly respected general”. The US president’s latest remarks came as he addressed a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. During the press conference, Trump announced a new class of heavily armed warships that will be named after himself — an honour usually reserved for leaders who have left office. Asked about the progress of talks between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said that his administration had so far “stopped eight wars” — a claim that he has repeated in the past. “We stopped a potential nuclear war between Pakistan and India,” Trump said. “The head of Pakistan and a highly respected general — he is a field marshal — and also the prime minister of Pakistan said that President Trump saved 10 million lives, maybe more, by getting that war [ sic ].” “You know, eight planes were shot down, the war was starting to rage,” he said. “We have solved many wars; the only one we have not solved yet is Russia and Ukraine,” the US president said. He noted that there was a lot of “hatred” between the two nations. This is the latest in a series of compliments that Trump has given to CDF Field Marshal Munir since their meeting in Washington in June. On June 19, he extended an unprecedented invitation to the army chief for a historic luncheon at the White House. The US president has since lauded Munir on several occasions, even referring to him as “my favourite field marshal”. On October 29, Trump praised CDF Field Marshal Munir, calling him a “great fighter” while talking about the Pakistan and India conflict in May. In his comments, he said: “I’m doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love, as you know, for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said. “Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the field marshal — they have a field marshal. You know why he’s a field marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy, too.” A day prior, he had lauded the role of the CDF in the ceasefire agreement following the May conflict. The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”. In November, he stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.",
