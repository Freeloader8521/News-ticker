      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said Iranians should continue nationwide protests and take over the country’s institutions. “Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING - TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Save the names of the killers and abusers. They will pay a big price. I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” Later, when asked what he meant by saying “help is on its way” to protesters in Iran, Trump told reporters that they would have to figure it out. “You’re going to have to figure that one out. I’m sorry,” Trump said in response to a question. On Monday, his Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that a channel for diplomacy with Tehran remained open, saying that Iran was taking a “far different tone” in private discussions with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff. Trump on Monday also announced a 25 per cent tariff on any country doing business with Iran. Following the US president’s post, Iranian security chief Ali Larijani said on social media platform X that Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were the “main killers” of the Iranian people. Russia condemns ‘subversive external interference’ Meanwhile, Russia on Tuesday condemned what it described as “subversive external interference” in Iran’s internal politics and said US threats of new military strikes against the country were “categorically unacceptable”. “Those who plan to use externally inspired unrest as a pretext for repeating the aggression against Iran committed in June 2025 must be aware of the disastrous consequences of such actions for the situation in the Middle East and global international security,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. Separately, Britain, France, Germany and Italy all summoned Iranian ambassadors in protest over the crackdown. “The brutal actions of the Iranian regime against its own people are shocking,” the German foreign ministry said on X. Underscoring international uncertainty over what comes next in Iran, which has been one of the dominant powers across the Middle East for decades, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he believed the government would fall. “I assume that we are now witnessing the final days and weeks of this regime,” he said, adding that if it had to maintain power through violence, “it is effectively at its end”. He did not expand on whether this forecast was based on intelligence or other assessments. Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi dismissed Merz’s criticisms, accusing Berlin of double standards and saying he had “obliterated any shred of credibility”.",

      "summary_orig": "Four terrorists were killed by security forces during an intelligence-based operation in Balochistan‘s Kalat district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Tuesday. In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on January 12 (Monday) security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. During the operation, security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, it said, adding that four terrorists were killed after an “intense fire exchange”. “Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the statement added. It stated that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. It added that the counterterrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces on the operation. In his statement posted by state broadcaster PTV on X, PM Shehbaz said security forces were achieving notable successes in their fight against terrorism under Azm-e-Istehkam. “The whole nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the fight against terrorism,“ he said, reaffirming Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. In a press conference last week, the Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025. Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.",

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on January 12 (Monday) security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. During the operation, security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, it said, adding that four terrorists were killed after an “intense fire exchange”. “Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the statement added. It stated that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. It added that the counterterrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces on the operation. In his statement posted by state broadcaster PTV on X, PM Shehbaz said security forces were achieving notable successes in their fight against terrorism under Azm-e-Istehkam. “The whole nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the fight against terrorism,“ he said, reaffirming Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. In a press conference last week, the Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025. Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.",

      "title_orig": "WWF-Pakistan says removal of trees in Islamabad also linked to infrastructure development",
      "summary_orig": "WWF-Pakistan on Tuesday disputed Islamabad authorities’ stance that paper mulberry trees were removed in the capital for causing allergies, stating that the action was also linked to infrastructure development. Recently, large-scale tree removal took place in at least three locations in the federal capital, including acres of tree cover around Shakarparian. Islamabad’s Capital Development Authority (CDA) has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed as they had been causing pollen allergies , and earlier on Tuesday Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry assured lawmakers that more trees would be planted in the coming months. “WWF-Pakistan’s field assessments indicate that vegetation loss in the capital is not limited to Paper Mulberry management alone, but is also linked to infrastructure development in multiple locations,” the environmental body said on social media. “Beyond pollen and allergies, Islamabad’s recent tree removal reflects broader challenges in urban planning,” it added. Social media users and even some lawmakers have alleged that, besides paper mulberry, old indigenous trees were also chopped down. Responding to those queries in the National Assembly on Tuesday, Chaudhry explained there were “three possible reasons” for removing the trees: the presence of paper mulberry species; areas designated as brown zones in Islamabad’s Master Plan but commonly regarded as green until development began, including Embassy Road; and sectors also considered as green areas until they were built. “I am saying with utmost responsibility that no other species was removed,” he asserted, about the claims of other species besides the paper mulberry being cut. In its Facebook post, WWF-Pakistan noted: “Urban trees play a critical role in soil stability, climate regulation, and biodiversity support. “Any tree removal must follow evidence-based planning, legal compliance, and clear restoration commitments to ensure long-term ecological balance,” it demanded. The environmental organisation also shared a report that consolidated findings from its “field inspections on tree-cutting and land-clearing activities in Islamabad with key policy, health, and ecological considerations related to the ongoing removal of paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) and cutting of trees for [sic] construction of infrastructure”. “Between December 2025 and January 2026, extensive tree cutting and land clearing activities were widely reported through social and formal media across multiple locations in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), including Shakarparian, Lok Virsa, the National Museum precinct, the Islamabad Expressway (H-8), and the Margalla Enclave Link Road near the National Institutes of Health (NIH),” WWF-Pakistan stated. A photo of a piece of land selectively cleared opposite the National Museum in Shakarparian.. —  Photo courtesy WWF-Pakistan It added that “several” of these activities were associated with “major infrastructure development works, including road construction and monument-related projects, resulting in large-scale clearance of trees and natural vegetation”. Subsequently, WWF-Pakistan carried out field verification to “assess the nature, scale, and underlying drivers of these activities, and to distinguish between vegetation removal linked to infrastructure development and that undertaken for public-health purposes”. The report noted that paper mulberry has been identified by environmental and medical experts as a “major contributor to seasonal pollen allergies in Islamabad, causing allergic rhinitis, asthma, and related respiratory issues”. “Under directives from the Prime Minister’s Office and public health authorities, CDA launched a structured programme to systematically remove this species from parks, greenbelts and public spaces,” it recalled. WWF-Pakistan found: “Overall, field evidence and available documentation indicate that while a significant portion of tree removal across Islamabad is associated with the paper mulberry eradication programme driven by public-health considerations, substantial vegetation loss has also resulted from infrastructure development, particularly along the H-8 Islamabad Expressway (proposed monument site) and the Margalla Enclave Link Road. “At the H-8 site alone, infrastructure-related land clearing has resulted in an estimated net loss of approximately five hectares of urban tree and vegetation cover.” While noting that reforestation and compensatory plantation efforts were reportedly underway at several locations, the report said their “visibility, consistency, and ecological design, especially at infrastructure sites, remain unclear”. “The long-term ecological success of these interventions will therefore depend on transparent decision-making, clear and site-specific restoration planning, prioritisation of native species, and independent monitoring to ensure that Islamabad’s green character and ecological integrity are effectively safeguarded,” it concluded. As per the report, “official sources” indicated that more than 29,000 paper mulberry trees have been removed city-wide, including from Shakarparian, Fatima Jinnah Park (F-9), and greenbelts along Park Road and the H-8 Expressway. Paper mulberry a ‘highly invasive species’ In a separate research paper dated Monday, WWF-Pakistan Forest Director Muhammad Ibrahim Khan proposed a “science-based strategy for gradual removal and replacement of paper mulberry” in ICT. Citing various previous research, the official noted that paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) was a “non-native, highly invasive species in Islamabad and Rawalpindi that has aggressively colonised natural vegetation pockets, from the Margalla foothills and associated nullahs to urban and peri-urban sectors”. An image of felled trees in Islamabad. — Photo courtesy WWF-Pakistan He not only acknowledged the species’ “well-documented role” in pollen allergies, but also pointed out that it “suppresses native tree regeneration, ground flora and associated wildlife habitats through rapid growth, dense canopy formation, and allelopathic effects”. The paper further said that paper mulberry’s complete eradication was “ecologically impractical and technically unrealistic” due to its regeneration abilities. Expressing ecological concerns, the paper stated: “Sudden, large-scale removal, especially uprooting, risks soil disturbance, erosion, loss of understorey vegetation, and displacement of urban wildlife. “Indiscriminate felling may also unintentionally remove native species and mixed natural growth, further degrading ecological integrity and ecosystem services.” The WWF-Pakistan official called for all activities to be guided by “site-specific ecological assessments and legally compliant Environmental Impact Assessments where applicable”. “Public disclosure of species removed, species planted, and survival outcomes is essential to maintain transparency and public trust,” it added.",

The environmental organisation also shared a report that consolidated findings from its “field inspections on tree-cutting and land-clearing activities in Islamabad with key policy, health, and ecological considerations related to the ongoing removal of paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) and cutting of trees for [sic] construction of infrastructure”. “Between December 2025 and January 2026, extensive tree cutting and land clearing activities were widely reported through social and formal media across multiple locations in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), including Shakarparian, Lok Virsa, the National Museum precinct, the Islamabad Expressway (H-8), and the Margalla Enclave Link Road near the National Institutes of Health (NIH),” WWF-Pakistan stated. A photo of a piece of land selectively cleared opposite the National Museum in Shakarparian.. —  Photo courtesy WWF-Pakistan It added that “several” of these activities were associated with “major infrastructure development works, including road construction and monument-related projects, resulting in large-scale clearance of trees and natural vegetation”. Subsequently, WWF-Pakistan carried out field verification to “assess the nature, scale, and underlying drivers of these activities, and to distinguish between vegetation removal linked to infrastructure development and that undertaken for public-health purposes”. The report noted that paper mulberry has been identified by environmental and medical experts as a “major contributor to seasonal pollen allergies in Islamabad, causing allergic rhinitis, asthma, and related respiratory issues”. “Under directives from the Prime Minister’s Office and public health authorities, CDA launched a structured programme to systematically remove this species from parks, greenbelts and public spaces,” it recalled. WWF-Pakistan found: “Overall, field evidence and available documentation indicate that while a significant portion of tree removal across Islamabad is associated with the paper mulberry eradication programme driven by public-health considerations, substantial vegetation loss has also resulted from infrastructure development, particularly along the H-8 Islamabad Expressway (proposed monument site) and the Margalla Enclave Link Road. “At the H-8 site alone, infrastructure-related land clearing has resulted in an estimated net loss of approximately five hectares of urban tree and vegetation cover.” While noting that reforestation and compensatory plantation efforts were reportedly underway at several locations, the report said their “visibility, consistency, and ecological design, especially at infrastructure sites, remain unclear”. “The long-term ecological success of these interventions will therefore depend on transparent decision-making, clear and site-specific restoration planning, prioritisation of native species, and independent monitoring to ensure that Islamabad’s green character and ecological integrity are effectively safeguarded,” it concluded. As per the report, “official sources” indicated that more than 29,000 paper mulberry trees have been removed city-wide, including from Shakarparian, Fatima Jinnah Park (F-9), and greenbelts along Park Road and the H-8 Expressway. Paper mulberry a ‘highly invasive species’ In a separate research paper dated Monday, WWF-Pakistan Forest Director Muhammad Ibrahim Khan proposed a “science-based strategy for gradual removal and replacement of paper mulberry” in ICT. Citing various previous research, the official noted that paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) was a “non-native, highly invasive species in Islamabad and Rawalpindi that has aggressively colonised natural vegetation pockets, from the Margalla foothills and associated nullahs to urban and peri-urban sectors”. An image of felled trees in Islamabad. — Photo courtesy WWF-Pakistan He not only acknowledged the species’ “well-documented role” in pollen allergies, but also pointed out that it “suppresses native tree regeneration, ground flora and associated wildlife habitats through rapid growth, dense canopy formation, and allelopathic effects”. The paper further said that paper mulberry’s complete eradication was “ecologically impractical and technically unrealistic” due to its regeneration abilities. Expressing ecological concerns, the paper stated: “Sudden, large-scale removal, especially uprooting, risks soil disturbance, erosion, loss of understorey vegetation, and displacement of urban wildlife. “Indiscriminate felling may also unintentionally remove native species and mixed natural growth, further degrading ecological integrity and ecosystem services.” The WWF-Pakistan official called for all activities to be guided by “site-specific ecological assessments and legally compliant Environmental Impact Assessments where applicable”. “Public disclosure of species removed, species planted, and survival outcomes is essential to maintain transparency and public trust,” it added.",
      "title": "WWF-Pakistan says removal of trees in Islamabad also linked to infrastructure development",
      "summary": "WWF-Pakistan on Tuesday disputed Islamabad authorities’ stance that paper mulberry trees were removed in the capital for causing allergies, stating that the action was also linked to infrastructure development. Recently, large-scale tree removal took place in at least three locations in the federal capital, including acres of tree cover around Shakarparian. Islamabad’s Capital Development Authority (CDA) has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed as they had been causing pollen allergies , and earlier on Tuesday Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry assured lawmakers that more trees would be planted in the coming months. “WWF-Pakistan’s field assessments indicate that vegetation loss in the capital is not limited to Paper Mulberry management alone, but is also linked to infrastructure development in multiple locations,” the environmental body said on social media. “Beyond pollen and allergies, Islamabad’s recent tree removal reflects broader challenges in urban planning,” it added. Social media users and even some lawmakers have alleged that, besides paper mulberry, old indigenous trees were also chopped down. Responding to those queries in the National Assembly on Tuesday, Chaudhry explained there were “three possible reasons” for removing the trees: the presence of paper mulberry species; areas designated as brown zones in Islamabad’s Master Plan but commonly regarded as green until development began, including Embassy Road; and sectors also considered as green areas until they were built. “I am saying with utmost responsibility that no other species was removed,” he asserted, about the claims of other species besides the paper mulberry being cut.

The outage began around 9 am ET, peaking at more than 28,300 logged issues with Elon Musk’s platform in the US before cooling to about 700 reports, according to Downdetector. In the UK, reports fell to roughly 130 from a high of more than 8,000, while Canada saw issues decline after topping 3,200 earlier in the day, according to the website that tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources. In Pakistan, complaints peaked at 93 at 7:38pm, falling to four by 8:23pm. This image shows X outages reported by Pakistani users. — Photo courtesy Downdetector The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on what caused the outage. The actual number of affected users may differ from what is shown on Downdetector, as the reports are submitted by users. In November 2025, a Cloudflare outage had briefly prevented access to X after a faulty security configuration crashed its traffic system. A few days later, a separate disruption took X offline for thousands of US users. On March 10 last year, users in Pakistan and around the world experienced an outage on X. At the time, platform owner Elon Musk said the disruption was the result of a cyberattack.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump announced a 25 per cent tariff on any country doing business with Iran, ramping up pressure as a crackdown on protests continues. Trump, who has repeatedly threatened Iran with military intervention, said in a social media post on Monday that the new levies would “immediately” hit the Islamic republic’s trading partners who also do business with the United States. “This Order is final and conclusive,” he wrote, without specifying who they will affect. Iran’s main trading partners are China, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, according to economic database Trading Economics. Trump has been mulling his options on Iran, which has been roiled by more than two weeks of demonstrations that have defied a near-total internet blackout and lethal force. Sparked by economic grievances, the nationwide protests have grown into one of the biggest challenges yet to the theocratic system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution ousted the shah. Iranian authorities have blamed foreign interference for stoking the unrest and staged their own nationwide counter-rallies. A map of Iran showing the locations of protests as posted on social media. — Reuters Rights groups warned that the severed communications were aimed at masking a rising death toll. The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said the internet shutdown has made it “extremely difficult to independently verify reports” of casualties. “The international community has a duty to protect civilian protesters against mass killing by the Islamic republic,” said IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam. The White House said on Monday that Trump remained “unafraid” to deploy military force against Iran, but was pursuing diplomacy as a first resort. US asks its citizens to leave Iran The State Department asked US-Iranian dual nationals to “exit Iran on Iranian passports”. “The Iranian government does not recognise dual nationality and will treat US-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens,” the advisory said, adding that US nationals face “significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran”. “Showing a US passport or demonstrating connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone,” added the State Department. “The US government cannot guarantee your safety if you choose to depart using the following options. You should leave only if you believe it is safe to do so.” China opposes Trump’s tariff threat China said late on Monday that it opposed “any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction” after Trump announced the 25pc tariff on US trade. “China’s position against the indiscriminate imposition of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff wars and trade wars have no winners, and coercion and pressure cannot solve problems,” a spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Washington said on X. “China firmly opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.” ‘Four-front war’ Iran on Monday sought to regain control of the streets with mass nationwide rallies that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protest movement was defeated. In power since 1989 and now 86, Khamenei said the pro-government turnout was a “warning” to the United States. “These massive rallies, full of determination, have thwarted the plan of foreign enemies that were supposed to be carried out by domestic mercenaries,” he said, according to state TV, referring to pro-government demonstrations. In the capital Tehran, state TV showed people brandishing the national flag and prayers read for victims of what the government has termed “riots”. At Enghelab (Revolution) Square, parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told the crowd that Iran was fighting a “four-front war”, listing economic war, psychological war, “military war” with the US and Israel, and “today a war against terrorists” — a reference to the protests. Flanked by the slogans “Death to Israel, Death to America” in Persian, he vowed the Iranian military would teach Trump “an unforgettable lesson” if attacked. But Trump said on Sunday that Iran’s leadership had called him seeking “to negotiate”. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran that Iran was “not seeking war but is fully prepared for war”, while calling for “fair” negotiations. Foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said a channel of communication was open between Araghchi and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff despite the lack of diplomatic relations. Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah who has been vocal in calling for protests, told CBS News the government was “trying to trick the world into thinking that [it] is ready to negotiate once again”. He said Trump was “a man that means what he says and says what he means” and who “knows what’s at stake”. “The red line that was drawn has been definitely surpassed by this regime.” ‘Respect for their rights’ State outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning in Tehran, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic. Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”. Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies. The government has declared three days of national mourning for those killed. The European Union has voiced support for the protesters and on Monday said it was “looking into” imposing additional sanctions on Iran over the repression of demonstrations. The European Parliament also announced it had banned all Iranian diplomats and representatives from the assembly’s premises. French President Emmanuel Macron issued a statement condemning “the state violence that indiscriminately targets Iranian women and men who courageously demand respect for their rights”. Tehran ally Russia, for its part, slammed what it called attempts by “foreign powers” to interfere in Iran, state media reported, in Moscow’s first reaction to the protests.",

In power since 1989 and now 86, Khamenei said the pro-government turnout was a “warning” to the United States. “These massive rallies, full of determination, have thwarted the plan of foreign enemies that were supposed to be carried out by domestic mercenaries,” he said, according to state TV, referring to pro-government demonstrations. In the capital Tehran, state TV showed people brandishing the national flag and prayers read for victims of what the government has termed “riots”. At Enghelab (Revolution) Square, parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told the crowd that Iran was fighting a “four-front war”, listing economic war, psychological war, “military war” with the US and Israel, and “today a war against terrorists” — a reference to the protests. Flanked by the slogans “Death to Israel, Death to America” in Persian, he vowed the Iranian military would teach Trump “an unforgettable lesson” if attacked. But Trump said on Sunday that Iran’s leadership had called him seeking “to negotiate”. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran that Iran was “not seeking war but is fully prepared for war”, while calling for “fair” negotiations. Foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said a channel of communication was open between Araghchi and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff despite the lack of diplomatic relations. Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah who has been vocal in calling for protests, told CBS News the government was “trying to trick the world into thinking that [it] is ready to negotiate once again”. He said Trump was “a man that means what he says and says what he means” and who “knows what’s at stake”. “The red line that was drawn has been definitely surpassed by this regime.” ‘Respect for their rights’ State outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning in Tehran, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic. Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”. Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies. The government has declared three days of national mourning for those killed. The European Union has voiced support for the protesters and on Monday said it was “looking into” imposing additional sanctions on Iran over the repression of demonstrations. The European Parliament also announced it had banned all Iranian diplomats and representatives from the assembly’s premises. French President Emmanuel Macron issued a statement condemning “the state violence that indiscriminately targets Iranian women and men who courageously demand respect for their rights”. Tehran ally Russia, for its part, slammed what it called attempts by “foreign powers” to interfere in Iran, state media reported, in Moscow’s first reaction to the protests.",

      "summary_orig": "Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon on Tuesday assailed the PTI for not honouring commitments made in preparation for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s recent Sindh visit. Memon’s comments come a day after the KP CM concluded his visit to the province. On Monday, the chief minister decried the treatment of him and his entourage in Karachi, saying that the provincial government had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi . Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Memon expressed his view that the PTI “did not care for the respect they had been accorded during the visit”. “We do not care about their speeches; however, violations were committed, and all they did was blame the Sindh government.” Addressing the events that transpired during the KP CM’s visit, Memon said that the Sindh government was in contact with representatives from the KP government, and the two had “chalked out” the schedule for the visit. Memon maintained that the PTI “violated every commitment they made earlier”. “There was a threat alert issued as well by security institutions; we did not disclose it to the public; however, the KP government was informed,” the minister said. He said that, keeping in view the security situation, Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah assured the delegation of protection and facilities, but he urged them “not to engage in anything that disrupts daily life and puts the safety of the delegation at risk”. Memon recalled: “The first day, they were informed by Nasir Shah sahib to stay clear of certain areas, considering the threat, yet in the evening, they were seen in the District South“. The Sindh minister further told the media, “Security plans are pre-decided before any such events […] to prevent any unfortunate incidents”. “When they went to Hyderabad, they took an unapproved route on their way back to Karachi,” he added, contrary to Afridi’s claims of his convoy being forced to take such a route due to roadblocks. The minister detailed that the PTI delegation took the route of the Hyderabad Bridge, where Memon said the delegation “got stuck in traffic for a couple of hours”. Nasir had also refuted Afridi’s claims, saying that police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”. On Afridi’s planned meeting with Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah, which the PTI said had been scheduled for January 12 but did not take place, Memon claimed that the KP CM House decided the meeting’s time by themselves, without consulting the other side. However, as CM Murad had other important meetings already scheduled, it was conveyed to the KP CM House that Memon could meet wherever Afridi wished to “if there were any important issues to discuss”. When asked about the PTI’s stance on the meeting being cancelled by the Sindh CM House, Memon said it was “full of lies”. The minister also disputed the PTI’s claims that the gates of Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah had been locked despite the permission for the party to hold a rally. Memon asserted that the ground did not even have gates in the first place. He added, “If there are police mobiles inside the ground, they are present there to provide security.” The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue , saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid. Finally, CM Afridi briefly addressed hundreds near Mazar-i-Quaid. ‘Attempt to recreate May 9 events’ Memon further alleged that a “very dangerous attempt was made to recreate the events of May 9, 2023 in Karachi”, mentioning the vandalism of media vehicles on January 11. He asserted that the provincial government and police displayed “patience” while dealing with the situation. The minister recalled that in Hyderabad, the PTI began “criticising the Sindh government again and started name-calling”, apparently referring to CM Afridi’s comment about President Asif Ali Zardari. “What do you think the Sindh government is going to gain if you get stuck in traffic for a few hours? What benefit will we get out of this teasing?” the minister questioned. “If our behaviour had been similar to that of PTI in the past, we would not have welcomed them at all,“ Memon added. “You (PTI) were planning to cause mischief […] we told them that ‘please only do what has already been approved’,” the senior minister said. Memon said that the Sindh government gave PTI “full assurances and facilitated them”, but they took “unfair advantage” of it. He further asserted that no “wheel-jamming“ will be allowed on February 8, when asked about the KP CM‘s reported remarks to “bring the entire country to a halt” as part of the PTI’s protest plan .",

      "title_orig": "Over 29,000 trees removed in Islamabad; Talal Chaudhry says more to be planted",
      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on Tuesday informed irked lawmakers in the National Assembly that 29,115 trees had been removed from the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), but that more than this number would be planted in the coming months. In the past few days, there has been widespread criticism over the cutting of thousands of mature trees in various locations of the federal capital, including the levelling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian. PTI MNA Riaz Fatyana moved a calling attention notice on the tree-cutting in the federal capital and the public concern it was causing. Responding to him, Chaudhry said 29,115 trees have been removed, while “40,000 trees of more than 8-10 feet have been planted”. He added that another 60,000 trees will be planted in the same areas on March 30, when the weather will be more suitable for planting. The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed, as they had been causing pollen allergy . However, social media users had alleged that, besides paper mulberry, indigenous trees were also chopped down, making Shakarparian look like barren land. Climate Change Minister Musadiq Malik has defended the move , stating that paper mulberry was an invasive and “life-threatening” species. Speaking in the NA, Chaudhry acknowledged that it was a matter of high importance and had been under discussion in the media for many days. He explained that there were “three possible reasons” for removing the trees: the presence of paper mulberry species; areas designated as brown zones in Islamabad’s Master Plan but commonly regarded as green until development began, including Embassy Road; and sectors also considered green areas until they were built. He invited the house and the journalists to assess the green areas based on the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) process, adding that the responsible authorities would be answerable if greenery is reduced or green areas are converted into brown. “Greenery declined till 2020, but the data from 2023-2025 shows that the percentage of greenery has increased compared to before,” the state minister said. Chaudhry also called for it “not to be made a fashion to make Islamabad the target of criticism or personally hit the CDA chairman”. He added that the decisions were not made by any one person, but taken under a policy. On the criticism of infrastructure projects based on the argument that trees had to be cut for them, Chaudhry offered to give an on-ground briefing to parliamentarians and journalists on all such projects carried out under the current government. “If any tree was removed, mature trees four times that number were planted,” he asserted. On the reason for removing the paper mulberry species, Chaudhry highlighted that “by-air seeding” was carried out during Islamabad’s initial development to add greenery. “Over time, it became evident that some of these species were hazardous to health, causing allergies and other issues,” he said. The state minister recalled the Islamabad High Court’s 2009 order to speed up the eradication of paper mulberry trees to mitigate pollen allergies, and the formation of a committee in 2020 to ensure environmental protection in the capital. He also cited a Supreme Court order from 2024, its suo-motu notice and the subsequent involvement of two forest experts regarding the removal of paper mulberry trees from the F-9 Park. As a result, a standard operating procedure (SOP) was determined wherein a survey of the tree species and numbers is first conducted, followed by a public hearing, before proceeding to felling the trees. Responding to a query by Fatyana, Chaudhry said, “We have not earned money by removing trees”. Instead, he added, money has been spent to remove trees harmful to health, as the roots of the paper mulberry species also need to be taken out. “I am saying with utmost responsibility that no other species was removed,” he asserted. PPP, PTI lawmakers raise concerns over ‘large-scale’ tree-cutting Reacting to Chaudhry’s explanation, PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui said he had “attempted to justify the mass-cutting of trees, but nowhere in the world trees were felled on such a vast scale due to health issues, or pollen allergy from paper mulberry trees”. She cited Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States as examples, stating that “targeted control” was employed there to get rid of saplings. “There is a kingship. You stood up and said to root out the Green Belt because you suddenly realised that it was causing pollen allergy. It does not happen like this; there is a procedure,” Faruqui said. She claimed that “huge mature trees” were cut down, adding: “This is no justification that you remove the entire Green Belt and say ‘we have planted four saplings’. Those four saplings would not grow up even in 50 years.” Responding to her, Chaudhry said, “If you want to solve the issue, then stop point-scoring.” He declared: “We will be responsible if the green area has decreased due to any mega-project, development, or court order.” The state minister asserted there was “no kingship” and a proper process was followed. MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar said he agreed with “most of” what Chaudhry said, but insisted that “many old trees” were also cut down, which gravely saddened the public. “It was definitely needed for development, but then they should come forward and announce proactively how many trees we are planting in their place,” he said. Speaking on points of order in the NA before Chaudhry’s explanation, PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan and PPP’s Shazia Marri also raised the issue of tree-cutting in Islamabad. Ali said that if the interior ministry, the Islamabad administration or the climate change ministry had cut the trees “after taking the citizens of Islamabad into confidence, there would not have been mistrust in them”. “The nearly 40,000 trees you have cut are the lungs of Islamabad,” the PTI lawmaker added. He further urged the relevant authorities to plant 100 saplings in the spring for each tree cut down. Ali questioned why “50 to 60-year-old trees” were also removed if only paper mulberry trees were being replaced. Marri also raised her party’s concerns over the “large-scale tree-cutting in Islamabad”. “Whether it is Shakarparian, F-9, or other areas, reports are emerging that thousands of trees are being cut,” she said. The PPP lawmaker added, “Even if you are justifying it that a specific species harmful to the environment is being cut, but why are they running away from accountability?” Marri demanded the “actual truth” and the figures on the tree plantation being carried out to make up for it. She recommended that the matter be referred to the NA’s Standing Committee for Climate Change for further debate. Unanimous resolution urges govt to probe documented passengers’ offloading Separately, the NA unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the government probe the offloading of documented passengers at various airports across the country. Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. PPP MNA Agha Rafiullah moves a resolution before the National Assembly on Jan 13, 2026. — screengrab via YouTube/NaofPakistan PPP MNA Agha Rafiullah moved a resolution before the NA today, stating that the “government should take immediate steps to investigate the off-loading of documented passengers at various airports”. The resolution also urged the government to recommend “administrative reforms to ensure transparency, accountability and the protection of passenger rights, while improving communication so that all off-loading decisions are lawful and properly documented”. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then moved the resolution for voting, which received no opposition and was subsequently passed unanimously. Speaking later on a point of order, PPP’s Marri termed the offloading of travellers a “very important” issue. “People going abroad for work or education as a result of a good offer, especially with all their complete documents, now have so much fear because of these actions.” She noted the “demeanour adopted with them despite them having complete documents”, urging the government to take action on the matter. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had linked the offloading incidents to a crackdown on migrant smuggling by denying travel to those with incomplete documents. In mid-December, growing public fury prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to finally take notice of the issue and form a “special committee” to look into the matter. Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi issued orders to the FIA for the strict screening of travel documents at airports. In the first week of December, Naqvi had said that 50–70 passengers were being offloaded daily from flights to protect the country’s passport reputation, which, at an average of 60 per day, comes to fewer than 22,000 in a year. However, official figures showed that the actual number of offloaded passengers in 2025 was three times higher, at 66,000. According to FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar Raja, 51,000 of the 66,000 passengers offloaded this year were stopped by the FIA for insufficient or unverified documentation.",

PPP MNA Agha Rafiullah moves a resolution before the National Assembly on Jan 13, 2026. — screengrab via YouTube/NaofPakistan PPP MNA Agha Rafiullah moved a resolution before the NA today, stating that the “government should take immediate steps to investigate the off-loading of documented passengers at various airports”. The resolution also urged the government to recommend “administrative reforms to ensure transparency, accountability and the protection of passenger rights, while improving communication so that all off-loading decisions are lawful and properly documented”. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then moved the resolution for voting, which received no opposition and was subsequently passed unanimously. Speaking later on a point of order, PPP’s Marri termed the offloading of travellers a “very important” issue. “People going abroad for work or education as a result of a good offer, especially with all their complete documents, now have so much fear because of these actions.” She noted the “demeanour adopted with them despite them having complete documents”, urging the government to take action on the matter. The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had linked the offloading incidents to a crackdown on migrant smuggling by denying travel to those with incomplete documents. In mid-December, growing public fury prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to finally take notice of the issue and form a “special committee” to look into the matter. Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi issued orders to the FIA for the strict screening of travel documents at airports. In the first week of December, Naqvi had said that 50–70 passengers were being offloaded daily from flights to protect the country’s passport reputation, which, at an average of 60 per day, comes to fewer than 22,000 in a year. However, official figures showed that the actual number of offloaded passengers in 2025 was three times higher, at 66,000. According to FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar Raja, 51,000 of the 66,000 passengers offloaded this year were stopped by the FIA for insufficient or unverified documentation.",

      "summary_orig": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Pakistan on Tuesday agreed to sign a formal agreement on “pre-immigration clearance” for Pakistani nationals visiting the Gulf country, said a statement by the Ministry of Interior. The agreement, when signed, will enable Pakistani nationals to bypass lengthy immigration processes upon arrival in the UAE. The decision was made in a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and a delegation from the UAE, led by Director General of Customs and Port Security Ahmed Bin Lahij Al Falasi, the press release said. “The immigration process for the passengers will be completed in Pakistan before travel,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. He added that with the implementation of the system, Pakistani nationals will be able to bypass lengthy immigration processes upon arrival in the UAE. “They will be able to exit the airport directly like domestic passengers,” said Naqvi. The interior minister detailed that the system will be launched as a pilot project, with the first phase set to begin in Karachi. He did not mention any date for the commencement of the pilot project. Naqvi voiced optimism that the new system will “facilitate travel and improve the overall travel experience”. The UAE delegation vowed to cooperate during the implementation of the initiative, labelling it as “beneficial” for both countries. “Relevant authorities will coordinate with each other to finalise the administrative and technical aspects of the pilot project,” the statement read. It added that after the pilot phase in Karachi, the system will be expanded to other cities as well. Also present at the meeting were Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Federal Secretary for Interior Khurram Agha. Restrictions on UAE visas The development comes as Pakistanis, in the past year, have faced increased difficulties in obtaining visas to the UAE. In November 2025, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry said that the UAE had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis. The additional secretary made this revelation during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, further stating that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”. Visa rejections were also faced by Pakistani citizens in early July last year, which prompted Naqvi to raise the issue with his UAE counterpart. In a meeting held the same month, the UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “ full support ” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens as the Pakistani minister sought “relaxation in visa policies”. The UAE Ambassador to Pakistan, Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi, in April had also announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa. The announcement came after the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, in January 2025, was told that some visas to the UAE had been “ unofficially closed ”. Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig had said the above, adding that the UAE government had reservations that Pakistanis on “visit visas, not work visas”, resort to begging in the country. However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, had said there were “ no restrictions on work visas ” for Pakistanis travelling to the Gulf country.",

      "summary_orig": "Beijing has rejected New Delhi’s claim over the Shaksgam valley in Kashmir and said that the territory “belongs to China”. At a press conference on Monday, when asked by the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) for comment on the Indian criticism of China’s infrastructure development projects in the Shaksgam valley, China‘s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that it was “fully justified” for China to conduct infrastructure construction “on its own territory”. “The territory you mentioned belongs to China,” she said. India’s foreign ministry spokesperson had on Friday said that it reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests as the Shaksgam valley was “an Indian territory”. “We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement that happened in 1963. We have consistently maintained that the agreement is illegal and invalid,” he said at a press conference in response to a question from India’s state-owned public television broadcaster Doordashan . The Indian spokesperson added that New Delhi also does not “recognise the so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor”. “The entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India,” he maintained, adding, “This has been clearly conveyed to Pakistani and the Chinese authorities several times”. He added that India had “consistently protested with the Chinese side against attempts to alter the ground reality in Shaksgam Valley”. Mao Ning, in response to the Indian foreign ministry spokesperson’s comments, said that China and Pakistan had in the 1960s signed a boundary agreement and delimited the boundary between the two countries, terming it “the right of China and Pakistan as sovereign countries”. “The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as an economic cooperation initiative, aims at promoting local socio-economic development and improving people’s livelihood,” she said. “The China-Pakistan boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue and the position remains unchanged.” India and China have long clashed over border disputes, but had reached a milestone pact in 2024 on lowering military tensions on their Himalayan border, which escalated after a military clash in 2020 in which 20 soldiers from India and four from China were killed. Since the pact in 2024, the two countries have taken steps to improve relations, including a resumption of direct flights and enhanced investment and trade flows. However, Beijing and New Delhi continue to spar over territory, including Arunachal Pradesh , which Beijing calls Zangnan and says is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed. Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi.",

The Indian spokesperson added that New Delhi also does not “recognise the so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor”. “The entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India,” he maintained, adding, “This has been clearly conveyed to Pakistani and the Chinese authorities several times”. He added that India had “consistently protested with the Chinese side against attempts to alter the ground reality in Shaksgam Valley”. Mao Ning, in response to the Indian foreign ministry spokesperson’s comments, said that China and Pakistan had in the 1960s signed a boundary agreement and delimited the boundary between the two countries, terming it “the right of China and Pakistan as sovereign countries”. “The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as an economic cooperation initiative, aims at promoting local socio-economic development and improving people’s livelihood,” she said. “The China-Pakistan boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue and the position remains unchanged.” India and China have long clashed over border disputes, but had reached a milestone pact in 2024 on lowering military tensions on their Himalayan border, which escalated after a military clash in 2020 in which 20 soldiers from India and four from China were killed. Since the pact in 2024, the two countries have taken steps to improve relations, including a resumption of direct flights and enhanced investment and trade flows. However, Beijing and New Delhi continue to spar over territory, including Arunachal Pradesh , which Beijing calls Zangnan and says is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed. Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Despite the passage of about three months, law enforcement agencies (LEAs) remain in the dark about the whereabouts of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Hussain Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi. The issue resurfaced a couple of days ago, after an alleged statement attributed to the proscribed religious outfit surfaced, claiming that both were “in the custody of agencies”. However, senior law enforcement officials are sticking to their earlier stance, maintaining that the two are hiding somewhere in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). They said the Rizvi brothers had fled on the day the Punjab police launched a pre-dawn operation in Muridke to dismantle the TLP protest camp along G.T. Road. “I give you my word that they are not in the custody of any security agency and are still in AJK. They are most likely sheltered by a loyal worker of the banned organisation somewhere in the hilly areas,” said a senior officer. Talking to Dawn , he rejected the alleged TLP statement, terming it a “false, funny and self-generated claim”. A source said a senior Punjab official was tasked with contacting federal authorities to verify the claim after the statement went viral on social media. He said the provincial official conveyed to a senior official in Islamabad the Punjab police intent to arrest the “fleeing Rizvis” in multiple cases if they were in custody of any security agency, but the federal authorities told him the absconding TLP chief and his brother were not in the custody of any agency. The source said the two brothers had assumed the status of “high-profile wanted criminals” in cases registered against them under serious and heinous offences, including anti-terrorism charges. “So far, 44 FIRs have been registered against Saad and Anas in Sheikhupura and 11 in Lahore, in which they are nominated,” he said, adding that the charges were of a grave nature. Asked why the LEAs had failed to trace them, the official said the absconding TLP leaders were not using phones or other devices, making it difficult to track their location or hideouts. “We have activated all systems across the country, and it has been confirmed by relevant state institutions that the TLP chief and his brother are still in Pakistan,” he said, ruling out the possibility of their fleeing abroad. He added that the Punjab police were actively pursuing the fugitives and had constituted several teams. About the charges, the official said both had allegedly instigated TLP workers and hardcore activists to carry out attacks on law enforcement officials, besides damaging government vehicles and property. An SHO lost his life, while dozens of others sustained injuries during repea­ted attacks by TLP workers in Lahore and Sheikhupura. He said the TLP chief and his brother had led the “Gaza March”, launched from Lahore, where the party’s headquarters are located, in October last year, with the stated aim of marching towards Islamabad. Meanwhile, the FIA also moved swiftly, traced around 95 bank accounts allegedly operated by Saad Rizvi, and initiated investigations under money laundering charges, the official said. Dawn tried to contact the spokesperson/representative of the banned TLP to verify the recent statement claiming that Saad and Anas were in the custody of state agencies. However, the representative neither answered the call nor responded to WhatsApp messages. Published in Dawn, January 13th, 2026",

However, senior law enforcement officials are sticking to their earlier stance, maintaining that the two are hiding somewhere in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). They said the Rizvi brothers had fled on the day the Punjab police launched a pre-dawn operation in Muridke to dismantle the TLP protest camp along G.T. Road. “I give you my word that they are not in the custody of any security agency and are still in AJK. They are most likely sheltered by a loyal worker of the banned organisation somewhere in the hilly areas,” said a senior officer. Talking to Dawn , he rejected the alleged TLP statement, terming it a “false, funny and self-generated claim”. A source said a senior Punjab official was tasked with contacting federal authorities to verify the claim after the statement went viral on social media. He said the provincial official conveyed to a senior official in Islamabad the Punjab police intent to arrest the “fleeing Rizvis” in multiple cases if they were in custody of any security agency, but the federal authorities told him the absconding TLP chief and his brother were not in the custody of any agency. The source said the two brothers had assumed the status of “high-profile wanted criminals” in cases registered against them under serious and heinous offences, including anti-terrorism charges. “So far, 44 FIRs have been registered against Saad and Anas in Sheikhupura and 11 in Lahore, in which they are nominated,” he said, adding that the charges were of a grave nature. Asked why the LEAs had failed to trace them, the official said the absconding TLP leaders were not using phones or other devices, making it difficult to track their location or hideouts. “We have activated all systems across the country, and it has been confirmed by relevant state institutions that the TLP chief and his brother are still in Pakistan,” he said, ruling out the possibility of their fleeing abroad. He added that the Punjab police were actively pursuing the fugitives and had constituted several teams. About the charges, the official said both had allegedly instigated TLP workers and hardcore activists to carry out attacks on law enforcement officials, besides damaging government vehicles and property. An SHO lost his life, while dozens of others sustained injuries during repea­ted attacks by TLP workers in Lahore and Sheikhupura. He said the TLP chief and his brother had led the “Gaza March”, launched from Lahore, where the party’s headquarters are located, in October last year, with the stated aim of marching towards Islamabad. Meanwhile, the FIA also moved swiftly, traced around 95 bank accounts allegedly operated by Saad Rizvi, and initiated investigations under money laundering charges, the official said. Dawn tried to contact the spokesperson/representative of the banned TLP to verify the recent statement claiming that Saad and Anas were in the custody of state agencies. However, the representative neither answered the call nor responded to WhatsApp messages. Published in Dawn, January 13th, 2026",
