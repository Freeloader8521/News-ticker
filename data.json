The statement said that on various dates in October, students along with external accomplices stormed the registrar’s office, assaulted a female student, attempted to forcefully enter the vice-chancellor’s office, attacked a police guard, and showed deliberate disrespect during the national anthem at an event. Another reported incident involved anti-Pakistan slogans during a cricket match screening. A fact-finding committee was formed to investigate the incidents, after which the case was referred to the university’s disciplinary committee. The accused students were issued show-cause notices and given the opportunity to present their defence. Their replies were found unsatisfactory. Under university discipline rules, the administration expelled the involved students and cancelled their admissions. Hostel rooms were vacated and sealed. Those expelled include Aman Burki, Irfanullah, Nangyal Bittani, Ehsan Mehsud, and Tariq Bittani, while former student Amir Bittani has been banned from campus for five years. The university clarified that expelled students cannot seek admission in any other institution. The administration stated that a small group, backed by disruptive elements, has been attempting to disturb the university’s peaceful environment. It added that despite recent improvements in academics and administration under Vice-Chancellor Dr Zafar Iqbal, certain groups tried to incite unrest through false propaganda.

      "summary_orig": "FEAR was the main reason behind the passage of the 26th Amendment . Fear that the Supreme Court would somehow free jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and even go as far as to annul the last election in which, many believed, the will of the people at the ballot box may not have reflected in the final result. The 27th Amendment takes that thought to its logical conclusion. The move gives constitutional cover to what the defence minister has called a ‘hybrid’ system and also acknowledges and institutionalises the senior partner’s lead role which will extend beyond the term in office of the junior, civilian partner. When critics say the superior courts will now be under the executive’s influence, even control, they mean that given the balance of powers between the civilian and the uniformed, parts of the courts will now find themselves in the vice-like grip of the establishment. While that may be true, it is not out of place to say that what has happened has given constitutional cover to a fait accompli; except for very brief and insignificant periods of independence, the superior judiciary has rarely stood its ground in the face of establishment pressure. Starting with the Supreme Court’s predecessor the Federal Court, chief justice Munir’s infamous verdict, which overturned the Sindh Chief Court’s ruling in favour of Moulvi Tamizuddin, the Speaker, who had challenged the dissolution of the assembly by Governor-General Ghulam Mohammed, to the present day, the superior judiciary’s crucial verdicts have reflected more the will of the power centre(s) than the rule of law, or the spirit and supremacy of the Constitution. So far, a lot of the blame has been put on the political class for its failure to deliver. I can rattle off events in the Ayub era to the upholding of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s ouster to his death sentence and his execution to the dismissal of many governments starting in 1988 and continuing till the military takeover in 1999. When has the Supreme Court stood its ground and stood with law, justice and the people? If the Supreme Court was actually ‘ hollowed out ’, it happened way before the 27th Amendment became part of the Constitution. It sent two elected prime ministers home more recently and followed the establishment’s lead. What has happened now is seen as outrageous simply because it formalises what many justices appear to have long been comfortable with. Honourable exceptions being exceptions and nothing more. For every justice who refused to bow to the will of the gun and decided to step aside, there were, arguably, dozens who were more than willing to fill the breach. That’s the tragedy. As for the international environment today, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and individual liberty all seem to be under siege or attack. These cherished values seem to be in retreat. In the day and age of social media-shaped narratives and decline in the influence of legacy media, especially those elements of the legacy or traditional media that believed in truth, objectivity, balance and fairness, a whole new equilibrium is emerging. Where it takes us or is taking us is another story. In our case specifically, with so many external dangers and the resurgence of terrorism, and having discarded a relatively better form of democracy in favour of the hybrid variety, all authority and power now vests in one individual . Or, some would argue, the individual has been facilitated by politicians lacking in legitimacy to take total control. From now on, the onus of delivery is on him and accolades or the opposite will be his alone. I, for one, earnestly hope that in the area of national defence, he can repeat the wins of the May conflict with India and improve the performance of the SIFC, which has not managed to achieve what it was intended to. Going forward, the only thing that guarantees national security and stability in a hostile environment is economic development and provision of jobs and basic services to the people, a vast majority of whom have nothing. Literally. Our people have been badly let down. So far, a lot of the blame has been put on the political class for its failure to deliver. Even if there are glaring examples of the political class having been blocked or removed from decision-making when the economy was doing well. Individual ambitions of unelected power wielders overwhelmed what was in the interest of the teeming multitudes. By its very definition, this hybrid set-up devolves common responsibility where the senior partner cannot blame civilian junior partners for failures. Any shortcomings will have to be jointly shouldered. This 27th Amendment seems to make the task of the politicians and political parties out of power even harder to stage a comeback. Having tried to take to the streets to force a change in the status quo and failing, perhaps the one hope that flickered in what was a strong wind was legal, judicial relief coming via the superior courts. That too has been extinguished. Sympathisers and supporters in other powerful institutions have been purged or sidelined. This calls for a change in the opposition strategy as no assistance will be forthcoming from within power centres in the country. Imran Khan’s supporters and believers say his position is unshakeable, principled, while others at the very least feel he has so far displayed resilience and stubbornness in not talking to the junior hybrid partner as he has often been told to. With the legal route to freedom, rehabilitation now blocked off, it will be interesting to see what the former prime minister and his key lieutenants agree is the best way forward. Given that his deputies constantly complain of his being largely incommunicado, it may be weeks, even months before the first hints emerge of a shift, if any, in strategy.

Starting with the Supreme Court’s predecessor the Federal Court, chief justice Munir’s infamous verdict, which overturned the Sindh Chief Court’s ruling in favour of Moulvi Tamizuddin, the Speaker, who had challenged the dissolution of the assembly by Governor-General Ghulam Mohammed, to the present day, the superior judiciary’s crucial verdicts have reflected more the will of the power centre(s) than the rule of law, or the spirit and supremacy of the Constitution. So far, a lot of the blame has been put on the political class for its failure to deliver. I can rattle off events in the Ayub era to the upholding of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s ouster to his death sentence and his execution to the dismissal of many governments starting in 1988 and continuing till the military takeover in 1999. When has the Supreme Court stood its ground and stood with law, justice and the people? If the Supreme Court was actually ‘ hollowed out ’, it happened way before the 27th Amendment became part of the Constitution. It sent two elected prime ministers home more recently and followed the establishment’s lead. What has happened now is seen as outrageous simply because it formalises what many justices appear to have long been comfortable with. Honourable exceptions being exceptions and nothing more. For every justice who refused to bow to the will of the gun and decided to step aside, there were, arguably, dozens who were more than willing to fill the breach. That’s the tragedy. As for the international environment today, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and individual liberty all seem to be under siege or attack. These cherished values seem to be in retreat. In the day and age of social media-shaped narratives and decline in the influence of legacy media, especially those elements of the legacy or traditional media that believed in truth, objectivity, balance and fairness, a whole new equilibrium is emerging. Where it takes us or is taking us is another story. In our case specifically, with so many external dangers and the resurgence of terrorism, and having discarded a relatively better form of democracy in favour of the hybrid variety, all authority and power now vests in one individual . Or, some would argue, the individual has been facilitated by politicians lacking in legitimacy to take total control. From now on, the onus of delivery is on him and accolades or the opposite will be his alone. I, for one, earnestly hope that in the area of national defence, he can repeat the wins of the May conflict with India and improve the performance of the SIFC, which has not managed to achieve what it was intended to. Going forward, the only thing that guarantees national security and stability in a hostile environment is economic development and provision of jobs and basic services to the people, a vast majority of whom have nothing. Literally. Our people have been badly let down. So far, a lot of the blame has been put on the political class for its failure to deliver. Even if there are glaring examples of the political class having been blocked or removed from decision-making when the economy was doing well. Individual ambitions of unelected power wielders overwhelmed what was in the interest of the teeming multitudes. By its very definition, this hybrid set-up devolves common responsibility where the senior partner cannot blame civilian junior partners for failures. Any shortcomings will have to be jointly shouldered. This 27th Amendment seems to make the task of the politicians and political parties out of power even harder to stage a comeback. Having tried to take to the streets to force a change in the status quo and failing, perhaps the one hope that flickered in what was a strong wind was legal, judicial relief coming via the superior courts. That too has been extinguished. Sympathisers and supporters in other powerful institutions have been purged or sidelined. This calls for a change in the opposition strategy as no assistance will be forthcoming from within power centres in the country. Imran Khan’s supporters and believers say his position is unshakeable, principled, while others at the very least feel he has so far displayed resilience and stubbornness in not talking to the junior hybrid partner as he has often been told to. With the legal route to freedom, rehabilitation now blocked off, it will be interesting to see what the former prime minister and his key lieutenants agree is the best way forward. Given that his deputies constantly complain of his being largely incommunicado, it may be weeks, even months before the first hints emerge of a shift, if any, in strategy.

      "summary": "FEAR was the main reason behind the passage of the 26th Amendment . Fear that the Supreme Court would somehow free jailed former prime minister Imran Khan and even go as far as to annul the last election in which, many believed, the will of the people at the ballot box may not have reflected in the final result. The 27th Amendment takes that thought to its logical conclusion. The move gives constitutional cover to what the defence minister has called a ‘hybrid’ system and also acknowledges and institutionalises the senior partner’s lead role which will extend beyond the term in office of the junior, civilian partner. When critics say the superior courts will now be under the executive’s influence, even control, they mean that given the balance of powers between the civilian and the uniformed, parts of the courts will now find themselves in the vice-like grip of the establishment.

      "summary_orig": "THE regional geopolitical landscape remains highly tense, with Afghanistan, India and Pakistan positioned on a delicate escalation ladder. What is contributing significantly to this tension is the role of non-state actors. Where Afghanistan and Pakistan are concerned, the TTP is now a major point of contention. Meanwhile, for India and Pakistan, the situation has been exacerbated by the recent terrorist attack in Delhi. The identities and motives of the perpetrators are not clear, neither are possible links with regional or international terrorist networks. Nevertheless, it is evident that terrorist actors are a key factor in conflict escalation in the region. The irony is that political leaders are viewing the problem primarily through geopolitical and ideological lenses, an approach that will only benefit the terrorists. States and their security institutions, particularly in South Asia, have long been accustomed to interpreting terrorism-related threats within broad geopolitical frameworks. While this may provide some diplomatic or political leverage, it rarely contributes to actually resolving the underlying issues. This is precisely what terrorist actors want. They exploit such environments, expanding their operational space with minimal investment in attacks that can inflict disproportionate damage on both inter-state relations and lives. One of the core domains in which terrorism operates lies between the broader geopolitical environment and the counterterrorism practices of states. Terrorist organisations shape their strategies, operations, narratives, and political messaging within this space. When state priorities shift, terrorists exploit the resulting vacuums and disruptions. A case in point is the US shift in focus from Afghanistan to Iraq in 2003, which expanded the theatre of war for terrorist groups. This allowed them to build extensive networks. Their internal differences, rooted in divergent readings of global and regional politics, initially weakened them, but these same differences eventually gave birth to the militant Islamic State (IS) group and several other groups across Iraq and Syria. Terrorist groups also drew ideological strength from the nature of the US, Nato, and allied counterterrorism approaches, which were often brutal and violated humanitarian norms. From abuses at Abu Ghraib to torture cells, and later the collateral damage caused by drone strikes in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Africa, and the Gulf, these actions fuelled resentment. Terrorist groups effectively exploited this anger to amplify their narratives, enhance their recruitment, and sustain their financial networks. When state priorities shift, terrorists exploit the resulting vacuums and disruptions. It is not surprising that when then president Barack Obama announced America’s exit from Iraq in October 2011, most terrorist groups redirected their focus towards the Assad regime in Syria. Although Russia, Israel, Iran, Turkey and the Arab states pursued their own geopolitical agendas, they eventually recalibrated their political positions within the increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. Over time, they adopted more pragmatic approaches. As the conflict evolved, the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham-led alliance captured key areas around Damascus and gradually emerged as a significant actor in both regional and global politics. Recently, President Donald Trump received Ahmed al-Sharaa, who headed HTS, and praised him in his typical style, declaring that under his leadership, Syria would become a vibrant state. The Afghan Taliban, meanwhile, gained considerable strength from the expanding conflict and from the support they received within the neighbourhood, particularly from Pakistan, which enhanced both their operational capacity and political leverage. Afghanistan, however, represented a very different theatre of war. Its geopolitics were not as multi-layered or complex as those in Iraq and Syria. The principal clash of interests centred on Pakistan and India, and this rivalry shaped much of the Nato presence in Afghanistan. Iran, for its part, was occupied with multiple regional priorities. Its main focus was the Middle East, where it sought to secure its proxies and allies in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Consequently, Iran invested more in recruiting fighters from these regions, while providing support to certain Taliban factions at a level that never matched Pakistan’s influence. For the Taliban, the equations were not particularly difficult. They found political and strategic space between US and Nato urgency to exit the region and Pakistan’s desire to safeguard its interests in Afghanistan. What later unfolded between Pakistan and the Taliban is a separate story, one that has become increasingly evident in recent developments. Afghanistan’s conservative, tribal-centric nationalist tendencies also enabled the Taliban to shape their political approach, negotiate with the US and later manoeuvre strategically in their dealings with Pakistan. However, the major commonality between HTS and the Taliban was that both were claimants to territory and to a form of power that their respective religious or ethnic groups believed they had lost. Al Qaeda, by contrast, belonged to a different category, anchored in ideological operations rather than territorial ambition. It sharpened the political worldview of terrorist organisations across the globe, and to some extent, IS later followed its template. Al Qaeda remained an inspiration and a connective force for smaller terrorist groups, self-radicalised individuals and segments of Muslim diaspora communities, as well as Muslim societies. Al Qaeda also shaped the worldview of Pakistani and Kashmir-based groups. Its call for ‘global jihad’ encouraged militants to detach themselves from state agendas and pursue a ‘pure’ cause, fighting for lands free from the influence of Muslim states, which they perceived as subservient to a global imperial order. An example is Zakir Musa in Indian-held Kashmir, who attempted to ‘purify’ the Kashmiri jihad movement. He openly criticised groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and claimed that jihad should be waged solely for God. In many instances, terrorist groups deliberately create conditions that push states to the brink of confrontation, as Al Qaeda (through LeT) attempted with the Mumbai attacks in 2008. They closely study political contexts and exploit any emerging fissures within states. In India’s context, the probability cannot be ruled out that a rogue or self-radicalised cell of indoctrinated individuals can independently conceive and execute acts of violence driven by utopian or grandiose ideas rooted in faith, ethnicity, freedom, perceived suppression, or reactions to repression.

Pakistan has been placed close to the bottom in Freedom House’s Freedom on the Net index , scoring only 27 out of 100. Ranked ‘not free’, the country accompanies China, Iran and Russia on the list known for internet curbs. Regional peers, meanwhile, performed better with India at 51, Sri Lanka at 53 and Bangladesh at 45. All three were declared ‘partly free’. The assessment comes at a time when Pakistan is experiencing major democratic curtailments such as the passage of the 27th Amendment , besides repeated internet shutdowns, including the recent weeklong outage in Balochistan. According to the report, which gave Pakistan a score of 6/25 on ‘access’, 13/35 on ‘limits on content’, and 8/40 on ‘violations of user rights’, the country has seen a rapid decline over the past 15 years. In this period, like in other countries experiencing similar downward trends, the government imposed curbs on online activity in response to challenges to its rule. The country was ranked ‘not free’ in 2012 and not much seems to have changed since. Between June 2024 and May this year, repeated disruptions were reported across major communication platforms, including WhatsApp and Signal, often linked to new blocking and monitoring technologies. In November 2024, authorities restricted internet services across Islamabad during mass protests. The pattern intensified this year with threats to block VPNs , mandatory registration requirements that sought user identification details, and amendments to Peca introduced in January. Rights groups warn that these changes contain vague language that can easily be used to suppress speech that is critical of the state. Such repressive actions have consequences. The report documents at least five death sentences issued for alleged online blasphemy during the coverage period. It also highlights the continuing influence of the establishment over electoral processes, media environments and policy decisions. These pressures create an atmosphere in which online and offline expression feel unsafe. Heavy-handed restrictions reinforce the perception that the state prefers control and opacity over engagement and accountability. The passage of the 27th Amendment, criticised for weakening constitutional safeguards, adds to the sense that Pakistan’s democratic space is contracting. Elections alone cannot uphold democracy. They require an open public sphere in which citizens can speak, assemble and challenge authority. When the physical and digital spheres contract simultaneously, the foundations of democratic life weaken. In a modern democracy, the internet must serve as a basic civic infrastructure rather than a tool of control. Transparent regulation, judicial oversight of shutdowns and the repeal of opaque cyber law provisions are non-negotiable. Pakistan can still walk back and reverse this negative trajectory. It remains to be seen whether the political will to do so exists. Published in Dawn, November 16th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI claimed on Saturday that the report by The Economist , widely circulated on social media, was nothing more than recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary. The report covered PTI founder Imran Khan’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as prime minister. Imran married Bushra in February 2018. An official response, issued by the party’s media wing, claimed that co-writer Bushra Taskeen was a known critic of PTI and the “so-called” analysis published in the report was to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and stolen elections. The party said it had the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and publication, if they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology. “We have seen this narrative play out before. Half-truths, innuendo, selective outrage, all packaged and presented as ‘objective analysis’. This attempt to misrepresent facts is not intended to inform Pakistan or its people, but rather to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and systematically stolen elections,” it claimed. “What is most striking is the convenient targeting of Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, who have been incarcerated for two years and three months, while the article remains silent on what has been happening in Pakistan for the last three years and seven months. There is no mention of human rights violations, the rigged elections confirmed even by the Commonwealth observers , the hundreds of PTI supporters who have recently been convicted to 10-year sentences in fabricated cases, or the systematic political persecution the party has faced. “Instead, the writers chose to focus on the personal lives of the country’s most popular and courageous leader, a man revered by millions of Pakistanis, while ignoring the glaring injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens, party members, and the democratic system itself.” The party further claimed that the Al Qadir Trust case, frequently cited in the article, was ongoing and had not been “fixed” as implied. “PTI has consistently sought transparency and judicial resolution. The Constitution itself has been repeatedly tampered with, in fear of Imran Khan, undermining the rule of law. One must ask the writers why they did not highlight these grave concerns and instead chose to sensationalise the personal life of the PTI leader? Furthermore, co-writer Bushra Taskeen is a known critic of PTI, demonstrating clear bias against Imran Khan and favouring the PML-N, calling into question the objectivity of this analysis,” the party stated. “Imran Khan’s own trials are far from open and fair. They are being conducted inside prison, denying him his basic rights, including meetings with family, friends, and legal counsel, despite explicit court orders. This systematic denial of due process exposes the politically motivated nature of these proceedings, yet the article conspicuously omits these facts.“ The PTI added that they “reserve the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and The Economist , should they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology for this baseless, reckless, and defamatory personal attack on the leader of 240 million Pakistanis and the millions of devoted supporters of Imran Khan worldwide”. “The people of Pakistan know the truth. They see through these attempts to malign their leader and continue to revere Imran Khan for his courage, integrity, and steadfast commitment to the nation. His moral leadership and dedication to justice remain a beacon of hope for millions, despite the relentless political persecution he and his family have endured,” the response concluded.",

South Africa gave the war-ravaged Palestinians 90-day visas, Al Jazeera reported.

      "title_orig": "WHAT I HAVE LEARNT IN 50 YEARS",
      "summary_orig": "Over the last 50-plus years, I have sat through numerous presentations on government, NGO, masters and PhD students’ development projects, in various countries, both in what is now known as the global North and global South. In addition, international financial institutions (IFIs), such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, have also sought my assistance. I have also been a member of various United Nations committees on physical and social development, and a consultant to them. As the chief adviser and the chairperson of the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) and the Urban Resource Centre (URC), I have challenged the structure of thinking of many such projects and documented my concerns regularly. The most important thing I have learned in the process is that most of these projects have a very strong anti-poor bias and are primarily concerned with brick and mortar aspects of problems. ANTI-POOR BIAS As far as academia is concerned, almost all teachers and supervisors bring their class prejudices with them, and the literature search that students have to undertake strengthens these prejudices. The poor are portrayed as helpless and incapable of taking decisions regarding their own lives. The students are asked to observe and pass judgements on their observations. The poor are almost never asked their own definition of poverty. Judgements are passed in surveys on the basis of very small numbers. And once these numbers are cited, they become the “truth” for other students and consultants to follow. Planning and development expert Arif Hasan has spent more than five decades working with poor communities across Pakistan and development practitioners and institutes around the world. He reflects on the major lessons he has learnt from that experience and his personal observations on what is wrong with Pakistan’s development paradigm… In addition, studies by IFIs have an interest in portraying conditions to be much worse than they really are, so as to increase their loan packages for the project or policy under consideration. In addition, much of the loans Pakistan takes are for paying off previous loans, something that is seldom taken into consideration by the authors of the plans. DOUBLE STANDARDS The anti-poor bias expresses itself in other ways as well. Building standards developed for poor and rich settlements vary considerably. The poor settlements have much lower standards, the contractor is badly supervised, and the element of corruption is much higher in percentage terms. Much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed for them collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, low-income settlements are completely flooded. It is not of much satisfaction that middle-income settlements today suffer the same fate as well. Even the workmen employed for the low-income settlement projects are not skilled, paid less per day, and the savings that are generated are taken over for politicians, bureaucrats and the contractor himself. Many decisions that are taken for low-income settlements are a violation of common sense. Much of the professionals employed on these projects are barely trained, and many do not possess a qualification and are seldom present on site. HEALTH Health is a major issue in low-income settlements. Disease deprives a family of income and, to get well, one has to spend money, which the family cannot afford. The location of hospitals or medical facilities are not where they are needed, but in locations where amenity plots had been located in formal and informal planning. In addition, in academic training, a lot of emphasis is put on curative rather than preventive medicine. That determines the location and design of health-related infrastructure, and the relation between disease and architecture simply does not exist in planning concepts. The cost of curative medicine has become so high that many families are now heavily in debt because of it. Surveys show that people have shifted to hakeems [traditional healers] and homeopathic systems, so as to make medicine affordable. PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS If you look at the location of parks and playgrounds, the main municipal parks are eight to 10 km away from most low-income settlements. Amenity plots in low-income settlements have been encroached upon, and those that have not been encroached upon have not been developed. Many of them have become garbage dumps and sorting yards for solid waste, promoting disease and environmental degradation of the settlements around them. There are other aspects as well. Surveys by my office and the URC show that the poor are clear in their view that the major cause of their poverty is the absence of a roof that they own. A roof gives them dignity, the possibility of upward mobility, better proposals for their daughters’ marriages, the possibility of improving their home incrementally as and when they have money, freedom from insecurity, the possibility of their children — especially girls — receiving an education because of the savings made on rent and, subsequently, better jobs for their women, such as in malls and as supervisors in factories. These very important issues seldom form part of the housing analysis. Perhaps this is because these intangible issues do not help in justifying a large loan. AND WHAT ABOUT THE LOANS? A study of loans taken by Pakistan for housing purposes shows that, while the brick and mortar part is utilised, the intangible aspects are normally not utilised. Much of this is because sociologists who can make the necessary studies for the IFIs are very short in supply, and are usually employed as consultants. It is also because it is not easy to save money for illegal benefits from social infrastructure projects. Every loan has an element of capacity-building for the government staff and the special staff that is hired. This capacity-building usually consists of workshops and visits to foreign countries to see how projects in those countries were designed and how they function. They are usually independent projects, not necessarily a part of a larger policy. This capacity-building component is normally 12 percent  of the project cost. Over the years, millions of dollars have been invested in capacity-building. In spite of this, we keep building the same capacity again and again, and the departments for whom capacity is built revert back to their previous organisational culture and manner of functioning. We can see from the state in which the development agencies are, that no capacity has been built. EVICTIONS AND RESETTLEMENTS In housing projects, one of the main problems is acquiring land for them. This is done by removing existing settlements and relocating them, sometimes on the same land and very often elsewhere, on land identified and provided by the state. The new settlement, which was previously in the city centre, is relocated to the city’s fringes. This impoverishes the people and destroys community ties. It adds transport costs to work and back, deprives women of jobs because of distances and the costs involved from home to work and back, and it puts households in debt (since the poor pay monthly for their groceries, which was possible previously because of community links). Poor households also borrow from each other in times of need, which becomes difficult with new neighbours. The old manner of professionals and their support staff visiting settlements for long periods and spending time with the affectees of evictions is gone. And where it takes place it is like “development tourism.” As a result, there is little empathy between the different actors of development planning and the opinion of the affectees is usually missing, except for a paragraph or two summarised from a visit or survey. In addition, previously people formed committees and stood up for themselves and negotiated or demonstrated with their representatives and other influential personalities. Today, there is no lack of NGOs to support them or to initiate their struggle. This weakens their position as compared to before, as NGOs’ positions are more understanding and supportive of government decisions, as compared to people’s committees. Boys cross a makeshift 'bridge' at Karachi's Gujjar Nullah: much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed in  low-income settlements collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, these localities become completely flooded | Amar Guriro LAND AND HOUSING There are other issues with land as well. Government agencies claim that they have no land for development for the poor. Yet they have no problem handing out large land parcels to formal sector developers. There are many reasons for this. The state collects large revenues from the sale and or development of these land parcels. The fact that poor cooperatives can produce the same revenue over a longer period of time, with interest, is disregarded. Then there is another problem. Available land, which is next to expensive land and that can be considered for low-income groups, is not considered because the value of the expensive land will fall if it is next to low-income settlements. As a result, the poor can only live on peripheral or environmentally degraded land that no one wants. The market, realising the demand for low-income housing near the city centre, has found ways to cater to this demand. Old katchi abadis [informal settlements] near the centre are being converted into multi-storey apartments, often four to seven floors high. They have no lifts and very narrow streets. When they began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they provided cheap flats for the lower-middle class to purchase on cash, instalments or pagrri [goodwill money]. Today, they are not affordable, even for the better-off poor. The result is that an increasing number of flat-owners are in debt, from purchasing and continuing to live in these highrises. These new developments are not considered legal by state agencies, as they follow no by-laws and zoning regulations, simply because such regulations do not exist. The residents, therefore, live in a constant fear of eviction. But the informal sector has devised documents of sale and possession amongst themselves. Their legality is decided on the basis of by-laws which are applied to formally constructed houses. This is very unfair because these houses have no lease and they have never applied for a building permit — this concept did not exist when they began construction. In addition, government surveys of informal settlements for rehabilitation purposes are also faulty. These surveys usually count houses as they appear on a Google map. However, in informal settlements, many households often live on one plot of land or in one house. So, government surveys are usually about houses and not about people. Thus, government figures are unreliable and the cause of considerable injustice. COMPENSATIONS Compensation given as money is usually more equitable, as the affectee can use it at their convenience. Yet it has to be sufficient to rent accommodation or purchase a plot. It never is, because the needs of the poor are always under-estimated because of the bias against them, in the name of transparency. The manner in which money is given is complex. The affectee is viewed with suspicion by officialdom. So, something that could take a few hours gets lost in bureaucratic complexity, with many steps to take and many days in taking them. Because of this, affectees often lose day wages or have problems with their employers. A major problem is encountered by senior residents who are invalid and cannot afford to purchase or hire a home. So, many of them end up living on the street or under bridges. At night, many parks are also full of them but, as government attempts to prevent them from sleeping in parks improve, the number of people sleeping on the street or under bridges also increases. An increasingly large number are also sleeping on the beach. Conditions in the rural areas are also becoming increasingly difficult because of the need for cash, which daily wage labour can not manage to earn sufficiently. With climate change, the number of environmental refugees is also increasing rapidly. There are no plans to provide them jobs or spaces to live. They are also living on the streets, under bridges, or in under-construction buildings. They manage to earn somewhat because another informal sector provides them with trinkets, such as balloons, to sell. A whole supply-chain of manufacturing exists, providing these items on credit. The women clean car windscreens at crossroads. I have never found out what exactly their men do or what the number of such a population is. There are also street hotels on pavements that rent out a bed and breakfast for between Rs100 to 300 per night, along with some basic toilet facilities, which are often provided by the neighbouring mosque in lieu of a small donation by the user. These ‘hotels’ are also adjacent to transport terminals, where drinking water is publicly available. This is a whole unexplored world. A group of schoolgirls crossing a street in Rawalpindi: because the government schooling system is substandard, many families prefer to send their children to neighbourhood private schools, which proves to be a great financial burden for poorer families | White Star DENSITY A serious issue that is evolving is related to density. One-hundred-and-twenty square yard plots (which were owned by the father or grandfather) are divided among the children. Every child wants his/her part to have access to the road, which divides the plot, often into 3, making the divided plot no more than 30 feet at the roadside. This means that each person gets no more than a 10-foot frontage. A first floor is sometimes added to this. So, where one family was living, now at least six families are living in a plot of very small frontage. This creates a situation of unbearable density and, as the population grows, there are further divisions and subdivisions and/ or high rises, which manage to create densities over 1,000 to 1,200 persons per hectare. This issue is seldom or never addressed. GROWING INEQUALITY GAP As a result of what has been discussed above, there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor. That is why better-income young men and women stand a better chance in becoming members of national cultural and sports teams. The poor also complain of elite schools and colleges using their social and political influence in getting their members to become members of national teams. It is for all these reasons that the upper echelons of the judiciary, bureaucracy, business and the military are drawn from the elite private schools and universities of Pakistan and support each other on a class basis. Their development decisions support their class interests, and they are not fully aware of the problems that their country and its less fortunate citizens face. Development for them means bringing the benefits they have to the people of Pakistan. But this is not possible. IFIs have a major say in the development model of Pakistan. Their air-conditioned offices in the city centre, far away from the homes of low-income groups, their fleet of expensive cars, constant trips abroad, workshops in five-star hotels and huge salaries anger the people, and it is not uncommon to hear them say “they are becoming rich on our problems.” EDUCATION Education is one of the priorities of poor families. However, the government schooling system is poor, and so poor families prefer to send their children to neighbourhood private schools, which are operated by local entrepreneurs. These are expensive as a result, so families have to decide which child to send to school and which child to send to work. This is a very difficult decision and causes ruptures in the family. Unlike neighbourhood schools, colleges and universities are very far away from low-income settlements, and a trip to them (in the absence of efficient and cheap transportation) and back is very expensive in terms of money and time. This also results in many young people giving up on higher education. This adversity affects the majority of women aspirants. All this is in addition to very high fees (often in tens of thousands), which low-income groups can seldom afford. CULTURE The Pakistan state is anti-culture and against students organising themselves. As a result, there is no student political activity. It is frowned upon, if not persecuted, and arts, music, dance and drama are discouraged. But all this has become an exclusive part of elite culture and held in elite institutions, often supported by cultural institutions of foreign countries. However, there are signs that this is changing and that the lower-middle class is slowly becoming a part of this. There was a time when student cards could subsidise travel, hostel charges, student canteens and library fees. All this has gone due to the neoliberal economic policies adopted by the state. Not only this, but every student who is admitted to a university signs a form saying he or she will not indulge in any form of discussion or debate regarding politics or religion. With this statement, dissent, which is a basic requirement of development and progress, is killed. WOMEN AND FAMILY STRUCTURES In the last 20 years, the family structure and the women of Karachi have changed. We have moved from joint to nuclear families. As a result, women have become comparatively independent and also dominate the fields of education and health. Self-willed marriages are increasing rapidly, and so is divorce. The conservative segment of society feels this is because people do not follow their religion. But this cannot be stopped. There is now a women’s football team, cricket team and hockey team, and women participate in athletics and martial arts and win. They participate in politics and participate in demonstrations, and often arrange them. Their public presence has increased too, and many women are in important government and private sector jobs as heads of institutions as well. But in spite of fairly strong women’s movements, women complain that they still have a long way to go before they can use their independence to achieve some form of equality with their men. They earn, but still they have to cook and clean. These changes have had a major impact on the design, especially on the incremental development, of the home and the future culture of the younger generation. Most homes possess a smartphone and have access to the internet and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, in spite of these developments, the city has almost no toilets for women, which restricts their working hours, and during their periods, they often have no option but to take the day off. In addition, the pavements that are available to them to walk on have obstructions such as trees, advertisement signage and broken patches. Often there are no pavements at all. This results in accidents and difficulty in moving around, especially with children and with senior citizens. There are many newly built roads that have no pavements at all and, when I have expressed this observation, I have been told “Arif Bhai, have you ever seen anyone walk on a pavement in Karachi?” FINAL NOTE There is much more that I have observed and written about and can safely conclude that, unless these and many other things are taken into account when trying to solve our problems and building a future, our problems will not be solved. Streets will flood, additional katchi abadis will be created, transport will not improve because it will not be maintained and managed, traffic will become more unbearable in the absence of management and, worst of all, women’s development will take place in an environment full of conflicts because the state will not support it. Hopefully, a new generation that is now growing up will be able to change this. The writer is an architect and urban planner.

In addition, government surveys of informal settlements for rehabilitation purposes are also faulty. These surveys usually count houses as they appear on a Google map. However, in informal settlements, many households often live on one plot of land or in one house. So, government surveys are usually about houses and not about people. Thus, government figures are unreliable and the cause of considerable injustice. COMPENSATIONS Compensation given as money is usually more equitable, as the affectee can use it at their convenience. Yet it has to be sufficient to rent accommodation or purchase a plot. It never is, because the needs of the poor are always under-estimated because of the bias against them, in the name of transparency. The manner in which money is given is complex. The affectee is viewed with suspicion by officialdom. So, something that could take a few hours gets lost in bureaucratic complexity, with many steps to take and many days in taking them. Because of this, affectees often lose day wages or have problems with their employers. A major problem is encountered by senior residents who are invalid and cannot afford to purchase or hire a home. So, many of them end up living on the street or under bridges. At night, many parks are also full of them but, as government attempts to prevent them from sleeping in parks improve, the number of people sleeping on the street or under bridges also increases. An increasingly large number are also sleeping on the beach. Conditions in the rural areas are also becoming increasingly difficult because of the need for cash, which daily wage labour can not manage to earn sufficiently. With climate change, the number of environmental refugees is also increasing rapidly. There are no plans to provide them jobs or spaces to live. They are also living on the streets, under bridges, or in under-construction buildings. They manage to earn somewhat because another informal sector provides them with trinkets, such as balloons, to sell. A whole supply-chain of manufacturing exists, providing these items on credit. The women clean car windscreens at crossroads. I have never found out what exactly their men do or what the number of such a population is. There are also street hotels on pavements that rent out a bed and breakfast for between Rs100 to 300 per night, along with some basic toilet facilities, which are often provided by the neighbouring mosque in lieu of a small donation by the user. These ‘hotels’ are also adjacent to transport terminals, where drinking water is publicly available. This is a whole unexplored world. A group of schoolgirls crossing a street in Rawalpindi: because the government schooling system is substandard, many families prefer to send their children to neighbourhood private schools, which proves to be a great financial burden for poorer families | White Star DENSITY A serious issue that is evolving is related to density. One-hundred-and-twenty square yard plots (which were owned by the father or grandfather) are divided among the children. Every child wants his/her part to have access to the road, which divides the plot, often into 3, making the divided plot no more than 30 feet at the roadside. This means that each person gets no more than a 10-foot frontage. A first floor is sometimes added to this. So, where one family was living, now at least six families are living in a plot of very small frontage. This creates a situation of unbearable density and, as the population grows, there are further divisions and subdivisions and/ or high rises, which manage to create densities over 1,000 to 1,200 persons per hectare. This issue is seldom or never addressed. GROWING INEQUALITY GAP As a result of what has been discussed above, there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor. That is why better-income young men and women stand a better chance in becoming members of national cultural and sports teams. The poor also complain of elite schools and colleges using their social and political influence in getting their members to become members of national teams. It is for all these reasons that the upper echelons of the judiciary, bureaucracy, business and the military are drawn from the elite private schools and universities of Pakistan and support each other on a class basis. Their development decisions support their class interests, and they are not fully aware of the problems that their country and its less fortunate citizens face. Development for them means bringing the benefits they have to the people of Pakistan. But this is not possible. IFIs have a major say in the development model of Pakistan. Their air-conditioned offices in the city centre, far away from the homes of low-income groups, their fleet of expensive cars, constant trips abroad, workshops in five-star hotels and huge salaries anger the people, and it is not uncommon to hear them say “they are becoming rich on our problems.” EDUCATION Education is one of the priorities of poor families. However, the government schooling system is poor, and so poor families prefer to send their children to neighbourhood private schools, which are operated by local entrepreneurs. These are expensive as a result, so families have to decide which child to send to school and which child to send to work. This is a very difficult decision and causes ruptures in the family. Unlike neighbourhood schools, colleges and universities are very far away from low-income settlements, and a trip to them (in the absence of efficient and cheap transportation) and back is very expensive in terms of money and time. This also results in many young people giving up on higher education. This adversity affects the majority of women aspirants. All this is in addition to very high fees (often in tens of thousands), which low-income groups can seldom afford. CULTURE The Pakistan state is anti-culture and against students organising themselves. As a result, there is no student political activity. It is frowned upon, if not persecuted, and arts, music, dance and drama are discouraged. But all this has become an exclusive part of elite culture and held in elite institutions, often supported by cultural institutions of foreign countries. However, there are signs that this is changing and that the lower-middle class is slowly becoming a part of this. There was a time when student cards could subsidise travel, hostel charges, student canteens and library fees. All this has gone due to the neoliberal economic policies adopted by the state. Not only this, but every student who is admitted to a university signs a form saying he or she will not indulge in any form of discussion or debate regarding politics or religion. With this statement, dissent, which is a basic requirement of development and progress, is killed. WOMEN AND FAMILY STRUCTURES In the last 20 years, the family structure and the women of Karachi have changed. We have moved from joint to nuclear families. As a result, women have become comparatively independent and also dominate the fields of education and health. Self-willed marriages are increasing rapidly, and so is divorce. The conservative segment of society feels this is because people do not follow their religion. But this cannot be stopped. There is now a women’s football team, cricket team and hockey team, and women participate in athletics and martial arts and win. They participate in politics and participate in demonstrations, and often arrange them. Their public presence has increased too, and many women are in important government and private sector jobs as heads of institutions as well. But in spite of fairly strong women’s movements, women complain that they still have a long way to go before they can use their independence to achieve some form of equality with their men. They earn, but still they have to cook and clean. These changes have had a major impact on the design, especially on the incremental development, of the home and the future culture of the younger generation. Most homes possess a smartphone and have access to the internet and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, in spite of these developments, the city has almost no toilets for women, which restricts their working hours, and during their periods, they often have no option but to take the day off. In addition, the pavements that are available to them to walk on have obstructions such as trees, advertisement signage and broken patches. Often there are no pavements at all. This results in accidents and difficulty in moving around, especially with children and with senior citizens. There are many newly built roads that have no pavements at all and, when I have expressed this observation, I have been told “Arif Bhai, have you ever seen anyone walk on a pavement in Karachi?” FINAL NOTE There is much more that I have observed and written about and can safely conclude that, unless these and many other things are taken into account when trying to solve our problems and building a future, our problems will not be solved. Streets will flood, additional katchi abadis will be created, transport will not improve because it will not be maintained and managed, traffic will become more unbearable in the absence of management and, worst of all, women’s development will take place in an environment full of conflicts because the state will not support it. Hopefully, a new generation that is now growing up will be able to change this. The writer is an architect and urban planner.

      "title": "WHAT I HAVE LEARNT IN 50 YEARS",
      "summary": "Over the last 50-plus years, I have sat through numerous presentations on government, NGO, masters and PhD students’ development projects, in various countries, both in what is now known as the global North and global South. In addition, international financial institutions (IFIs), such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, have also sought my assistance. I have also been a member of various United Nations committees on physical and social development, and a consultant to them. As the chief adviser and the chairperson of the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) and the Urban Resource Centre (URC), I have challenged the structure of thinking of many such projects and documented my concerns regularly. The most important thing I have learned in the process is that most of these projects have a very strong anti-poor bias and are primarily concerned with brick and mortar aspects of problems. ANTI-POOR BIAS As far as academia is concerned, almost all teachers and supervisors bring their class prejudices with them, and the literature search that students have to undertake strengthens these prejudices. The poor are portrayed as helpless and incapable of taking decisions regarding their own lives. The students are asked to observe and pass judgements on their observations. The poor are almost never asked their own definition of poverty. Judgements are passed in surveys on the basis of very small numbers. And once these numbers are cited, they become the “truth” for other students and consultants to follow. Planning and development expert Arif Hasan has spent more than five decades working with poor communities across Pakistan and development practitioners and institutes around the world. He reflects on the major lessons he has learnt from that experience and his personal observations on what is wrong with Pakistan’s development paradigm… In addition, studies by IFIs have an interest in portraying conditions to be much worse than they really are, so as to increase their loan packages for the project or policy under consideration. In addition, much of the loans Pakistan takes are for paying off previous loans, something that is seldom taken into consideration by the authors of the plans. DOUBLE STANDARDS The anti-poor bias expresses itself in other ways as well. Building standards developed for poor and rich settlements vary considerably. The poor settlements have much lower standards, the contractor is badly supervised, and the element of corruption is much higher in percentage terms. Much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed for them collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, low-income settlements are completely flooded. It is not of much satisfaction that middle-income settlements today suffer the same fate as well. Even the workmen employed for the low-income settlement projects are not skilled, paid less per day, and the savings that are generated are taken over for politicians, bureaucrats and the contractor himself. Many decisions that are taken for low-income settlements are a violation of common sense. Much of the professionals employed on these projects are barely trained, and many do not possess a qualification and are seldom present on site. HEALTH Health is a major issue in low-income settlements. Disease deprives a family of income and, to get well, one has to spend money, which the family cannot afford. The location of hospitals or medical facilities are not where they are needed, but in locations where amenity plots had been located in formal and informal planning. In addition, in academic training, a lot of emphasis is put on curative rather than preventive medicine. That determines the location and design of health-related infrastructure, and the relation between disease and architecture simply does not exist in planning concepts. The cost of curative medicine has become so high that many families are now heavily in debt because of it. Surveys show that people have shifted to hakeems [traditional healers] and homeopathic systems, so as to make medicine affordable. PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS If you look at the location of parks and playgrounds, the main municipal parks are eight to 10 km away from most low-income settlements. Amenity plots in low-income settlements have been encroached upon, and those that have not been encroached upon have not been developed. Many of them have become garbage dumps and sorting yards for solid waste, promoting disease and environmental degradation of the settlements around them. There are other aspects as well. Surveys by my office and the URC show that the poor are clear in their view that the major cause of their poverty is the absence of a roof that they own. A roof gives them dignity, the possibility of upward mobility, better proposals for their daughters’ marriages, the possibility of improving their home incrementally as and when they have money, freedom from insecurity, the possibility of their children — especially girls — receiving an education because of the savings made on rent and, subsequently, better jobs for their women, such as in malls and as supervisors in factories. These very important issues seldom form part of the housing analysis. Perhaps this is because these intangible issues do not help in justifying a large loan. AND WHAT ABOUT THE LOANS? A study of loans taken by Pakistan for housing purposes shows that, while the brick and mortar part is utilised, the intangible aspects are normally not utilised. Much of this is because sociologists who can make the necessary studies for the IFIs are very short in supply, and are usually employed as consultants. It is also because it is not easy to save money for illegal benefits from social infrastructure projects. Every loan has an element of capacity-building for the government staff and the special staff that is hired. This capacity-building usually consists of workshops and visits to foreign countries to see how projects in those countries were designed and how they function. They are usually independent projects, not necessarily a part of a larger policy. This capacity-building component is normally 12 percent  of the project cost. Over the years, millions of dollars have been invested in capacity-building. In spite of this, we keep building the same capacity again and again, and the departments for whom capacity is built revert back to their previous organisational culture and manner of functioning. We can see from the state in which the development agencies are, that no capacity has been built. EVICTIONS AND RESETTLEMENTS In housing projects, one of the main problems is acquiring land for them. This is done by removing existing settlements and relocating them, sometimes on the same land and very often elsewhere, on land identified and provided by the state. The new settlement, which was previously in the city centre, is relocated to the city’s fringes. This impoverishes the people and destroys community ties. It adds transport costs to work and back, deprives women of jobs because of distances and the costs involved from home to work and back, and it puts households in debt (since the poor pay monthly for their groceries, which was possible previously because of community links). Poor households also borrow from each other in times of need, which becomes difficult with new neighbours. The old manner of professionals and their support staff visiting settlements for long periods and spending time with the affectees of evictions is gone. And where it takes place it is like “development tourism.” As a result, there is little empathy between the different actors of development planning and the opinion of the affectees is usually missing, except for a paragraph or two summarised from a visit or survey. In addition, previously people formed committees and stood up for themselves and negotiated or demonstrated with their representatives and other influential personalities. Today, there is no lack of NGOs to support them or to initiate their struggle. This weakens their position as compared to before, as NGOs’ positions are more understanding and supportive of government decisions, as compared to people’s committees. Boys cross a makeshift 'bridge' at Karachi's Gujjar Nullah: much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed in  low-income settlements collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, these localities become completely flooded | Amar Guriro LAND AND HOUSING There are other issues with land as well. Government agencies claim that they have no land for development for the poor. Yet they have no problem handing out large land parcels to formal sector developers. There are many reasons for this. The state collects large revenues from the sale and or development of these land parcels. The fact that poor cooperatives can produce the same revenue over a longer period of time, with interest, is disregarded. Then there is another problem. Available land, which is next to expensive land and that can be considered for low-income groups, is not considered because the value of the expensive land will fall if it is next to low-income settlements. As a result, the poor can only live on peripheral or environmentally degraded land that no one wants. The market, realising the demand for low-income housing near the city centre, has found ways to cater to this demand. Old katchi abadis [informal settlements] near the centre are being converted into multi-storey apartments, often four to seven floors high. They have no lifts and very narrow streets. When they began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they provided cheap flats for the lower-middle class to purchase on cash, instalments or pagrri [goodwill money]. Today, they are not affordable, even for the better-off poor. The result is that an increasing number of flat-owners are in debt, from purchasing and continuing to live in these highrises. These new developments are not considered legal by state agencies, as they follow no by-laws and zoning regulations, simply because such regulations do not exist. The residents, therefore, live in a constant fear of eviction. But the informal sector has devised documents of sale and possession amongst themselves. Their legality is decided on the basis of by-laws which are applied to formally constructed houses. This is very unfair because these houses have no lease and they have never applied for a building permit — this concept did not exist when they began construction. In addition, government surveys of informal settlements for rehabilitation purposes are also faulty. These surveys usually count houses as they appear on a Google map. However, in informal settlements, many households often live on one plot of land or in one house. So, government surveys are usually about houses and not about people.

Samir Zitouni, known as Sam, was working onboard the London North Eastern Railway (LNER) high-speed train from Doncaster to London when the attack happened on 1 November. LNER said the 48-year-old, who has worked for the company for more than 20 years, has been credited with helping to save multiple lives after passengers came under threat in Huntingdon. British Transport police said Zitouni was now able to continue his recovery at home. The force said on Saturday: “Samir Zitouni had been in a critical condition having suffered multiple injuries, and thanks to the efforts of NHS medical staff he’s been able to be discharged from hospital today.” His family said: “We are so grateful for the outpouring of support from the public, and very touched by all the kind words about Sam’s brave actions on the night of the attack. “While we are really happy to have him home, he still has a significant recovery ahead and we would now like to be left in privacy to care for him as a family.” Zitouni’s job is customer experience host, which largely involves providing onboard catering. He was among 11 patients treated in hospital for injuries sustained during the attack, which is understood to have started shortly after the train left Peterborough station. Among the injured was Jonathan Gjoshe, 22, a Scunthorpe United footballer who was treated for non-life-threatening injuries, and Stephen Crean, 61, who sustained stab injuries. Anthony Williams, 32, was remanded into custody at Peterborough magistrates court on 3 November charged with 10 counts of attempted murder, two counts of possession of a bladed article and one count of actual bodily harm. One of the attempted murder counts relates to a separate incident at a London station. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s Revolutionary Guards confirmed on Saturday that they had seized an oil tanker in the Gulf as it sailed away from a UAE port, a day after security companies determined they were likely responsible. “Yesterday morning at 7:30, after a judicial authority ordered the seizure of the cargo of an oil tanker with the trade name Talara and the flag of the Marshall Islands, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) rapid reaction units of the naval forces monitored its movements and intercepted and seized it,” said the IRGC. “The tanker was found to be in violation of the law by carrying unauthorised cargo,” the statement continued, adding it “was carrying 30,000 tonnes of petrochemical cargo and was heading to Singapore”. The Iranian news agency Fars said that action was not taken as a measure against any other nation, but was a purely local matter. The seized cargo, the report said, was made up of Iranian-produced petrochemicals being illegally exported and “the main culprit was an Iranian individual or business”. The vessel had departed from Ajman in the United Arab Emirates and was heading south through the Strait of Hormuz when it was approached by three small boats, after which it made a “sudden course deviation”, maritime security company Ambrey said. The US Navy had earlier said it was “actively monitoring the situation”. “Commercial vessels are entitled to largely unimpeded rights of navigation and commerce on the high seas,” said the US 5th Fleet, which patrols the region. The Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for global oil and liquefied natural gas, has previously been the scene of similar incidents. Last year, the Revolutionary Guards seized a container ship, saying it had links to Israel, following a deadly attack on Iran’s consulate in Syria blamed on Israel.",

      "summary_orig": "Police detained five people on Saturday after clashes broke out at the All Sindh Lawyers’ Convention in Sukkur to protest against the 27th Constitutional Amendment . A group of lawyers at the convention, held at the Sukkur District Bar, began shouting slogans against President Asif Ali Zardari, whereas another group of lawyers began chanting in the president’s favour. The disorder intensified with the involvement of plainclothes individuals when a verbal altercation and scuffle broke out between them and lawyers. Meanwhile, some of the protesting lawyers reportedly held five outsiders, who were in plainclothes and entered the lawyers’ convention, and began beating them up. Advocate KB Laghari said the five individuals were apprehended and handed over to the police. He asserted that “lawyers are brothers, and no one can make us fight”. Laghari added that Sukkur District Bar Association President Qurban Ali Malano felt unwell during the unrest and was moved to the hospital due to his deteriorating condition. PPP workers allegedly caused disruption The outsiders who caused the clash and disorder during the lawyers’ convention were said to be PPP workers. The central figure of the conflict was reported to be Mairaj Gopang, a worker of the PPP’s Shaheed Benazir Division and an office-bearer of the Peoples Students Federation (PSF). According to lawyers, the disturbance began when Karachi Bar General Secretary Rehman Korai mentioned the name of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar during his speech. Upon hearing this, the alleged PPP workers attacked the lawyers’ leadership, including Aamir Nawaz Waraich, Malano, Laghari, Haseeb Jamali and Shafqat Raheem, during the speech. Although other lawyers present tried to protect their leadership, the senior lawyers received minor injuries and were taken to the hospital. The individuals then began chanting slogans of “Long Live Bhutto” when police brought them to the C-Section Police station. Syed Zain Shah, president of the Sindh United Party and convener of the Save Sindh River Movement, strongly condemned the attack. He asserted that this action was not only an attack on the legal fraternity but also a clear assault on the Constitution, law, democratic values and freedom of expression. Lanjar takes notice Lanjar took a strong notice of the incident. In a strongly-worded statement, the home minister expressed regret over the incident and termed the attack on lawyers as highly condemnable. He stated that those involved in the assault would face strict legal action in accordance with the law. Lanjar emphasised that lawyers were his own community, akin to family, and urged the legal fraternity to avoid internal disputes and maintain unity and discipline. The minister further said that the government would take every possible step to ensure the safety and protection of lawyers. The home minister added that a full investigation was already ordered and responsibility would be determined following the inquiry. Lanjar said restoring a peaceful environment remained a top priority of the government, and all necessary measures were being taken in this regard.",

      "title": "Clashes mar Sindh lawyers’ convention in Sukkur held against 27th amendment; 5 detained",
      "summary": "Police detained five people on Saturday after clashes broke out at the All Sindh Lawyers’ Convention in Sukkur to protest against the 27th Constitutional Amendment . A group of lawyers at the convention, held at the Sukkur District Bar, began shouting slogans against President Asif Ali Zardari, whereas another group of lawyers began chanting in the president’s favour. The disorder intensified with the involvement of plainclothes individuals when a verbal altercation and scuffle broke out between them and lawyers. Meanwhile, some of the protesting lawyers reportedly held five outsiders, who were in plainclothes and entered the lawyers’ convention, and began beating them up. Advocate KB Laghari said the five individuals were apprehended and handed over to the police. He asserted that “lawyers are brothers, and no one can make us fight”. Laghari added that Sukkur District Bar Association President Qurban Ali Malano felt unwell during the unrest and was moved to the hospital due to his deteriorating condition. PPP workers allegedly caused disruption The outsiders who caused the clash and disorder during the lawyers’ convention were said to be PPP workers. The central figure of the conflict was reported to be Mairaj Gopang, a worker of the PPP’s Shaheed Benazir Division and an office-bearer of the Peoples Students Federation (PSF). According to lawyers, the disturbance began when Karachi Bar General Secretary Rehman Korai mentioned the name of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar during his speech. Upon hearing this, the alleged PPP workers attacked the lawyers’ leadership, including Aamir Nawaz Waraich, Malano, Laghari, Haseeb Jamali and Shafqat Raheem, during the speech. Although other lawyers present tried to protect their leadership, the senior lawyers received minor injuries and were taken to the hospital. The individuals then began chanting slogans of “Long Live Bhutto” when police brought them to the C-Section Police station. Syed Zain Shah, president of the Sindh United Party and convener of the Save Sindh River Movement, strongly condemned the attack. He asserted that this action was not only an attack on the legal fraternity but also a clear assault on the Constitution, law, democratic values and freedom of expression.

      "summary_orig": "Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza on Saturday tendered his resignation as a judge of the Lahore High Court (LHC), becoming the first judge to resign from any high court after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was enacted into law. According to family sources, his resignation letter stated that in light of the latest amendment to the Constitution, he could not continue in good conscience. Justice Mirza was appointed as an additional judge of the LHC in March 2014, and his superannuation was due on March 6, 2028. He is the son of late Justice Zia Mehmood Mirza , a former Supreme Court judge who delivered the famous and only dissenting opinion among seven judges in the case pertaining to the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto’s government by then-president Farooq Ahmad Khan Laghari in 1996. The judge had held that Laghari’s move was unjustified and there was no evidence suggesting there was a breakdown of constitutional order to justify exercising his powers under Article 58(2)(b), which allowed the president to dismiss the elected government and which was ultimately removed in the 18th Amendment. A press release from the LHC Bar Association (LHCBA) said its officeholders paid tribute to the judge for his resignation and criticised the 27th Constitutional Amendment for having “divided the higher judiciary into pieces” and being responsible for the “burial of the Constitution”. The LHCBA called on other judges who took oath under the Constitution to also resign from their posts, saying the entire legal community would respect them for the move. The association also announced observing a strike on Monday, saying that lawyers would completely boycott court proceedings after hearings of urgent cases. Justice Mirza’s resignation comes two days after the passage of the contentious 27th Amendment, which has been assailed as a “ flagrant attack ” on judicial independence by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ). The move also follows the resignations of the Supreme Court’s senior puisne judge, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, and Justice Athar Minallah, both of whom wrote strongly worded resignation letters censuring the 27th Amendment. Amid speculation about possible transfers of high court judges, Justices Mohsin Akhtar Ka­­­yani and Saman Rafat Imtiaz of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) have hinted they might not be available to hear cases in the federal capital from next month. 27th Amendment and its impact on judiciary The 27th Amendment, besides bringing changes in other domains , alters the judiciary’s functioning in two areas — constitutional matters and the transfer of judges. The legislation empowers the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan to transfer high court judges without their consent — a provision that has raised concerns with­­in sections of the judiciary. The most notable decision made by the ruling coalition is the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which experts say has dethroned the Supreme Court as the country’s highest judicial forum. The reason for those concerns is that the FCC will now deal with crucial constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil. Additional reporting by Rana Bilal.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday paid a visit to the Cadet College in Wana, where an attack was thwarted earlier this week, saying that elements from “across the border” were responsible for terrorist incidents. In remarks which were televised, Naqvi told tribal elders gathered at the college during his visit that several officials from Pakistan — including himself, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Defence Minister Asif Khawaja — had spoken to Afghanistan about the issue of terrorism. “We repeatedly told them one thing: terrorism should be stopped. Do not destroy the peace in our country,” he said. The minister further said that Pakistan’s economic indicators and its relations with other countries were headed in the right direction. However, elements from “across the border” came to the country to carry out attacks, he said. He also referred to the suicide blast in Islamabad on Tuesday, saying that elements from “across the border” were involved. Naqvi has previously said that both the Wana and Islamabad incidents had Afghan involvement . The Cadet College had come under attack on November 10. While all students and teachers were safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed , the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals. “Our local people are not used [in carrying out these attacks],” Naqvi said. “For some time now, you can see none of the attacks have been carried out by a local citizen,” he added. According to a handout issued by the interior ministry, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Frontier Corps (South) Inspector General Major General Mehr Omar Khan had welcomed the minister at the college. During his visit, Naqvi met officers and soldiers from the Pakistan Army, who had participated in foiling the attack, and also met students and faculty members from the college. The statement said that Naqvi also announced that the college would be renovated, adding that the Pakistan Army and FC had set a remarkable example of bravery and professionalism by safely rescuing all students and teachers.\n‎\n“The enemy wanted to execute an Army Public School -like attack, but our brave soldiers foiled the attempt, sending the terrorists to hell and defeating the conspiracy,” he was quoted as saying. “These are savages who have no link with humanity. No faith permits targeting children, and these beasts have no religion. Calling them human is an insult to humanity,” he said. Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. In November 2022 , the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.",
