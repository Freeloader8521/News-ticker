      "summary_orig": "Information Attaullah Tarar took notice after journalist Benazir Shah said that an account he followed on the social media platform X had made an AI-generated video of her. He asserted that nobody had the right to make “fake videos” or try to harass journalists by defaming them. Shah posted on Sunday on X that an account on the social media platform followed by Tarar had “made an AI video of me”. “But as we’ve said before, we’ll say it again: #AttacksWontSilenceUS ,” she added. Her post was in response to the video in question, shared by an account called PakVocals. The description with the clip claimed that it was a “leaked video” of Shah “dancing in a club in London”. Subsequently, Tarar responded to Shah on Sunday night, saying, “Totally unacceptable and highly condemnable. Notice taken, please. “Nobody has the right to make fake videos and then disseminate them or try to harass any journalist by defaming them. I follow more than 1,900 accounts. I do not condone the behaviour of this account and also assure you that action will be taken,” the minister said. Later, Shah said she appreciated the minister taking the matter seriously. However, she said that she did not want to pursue a case under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) through the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) as “doing so would lend legitimacy to a law and an institution that have been used to harass journalists, silence private citizens, and suppress dissent”. “If the minister and his government are serious about ensuring safety for journalists and citizens, they should scrap Peca and the NCCIA and begin a genuine consultation process to draft legislation that truly addresses journalists’ concerns,” she said. Journalists also rallied behind Shah as the matter garnered attention on social media. “Deep fake, condemnable, culpable crime, should be investigated and the one who doctored the video must be brought to the court of law. My sincere support to fellow brilliant journalist Benazir Shah who always stands by facts, neutrality and truth. More power to you. Stand firm, please,” posted journalist Zahid Gishkori on X. Journalist Asad Ali Toor said he was sure that the person in the video was not Shah. He said he was also certain that the account that shared the video was a “pro PML-N account followed by pro PML-N journalists and the minister”. “This is [a] shameful and disgusting campaign, and I strongly condemn it. At the same time, I want to say all political parties have their own pool of dirt which they time to time launch against their critics. Shameful,” he commented. Journalist Meher Bokhari, referring to the video in question and the accosting of Geo News anchor Shahzeb Khanzada in a separate incident, called for more respect. “This is not who we were meant to become. Whether it’s PTI supporters harassing Shazeb Khanzada or or PML-N supporters circulating fake AI videos of Benazir Shah, none of it reflects who we are. “Both are hardworking journalists, people who have dedicated their lives to informing the public despite constant pressure. Sure, nothing makes sense here anymore, but the least we can do is hold on to our values and our respect for one another. Character is what you choose to keep intact when everything around you falls apart,” she said.",

      "summary_orig": "A Bangladesh court sentenced ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year. The ruling comes months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February. Hasina’s Awami League party has been barred from contesting and it is feared that Monday’s verdict could stoke fresh unrest ahead of the vote. The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court located in the capital Dhaka, delivered the guilty verdict amid tight security and in Hasina’s absence after she fled to India in August 2024. The verdict can be appealed in the Supreme Court. But Hasina’s son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed , told Reuters on the eve of the verdict that they would not appeal unless a democratically elected government took office with the Awami League’s participation. Worst violence since 1971 During the trial, prosecutors told the court that they had uncovered evidence of her direct command to use lethal force to suppress a student-led uprising in July and August 2024. According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most of them by gunfire from security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence. Hasina was represented by a state-appointed defence counsel who told the court that the charges against her were baseless and pleaded for her acquittal. Ahead of the verdict, Hasina dismissed the accusations and the fairness of the Tribunal proceedings, asserting a guilty verdict was “a foregone conclusion”. Bangladesh has been tense ahead of the verdict, with at least 30 crude bomb explosions and 26 vehicles torched across the country over the past few days. There have been no casualties, however.",

      "summary_orig": "Health Minister Mustafa Kamal expressed confidence on Monday that the changes pertaining local governments sought by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) would be addressed in the next constitutional amendment slated for the “coming months”. Kamal made the remarks while addressing a press conference in Karachi, less than a week after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was enacted into law amid protests by the opposition and other quarters. When the 27th Amendment was tabled in the National Assembly on Nov 11, Kamal had referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of the 28th Amendment. Speaking to the media today, he said that changes were initially pitched to be included in the 26th Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year. Kamal then thanked other parties, including the ruling PML-N, and “individual friends from the PPP” and “many friends from the PTI” for “vocally backing” the MQM-P’s changes related to local governments. He said the proposed changes were extensively discussed for over six hours in the parliamentary standing committee meeting called to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment. “We had enough numbers […] We had won our case in the standing committee. We had the numbers. We had the support of the PML-N and others,” he maintained. “But the PPP was not ready to support the [inclusion of] our bill [on local governments] in the 27th Amendment, which resulted in a deadlock,” he added, clarifying that he was not making any allegations in saying so. Kamal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the ruling PML-N then requested the MQM-P to postpone its proposed changes once again as the 27th Amendment included crucial provisions pertaining to the Pakistan Army and the judiciary. “We were assured that they all supported the bill. They asked for one more chance, assuring that this would be included in the next amendment,” he added. Subsequently, the MQM-P decided to accept the request in the “larger interest of the country,” he said. Stressing the importance of changes pertaining to local government, Kamal further stated: “In Pakistan, […] in the coming months, this constitutional amendment will be introduced in the assembly and get approved, and the people will get resources at their doorstep.” Kamal also referred to the Punjab As­­sembly unanimously passing a resolution last month, calling for an amendment to Article 140-A of the Constitution to ensu­­re empowerment and protection of local bodies, along with mandatory and timely elections for effective governance. He deemed the development a success of the MQM-P. Kamal’s remarks come a day after Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said the ruling coalition could introduce another constitutional amendment if the need was felt to “maintain stability” in the country.",

      "summary_orig": "India said on Monday it had signed a “significant” deal that will see the United States supply nearly 10 per cent of the Asian giant’s liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) imports, as it seeks to diversify its energy sources. Relations between Washington and New Delhi plummeted in August after President Donald Trump raised tariffs on India to 50pc , with US officials accusing the country of fuelling Russia’s war in Ukraine by buying its discounted oil. Trump has claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has agreed to cut its Russian oil imports as part of a prospective trade deal — something New Delhi has not confirmed. India and the United States remain in talks, despite disagreements over a range of issues including agricultural trade and the Russian oil purchases. Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri said India had signed the one-year deal for 2.2 million tonnes per annum of LPG, sourced from the US Gulf Coast, providing “close to 10 per cent” of India’s annual imports of the fuel. Puri said it was “the first structured contract of US LPG for the Indian market”. “In our endeavour to provide secure, affordable supplies of LPG to the people of India, we have been diversifying our LPG sourcing,” Puri said in a statement, adding that “one of the largest and the world’s fastest growing LPG market opens up to the US”. In October, Indian state-backed refiner HPCL-Mittal Energy said it halted purchases of Russian crude after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow’s two largest oil companies. Reliance Industries, the privately owned main Indian buyer of Russian crude, has also said it is assessing the implications of the US restrictions, as well as those imposed by the European Union. India’s economy, the fifth-largest in the world, grew at its fastest pace in five quarters in the three months ending June 30, helped by higher government spending and improved consumer sentiment. But US tariffs continue to overshadow the economy, with experts projecting that they could shave anywhere between 60 to 80 basis points off GDP growth this fiscal year, if there is no relaxation soon.",

      "summary_orig": "Politicians and journalists have jumped to the defence of anchorperson Shahzeb Khanzada after videos emerged on social media of him being accosted in public by a man accusing him of acting against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi. The video, which has been circulating on social media since Sunday night, shows a man following Khanzada in what appeared to be a clothing store. In the video, the man told the journalist he should be “ashamed” of “what he has done against Imran” and his wife. For his part, Khanzada — who appeared to be present with his family — did not engage with the man and walked away. While the man did not provide an explanation for the allegations he was levelling against the journalist, PTI’s Shahbaz Gill shared an old clip of Khanzada talking about the Iddat case, filed against Bushra Bibi and Imran by her former husband Khawar Maneka, on his show. The case pertains to Imran and Bushra Bibi’s marriage during the latter’s Iddat period. “This is the filth Shahzeb did,” he said. He added that if the condemnation had come from the media fraternity, then the situation would not have reached this point, an apparent reference to the harassment of the journalist. The incident comes two days after The Economist published an article covering Imran’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as premier, which the party has termed recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary. Many on social media came to Khanzada’s defence, terming the incident “condemnable”. Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the incident was “yet another filthy reminder of the mob mentality Imran Khan has carefully bred within PTI”. “This crowd does not [have] manners, they were never taught dignity, decency or basic humanity. Their entire existence feeds on confrontation, chaos, and bullying. This is not politics, it is brute thuggery masquerading as activism. They know that they can only survive when society is torn down,” said the minister. PPP leader and Sindh Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said he strongly condemned the incident. “You can certainly disagree, but do so within the bounds of decency and respect. Your actions have not affected Shahzeb Khanzada’s honour, but rather [of] those who taught you this behaviour,” he said. Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Senator Faisal Subzwari said the incident was “another glimpse into the filth that had taken root in politics over the past decade”. “When national leaders praise the abuse brigade and give bad names to everyone except their own kind, then these lamentable traditions take root,” he said. Journalist Waseem Abbasi called the incident harassment, adding that this was “no crusade”. “This is disgusting and utterly condemnable,” said Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousufzai. “Khanzada is an honourable man and an outstanding journalist. This incident exposes the ugly face and behaviour of an intolerant cult,” he said. Journalist Asad Ali Toor termed the incident a “shameful campaign” against Khanzada. “I still maintain that Shahzeb in that interview completely exposed Khawar Maneka that his ‘Iddat’ case is a politically motivated case and he is just a disgusting proxy,” he said, adding that the PTI should be thanking him, rather than harassing him. Journalist Matiullah Jan said that Imran’s supporters should learn that harassing a journalist in this manner in the presence of his family members was condemnable. “There are a hundred civilised ways of protesting. Shahzeb Khanzada has left the government and its ministers speechless on many occasions,” he said. Journalist Zahid Gishkori, who has previously worked with Khanzada, said it was “extremely painful to see a strange man” harassing the latter and his family, adding that he stood with the journalist during this difficult time. “This is unacceptable and outright shameful. Harassing someone in a public place is not freedom of expression, it’s intimidation and thuggery,” said sports journalist Faizan Lakhani. “Shahzeb Khanzada is a respected, credible journalist, and this behaviour towards him is shameful. This incident exposes the true face of an intolerant society,” he said. “I strongly condemn the worst kind of fascism and the targeted harassment being inflicted on Shahzeb Khanzada by zombies of a political party,” said journalist Asma Shirazi. The Pakistan Daily founder Hamza Azhar Salam said the PTI had not taken Khanzada to court for defamation because “it knows they will be taken to the cleaners”. “Instead, PTI workers unleashed to harass Pakistan’s most credible journalist in front of his family. We stand by Khanzada and condemn this campaign of harassment,” he said. Meanwhile, Khanzada responded to PTI leader Gill on X, accusing him of lying. “This is classic Shahbaz Gill. When he was a minister, he was caught lying several times and here again he is lying,” he said, adding that he was responsible for reporting court proceedings. “These trolls actually don’t care about facts even if they go in favour of Imran Khan,” he said. “We didn’t just expose the Iddat case but also spoke for Shahbaz Gill, condemned his torture under custody and the use of the outdated treason law against him even when his own party and leaders were refusing to speak for him,” he said. The PTI founder and his wife — who are both currently under arrest — were convicted by an Islamabad court in the Iddat case and sentenced to seven years in jail each on Feb 3, 2024, five days before the general elections. In July the same year, they were acquitted in the case but then arrested on charges related to the sale of state gifts.",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: The Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) has said that despite 16 years of protests, sit-ins and rallies, the issue of enforced disappearances of political workers, students and other residents of Balochistan remains unresolved. Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch urged the state and its institutions to realise that the use of force, extrajudicial killings and disappearances of Baloch citizens would not improve the situation in the province. Instead, he called for a serious political approach to address Balochistan’s long-standing grievances. Flanked by family members of the missing, including VBMP General Secretary Hooran Baloch and activist Ghani Baloch, he said the organisation’s protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club had now completed 6,000 days. “This camp has also been set up in various parts of Balochistan, as well as in Karachi and Islamabad. It is viewed across Pakistan and the world as a symbol of peaceful resistance,” he said. Use of force can’t bring peace to Balochistan, Nasrullah Baloch warns He said that over the past 16 years, the organisation had held protests, seminars and long marches from Quetta to Islamabad, both on foot and by train. Nasrullah Baloch said the VBMP had registered cases of enforced disappearances with the judiciary, inquiry commissions and the federal and provincial governments, and had presented evidence to the relevant authorities despite “serious difficulties and hardships”. “False cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act were filed against me, General Secretary Hooran Baloch, Vice Chairman Mama Qadeer Baloch and others. We faced arrests and torture, but we did not abandon our struggle,” Nasrullah Baloch said. He claimed that two VBMP district coordinators were extrajudicially killed during the movement, yet the campaign continued. Families of missing persons, he said, submit complete details of their loved ones to the VBMP, which then forwards the cases to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances and to the provincial government. “The commission initiates legal proceedings within a week and issues notices to the relevant institutions. We also guide victims’ families about legal requirements,” he said. Drawing on years of experience, he urged the state to understand that peace in Bal­ochistan could not be restored through force. “Thousands of Baloch have been forcibly disappeared and thousands have been killed extrajudicially, yet the situation continues to deteriorate. We appeal to the state to refrain from using force in Balochistan. The issue is political and must be resolved through political dialogue,” he stressed. He also demanded that all citizens be treated in accordance with the law, that missing persons be recovered, that those facing charges be produced before courts and that extrajudicial arrests and killings be stopped. He called for legislation “in line with human dignity and constitutional principles” to address enforced disappearances. Nasrullah Baloch also urged the families of missing persons not to remain silent. “Come forward with complete details of your loved ones,” he appealed. Published in Dawn, November 17th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Kabul wants to bolster trade with C. Asia states • Afghan traders say Islamabad still shortest, cheapest route to seaports • Uzbek president proposes new bloc AFGHANISTAN is seeking to significantly bolster trade with the oil-rich countries of Central Asia as it attempts to end its economic dependence on Pakistan, which has historically been Kabul’s biggest trading partner. However, experts warn that geography, high costs, and political constraints will hinder efforts by Afghanistan’s cash-strapped and unrecognised Taliban government to shift trade to Central Asia, according to a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty report. Kabul’s attempts to find new trade partners come after the worst outbreak of hostilities with Islamabad in years. The neighbours exchanged military attacks last month, killing dozens of people and leading to Pakistan closing its border with Afghanistan. The month-long border closure has inflicted some $200 million in losses for Afghan traders, who rely on Pakistani seaports to access international markets. Similarly, Pakistan had been exporting fresh fruits, cement, medicines, surgical items, agricultural tools, fabrics, shoes, plastic pipes and sanitary items, cosmetics, and a variety of other locally manufactured products valued at around $100–200m per month to the neighbouring country. ‘Trade alternatives’ Senior Taliban officials have urged Afghan traders and investors to end their activities in Pakistan and find new business and trade opportunities in Central Asia. “We are actively working with our northern neighbors to find reliable trade alternatives,” Taliban Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi said last week. Abdul Ghani Baradar, a Taliban deputy prime minister, accused Islamabad of using trade as a “tool of political pressure” and framed the ongoing border closure as evidence that Kabul must reduce its reliance on its neighbour. Swiss-based Afghan expert Torek Farhadi said the Taliban’s new emphasis on trade with Central Asia is “largely political posturing”. Central Asia is landlocked, and Afghanistan must rely on long-distance overland corridors to reach markets. The region’s tariff structures impose high costs on many Afghan exports, especially agricultural goods. The logistics of handling, storing, and transporting perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables remain underdeveloped. “To make the northern route commercially viable, Afghanistan would need to remove tariffs and offer incentives to its Central Asian partners,” Mr Farhadi told RFE/RL. “But for the government in Kabul, customs revenue is one of their primary income sources.” Meanwhile, several railway projects, crucial for scaling cross-border trade, remain unfinished or lack financing. The Taliban’s lack of international recognition also prevents it from accessing funds from global institutions like the World Bank and IMF, limiting investment in the infrastructure needed to support northbound trade, Farhadi said. Those factors have ensured that Afghanistan’s trade with Central Asia, although growing, has remained modest. Trade between Afghanistan and the five Central Asian states — Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan — has grown steadily, reaching nearly $1.7 billion, according to Afghan officials. Still dependent Despite Afghanistan’s growing trade with Central Asia, Kabul remains dependent on Pakistan as Islamabad has long provided its neighbor with the fastest and most affordable access to global markets. The border crossings at Torkham and Chaman remain the backbone of Afghanistan’s commercial lifelines, but the repeated skirmishes in recent months caused frequent border closures. The most recent closures following armed clashes between Pakistani and Taliban forces left thousands of trucks stranded for weeks. But for Afghan traders, few alternatives can match Pakistan’s proximity or port infrastructure. Shifting trade away from those routes means higher transport costs, longer transit times, and increased logistical risks, experts say. “The reality is that Afghanistan’s shortest and cheapest route to seaports as well as India and other South Asian markets is through Pakistan,” said Azarakhsh Hafizi, the former head of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce. “We need all transit routes to remain open. It would benefit not only Afghanistan and Pakistan, but it is also important for the regional economic integration,” said Hafizi, who previously held membership in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Saarc. Regional bloc proposed Uzbek President Shavkat Mirzi­yoyev proposed on Sunday forming a regional co-operation organisation he called the “Community of Central Asia”, in what he said was a bid to promote economic integration in the region of more than 80 million people, Reuters reported. In a speech at a meeting in Tashkent of the leaders of the five post-Soviet republics of Central Asia, as well as Azerbaijan, Mirziyoyev suggested transforming regular meetings between the leaders of the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia into a formal regional bloc. He also stressed the need to boost economic, security and environmental cooperation. There was no immediate indication of the other countries’ response to the Uzbek proposal, but all five countries have in recent years said they want greater regional integration, where ties were sometimes testy in decades past. All five leaders visited Washington in unison for talks with US President Donald Trump earlier this month. Two of the countries, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, earlier this year settled a longstanding border conflict that had claimed hundreds of lives. Published in Dawn, November 17th, 2025",

Swiss-based Afghan expert Torek Farhadi said the Taliban’s new emphasis on trade with Central Asia is “largely political posturing”. Central Asia is landlocked, and Afghanistan must rely on long-distance overland corridors to reach markets. The region’s tariff structures impose high costs on many Afghan exports, especially agricultural goods. The logistics of handling, storing, and transporting perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables remain underdeveloped. “To make the northern route commercially viable, Afghanistan would need to remove tariffs and offer incentives to its Central Asian partners,” Mr Farhadi told RFE/RL. “But for the government in Kabul, customs revenue is one of their primary income sources.” Meanwhile, several railway projects, crucial for scaling cross-border trade, remain unfinished or lack financing. The Taliban’s lack of international recognition also prevents it from accessing funds from global institutions like the World Bank and IMF, limiting investment in the infrastructure needed to support northbound trade, Farhadi said. Those factors have ensured that Afghanistan’s trade with Central Asia, although growing, has remained modest. Trade between Afghanistan and the five Central Asian states — Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan — has grown steadily, reaching nearly $1.7 billion, according to Afghan officials. Still dependent Despite Afghanistan’s growing trade with Central Asia, Kabul remains dependent on Pakistan as Islamabad has long provided its neighbor with the fastest and most affordable access to global markets. The border crossings at Torkham and Chaman remain the backbone of Afghanistan’s commercial lifelines, but the repeated skirmishes in recent months caused frequent border closures. The most recent closures following armed clashes between Pakistani and Taliban forces left thousands of trucks stranded for weeks. But for Afghan traders, few alternatives can match Pakistan’s proximity or port infrastructure. Shifting trade away from those routes means higher transport costs, longer transit times, and increased logistical risks, experts say. “The reality is that Afghanistan’s shortest and cheapest route to seaports as well as India and other South Asian markets is through Pakistan,” said Azarakhsh Hafizi, the former head of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce. “We need all transit routes to remain open. It would benefit not only Afghanistan and Pakistan, but it is also important for the regional economic integration,” said Hafizi, who previously held membership in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Saarc. Regional bloc proposed Uzbek President Shavkat Mirzi­yoyev proposed on Sunday forming a regional co-operation organisation he called the “Community of Central Asia”, in what he said was a bid to promote economic integration in the region of more than 80 million people, Reuters reported. In a speech at a meeting in Tashkent of the leaders of the five post-Soviet republics of Central Asia, as well as Azerbaijan, Mirziyoyev suggested transforming regular meetings between the leaders of the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia into a formal regional bloc. He also stressed the need to boost economic, security and environmental cooperation. There was no immediate indication of the other countries’ response to the Uzbek proposal, but all five countries have in recent years said they want greater regional integration, where ties were sometimes testy in decades past. All five leaders visited Washington in unison for talks with US President Donald Trump earlier this month. Two of the countries, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, earlier this year settled a longstanding border conflict that had claimed hundreds of lives. Published in Dawn, November 17th, 2025",

      "summary": "• Kabul wants to bolster trade with C. Asia states • Afghan traders say Islamabad still shortest, cheapest route to seaports • Uzbek president proposes new bloc AFGHANISTAN is seeking to significantly bolster trade with the oil-rich countries of Central Asia as it attempts to end its economic dependence on Pakistan, which has historically been Kabul’s biggest trading partner. However, experts warn that geography, high costs, and political constraints will hinder efforts by Afghanistan’s cash-strapped and unrecognised Taliban government to shift trade to Central Asia, according to a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty report. Kabul’s attempts to find new trade partners come after the worst outbreak of hostilities with Islamabad in years. The neighbours exchanged military attacks last month, killing dozens of people and leading to Pakistan closing its border with Afghanistan. The month-long border closure has inflicted some $200 million in losses for Afghan traders, who rely on Pakistani seaports to access international markets. Similarly, Pakistan had been exporting fresh fruits, cement, medicines, surgical items, agricultural tools, fabrics, shoes, plastic pipes and sanitary items, cosmetics, and a variety of other locally manufactured products valued at around $100–200m per month to the neighbouring country. ‘Trade alternatives’ Senior Taliban officials have urged Afghan traders and investors to end their activities in Pakistan and find new business and trade opportunities in Central Asia. “We are actively working with our northern neighbors to find reliable trade alternatives,” Taliban Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi said last week.

      "summary_orig": "Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said on Sunday that Pakistan welcomed Iran’s offer of mediation between Islamabad and Kabul and would “not shy away from” it. “Iran is a brotherly, friendly country. Pakistan is always in favour of finding peaceful resolutions of issues through dialogue and diplomacy, and we appreciate the offer of mediation of our brotherly country, Iran,” Andrabi told Dawn upon a query about reports that Tehran was working to convene a regional meeting for mediation between Islamabad and the Afghan Taliban. “We believe that Iran can play an important role. We would not shy away from any mediatory role by Iran. Mediations are always welcome,” Andrabi said, adding that Pakistan had a “very strong case”. He further stated: “Generally, mediations are resented by a country or a side which is on a weak legal or a political case. Pakistan’s case on this issue, on terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, is very strong. So, obviously we will not shy away from mediation.” Pakistan, which has been grappling with the problem of terrorism for long, has been demanding that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. But, the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. Earlier this month, a third round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators from Turkiye and Qatar, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to prevent cross-border terrorism. The talks had followed deadly border clashes between the two neighbours in October. The border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on the night of October 11 and continued into the next morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm or deny whether it was behind the strikes, but maintained that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. A ceasefire was then agreed upon on the evening of October 15, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. But on November 7, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “ over ” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban have suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Iran and Russia called for continued dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan to resolve their ongoing disputes on cross-border terrorism. Previously on Nov 9, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had spoken with his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul. According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi had also expressed Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries. The same day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to suffer casualties among its security forces and civilian population in terror attacks, which authorities link to Afghanistan .",
