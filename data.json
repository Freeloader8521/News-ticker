A large wildfire erupted on a hillside in Uiseong County, North Gyeongsang Province, at around 3:15 p.m., less than a year after a major blaze swept through the area last spring, according to authorities. The cause of the fire has yet to be determined. Authorities issued the Level 2 response at 3:41 p.m. and deployed 10 helicopters, 51 fire suppression vehicles and 315 firefighters and other personnel. Some of the helicopters, however, reportedly have not taken off due to strong winds. The government issued an evacuation order instructing nearby residents to move to their respective village community centers as the fire spread rapidly amid the strong winds. Humidity at the site of the fire was measured at 33 percent. \"An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way, and the government will deploy all available resources to prevent casualties,\" a forest official said.",

      "summary_orig": "A feel-good, eco-friendly twist at a major Korean TV awards show has unexpectedly turned into a heated controversy. After comedian Yoo Jae-suk accepted his grand prize holding a Lego bouquet instead of real flowers, South Korea’s flower industry erupted in protest, warning that the move could hurt already struggling farmers and florists. The Korea Florist Association said the decision to replace traditional fresh bouquets with toy flowers at broadcast awards ceremonies “adds another wound” to growers and small shop owners who are battling weak consumer demand and rising costs. The group said that using plastic or toy bouquets on such high-profile stages risks making real flowers appear “inefficient or disposable,” even though millions of people rely on flower sales for their livelihoods. “More than 20,000 small flower shops and countless flower farms depend directly on fresh flower consumption,” the association said. “At a time when the government is promoting flower use through the Flower Industry Promotion Act, seeing a major broadcaster turn to toy bouquets sends the",

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, “Pakistan Navy demonstrated its operational readiness and combat preparedness through a comprehensive exercise in the north Arabian Sea, showcasing both conventional and unmanned capabilities, as per dictates of evolving naval warfare. “The exercise included the successful live firing of LY-80 (N) surface-to-air-missile from a vertical launching system at an extended range, validating the long-range capabilities of Pakistan Navy’s modern air defence systems,” said ISPR.

It added that the Pakistan Fleet commander witnessed the exercise, which showcased Pakistan Navy’s ability to “employ advanced systems”.

      "summary_orig": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader succumbed to his injuries on Saturday morning after being critically wounded in a bomb blast near a madressah in the Wana bazaar area. Police said on Friday that a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) was planted in the Konra Cheena area near a religious seminary to target Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, who was also the district president of Wafaqul Madaris al Arabia. He was immediately taken to Dera Ismail Khan for medical treatment but breathed his last on the way. Lower South Waziristan District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway. He said law enforcement agencies were examining all aspects of the incident, adding that the evidence collected from the site was being analysed to trace those responsible. The attack on Maulana Sultan is the latest in a series of incidents targeting religious scholars and JUI-F leaders in South Waziristan, particularly in Wana and the Birmal tehsil, over the past two years. In a statement posted on X, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his deep grief on Sultan’s death, describing him as a “devoted and courageous leader”. “This incident is not merely an attack on an individual but an assault on the moderate, peaceful, and democratic ideology,“ he said, asserting that the JUI-F was the “flag-bearer” of these values. “Following Bajaur, the targeting of freedom-loving and peace-advocating scholars in regions carrying deep religious significance like South Waziristan marks a deeply alarming pattern,” he said. Fazl recalled that in March 2025, JUI-F’s South Waziristan Emir was “severely injured” in a bomb blast and “till date remains under treatment at Multan’s Nishtar Hospital”. He further pointed out that former JUI-F district president Maulana Mirza Jan Wazir had been injured in a terrorist attack in June 2024 and had now passed away. Fazl said that the targeting of a party such as the JUI-F, which believed in “moderation, tolerance and constitutional struggle”, was extremely upsetting and a moment for serious reflection. The JUI-F chief said such attacks on scholars were “not only resounding proof of the failure and negligence of security institutions but also sinister attempts to suppress the peaceful narrative” that his party had been promoting for years across the country, including tribal areas. “The sole crime of such scholars is that they advocate for reason over the gun, love over hatred, and peace over discord,” Fazl lamented. He asserted that the JUI-F had always opposed oppression and violence, spoken for the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and adopted the struggle for reform and peace as its motto while remaining within the framework of the state. “This is precisely why the party, while staying away from all shades of extremism and radicalism, is recognised as a balanced, responsible, and mainstream national political force.” Fazl called on the “institutions responsible for national security” to recognise their constitutional and moral obligations; ensure the establishment of peace and the effective protection of scholars across the country, particularly in the tribal districts; and fulfil the demands for justice by meting out punishment to the elements involved in these tragic incidents. He affirmed that the JUI-F would continue its struggle for peace, religious harmony, democratic values, and constitutional supremacy in the country with “full resolve, no matter how many sacrifices it must give along the way”.

Police sources said security personnel reached the site immediately, cordoned off the area, and shifted the injured leader to a local hospital. The DPO confirmed that initial inquiries suggest the blast was carried out using an IED, deliberately targeting the peace committee chief. He said police were examining all aspects of the incident and had launched a search operation to apprehend the perpetrators.",

In a statement posted on X, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his deep grief on Sultan’s death, describing him as a “devoted and courageous leader”. “This incident is not merely an attack on an individual but an assault on the moderate, peaceful, and democratic ideology,“ he said, asserting that the JUI-F was the “flag-bearer” of these values. “Following Bajaur, the targeting of freedom-loving and peace-advocating scholars in regions carrying deep religious significance like South Waziristan marks a deeply alarming pattern,” he said. Fazl recalled that in March 2025, JUI-F’s South Waziristan Emir was “severely injured” in a bomb blast and “till date remains under treatment at Multan’s Nishtar Hospital”. He further pointed out that former JUI-F district president Maulana Mirza Jan Wazir had been injured in a terrorist attack in June 2024 and had now passed away. Fazl said that the targeting of a party such as the JUI-F, which believed in “moderation, tolerance and constitutional struggle”, was extremely upsetting and a moment for serious reflection. The JUI-F chief said such attacks on scholars were “not only resounding proof of the failure and negligence of security institutions but also sinister attempts to suppress the peaceful narrative” that his party had been promoting for years across the country, including tribal areas. “The sole crime of such scholars is that they advocate for reason over the gun, love over hatred, and peace over discord,” Fazl lamented. He asserted that the JUI-F had always opposed oppression and violence, spoken for the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and adopted the struggle for reform and peace as its motto while remaining within the framework of the state. “This is precisely why the party, while staying away from all shades of extremism and radicalism, is recognised as a balanced, responsible, and mainstream national political force.” Fazl called on the “institutions responsible for national security” to recognise their constitutional and moral obligations; ensure the establishment of peace and the effective protection of scholars across the country, particularly in the tribal districts; and fulfil the demands for justice by meting out punishment to the elements involved in these tragic incidents. He affirmed that the JUI-F would continue its struggle for peace, religious harmony, democratic values, and constitutional supremacy in the country with “full resolve, no matter how many sacrifices it must give along the way”. Peace committee chief unhurt in blast Separately, a suspected improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeted the vehicle of peace committee chief Qadeem Khan in the Barwand area of South Waziristan’s Servekai tehsil. The remains of the vehicle. — Photo provided by author Upper South Waziristan DPO Arshad Khan said that the vehicle sustained significant damage in the attack, but the peace committee chief escaped with minor injuries. Police sources said security personnel reached the site immediately, cordoned off the area, and shifted the injured leader to a local hospital. The DPO confirmed that initial inquiries suggest the blast was carried out using an IED, deliberately targeting the peace committee chief. He said police were examining all aspects of the incident and had launched a search operation to apprehend the perpetrators.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Saturday departed for Hyderabad for a day-long trip to mobilise the public for a nationwide street movement . CM Afridi arrived in Karachi yesterday on a four-day visit to garner momentum in the lead up to the planned February 8 protests , which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged. “[We] have departed from Karachi for Hyderabad,” announced PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shortly after 12pm. “God willing, Hyderabad will also come out on the streets massively like Karachi,” Sheikh said, hailing the massive public response received by CM Afridi in the metropolis a day earlier. In a post on its official X account, the PTI detailed the KP CM‘s itinerary for his trip to Hyderabad, where he will address the local press club, attend the Insaf Students Federation’s convention and participate in “street movement activities”. The party agenda also lists an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) in Hyderabad, though the lawyers’ body claimed it had never granted permission for Afridi to visit or address the bar. The bar association’s general secretary had invited the KP CM in a letter dated Jan 7. However, in a press release issued on Jan 8, the HCBA clarified that its executive committee had rejected the application by a clear majority. It said the general secretary issued the letter in his personal capacity and used the bar’s letterhead without consent. Speaking to the media before departing, CM Afridi said, “We were extremely happy with the way we were welcomed in different districts of Karachi and the passion and spirit we saw in the public. We thank everyone.” Referring to his planned public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi on Sunday, the chief minister said the people of Karachi had “another big responsibility”. “We have to make this jalsa successful under all circumstances and send a message to the world that Karachi was Imran Khan’s, is Imran Khan’s, and, God willing, will remain Imran Khan’s,” he stressed. At around 2pm, the PTI shared a video , saying CM Afridi and his convoy had reached Jamshoro. “Toward Hyderabad for street movement [ sic ],” said KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi on X, sharing a picture with CM Afridi, Sheikh and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja. The PTI’s KP chapter stated on X that the Sindh United Party (SUP) was ready to welcome Afridi. In another post, the PTI shared a video of PTI Hyderabad Youth Wing’s “enthusiastic” members chanting slogans as they stood prepared to welcome the KP CM at the Hyderabad Insaf House. Speaking to reporters, Sheikh said the PTI caravan will visit Jamshoro and Kotri as well. The PTI Sindh president also shared a video showing people showering petals on Afridi in a “splendid welcome” at Karachi’s Toll Plaza. Earlier on Saturday, Sheikh and Raja, along with others , gathered at Karachi‘s Hassan Square to record a statement as they began their journey to join CM Afridi’s convoy. Umer Dar , the brother of Usman Dar who quit the party in the wake of the May 9 riots, was among those present . Raja said: “Dear citizens of Sindh, we are present on your land today. I am standing opposite Karachi’s Hassan Square. As you know, a grand jalsa is being organised at 4:30pm tomorrow at Bagh-i-Jinnah under the shadow of Mazar-i-Quaid. “We have come before you with Imran Khan’s message. This is a message of freedom […], of defending the water of Sindh’s farmers,” he said. The PTI secretary general urged the public to attend the powershow and collectively raise their voice against the imprisonment of PTI leaders and the “violation of their privacy”. “We have to tell the oppressor that ‘we are alive, you cannot erase us’,” he said, calling the PTI and its founder “Pakistan’s future”. “We are the patriots of Pakistan, we are the sons of Sindh, we are the guardians of Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber Paktunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan,“ he said. A schedule shared by the PTI on X lists CM Afridi’s planned activities for Sunday, adding that he would meet Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah on Monday (Jan 12).",

CM Afridi arrived in Karachi yesterday on a four-day visit to garner momentum in the lead up to the planned February 8 protests , which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged. “[We] have departed from Karachi for Hyderabad,” announced PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shortly after 12pm. “God willing, Hyderabad will also come out on the streets massively like Karachi,” Sheikh said, hailing the massive public response received by CM Afridi in the metropolis a day earlier. In a post on its official X account, the PTI detailed the KP CM‘s itinerary for his trip to Hyderabad, where he will address the local press club, attend the Insaf Students Federation’s convention and participate in “street movement activities”. The party agenda also lists an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) in Hyderabad, though the lawyers’ body claimed it had never granted permission for Afridi to visit or address the bar. The bar association’s general secretary had invited the KP CM in a letter dated Jan 7. However, in a press release issued on Jan 8, the HCBA clarified that its executive committee had rejected the application by a clear majority. It said the general secretary issued the letter in his personal capacity and used the bar’s letterhead without consent. Speaking to the media before departing, CM Afridi said, “We were extremely happy with the way we were welcomed in different districts of Karachi and the passion and spirit we saw in the public. We thank everyone.” Referring to his planned public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi on Sunday, the chief minister said the people of Karachi had “another big responsibility”. “We have to make this jalsa successful under all circumstances and send a message to the world that Karachi was Imran Khan’s, is Imran Khan’s, and, God willing, will remain Imran Khan’s,” he stressed. At around 2pm, the PTI shared a video , saying CM Afridi and his convoy had reached Jamshoro. “Toward Hyderabad for street movement [ sic ],” said KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi on X, sharing a picture with CM Afridi, Sheikh and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja. The PTI’s KP chapter stated on X that the Sindh United Party (SUP) was ready to welcome Afridi. In another post, the PTI shared a video of PTI Hyderabad Youth Wing’s “enthusiastic” members chanting slogans as they stood prepared to welcome the KP CM at the Hyderabad Insaf House. Speaking to reporters, Sheikh said the PTI caravan will visit Jamshoro and Kotri as well. The PTI Sindh president also shared a video showing people showering petals on Afridi in a “splendid welcome” at Karachi’s Toll Plaza. Earlier on Saturday, Sheikh and Raja, along with others , gathered at Karachi‘s Hassan Square to record a statement as they began their journey to join CM Afridi’s convoy. Umer Dar , the brother of Usman Dar who quit the party in the wake of the May 9 riots, was among those present . Raja said: “Dear citizens of Sindh, we are present on your land today. I am standing opposite Karachi’s Hassan Square. As you know, a grand jalsa is being organised at 4:30pm tomorrow at Bagh-i-Jinnah under the shadow of Mazar-i-Quaid. “We have come before you with Imran Khan’s message. This is a message of freedom […], of defending the water of Sindh’s farmers,” he said. The PTI secretary general urged the public to attend the powershow and collectively raise their voice against the imprisonment of PTI leaders and the “violation of their privacy”. “We have to tell the oppressor that ‘we are alive, you cannot erase us’,” he said, calling the PTI and its founder “Pakistan’s future”. “We are the patriots of Pakistan, we are the sons of Sindh, we are the guardians of Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber Paktunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan,“ he said. A schedule shared by the PTI on X lists CM Afridi’s planned activities for Sunday, adding that he would meet Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah on Monday (Jan 12).",

      "summary_orig": "The capture by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and the killing in the operation of 32 Cubans assigned to protect him represent a major blow for the island’s revered intelligence services, experts say. Fearful of betrayal by dissenters within Venezuela’s ranks, the leftist Maduro — like his late mentor Hugo Chavez — sourced his security detail in communist-ruled Cuba. But the Cubans proved little match for the US special forces sent by helicopter to snatch Maduro from a military compound after US jets had pummelled Venezuela’s air defences. Of the 32 Cubans killed — along with 23 Venezuelan troops — 21 were from the Cuban interior ministry, which oversees the intelligence services, officials said. The remaining 11 were from Cuba’s military. Experts consulted by AFP agreed that the key to the seamless execution of the US operation — meticulously prepared for months, in complete secrecy — was the element of surprise. But former Venezuelan military officer Jose Gustavo Arocha of the Center for a Secure Free Society, a US think tank specialising in defence issues, also suggested that Cuba had misjudged the threat. Cuban intelligence “convinced the Maduro regime and its security agencies that the United States would never attack on Venezuelan territory,” Arocha said. Former US intelligence officer Fulton Armstrong, who is now a Latin America researcher at American University in Washington, also pointed to intelligence failures. Chief among them, he said, was the failure to anticipate the attack and then to detect helicopters entering Venezuela’s airspace. “Even a five or 10-minute warning would have made a massive difference for the guards and for Maduro,” the former CIA agent said. US forces, however, had a major advantage in the form of stealth drones, used to monitor the Venezuelan leader’s movements in real time, as well as more advanced weapons and combat gear. Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to Cuba and Venezuela, argued that Cuban intelligence underestimated US access to “insider cooperation in Venezuela” — an informant within Maduro’s camp. Citing sources close to the operation, The New York Times reported that a CIA source within the Venezuelan government revealed Maduro’s location. The United States had issued a reward of $50 million for information leading to his capture. Aura of invincibility For decades, the Cuban secret service, trained during the Soviet era by the KGB, enjoyed a reputation for invincibility. Besides having foiled some 600 assassination attempts against late leader Fidel Castro, Cuba was reputed for its ability to infiltrate foreign intelligence services and recruit high-ranking informants, particularly Americans. The most recent case to come to light was that of Victor Manuel Rocha, a former US diplomat sentenced in 2024 to 15 years in prison after working for over four decades for the Cuban state. But Cuba “didn’t adequately read the Trump administration,” said Arocha, noting that the administration’s National Security Strategy unveiled in December clearly articulated Trump’s goal of asserting US dominance over Latin America. Washington had regularly denounced Cuba’s role, since the 2000s, in the Venezuelan security apparatus. The routine response from Caracas and Havana was that Cuba, in return for Venezuelan oil supplies, provided its ally with doctors and humanitarian workers. Arocha argued that “so many years … doing the same thing successfully” blinded the Cubans to Trump’s willingness to defy diplomacy and international law, so they did not see him coming. The Republican leader stunned the world by ordering the capture of the Venezuelan president in what his administration said was a law enforcement operation that did not require authorisation from Congress. “All the capabilities of Cuban intelligence were blocked for the first time in the region … because their traditional methods became irrelevant against this new decision-making style,” Arocha said.",

Fearful of betrayal by dissenters within Venezuela’s ranks, the leftist Maduro — like his late mentor Hugo Chavez — sourced his security detail in communist-ruled Cuba. But the Cubans proved little match for the US special forces sent by helicopter to snatch Maduro from a military compound after US jets had pummelled Venezuela’s air defences. Of the 32 Cubans killed — along with 23 Venezuelan troops — 21 were from the Cuban interior ministry, which oversees the intelligence services, officials said. The remaining 11 were from Cuba’s military. Experts consulted by AFP agreed that the key to the seamless execution of the US operation — meticulously prepared for months, in complete secrecy — was the element of surprise. But former Venezuelan military officer Jose Gustavo Arocha of the Center for a Secure Free Society, a US think tank specialising in defence issues, also suggested that Cuba had misjudged the threat. Cuban intelligence “convinced the Maduro regime and its security agencies that the United States would never attack on Venezuelan territory,” Arocha said. Former US intelligence officer Fulton Armstrong, who is now a Latin America researcher at American University in Washington, also pointed to intelligence failures. Chief among them, he said, was the failure to anticipate the attack and then to detect helicopters entering Venezuela’s airspace. “Even a five or 10-minute warning would have made a massive difference for the guards and for Maduro,” the former CIA agent said. US forces, however, had a major advantage in the form of stealth drones, used to monitor the Venezuelan leader’s movements in real time, as well as more advanced weapons and combat gear. Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to Cuba and Venezuela, argued that Cuban intelligence underestimated US access to “insider cooperation in Venezuela” — an informant within Maduro’s camp. Citing sources close to the operation, The New York Times reported that a CIA source within the Venezuelan government revealed Maduro’s location. The United States had issued a reward of $50 million for information leading to his capture. Aura of invincibility For decades, the Cuban secret service, trained during the Soviet era by the KGB, enjoyed a reputation for invincibility. Besides having foiled some 600 assassination attempts against late leader Fidel Castro, Cuba was reputed for its ability to infiltrate foreign intelligence services and recruit high-ranking informants, particularly Americans. The most recent case to come to light was that of Victor Manuel Rocha, a former US diplomat sentenced in 2024 to 15 years in prison after working for over four decades for the Cuban state. But Cuba “didn’t adequately read the Trump administration,” said Arocha, noting that the administration’s National Security Strategy unveiled in December clearly articulated Trump’s goal of asserting US dominance over Latin America. Washington had regularly denounced Cuba’s role, since the 2000s, in the Venezuelan security apparatus. The routine response from Caracas and Havana was that Cuba, in return for Venezuelan oil supplies, provided its ally with doctors and humanitarian workers. Arocha argued that “so many years … doing the same thing successfully” blinded the Cubans to Trump’s willingness to defy diplomacy and international law, so they did not see him coming. The Republican leader stunned the world by ordering the capture of the Venezuelan president in what his administration said was a law enforcement operation that did not require authorisation from Congress. “All the capabilities of Cuban intelligence were blocked for the first time in the region … because their traditional methods became irrelevant against this new decision-making style,” Arocha said.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Friday continued to make a case for him deserving the Nobel Peace Prize, yet again highlighting his role in ending the May 2025 conflict between Pakistan and India. Taking media queries after a meeting with oil and gas executives at White House in Washington, Trump was asked about Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado’s offer to share her Nobel Peace Prize with the US president. “Norway is very embarrassed with what took place,” Trump said; the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for selecting the Nobel Peace Prize laureates. “Whether people like Trump or don’t like Trump, I settled eight wars — big ones,” Trump said — a claim that he has repeated in the past. “Some going on for 36 years, 32 years, 31 years, 28 years, 25 years. Some just getting ready to start, like India and Pakistan, where already eight jets were shot out in the air,” Trump said. He pointed out that he arranged a ceasefire between the two countries in “rapid order without nuclear weapons”. “I can’t think of anybody in history that should get the Nobel prize more than me, and I don’t want to be bragging but nobody else settled wars. Obama got the Nobel prize . He had no idea why. He still has no idea,” Trump said, calling former US president Barack Obama a “bad president”. “You should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. These were major wars. These were wars that nobody thought could be stopped. President Putin called me [and] he said about two of the wars that he’s been trying to stop them for 10 years [but] he wasn’t able to do it. He couldn’t believe it,” Trump said. “So, in theory, you should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. Every war was major. But I don’t care about that; I care about saving lives. I’ve saved tens of millions of lives,” he added, before recalling his Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in September. “The prime minister of Pakistan came here and he made a very public statement. He said that President Trump saved a minimum [of] 10 million lives having to do with Pakistan and India, and that was going to be raging.” Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared in April 2025 when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was, without evidence, blamed on Islamabad, which strongly refuted the allegations. The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in May with the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries. India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks. Initially stating that five jets were shot down during the May conflict — albeit without specifying of which side — Trump gradually raised that number to seven in October , and then eight in November . He has also praised Chief of the Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on several occasions, calling him a “ highly respected general ”, a “ great fighter ” and “ my favourite ”.",

In a statement, FO said, “For their safety and security, Pakistani nationals are advised to avoid all unnecessary travel to the Islamic Republic of Iran until conditions improve.” It also advised Pakistani nationals residing in Iran to exercise “extreme caution, remain vigilant, minimise non-essential travel, and stay in regular contact with the Pakistani missions” in Tehran, Zahidan and Mashhad. The FO also shared the phone numbers for the Pakistan embassy in the three cities; Tehran +98-21-66-9413-88/89/90/91, +98-21-66-9448-88/90, +98 910 764 8298; Zahidan +98 54 33 22 3389, +989046145412; Mashhad +98 910 762 5302, +98 937 180 7175. Protests have taken place across Iran for nearly two weeks in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions. Iranian rights group HRANA said on Friday it had documented at least 62 deaths, including 14 security personnel and 48 protesters, since demonstrations began on December 28. At the start of January, US President Donald Trump had warned that the US was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran’s security forces killed protesters. In response, in his first comments on the escalating protests, Khamenei on Friday called the demonstrators “vandals” and “saboteurs”. In a speech broadcast on state TV, he said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians”, in apparent reference to Israel’s June war against the Islamic republic, which the US supported and joined with strikes of its own. He predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution. For his part, Trump issued a new warning to Iran’s leaders on Friday, saying: “You better not start shooting because we’ll start shooting too.” “I just hope the protesters in Iran are going to be safe, because that’s a very dangerous place right now,” he added. Earlier this week, Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson said Islamabad firmly opposed any foreign interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, including Iran, in its first public comments since protests erupted. He said Pakistan viewed the situation in Iran as an internal matter and rejected external pressure or aggression. The spokesperson stressed that Pakistan did not wish to comment on Iran’s internal developments.",

      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday that security forces killed eleven terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said the operations were carried out on Jan 8 and that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It said that an IBO was conducted by the security forces in North Waziristan district on the reported presence of terrorists. During the operation, troops engaged the terrorists, and six were killed after an “intense fire exchange”. “Another joint IBO by police and security forces was conducted in Kurram district. In the ensuing fire exchange, five khawarij were effectively neutralised,” it said. The statement said weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces, law enforcement agencies and the target killing of innocent civilians”. It added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate other terrorists in the area, adding that the counterterrorism campaign would continue at “full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the “professional capabilities of the armed forces” for the successful operations. “We will continue the war against terrorism until it is completely eliminated,” the premier said, according to the Prime Minister’s Office. He said that Pakistan’s armed forces, as well as the police, remained engaged in combat with the enemies of the country. “The entire nation, including myself, stands shoulder to shoulder with the security forces in their unwavering resolve to protect the homeland,” he said. President Asif Ali Zardari also lauded the efforts of the security forces, stating that “the role of security forces and law enforcement agencies in protecting the lives and property of the people is commendable”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. In a press conference earlier this week, the Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025.",

      "title_orig": "Venezuela says in talks with US to restore diplomatic ties",
      "summary_orig": "Venezuela said on Friday it had launched talks with the United States on restoring diplomatic ties, days after US forces deposed Nicolas Maduro as its president. It was the latest sign of cooperation following the leftist leader’s capture and US President Donald Trump’s claim to be “in charge” of the South American country. Officials said US diplomats were in Caracas to discuss reopening the country’s embassy, while in Washington, Trump met with oil companies over his plans to access Venezuela’s huge crude reserves. The government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez “has decided to initiate an exploratory diplomatic process with the government of the United States of America, aimed at re-establishing diplomatic missions in both countries,” Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement. John McNamara, the top US diplomat in neighbouring Colombia, and other personnel “travelled to Caracas to conduct an initial assessment for a potential phased resumption of operations,” a US official said on customary condition of anonymity. Venezuela said it would reciprocate by sending a delegation to Washington. Rodriguez, in a statement, condemned “the serious, criminal, illegal and illegitimate attack” by the United States and vowed: “Venezuela will continue to confront this aggression through the diplomatic route.” Trump vows oil investments Trump said earlier on Friday that he had called off a second wave of attacks on Venezuela due to the prisoner releases. The US president had suggested he might use force again to get his way in Venezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. At a White House meeting on Friday, he pressed top oil executives to invest in Venezuela’s reserves, but was met with a cautious reception — with ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods dismissing the country as “uninvestable” without sweeping reforms. Trump said foreign firms had enjoyed no meaningful protections under Maduro, “but now you have total security. It’s a whole different Venezuela.” He also stressed that the companies would deal only with Washington, not Caracas, when exploiting Venezuela’s oil resources. Trump earlier said that oil companies promised to invest $100 billion in Venezuela, whose oil infrastructure is creaky after years of mismanagement and sanctions. He had earlier announced a plan for the United States to sell between 30 million and 50 million barrels of Venezuelan crude, with the money to be used at his discretion. He promised any funds sent to Caracas would be used to buy only US-made products. In the meantime, Washington has maintained maritime pressure on oil tankers in the Caribbean, where it seized a fifth tanker carrying Venezuelan crude — oil that would be sold, Trump said. State-owned oil company PDVSA confirmed in a statement that one vessel was returning to Venezuelan waters, describing it as the “first successful joint operation” with Washington. Prisoners’ release Anxious relatives waited outside Venezuelan jails for a glimpse of their loved ones as the authorities began releasing political prisoners — a move Washington claimed credit for. “When I heard the news, I broke down,” said Dilsia Caro, 50, waiting for the release of her husband, Noel Flores, who was jailed for criticising Maduro. Venezuela began releasing prisoners on Thursday in the first such gesture since US forces removed and detained Maduro in the deadly January 3 raid. Trump told Fox News he would meet next week with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, whom he earlier brushed aside as lacking the “respect” to lead Venezuela. Exiled Venezuelan opposition figurehead Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia said that any democratic transition in the country must recognise his claim to victory in the 2024 presidential elections. Maduro was proclaimed the winner of the vote, but his re-election was widely seen as fraudulent. Gonzalez was hoping on Friday for the release of his son-in-law, who was detained a year ago in Caracas. Protests in Caracas Maduro was seized in a US special forces raid accompanied by airstrikes, operations that left 100 people dead, according to Caracas. US forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, to New York to face trial on drug-trafficking and other charges. Rodriguez insisted on Thursday that her country was “not subordinate or subjugated” despite her pledge to cooperate with Trump. Angry protesters rallied in the streets of Caracas on Friday, demanding Maduro’s release in the latest of a daily series of demonstrations. “We don’t have to give one little drop of oil to Trump after all that he has done to us,” said one protester, Josefina Castro, 70, a member of a civil activists’ group. “Our Venezuelan brothers died (in the attack), and that hurts.”",

      "summary_orig": "After the United States forces recently carried out a raid in Venezuela and captured its leader Nicolas Maduro, Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro has said that he believed there was now a “real threat” of American military action against his country. Speaking to the BBC , Petro said Washington was treating other nations as part of a US “empire”. His remarks came after US President Donald Trump said a military operation in Colombia “sounds good” in the wake of strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Maduro. Petro said that the US risked transforming from “dominating the world” to becoming “isolated from the world”. He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like “Nazi brigades”. President Petro raises alarm after Trump says operation in South American country ‘sounds good’ Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US. The BBC has approached the White House for comment. Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to “watch his a..”, remarks the Colombian president strongly condemned. Change in tone Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which US president said he would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the “near future”. Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a “Great Honour”. A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric “from both sides”. But on Thursday, Petro’s tone suggested relations had not significantly impr­oved. He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, “most of it occupied by me”, covered “drug trafficking Colombia”, his cou­n­try’s view on Vene­zuela and “what is happening around Latin America rega­rding the United States”. Trump has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking. The US has conducted more than 30 strikes in recent months on vessels that the Washington says were being used for drug trafficking in the Cari­bbean and the Pacific, killing more than 110 people. Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired on Thursday night that after targeting drug trafficking by water “we are going to start now hitting land”, adding that “the cartels are running Mexico”. Trump has often bla­med immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations. Published in Dawn, January 10th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "Turkiye is reportedly seeking entry into a mutual defence agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, potentially paving the way for a new security alignment that could shift the balance of power in the Middle East and beyond, Bloomberg reported on Friday. Citing people familiar with the matter, who spoke anonymously, Bloomberg reported that the talks are at an advanced stage and “a deal is very likely”. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “ Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement ” in Riyadh last September, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. “The expanded alliance would make sense because Turkiye’s interests increasingly overlap with those of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in South Asia, the Middle East and even Africa,” the Bloomberg report said. “Turkiye also sees the pact as a way of strengthening security and deterrents when there are questions over the reliability of the US, which has strong military ties with all three countries, and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato,“ it added. The report noted Riyadh’s financial clout and Islamabad’s nuclear capability, ballistic missiles, and manpower, with Turkiye offering military experience and a developed defence industry, according to Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with the Ankara-based think tank TEPAV. “As the US prioritises its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan was quoted as saying by Bloomberg . The information ministry and Turkiye’s defence ministry declined to comment. Saudi Arabian authorities weren’t immediately available to respond to a request for comment to the American publication. New era According to Bloomberg , Turkiye joining the alliance would underscore a new era in relations with Saudi Arabia. “After turning the page on years of rancour, the countries are working to develop economic and defence cooperation,” the report read. “They held their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.” The report noted Riyadh and Ankara’s longstanding concern over Tehran and their preference for engagement with the country rather than the use of force. With regard to Pakistan, Bloomberg noted Turkiye’s construction of corvette warships for the Pakistan Navy and its work upgrading the Pakistan Air Force’s fleet of F-16 fighter jets. “Turkiye is already sharing drone technology with both countries, and now wants them to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet program,” the outlet added, citing an earlier report. “The trilateral defence talks come in the wake of a cease-fire between Pakistan and India that ended a four-day military clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May,” Bloomberg added. The report also acknowledged Pakistan‘s tensions with Afghanistan following border clashes, as well as Turkiye and Qatar’s efforts to broker talks, which were inconclusive. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies , with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad. With Turkiye, defence cooperation remains a key pillar of bilateral relations. According to the 2023 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report , Turkiye is Pakistan’s second-largest arms supplier, accounting for 11pc of its total arms imports. The defence partnership has grown significantly, with joint projects such as the Milgem warships , aircraft modernisation, and drone acquisitions deepening military collaboration.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has begun soft global marketing of the 2nd Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum, 2026 (PMIF26), scheduled to be held here on April 8 and 9, according to an official announcement on Friday. Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik held a briefing session with Pakistan’s ambassadors and high commissioners posted in key foreign capitals to advance preparations and mobilise international participation for the event. The meeting was conducted virtually with Pakistan’s missions abroad, while senior officials from the petroleum division and representatives of key public sector entities attended in person. The session focused on aligning diplomatic outreach with national economic priorities and positioning PMIF26 as a premier global platform for investment in Pakistan’s mineral and mining sector, the petroleum division said. PM approves national policy framework to reform gemstones sector During the briefing, the minister explained the aims, scale, and strategic importance of PMIF26 as a forum representing a national economic priority. He urged ambassadors and high commissioners to actively engage leading mining companies, institutional investors, financial institutions, and relevant government counterparts in their host countries to ensure broad-based and meaningful international participation. “PMIF26 will serve as a key platform for promoting mining awareness, stimulating economic activity, and attracting sustainable investment into Pakistan’s mineral sector,” the minister said, adding that the forum would build on the “success of PMIF 2025” held last year. He said the previous edition of the forum was organised in line with international standards and delivered tangible outcomes. “The forum attracted participants from over 50 countries and more than 5,000 delegates, while the signing of 14 memorandums of understanding with globally recognised companies validated growing international confidence in Pakistan’s mineral sector,” he added. PMIF 2026 is being planned as a strategic. technical conference — alongside an international gemstone exhibition — and a comprehensive resource library aimed at supporting informed as well as data-driven investment decisions. APP adds: Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday gave in-principle approval to a national policy framework to reform the gemstones sector, align it with international standards, and create a conducive environment for foreign investment, state-run APP reported. Chairing a high-level meeting on the country’s gemstone reserves, sectoral reforms, export enhancement, and adoption of modern technology, the prime minister directed strict adherence to timelines outlined in the policy framework this year. He also instructed immediate steps to establish international-standard laboratories and certification systems. PM Shehbaz ordered the establishment of two model centres of excellence for gemstones during the year and the engagement of internationally recognised experts to remove obstacles in policy implementation. He noted that Pakistan’s gemstone exports remained negligible despite the country having immense reserves, and called for encouraging private companies, particularly young entrepreneurs, to invest in the sector. Citing vast reserves of gemstones in Pakistan, he directed geological surveys to determine their location and value, ensuring full consultation with relevant institutions, provincial governments, and stakeholders. The meeting was told that Pakistan’s gemstone reserves were valued at around $450 billion, while annual exports stood at just $5.8 million. More than 5,000 companies are processing more than 30 types of precious stones in the country. Leading reserves in the country include those of emerald, peridot, ruby, topaz, and aquamarine. The industries and production ministry has chalked out a comprehensive action plan identifying challenges and priority measures to achieve a $1bn export target over five years through reforms. This year, the ministry will integrate the gemstone value chain into the national economy, promote local processing for value addition, adopt modern technology, launch private-sector training programmes, and introduce ‘Brand Pakistan’.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister‘s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Friday said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi is engaging in “illegal activity and travel” by trying to mobilise the party’s support base for a nationwide street movement. The KP chief executive is currently in Karachi as part of the PTI’s plans to launch a street movement, as per the directions of party founder Imran Khan. Speaking on the Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the PM’s aide said that the PTI was in no position to launch a street movement and described their upcoming nationwide wheel-jam strike on February 8 as “violence”. “They cannot mobilise because it isn’t in accordance with the law. The KP CM is involved in illegal activity and his travel is illegal,” Sanaullah said. When asked what part of CM Afridi’s visit was illegal, Sanaullah replied: “How is a wheel-jam strike a political activity permitted by the law and Constitution? Holding a wheel-jam strike in and of itself is illegal.” Sanaullah added that the Sindh government “would not permit a wheel-jam strike” and that the PTI “is not in a position to block even one road.” Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information, Shafiullah Jan — also a guest on the programme — responded to Sanaullah, clarifying that the February 8 wheel-jam strike was called by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, chairman of the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan opposition alliance. “Rana Sanaullah is confused; he issued a statement saying that if the call [to strike] isn’t revoked, May 9 cases will be opened,” he claimed, referring to the prosecution of PTI members over riots that occurred on May 9, 2023. “This shows that May 9 was a false flag operation against the PTI.“ “As far as February 8 is concerned, the PTI will support and accept Achakzai’s call for a wheel-jam,” Jan added. Sanaullah stated that the PTI’s street movement would not be successful and that “only a handful of people from KP” might join in. “When these people are prosecuted, they will create a ruckus,” the PM’s aide said. “These people are still claiming that May 9 was a false flag operation and that their members weren’t involved. They are willing to spread lies and create misunderstandings. Tell me, can you believe what they say?” Sanaullah also questioned what movement the PTI would lead. “With this wheel-jam strike, they say that KP will lead it. What are they leading?” he asked. “At most 4,500 people turned up at their Peshawar rally, even though they had been preparing for a month.” “In KP, they will try, but they will fail, and whoever takes part will continue to cry about false flags and fake cases when they get prosecuted,” the PM’s aide added. The KP CM, during his three-day visit , will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister.",

Holding a wheel-jam strike in and of itself is illegal.” Sanaullah added that the Sindh government “would not permit a wheel-jam strike” and that the PTI “is not in a position to block even one road.” Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information, Shafiullah Jan — also a guest on the programme — responded to Sanaullah, clarifying that the February 8 wheel-jam strike was called by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, chairman of the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan opposition alliance. “Rana Sanaullah is confused; he issued a statement saying that if the call [to strike] isn’t revoked, May 9 cases will be opened,” he claimed, referring to the prosecution of PTI members over riots that occurred on May 9, 2023. “This shows that May 9 was a false flag operation against the PTI.“ “As far as February 8 is concerned, the PTI will support and accept Achakzai’s call for a wheel-jam,” Jan added. Sanaullah stated that the PTI’s street movement would not be successful and that “only a handful of people from KP” might join in. “When these people are prosecuted, they will create a ruckus,” the PM’s aide said. “These people are still claiming that May 9 was a false flag operation and that their members weren’t involved. They are willing to spread lies and create misunderstandings. Tell me, can you believe what they say?” Sanaullah also questioned what movement the PTI would lead. “With this wheel-jam strike, they say that KP will lead it. What are they leading?” he asked. “At most 4,500 people turned up at their Peshawar rally, even though they had been preparing for a month.” “In KP, they will try, but they will fail, and whoever takes part will continue to cry about false flags and fake cases when they get prosecuted,” the PM’s aide added. The KP CM, during his three-day visit , will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister.",

      "summary": "Prime Minister‘s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Friday said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi is engaging in “illegal activity and travel” by trying to mobilise the party’s support base for a nationwide street movement. The KP chief executive is currently in Karachi as part of the PTI’s plans to launch a street movement, as per the directions of party founder Imran Khan. Speaking on the Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the PM’s aide said that the PTI was in no position to launch a street movement and described their upcoming nationwide wheel-jam strike on February 8 as “violence”. “They cannot mobilise because it isn’t in accordance with the law. The KP CM is involved in illegal activity and his travel is illegal,” Sanaullah said. When asked what part of CM Afridi’s visit was illegal, Sanaullah replied: “How is a wheel-jam strike a political activity permitted by the law and Constitution?

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Friday evening continued his efforts to rally PTI’s support base in Karachi to support the party’s upcoming nationwide street movement. After his visit to the Karachi Press Club (KPC), the provincial chief executive was scheduled to visit Insaf House and hold public meetings in the city’s district South and Malir. Earlier in the evening, Afridi reached the KPC and met with the city’s journalist fraternity while appreciating the welcome extended to him by the Sindh government. From the airport, the KP CM’s convoy took six hours to reach the press club, accompanied by a large crowd of party supporters. During his interaction with the media, Afridi compared his arrival in the metropolis with his recent visit to Lahore and said, “Karachi has been more welcoming than Lahore ”. “The democratic traditions of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto are still alive in Sindh,” said the KP CM during his interaction with journalists at the press club. The KP chief minister said that the purpose of his visit to Sindh’s provincial capital was to prepare for the PTI’s street movement. “The Punjab tour was not a good experience. Wherever we went to eat food, the lights of that area were turned off,” he told reporters. Afridi said that they had received verbal approval from the Sindh government for Sunday’s rally, though they had not received a response in writing. “Imran Khan did not struggle for power, but for the independence of the judiciary, true democracy and freedom of expression. This is why he has been imprisoned,” the KP CM said in his address at the press club. “In prison, he has been treated in an inhumane manner and kept in the same place where terrorists are held,” he added. Fielding questions, CM Afridi said that he saw traces of former premiers Benazir Bhutto and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in Sindh’s governance, and expressed satisfaction. CM Afridi, in another response, noted that a peace jirga was held in the provincial assembly, where all political parties agreed on fifteen points. “One of these points was that military operations are not a problem, but if one is carried out, it would be thuggery,” he added. Elaborating on the topic, Afridi said that “decisions cannot be made behind closed doors” and added that if the tribal elders and local leadership are not involved as stakeholders, “there will never be peace”. “What guarantee is there that peace will return after a military operation?” he questioned. “If the prime minister calls only on a single-point agenda regarding terrorism, I will certainly attend.” “The solution to terrorism is that all political parties, as well as the provincial and federal governments, make a joint decision and implement it. Only then is peace possible,” Afridi said. Arrival in Karachi Afridi reached Karachi earlier today, beginning his three-day visit to Sindh as part of PTI’s street mobilisation movement. Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani welcomed him at the airport. A video released from the minister’s office showed Ghani receiving Afridi and the two hugging at the airport. Ghani was also seen presenting Afridi a Sindhi cap and Ajrak. The party’s secretary general Salman Akram Raja also accompanied the KP CM. Videos shared by the PTI on X showed a large crowd gathered at the airport to welcome Afridi. An update shared on PTI‘s X account at around 5:15pm said Afridi’s convoy, surrounded by a large crowd, had reached Karachi’s main artery Sharea Faisal. PTI workers and supporters take part in a rally celebrating the arrival of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in Karachi on January 9. — X/@HaleemAdil Afridi also shared a video of himself at Sharea Faisal, with PTI supporters and workers shouting slogans of “Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi”. The convoy eventually reached the Karachi Press Club late in the evening after making a pit stop at Mazar-i-Quaid. Afridi boarded the flight for Karachi from the Islamabad airport, where he faced flight delays. KP Minister for Local Government Meena Khan Afridi, who is accompanying the chief minister, said in a post on X prior to their departure that their flight had been delayed. PTI workers and supporters take part in a rally celebrating the arrival of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in Karachi on January 9. — X/@HaleemAdil PTI alleges dismantling of tents Meanwhile, PTI spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had removed the tents put up outside the party‘s head office near the nursery area for the KP CM’s reception. He, however, clarified that the office had not been sealed by police. Previously, the PTI had alleged in a post on social media platform X that Sindh police had sealed the Insaf Secretariat in Karachi and dismantled a camp installed there for Afridi’s welcome. Bozdar said CM Afridi was expected to address party workers and leaders at the head office, where he would be taken from the airport. He also said he had spoken to police and Sindh government officials, who have assured that the tents would be returned. He added that the officials also assured that the party would be allowed to hold a gathering but was asked not to block roads. Dawn reached out to police for a comment but there was no response from their side. Afridi to hold gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday Before departing for Karachi, the KP chief minister said in a post on X that he was bringing party founder Imran Khan’s “message” to the province. “My visit is for three days and during this time we have planned various activities,” the chief minister said, urging people to support the street movement. KP CM announced that he would be holding a gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday at 4:30pm, calling on people to participate in the gathering. “We will hold the biggest gathering in Karachi’s history,” CM Afridi said. Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement issued by his office that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid. “We will fully welcome KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in the province,” he said, adding that the peaceful struggle of any political party, including the PTI, could not be stopped. But, he also warned that “difficulties could arise in the law is violated”. “There is no restriction on the rally. They have sought permission for holding rallies in South and Korangi districts. They have sought permission for a rally at Jinnah Ground and they are being given permission for that,” he said. “We are in talks with the PTI leadership and they can definitely be given permission for holding the rally in accordance with the law.” However, a notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office earlier on January 8 cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold a gathering in Qayyumabad. What’s on CM’s agenda? The KP CM, during his three-day visit, will meet with the party leadership, as well as lawyers and business leaders, and hold a meeting with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. The visit is aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of the incarcerated former prime minister. On Monday, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, shared the CM Afridi’s schedule for the visit. He detailed that CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on January 9 and arrive in Karachi, where he will be received by party workers and supporters. His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a meeting with the Press at the Karachi Press Club (KPC), and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir. The PTI Sindh chapter president had also said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on January 12, pending official confirmation. He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice following his arrival in Karachi. Hyderabad visit The CM will travel to Hyderabad on Jan 1o. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah. The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad. The agenda also includes an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA), but the lawyers’ body has said it never accorded permission for the CM to visit or address the bar. Earlier, the bar association general secretary invited the CM to the Hyderabad High Court in a letter dated January 7. In the letter, seen by Dawn , General Secretary Israr Hussain Chang said he warmly welcomed the CM to Sindh and “commend your principled stance on the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the rule of law, human rights, and justice for missing persons”. “We hope you will also support our ongoing legal and constitutional struggle to protect Sindh’s lands, resist unjust corporate farming allotments, and safeguard Karoonjhar Kirthar, and the water rights and Indus delta, all vital to our ecological and cultural identity. “During your visit to Hyderabad, if you spare some moments to visit the High Court, Hyderabad, I would be honoured to receive you on behalf of the legal fraternity and people of Sindh,” the letter read. But, the bar association clarified in a press release on January 8 that it “never accorded permission nor allowed the worthy KP chief minister to address or visit HCBA, Hyderabad”. It added that the bar association’s entire executive/ managing committee, by a clear majority, had rejected during a meeting an application submitted in this connection. The general secretary issued his letter in his personal capacity and “used the letterhead of the HCBA without consent of the managing committee for the aforesaid programme”, the press release said. Meanwhile, the spokesperson for PTI Hyderabad chairperson alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had conducted raids at residences of the “elected chairpersons of different union committees and activists of PTI on Thursday in different parts of the city”. However, no arrests could be made, he said. Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio also told Dawn that no PTI activists had been arrested during the raids in Hyderabad. Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — undertaken for the same purpose — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit. Additional reporting by Mohammad Hussain Khan Correction: This story previously incorrectly stated that the Korangi deputy commissioner had denied permission for the PTI to hold a public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid, when in fact, the permission was denied for a gathering in Qayyumabad.

The PTI Sindh chapter president had also said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on January 12, pending official confirmation. He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice following his arrival in Karachi. Hyderabad visit The CM will travel to Hyderabad on Jan 1o. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah. The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad. The agenda also includes an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA), but the lawyers’ body has said it never accorded permission for the CM to visit or address the bar. Earlier, the bar association general secretary invited the CM to the Hyderabad High Court in a letter dated January 7. In the letter, seen by Dawn , General Secretary Israr Hussain Chang said he warmly welcomed the CM to Sindh and “commend your principled stance on the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the rule of law, human rights, and justice for missing persons”. “We hope you will also support our ongoing legal and constitutional struggle to protect Sindh’s lands, resist unjust corporate farming allotments, and safeguard Karoonjhar Kirthar, and the water rights and Indus delta, all vital to our ecological and cultural identity. “During your visit to Hyderabad, if you spare some moments to visit the High Court, Hyderabad, I would be honoured to receive you on behalf of the legal fraternity and people of Sindh,” the letter read. But, the bar association clarified in a press release on January 8 that it “never accorded permission nor allowed the worthy KP chief minister to address or visit HCBA, Hyderabad”. It added that the bar association’s entire executive/ managing committee, by a clear majority, had rejected during a meeting an application submitted in this connection. The general secretary issued his letter in his personal capacity and “used the letterhead of the HCBA without consent of the managing committee for the aforesaid programme”, the press release said. Meanwhile, the spokesperson for PTI Hyderabad chairperson alleged while speaking to Dawn that police had conducted raids at residences of the “elected chairpersons of different union committees and activists of PTI on Thursday in different parts of the city”. However, no arrests could be made, he said. Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio also told Dawn that no PTI activists had been arrested during the raids in Hyderabad. Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — undertaken for the same purpose — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit. Additional reporting by Mohammad Hussain Khan Correction: This story previously incorrectly stated that the Korangi deputy commissioner had denied permission for the PTI to hold a public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid, when in fact, the permission was denied for a gathering in Qayyumabad. The error has now been corrected.",

      "title_orig": "Iran cuts internet amid expanding protests over economy; supreme leader tells Trump to focus on problems in US",
      "summary_orig": "Iran was largely cut off from the outside world on Friday after authorities blacked out the internet to curb expanding protests, with phone calls not reaching the country, flights cancelled and online Iranian news sites only intermittently updating. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused protesters of acting on behalf of US President Donald Trump, saying rioters were attacking public properties and warning that Tehran would not tolerate people acting as “mercenaries for foreigners”. He also told Trump to focus on the problems in his own country. The protests, which began on December 28 over an inflationary spiral, have not approached the scale of unrest three years ago but have spread across Iran with dozens reported dead and the authorities looking more vulnerable because of a dire economy and the aftermath of last year’s war with Israel and the United States. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has reported at least 34 protesters and four security personnel killed, and 2,200 arrested during the unrest. Images of fires raging in Iranian cities Iranian rights group Hengaw reported that a protest march after Friday prayers in Zahedan, where the Baluch minority predominates, was met by gunfire that wounded several people. Iran’s fragmented external opposition factions called for more protests on Friday with Reza Pahlavi, exiled son of the late ruling shah, telling Iranians in a social media post: “The eyes of the world are upon you. Take to the streets.” Trump, who bombed Iran last summer and who last week warned Tehran it could come to the protesters’ aid, said on Friday he would not meet Pahlavi and was “not sure that it would be appropriate” to support him. Images published by state television overnight showed what it said were burning buses, cars and motorbikes as well as fires at metro stations and banks. It accused the People’s Mujahedin Organisation, an opposition faction that splintered off after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and is also known as the MKO, of orchestrating the unrest. A state TV journalist standing in front of the fires on Shariati Street in the Caspian Sea port of Rasht said: “This looks like a war zone — all the shops have been destroyed.” Videos verified by Reuters as having been taken in the capital Tehran showed hundreds of people marching. In one of the videos, a woman could be heard shouting, “Death to Khamenei!” Iran has quelled far bigger bouts of unrest before, but it now faces a graver economic situation and intensifying international pressure with global sanctions over its disputed nuclear programme reimposed since September. Supreme leader warns protesters The authorities have tried a dual approach — describing protests over the economy as legitimate while condemning what they call violent rioters and cracking down with security forces. Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told lawmakers that the voices of protesters must be heard but that any cases linked to “foreign spy networks” must be handled differently. The Supreme Leader, the ultimate authority in Iran above the elected president and parliament, used tougher language in his speech on Friday. “The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of hundreds of thousands of honourable people. It will not back down in the face of vandals,” he said, accusing those involved in unrest of seeking to please Trump. Khamenei also told Trump to focus on the problems in his own country. The US president had stated earlier that the US was watching the situation in Iran “very closely”. “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump had said. Khamenei said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians” and predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution. While the initial protests were focused on the economy, with the rial currency losing half its value against the dollar last year and inflation topping 40 per cent in December, they have morphed to include slogans directly against the authorities. Protesters have chanted slogans including “death to the dictator” and praising the former monarchy that was overthrown in 1979. The extent of support inside Iran for the monarchy or for the MKO, the most vocal groups among emigre Iranians, is disputed. Most of the demonstrators seen in videos viewed by Reuters , many of which it has been unable to verify, have been young men. Iran blocked off the internet overnight. Reuters reporters trying to place phone calls to Iran from abroad were unable to do so on Friday. Flights cancelled At least six flights between Dubai and Iranian cities scheduled for Friday were cancelled, the Dubai Airport website showed. Turkish Airlines on Friday also cancelled its seven flights from Istanbul to Iran — five of them to the capital Tehran, a spokesperson told AFP . The other flights were bound for Tabriz and for Mashhad, the spokesperson said. Turkish Airlines had already cancelled two flights to Tehran on Thursday and one to Tabriz, the spokesperson said. According to the Istanbul airport app, five other flights operated by Iranian airlines have also been cancelled, while seven others were still scheduled at midday. According to the specialist website Flight Radar, a Turkish Airlines plane flying to Shiraz and a Pegasus flight to Mashhad turned back from Iranian space on Thursday night. Turkey shares a border of around 500 kilometres with Iran, and there are three active land crossings between the two countries.",
