      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Saturday that further medical treatment of PTI founder Imran Khan would be carried out by eye specialists at a specialised medical institution, while the opposition continued its sit-in at Parliament House over concerns regarding the ex-premier’s health. In a post on X, he said, “Pursuant to ongoing eye treatment of Imran Khan, further checkup and treatment will be done in a specialised medical facility by the best eye specialists. “A detailed report thereof will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” he said. The remarks came as parliamentarians from opposition parties, under the banners of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), continued their sit-in at Parliament House and KP House in Islamabad on Saturday for a second day, demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment. The sit-in was announced after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on Thursday that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. The sit-in started after Friday prayers and continued overnight. Participants in the sit-in are demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be moved to Shifa International Hospital. The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others. Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said on Saturday that Parliament House had been turned into a “prison”. “We have been inside Parliament since yesterday. We wanted to go outside but all the gates were closed,” he said in a video posted by TTAP on X. “Parliament and its premises have been turned into a prison; it is condemnable.” “We are not armed. We are standing here with nothing but our ethics and the strength of the truth,” he added. The Senate opposition leader noted that Imran, like other prisoners, had rights and that “90 per cent” of Pakistanis — both here and abroad — were expressing concerns over the PTI founder’s health. In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”. Demanding that they “be set free”, the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House. “We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”. “The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed. TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises. “On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said. According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night. Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in. PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors. She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour. We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.” She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye. Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament. “Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”. “Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”. The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released. He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked. Govt told to not escalate situation Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, flanked by former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza, warned the government to take steps before things got out of hand. They said that the government should not escalate the situation and eliminate political space for the opposition. They warned the government that it would not remain in power forever and urged it to go for dialogue and give respect to democratic principles. They also demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a hospital for medical treatment and that his family be granted access to him. They stated that the protest would continue until these demands were fulfilled. Khokhar also stated that he was prevented from taking food inside Parliament on Saturday morning and called the situation unjust. He also said that opposition leaders inside Parliament House were confined and roads leading to Parliament Lodges and KP House were blocked. Ahmad, meanwhile, demanded that Imran be provided medical treatment immediately. He claimed that direct responsibility for the situation was on the shoulders of the federal government. Reporters decry mistreatment The Parliamentary Reporters Association Pakistan (PRAP) strongly condemned the “obstacles, mistreatment, and rude behaviour faced by journalists” while covering the ongoing sit-in at the Parliament House, and demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed full access” to the premises. A joint statement issued by PRAP President M.B. Soomro, PRAP Secretary Naveed Akbar, and other office-bearers said the opposition had been staging a sit-in at Parliament House since yesterday, in which the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly (NA) and Senate, senators, and members of the NA are participating. “Covering such an important political process is the professional responsibility of journalists, and preventing them from doing so is a blatant violation of the principles of press freedom,” it said. According to the statement, “After covering the sit-in late last night, when Soomro, senior journalist Akram Abid, and other reporters reached the entrance of the Parliament House this morning, security personnel stopped them and pushed them away. “An attempt was also made to forcibly put Abid into a police van,” it said. The association expressed serious concern over the incident and said, “Preventing journalists from entering a national institution such as the Parliament House amounts to depriving them of their constitutional and professional rights. Turning the Parliament into a fortress and preventing the media from coverage reflects an undemocratic and authoritarian attitude.” It further said: “If the media is prevented from performing its duties, the timely and accurate dissemination of information to the public will be affected, which is harmful to any democratic society.” The association demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed unhindered access to the Parliament House and that effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents in the future”. The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”. KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful. “Imran Khan sahib ’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X. He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well. “Those opposing Imran Khan sahib , who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.” The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib ’s family and party,” Afridi added. “A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised. SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government. In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC. “The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted. Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”. “The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said. She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists. Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!” “Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”. “PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded. “Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.",

The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”. KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful. “Imran Khan sahib ’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X. He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well. “Those opposing Imran Khan sahib , who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.” The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib ’s family and party,” Afridi added. “A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised. SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government. In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC. “The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted. Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”. “The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said. She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists. Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!” “Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”. “PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded. “Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for nationalist leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister. Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms. Tarique Rahman, chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in a car on his way to the mosque to attend Friday prayer, as results project BNP’s victory in the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday. His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia , served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”. Muhammad Yunus, Chief Advisor of the interim government of Bangladesh, shows his ballot as he arrives to vote inside a polling station during the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission. ‘Verdict of the people’ Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”. But a day later, he conceded defeat. “In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement. “We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.” Shafiqur Rahman, the emir of Jamaat-i-Islami Bangladesh, attends a press conference following the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”. The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties. China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP. International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been “credible”. The International Republican Institute noted that while “election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile”. ‘Successful’ Jamaat’s Rahman said his party “will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account”. Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told AFP that the vote had been a success. “It was by far the best election,” he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres. “People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it,” he said on Saturday. “If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court.” A man reads an English daily newspaper at a store, the morning after the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place. Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists. Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina. “With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics,” he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation.” Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule. Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence. Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced “daunting challenges”, including “boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process”. ‘History that has seen both challenges and cooperation’ The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Saturday said it looked forward to improved ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. In a post on X, the party thanked President Asif Ali Zardari for his “warm congratulations and thoughtful message“. The BNP noted that while Islamabad and Dhaka share a complex history marked by both challenges and cooperation, “yet our peoples have continued to value dialogue, respect, and regional engagement”. Expressing optimism about the future, the party said it “remained hopeful that the two nations would further strengthen constructive ties, expand economic collaboration, and enhance people-to-people contacts in the years ahead”. It added that “closer cooperation could contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia.”",

Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence. Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced “daunting challenges”, including “boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process”. ‘History that has seen both challenges and cooperation’ The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Saturday said it looked forward to improved ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh. In a post on X, the party thanked President Asif Ali Zardari for his “warm congratulations and thoughtful message“. The BNP noted that while Islamabad and Dhaka share a complex history marked by both challenges and cooperation, “yet our peoples have continued to value dialogue, respect, and regional engagement”. Expressing optimism about the future, the party said it “remained hopeful that the two nations would further strengthen constructive ties, expand economic collaboration, and enhance people-to-people contacts in the years ahead”. It added that “closer cooperation could contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia.”",

      "summary": "Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for nationalist leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister. Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms. Tarique Rahman, chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in a car on his way to the mosque to attend Friday prayer, as results project BNP’s victory in the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday. His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia , served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”. Muhammad Yunus, Chief Advisor of the interim government of Bangladesh, shows his ballot as he arrives to vote inside a polling station during the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission. ‘Verdict of the people’ Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”. But a day later, he conceded defeat. “In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement. “We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.” Shafiqur Rahman, the emir of Jamaat-i-Islami Bangladesh, attends a press conference following the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”. The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties. China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP. International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been “credible”. The International Republican Institute noted that while “election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile”. ‘Successful’ Jamaat’s Rahman said his party “will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account”. Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told AFP that the vote had been a success. “It was by far the best election,” he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres. “People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it,” he said on Saturday. “If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court.” A man reads an English daily newspaper at a store, the morning after the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place. Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists. Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina. “With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics,” he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation.” Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Saturday said the riverine (katcha) areas of Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur districts had been “100 per cent cleared” of dacoits during security operations carried out over the past few weeks. “It was a no-go area for the state, police, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), and other agencies. The writ of the state and its authority have been restored in the area,” she said while addressing a high-level meeting following the successful operation in the riverine areas. Briefing on the operation, she said it was launched in three phases. “The first phase was launched at the end of December, in which ground operations were integrated with aerial surveillance. It targeted multi-pronged criminal activity.” “In the second phase, we cordoned off major criminal strongholds, including Mach, Katcha Rajwani, and Katcha Karachi, and brought them under control,” she said. She further said: “The third phase was the surrender phase, which continued from January 7 to February 13, during which more than 500 dacoits and criminals surrendered, including high-profile gang leaders.” Maryam shared further details of the criminal gangs, mentioning the names of “Umrani, Sikhani, Dolani, Bingyani, Lathani, and Inder,” who surrendered in the third phase of the operation. She noted that 34 criminals who surrendered had Rs10 million in bounties on their heads. CM Maryam also shared details of arms recovered during the operation, including grenade launchers, sub-machine guns, shotguns, and pistols. The Punjab chief minister also thanked Sindh Police and the government of Sindh for the successful operation, noting that law enforcement personnel “faced challenges in the tri-border areas” connecting Punjab with Balochistan and Sindh. She added that the successful operation would not have been possible without the active participation of the Sindh Police and the Sindh government. Further elaborating on the operation, she said, “Latest technology, including drones, night-vision cameras, and quad-dopters, were used in the operation. Every movement of criminals was not only digitally monitored but also tracked through aerial intelligence assets.” She added that this left the criminals with “no chance to hide or run away.” “The Punjab government deployed 1,700 personnel for the operation, with armoured personnel carriers and bullet-proof vehicles to ensure their safety.” The chief minister noted that the operation was successful because “LEAs, intelligence agencies, the police department, and the provincial government acted as one unit.” “It was a coordinated and synchronised effort,” added Maryam. The chief minister further said, “No casualty was reported in the multi-pronged operation.” “From a zone of fear, it has now become a zone where there is rule of law, the writ of the state, and the authority of the state,” she added. She thanked and congratulated former Punjab inspector general of police, Dr Usman Anwer, who “played a great role” in the operation. Speaking about the police force in border areas, she said, “For the first time in 78 years, 53 women from the tribal areas of Dera Ghazi Khan were recruited and joined the border police.” Maryam further described it as an “unprecedented achievement that we have to maintain”, adding that the government was planning a development package for the area and had established a committee for the purpose. Last month, Sindh police launched an operation against riverine bandits. Since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters have taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested, Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said.",

These operations were conducted in Lahore, Gujranwala, Sahiwal, Khushab, Mianwali, Bhakkar, Faisalabad, Jhang, Chakwal, Rajanpur, Narowal, Pakpattan and Sargodha. During the operations, 286 suspects were interrogated, and 26 terrorists were taken into custody along with arms, explosives and other prohibited material. One alleged militant affiliated with Al-Qaeda was arrested in Lahore, while four members of Fitna al-Khawarij were apprehended in Sargodha. Officials said the arrested suspects had links with the tribal areas. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The spokesperson said 4.9 kilograms of explosives, three improvised explosive devices (IEDs), 19 detonators, 34 feet of safety fuse wire, pamphlets and magazines of banned organisations, Prima cards, mobile phones and cash were recovered from their possession. Authorities said the suspects were planning to target important buildings in different cities to spread fear among the public. The CTD registered 25 cases against the arrested suspects under terrorism charges and started the investigation. In addition to the IBOs, the department, in coordination with local police and security agencies, conducted 4,662 combing operations across the province. During these operations, 160,009 individuals were checked, 538 suspects were arrested, 516 first information reports (FIRs) were registered and 389 recoveries were made. Last month, the CTD claimed to have arrested 49 suspected terrorists and foiled a major terror plan during a province-wide crackdown in Punjab, including a “dangerous operative” allegedly linked to India’s intelligence agency (RAW). The same month, it killed six ‘highly dangerous’ terrorists during an intelligence-based operation near Chapri Dam.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Friday embraced potential regime change in Iran and declared that “tremendous power” will soon be in the Middle East, as the Pentagon sent a second aircraft carrier to the region. Trump’s military moves and tough talk come even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West. Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Trump responded that it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen.” He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said, “there are people.” “For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. “In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We’ve been going on for a long time.” Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country’s ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles. Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the US amasses forces in the Middle East. The US targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities in strikes last year. When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Trump said the “dust.” He added: “If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left.” Long deployments US officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks. The Gerald R. Ford, the United States’ newest and the world’s largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year. Asked earlier on Friday why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it … if we need it, we’ll have it ready.” One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East. The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June. With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military’s arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance. In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering “illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere.” The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November. While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity. Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships. Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East. The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system. The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation. The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: An Indian national has pleaded guilty in a US federal court to plotting the assassination of Sikh activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York, the US Justice Department said on Friday. Prosecutors said Nikhil Gupta , 54, admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with the failed plot. He entered the plea on February 13 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 29. According to the Justice Department, Gupta acted at the direction of an Indian government employee identified as Vikash Yadav , who was employed by India’s Cabinet Secretariat, which oversees the country’s foreign intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Yadav remains at large. Former Indian intelligence officer Vikash Yadav who has been charged by the US for allegedly directing a foiled plot to murder a Sikh separatist and Indian critic in New York City, at an unknown location, in this undated handout image released on October 17. — Reuters/File The department said that in May 2023, Yadav recruited Gupta to arrange the killing of Pannun, a US citizen and lawyer who advocates for an independent Sikh state known as Khalistan. Gupta contacted a person he believed to be a criminal associate, who was in fact working with US law enforcement. That individual introduced him to an undercover officer posing as a hitman. Prosecutors said the conspirators agreed on a $100,000 payment for the killing, and about $15,000 was paid in advance. The plot was disrupted before any attack took place. In a statement, US Attorney Jay Clayton said Gupta believed he could target someone in the United States “simply for exercising their American right to free speech,” but would now face justice. An FBI official described the case as an example of “transnational repression”. The case comes amid wider tensions between India and Western governments over alleged threats against Sikh separatists abroad. Canada has separately accused India of involvement in the 2023 killing of another Sikh leader outside a temple in British Columbia — allegations New Delhi has denied. Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic in June 2023 and later extradited to the United States.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Friday nearly 150,000 Afghans have returned home from Pakistan and Iran so far in 2026. These returns add to the 5.4 million Afghans who have gone back to Afghanistan from the same two neighbouring countries since October 2023. UNHCR says it continues to observe significant numbers of Afghans returning or being forced to return from neighbouring countries under extreme difficult circumstances. The speed and scale of these returns have pushed Afghanistan deeper into crisis, as the country continues to face a deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation — particularly for women and girls — along with a fragile economy and recurring natural disasters. According to a recent report by the World Bank, rapid population growth fuelled by these returns led to a 4 per cent decline in GDP per capita in 2025. The high number of returns already this year is particularly concerning given the severity of winter, with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of the country. UNHCR’s recent survey of returnees highlights the scale of challenges they face. Just over half reported being able to find some form of work, even if informal. For women, this figure drops to less than a quarter. More than half of returnee families report having no civil documentation — such as identity cards to prove who they are or where they are from — and more than 90 per cent are living on less than $5 a day. More than half of returnee families lack civil documentation; over 90pc live on less than $5 per day “We are deeply concerned about the sustainability of these returns, UNHCR said. While 5 per cent of returnees surveyed say they intend to leave Afghanistan again, more than 10 per cent know a relative or community member who has already left since returning. These decisions are not driven by a desire to leave, but by the reality that many are unable to rebuild a viable and dignified life. “This year, our focus is on supporting the reintegration of returnees. We have the access, presence and experience of the last four decades in Afghanistan to deliver the assistance that communities say they most need, including protection services, housing and livelihood support, particularly for women.” Along with other UN agencies and partners, UNHCR is closely monitoring the regional situation, where asylum space continues to shrink and regulated migration pathways are narrowing. Afghans increasingly feel compelled to undertake dangerous onward journeys. “We remain prepared to respond to population movements into Afghanistan, while also continuing to call on states to uphold access to asylum, protect and assist Afghan refugees, and ensure that no one is returned to a place where their rights and freedoms are at risk,” the UN refugee agency said. Given the dire humanitarian situation and rapidly increasing population, additional support is urgently needed in 2026 to scale up assistance and invest in reintegration, enabling people to rebuild their lives with dignity, hope and stability.

      "summary_en": "ISLAMABAD: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Friday nearly 150,000 Afghans have returned home from Pakistan and Iran so far in 2026. These returns add to the 5.4 million Afghans who have gone back to Afghanistan from the same two neighbouring countries since October 2023. UNHCR says it continues to observe significant numbers of Afghans returning or being forced to return from neighbouring countries under extreme difficult circumstances. The speed and scale of these returns have pushed Afghanistan deeper into crisis, as the country continues to face a deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation — particularly for women and girls — along with a fragile economy and recurring natural disasters. According to a recent report by the World Bank, rapid population growth fuelled by these returns led to a 4 per cent decline in GDP per capita in 2025. The high number of returns already this year is particularly concerning given the severity of winter, with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of the country. UNHCR’s recent survey of returnees highlights the scale of challenges they face. Just over half reported being able to find some form of work, even if informal. For women, this figure drops to less than a quarter. More than half of returnee families report having no civil documentation — such as identity cards to prove who they are or where they are from — and more than 90 per cent are living on less than $5 a day. More than half of returnee families lack civil documentation; over 90pc live on less than $5 per day “We are deeply concerned about the sustainability of these returns, UNHCR said.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam on Friday expressed confidence that there would not be any war against the Islamic Republic in the foreseeable future, but noted that the war of narratives and psychological warfare would continue against his country. Talking to a select group of media persons in the federal capital, he said that Iran was countering the “Zionist and Western narrative” alongside military aggression, adding that the US and Israel had a history of “deception and backstabbing”. “But they have seen the response in the recent 12-day conflict , and Israel was almost on its knees when the US intervened,” the envoy said. He added that wars were not fought merely with weapons but with national determination and the resilience of the whole society. He said that the West had used all its cards in the June 2025 attack by the Zionist regime and the recent conspiracy when riots were held, and acknowledged that the resistance movements in Lebanon, Yemen and Syria had been weakened. Moghadam urges Muslim unity, lauds Islamabad’s support for Tehran during 12-day war with Israel “While there are ups and downs in wars and broader conflicts, the US, Israel and others have seen the advanced military capabilities as well as the strength of the Iranian nation — it is less likely there will be a war soon,” Mr Moghadam said. ‘War may affect region’ “If, God forbid, war breaks out, regional countries will have to make their own decisions, as such a war would affect the entire region,” he added. He stressed that Iran had always called for greater unity and cooperation among Muslim countries since the Islamic revolution. He said that all the Muslim nations were targets on their list but the priority was different. “Today it is Iran and tomorrow it will be Saudi Arabia,” he added. Referring to the “12-day war” with Israel last year, he lauded Pakistan for supporting Iran and said that despite strong propaganda and huge networks, the Western narrative had weakened over the decades and resistance to the policies of Zionism was visible globally. He also lauded Pakistan’s stance at regional and international forums, claiming Islamabad had supported Iran diplomatically during the recent conflict. “There is a clear understanding in Pakistan that any harm to Iran is harm to Pakistan,” he added. The ambassador said that US President Donald Trump’s Peace Plan for Gaza was a mockery, as all the funding for the restructuring of the Palestinian territory would be in the hands of the American president, “who has no credibility”. “Whereas the establishment of the [international stabilisation]force [for Gaza] was a dangerous move as its target was to disarm the resistance group Hamas through Muslim countries,” he added. “Pak­istan’s decision to distance itself from this force is encouraging.” Balochistan Speaking on common issues, he expressed concern over terrorism in Balochistan province and said that it was a bilateral matter between the two countries. He observed that there was a need to look into the root causes of the problems faced by Pakistan’s Balochistan province and Iran’s adjoining Sistan province. He said that militant activities could not be countered through the use of force alone. “Lack of opportunities and discontent among the people of Pakistan’s Balochistan and Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan provinces has to be addressed through economic development and cooperation to neutralise the hostile designs of the common enemies of both countries,” he added. Women empowerment Responding to a question on the status of women in Iran, the envoy said that while Iran had laws regarding the hijab, there was no coercion in public spaces, and women continued to play a prominent role in education and professional sectors. He said that recent rallies on the occasion of the 47th anniversary of the revolution held across Iran witnessed participation by both veiled and unveiled women. “There is a law regarding the hijab in our country, and that is enforced in government offices, but there is no strictness in public gatherings,” he said, adding that similar social variations were visible in other Muslim societies, including Pakistan. He clarified that certain dress codes applied within government institutions, as was the case in many countries, but only Iran was targeted by the Western media. “Western media never showed the progress made in this regard, as women’s participation in Iran’s higher education is huge. There are more female students in Iranian universities than male students, and women are scientists and hold senior posts even in highly technical projects,” he said. “But nobody compares the representation of women across professions in Iran with other Islamic countries, or with what it was before the Islamic revolution,” Mr Moghadam added. “Nobody among us would like to see the status of women as commercial products or be named in those notorious file[s of late US convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein],” the envoy maintained, and concluded that the status of women should be seen in the context of Iran’s social laws and societal norms.

As per details, the incident occurred near the traffic police office on the Old GT Road where one Tahir Beig (60) of Chak Buzarag was going home on his motorcycle when was stopped at a picket by the traffic police. The police officials reportedly imposed a fine of Rs2,000 on the motorcyclist for not wearing a helmet. He requested the duty officials to spare him as he did not have the amount on him to pay the fine. However, the officials declined to accept his request. The man then started walking towards the GTS Chowk without his motorbike to arrange the amount and pay the fine, but he fell just a few meters away and died on the spot. Some eyewitnesses called Rescue 1122 and they pronounced him dead after a checkup. The rescue and police officials later shifted the body to the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital (ABSTH). A spokesperson for the Gujrat Police confirmed that the elderly man died of a heart attack after the traffic officials imposed a fine on him. He said that the doctors at the ABSTH had declared heart attack as the cause of his death. The Gujrat DPO ordered the SP (investigation) to conduct an inquiry into the incident.

The man then started walking towards the GTS Chowk without his motorbike to arrange the amount and pay the fine, but he fell just a few meters away and died on the spot. Some eyewitnesses called Rescue 1122 and they pronounced him dead after a checkup. The rescue and police officials later shifted the body to the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital (ABSTH). A spokesperson for the Gujrat Police confirmed that the elderly man died of a heart attack after the traffic officials imposed a fine on him. He said that the doctors at the ABSTH had declared heart attack as the cause of his death. The Gujrat DPO ordered the SP (investigation) to conduct an inquiry into the incident.
