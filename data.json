      "summary_orig": "Ten people were killed and around a dozen wounded when gunmen opened fire during a Jewish holiday event at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday, Australian officials said. New South Wales police said two people had been taken into custody, and the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) said one of at least two gunmen was among those killed. Around a dozen people were taken to local hospitals after the shooting, a New South Wales ambulance spokesperson said. Australian police said an “improvised explosive device” had been found in a car linked to a suspect in the deadly shooting. “We have found an improvised explosive device in a car which is linked to the deceased offender,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a news conference. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the incident “shocking and distressing”, adding that “emergency responders are on the ground and working to save lives”. “I saw at least 10 people on the ground and blood everywhere,” 30-year-old local Harry Wilson, who witnessed the shooting, told the Sydney Morning Herald . Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Jewish people who had gone to light the first candle of the Hanukkah holiday on the beach had been attacked by “vile terrorists”. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was appalled by the shooting. “These are the results of the anti-Semitic rampage in the streets of Australia over the past two years, with the anti-Semitic and inciting calls of ‘Globalise the Intifada’ that were realised today,” he alleged. One of the world’s most famous beaches, Bondi is typically crowded with locals and tourists, especially on warm weekend evenings. “If we were targeted deliberately in this way, it’s something of a scale that none of us could have ever fathomed. It’s a horrific thing,” Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News , adding his media adviser had been wounded in the attack. Videos circulating on X appeared to show people on the beach and nearby park scattering as multiple gunshots and police sirens could be heard. One video showed a man dressed in a black shirt firing a large weapon before being tackled by a man in a white T-shirt who wrestled his weapon off him. A different man was seen firing a weapon from a pedestrian bridge. Another video showed two men pressed onto the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge. Officers could be seen trying to resuscitate one of the men. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage. The attack came almost exactly 11 years after a lone gunman took 18 people hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney. Two hostages and the gunman were killed after a 16-hour standoff . Sussan Ley, the leader of Australia’s opposition Liberal party, said the loss of life in the incident was “significant”. “Australians are in deep mourning tonight, with hateful violence striking at the heart of an iconic Australian community, a place we all know so well and love, Bondi,” she said.

Sources in the valley told Dawn that hectic deliberations had been taking place between the Tirah Bagh Brigade Headquarters and local elders since Wednesday (Dec 10) to develop a mechanism for the ‘willful’ relocation of families from the valley and an acceptable package for the new internally displaced persons (IDPs). They said that while expressing satisfaction with the voluntary repatriation of families from different areas of Tirah in the last few weeks, officials posted to the Bagh Brigade Headquarters made it clear to local elders that those unwilling to vacate their houses would face “utter difficulties” after the launch of the operation. A Malakdinkhel elder, who was part of the negotiating team, told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the launch of the military operation was a matter of time now while the security officials were now insisting on devising modalities which could minimise chances of collateral damage to residents and reduce their misery. Security officials, elders discussing mechanism for families’ relocation He said that security officials in Peshawar and Rawalpindi were pondering over the timeframe of the Tirah military operation as the General Headquarters and 11 Corps were insisting on the shortest possible duration in order to minimise the sufferings of local families. The elder said that security officials agreed to give residents time for voluntary displacement and offered transport and other facilities to them. “The security forces are showing the maximum restraint by not imposing curfews in different parts despite clear-cut instructions from high-ups, while avoiding indiscriminate shelling on troubled areas,” he said. The Malakdinkhel elder further said that a warning was issued about the closure of most exit routes, including Dwa Theoye, Arhanga and Haider Kandaw, if the residents failed to avail the deadline for willful repatriation. Security officials also told Tirah elders that the new IDPs would be allowed to return in the two months’ time at maximum on the successful completion of military operation, while a verbal assurance was given about the meeting of the “legitimate” demands of Tirah residents through the execution of development schemes. The security officials also urged elders to form local peace committees on return following the military operation. However, as there was no mention of the committees’ responsibilities, the elders didn’t disapprove of the idea. On Wednesday, the Tirah elders submitted a long list of demands to the officials of Brigade Headquarters, including advance payment of Rs500,000, provision of free transport, formal IDP status for the newly-displaced families and a firm assurance that no military operations and forced displacement will take place after the completion of operations and return of IDPs. The elders also called for a written agreement about all decisions made during their meetings with security officials, with the Supreme Court chief justice, interior minister, Peshawar’s corps commander, the provincial chief minister and the 27 Brigade acting as guarantors. Sources said that while agreeing to continue parlays, both sides failed to make a deal. Both MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani from Bara along with representatives of Bara Siyasi Ittehad and elders from Bara were kept out of Tirah deliberations. They have vehemently opposed any fresh military operation in Tirah and forced displacement of residents. While Tirah elders and security forces were busy sorting out modalities for the operation and evacuation, the families in different parts of the valley continued to vacate their homes and departed for Bara and Peshawar.

      "summary_orig": "Displaced residents rest at an evacuation centre in the Thai border province of Buriram.—AFP BANGKOK: Cambodia shut its border crossings with Thailand on Saturday, after Bangkok denied US President Donald Trump’s claim that a truce had been agreed to end days of deadly fighting. Violence between the Southeast Asian neighbours, which stems from a long-running dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, has displaced around half a million people on both sides. At least 25 people have died this week, including four Thai soldiers, the defence ministry said were killed in the border area on Saturday. The latest fatalities were followed by Phnom Penh announcing it would immediately “suspend all entry and exit movements at all Cambodia-Thailand border crossings”, the interior ministry said. Each side blamed the other for reigniting the conflict, before Trump said a truce had been agreed. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said Trump “didn’t mention whether we should make a ceasefire” during their Friday phone call. The two leaders “didn’t discuss” the issue, Anutin told journalists on Saturday. Trump had hailed his “very good conversation” with Anutin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Friday. “They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord” agreed in July, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. The United States, China, and Malaysia, as chair of the regional bloc Asean, brokered a ceasefire in July after an initial five-day spate of violence. In October, Trump backed a follow-on joint declaration between Thailand and Cambodia, touting new trade deals after they agreed to prolong their truce. But Thailand suspended the agreement the following month after Thai soldiers were wounded by landmines at the border. In Thailand, evacuee Kanyapat Saopria said she doesn’t “trust Cambodia anymore”. “The last round of peace efforts didn’t work out… I don’t know if this one will either,” the 39-year-old said. Across the border, a Cambodian evacuee said she was “sad” the fighting hadn’t stopped despite Trump’s intervention. “I am not happy with brutal acts,” said Vy Rina, 43. Trading blame over civilians Bangkok and Phnom Penh have traded accusations of attacks against civilians, with the Thai army reporting six wounded on Saturday by Cambodian rockets. Cambodia’s information minister, Neth Pheaktra, meanwhile, said Thai forces had “expanded their attacks to include civilian infrastructure and Cambodian civilians”. A Thai navy spokesman said the air force “successfully destroyed” two Cambodian bridges used to transport weapons to the conflict zone. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Saturday urged both sides to “cease all forms of hostilities and refrain from any further military actions”. Thailand has reported 14 soldiers killed and seven civilian deaths, while Cambodia said four civilians were killed earlier this week. At a camp in Thailand’s Buriram, journalists saw displaced residents calling relatives near the border who reported that fighting was ongoing. Thailand’s prime minister has vowed to “continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people”. After the call with Trump, Anutin said, “the one who violated the agreement needs to fix (the situation)”. Cambodia’s Hun Manet, meanwhile, said his country “has always been adhering to peaceful means for dispute resolutions”. Published in Dawn, December 14th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "THE ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan remains ‘fragile’, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has described it . Mr Sharif, who was speaking at a multilateral forum in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan on Friday, also observed that the international community should press the Afghan Taliban to fulfil their commitments vis-à-vis preventing terrorists from using their soil to attack others. At the same forum, Turkish President Recep Erdogan again offered his good offices to maintain an “extended ceasefire” between Islamabad and Kabul. Meanwhile, a recent resolution adopted by around 1,000 Afghan clerics at a gathering in Kabul, calling for prohibition of cross-border movement of fighters, is a step in the right direction. Yet the effectiveness of this decree will only be proved if there is a visible drop in the number of terrorist attacks targeting Pakistan carried out by Afghanistan-based militants. According to reports, the clerics pledged that Afghan soil would not be used against other countries, while calling for “necessary measures” towards those who violate the edict. They also observed that Afghan Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada had prohibited Afghan nationals from participating in military activity abroad. The resolution is most likely referring to Mullah Akhundzada’s 2023 decree in which the Taliban head declared cross-border attacks, including those targeting Pakistan, as “haram”. Yet the Taliban chief’s prohibition has not been heeded by terrorists, who continue their bloody campaign against Pakistan. The resolution seems to be an attempt by the Afghan side to rebuild trust with Pakistan, and prevent bilateral ties from deteriorating further. The call was issued by independent clerics, not by the Taliban authorities, though as an Afghan participant of the Kabul conclave told this paper, Mullah Akhundzada “does not want a neighbour to have problems because of us”. The number of Afghans participating in cross-border attacks has risen, so perhaps the resolution is also an attempt to quell this trend. But the question remains: what about Pakistani terrorists based in Afghanistan who are involved in cross-border attacks? Will the Taliban regime take concrete action against them? If the realisation has dawned in Kabul and Kandahar that giving free rein to terrorist groups such as the TTP to attack Pakistan and other neighbours will further isolate Afghanistan regionally and globally, then it would be a case of ‘better late than never’. We hope these are not mere words, and that there is a sincere will on the Afghan side to address the issue of terrorism. The Foreign Office has cautiously welcomed the resolution. Continued bilateral tension and conflict is in the interest of neither state. Therefore, the mediation efforts of friendly states must continue. Once the terrorism issue is resolved, both states can start work on building a fruitful relationship. Published in Dawn, December 14th, 2025",

The resolution seems to be an attempt by the Afghan side to rebuild trust with Pakistan, and prevent bilateral ties from deteriorating further. The call was issued by independent clerics, not by the Taliban authorities, though as an Afghan participant of the Kabul conclave told this paper, Mullah Akhundzada “does not want a neighbour to have problems because of us”. The number of Afghans participating in cross-border attacks has risen, so perhaps the resolution is also an attempt to quell this trend. But the question remains: what about Pakistani terrorists based in Afghanistan who are involved in cross-border attacks? Will the Taliban regime take concrete action against them? If the realisation has dawned in Kabul and Kandahar that giving free rein to terrorist groups such as the TTP to attack Pakistan and other neighbours will further isolate Afghanistan regionally and globally, then it would be a case of ‘better late than never’. We hope these are not mere words, and that there is a sincere will on the Afghan side to address the issue of terrorism. The Foreign Office has cautiously welcomed the resolution. Continued bilateral tension and conflict is in the interest of neither state. Therefore, the mediation efforts of friendly states must continue. Once the terrorism issue is resolved, both states can start work on building a fruitful relationship. Published in Dawn, December 14th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office’s decision to summon Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsaas over his “unwanted presence” at a Supreme Court hearing involving rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, has sparked debate over the boundaries of diplomatic engagement in sensitive cases and the interpretation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. While the Foreign Office has described the envoy’s presence as interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs and a breach of diplomatic protocol and Article 41 of the Vienna Convention, several diplomats and former envoys argue that observing open court proceedings does not, in itself, amount to meddling. Former ambassador to India Abdul Basit, when asked whether the move could be construed as interference, said that “in the strict sense of the word”, it could not. He added that there was no provision in the Vienna Convention that bound diplomats to stay away from public court proceedings. However, he noted that diplomatic practice “would strongly suggest that diplomats in their host countries usually keep themselves away from internal politics”. But this doesn’t mean “they cannot interact with opposition politicians, which they do all the time, including our diplomats around the world”, Mr Basit added. The summoning of Norway’s envoy over attending a court hearing has ignited debate over how far diplomats can go in observing sensitive domestic proceedings under the Vienna Convention A senior European diplomat also insisted that mere observation of open court proceedings could not be labelled as interference. Citing Article 3(d) of the Vienna Convention — which outlines the functions of a diplomatic mission and includes “ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State” — the diplomat said it was not a breach of protocol for an envoy to attend open proceedings in a host country. Diplomatic immunity protected envoys from the jurisdiction of host-country courts but did not prevent them from observing public proceedings out of professional interest, the diplomat added. The Vienna Convention also emphasises freedom of movement (Article 26) and does not explicitly prohibit attendance at public events, including court hearings, as long as diplomats do not interfere with proceedings or undertake actions that could be seen as official intervention in domestic affairs. The diplomat said the Norwegian ambassador attended as a silent observer, sought no meeting with any judge and made no public comment about the case, which could not be viewed as an attempt to influence the judiciary or interfere with the judicial process. “When foreign observers monitor elections in Pakistan, do they interfere in the electoral process?” he asked, arguing that independent observation strengthened transparency. “Observers should be welcomed if there is nothing to hide and the trials are fair,” he said. ‘Serious error of judgement’ However, former ambassador to the European Union Naghmana Hashmi took a different view, saying Article 41 was explicit in requiring diplomats not to interfere “in any way” in the internal affairs of the host country. “If I were to analyse the actions of the Norwegian ambassador, I would say that it certainly falls under a violation of Article 41 of the Vienna Convention. He should not have gone there. I think it is a very, very serious error of judgement,” she said. Ms Hashmi acknowledged that the envoy did not make public statements or speak to the media, but she argued that the diplomat’s presence created an impression that he had been asked to attend by individuals facing accusations in a sensitive case. She pointed out that no other ambassador was seen attending the hearing, adding that the envoy was also seen on television shaking hands and speaking with the accused within the Supreme Court premises. “The Norwegian government may not be expressly saying that, but the perception certainly is that Norway is supporting the accused, which in any case is totally unacceptable,” she said. Ms Hashmi maintained that amb­assadors generally do not sit in court proceedings in other countries, particularly in cases linked to internal affairs and national security. Dip­lo­matic conduct, she said, was gov­ern­­ed by international law and established norms that must be respected. ‘Fair trial is a human right’ A European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the right to a fair trial was a human right and alleged violations could not be termed an internal matter. The diplomat cautioned against setting new precedents by summoning an ambassador for observing proceedings in open court, and questioned whether the move was intended as a signal to the rest of the diplomatic community in Pakistan. Former ambassador Muhammad Ayaz Wazir said attending court proceedings was not interference in itself, but added that any public comment on a pending case would be inconsistent with an envoy’s role. “He is not only an individual but a representative of a government. His words would therefore be attributed to the authority he represents,” he said, adding that much depended on how the host government viewed a particular case. “It is my personal view, as I am not privy to the government’s current policies on various issues,” he said. Another former ambassador said there was “no issue” with a foreign diplomat at­­­tending court or parliamentary proceedings, calling it part of normal diplomatic reporting and observation. He described the summoning as “intimidatory tactics” to discourage outside interest in the human rights situation in the country. The Vienna Convention and diplomatic conduct The Vienna Convention on Diplo­matic Relations (1961) is a cornerstone treaty of international law go­­verning diplomatic relations bet­ween sovereign states. It sets out the privileges, immunities and obligations of diplomatic missions, and is intended to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without intimidation or undue hindrance from the host state. The convention was adopted on April 18, 1961, and entered into force on April 24, 1964. It has achieved near-universal acceptance, with almost 200 states party to it. By codifying long-standing customs and practices, it provides a detailed framework for diplomatic engagement and has been central to maintaining channels of communication even amid serious disagreements between states. While the purpose of diplomacy is to preserve communication and manage differences, actions perceived as offending the host country can cause tension and lead to a formal protest, including summoning an ambassador to the foreign ministry to convey concern. In rare cases, disputes escalate to the downgrading or suspension of diplomatic representation. Some of the key provisions of the convention include: Article 9: The host country can declare a diplomat “persona non gr­­a­ta” and expel them, no reason ne­­ed­­ed, typically used in serious breaches. The declaration of persona non grata is a mechanism frequently employed in diplomatic disputes. Specific instances where ambassadors or other diplomatic agents have been declared persona non grata are often the result of bilateral tensions or breaches of the conduct expected under the convention. High-profile cases often make it to public knowledge, typically in the context of espionage, interference in domestic affairs or other diplomatic indiscretions. Article 22: Diplomatic missions are inviolable. The host country can’t enter without permission. Article 26: Diplomats have freedom of movement and travel in the host country, with some security exceptions. Article 27: Diplomatic missions can communicate freely with their government, using diplomatic bags that aren’t to be opened or detained. Article 29: Diplomats can’t be arrested or detained. Their private residences are also protected. Article 30: Diplomatic archives and documents are inviolable, wherever they are. Article 31: Diplomats have immunity from criminal jurisdiction of the host country. Civil immunity applies except in specific cases (e.g. private property disputes). Article 41: Diplomats must resp­ect the laws of the host country and not interfere in its internal affairs. These provisions aim to ensure diplomats can perform their duties without fear or hindrance, promoting smooth international relations. Published in Dawn, December 14th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Defence minister says accountability of ‘conspirators’ to continue • Says Pakistan being revived through ‘hybrid system’ • ‘Plotters’ still trying to ‘facilitate Imran’s return’ • Alleges PTI leaders ‘bribe’ Taliban, want talks with ‘enemies’ NAROWAL: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday maintained that the deadly riots on May 9, 2023 was a ‘joint venture’ between ex-spymaster Faiz Ham­eed and PTI founder Imran Khan, vowing that the process of acc­o­untability for ‘enemies’ of Paki­stan, whether they were civilian or in uniform, would continue. The minister also asserted there were still other charges against Hameed on which legal proceedings would be initiated soon. He made these remarks after the former director general of Inter-Services Intelligence was sentenced to a 14-year jail term in a case related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others. Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, Mr Asif claimed both the ex-spymaster and the ex-premier were partners in the ‘plan to destroy Pakistan and its army’. “Faiz Hameed and Imran Khan were equally involved in planning what happened in Mianwali, Lahore, Peshawar, and in front of GHQ on May 9,” he said. “Those who have put the country’s future at stake for power cannot be considered Pakistanis whe­ther they are in uniform like Faiz or in a waistcoat and Peshawari sandals like Imran,” he added. Calling the May 9 riots an ‘attack on the sanctity of the armed forces’, he said the same institution had restored national pride through Operation Bunyanul Marsoos against India in May , earning Pakistan international acclaim. “God forbid, if the Faiz-Imran nexus still existed, perhaps there would not have been a need for war at all since they would have ensured the country’s destruction from the inside,” he said. Nawaz’s ouster, parliament’s role The minister alleged Hameed was in charge of ‘Project Imran’, blaming him for the ouster of prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017. “The removal of Nawaz Sharif, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s [Khan] coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hameed. Nawaz Sharif was kept in prison during the 2018 elections. Imran [Khan] had put Nawaz Sharif, his family members and other politicians in jail through Faiz.” He claimed Mr Khan was made the prime minister through rigging under Hameed’s supervision and alleged that they played a ‘dangerous game’ with the country during the next four years. He said the ex-spymaster facilitated the ‘imprisonment of political opponents’. While terming the period a ‘shameful chapter’ in country’s history, the defence minister said parliament was converted into an ISI ‘subsidiary’. “During the Faiz’s tenure [as ISI chief], the agency used to dictate legislation to parliament.” He claimed that after Hameed’s transfer, the ‘project’ started to slowly ‘unravel’, but as a corps commander he continued to facilitate Mr Khan. “Faiz used to plan mischief in Pakistan, and the PTI provided the manpower to execute those plans.” ‘Conspirators still active’ While admitting that the current system of governance a ‘hybrid system’ involving cooperation bet­ween the government and the military, the defence minister said the stability was brought through this. But, he added, conspirators were again attempting to prop up the PTI founder and bring him back to power, adding that ‘all these seeds were sown by Faiz’. He said 3,000 to 4,000 Afghans were brought to and settled in Pakistan to cause mischief in the country. “These Afghans were accommodated in the homes of citizens.” He accused PTI leaders of bribing the Taliban, alleging that party wanted to hold talks with Pakistan’s ‘enemies’. About the recent conviction of the ex-spymaster, the minister noted that Hameed still had the right to appeal at relevant forums, including the army’s court of appeals and high court.

About the recent conviction of the ex-spymaster, the minister noted that Hameed still had the right to appeal at relevant forums, including the army’s court of appeals and high court.

      "summary": "• Defence minister says accountability of ‘conspirators’ to continue • Says Pakistan being revived through ‘hybrid system’ • ‘Plotters’ still trying to ‘facilitate Imran’s return’ • Alleges PTI leaders ‘bribe’ Taliban, want talks with ‘enemies’ NAROWAL: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday maintained that the deadly riots on May 9, 2023 was a ‘joint venture’ between ex-spymaster Faiz Ham­eed and PTI founder Imran Khan, vowing that the process of acc­o­untability for ‘enemies’ of Paki­stan, whether they were civilian or in uniform, would continue. The minister also asserted there were still other charges against Hameed on which legal proceedings would be initiated soon. He made these remarks after the former director general of Inter-Services Intelligence was sentenced to a 14-year jail term in a case related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others. Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, Mr Asif claimed both the ex-spymaster and the ex-premier were partners in the ‘plan to destroy Pakistan and its army’. “Faiz Hameed and Imran Khan were equally involved in planning what happened in Mianwali, Lahore, Peshawar, and in front of GHQ on May 9,” he said. “Those who have put the country’s future at stake for power cannot be considered Pakistanis whe­ther they are in uniform like Faiz or in a waistcoat and Peshawari sandals like Imran,” he added. Calling the May 9 riots an ‘attack on the sanctity of the armed forces’, he said the same institution had restored national pride through Operation Bunyanul Marsoos against India in May , earning Pakistan international acclaim. “God forbid, if the Faiz-Imran nexus still existed, perhaps there would not have been a need for war at all since they would have ensured the country’s destruction from the inside,” he said. Nawaz’s ouster, parliament’s role The minister alleged Hameed was in charge of ‘Project Imran’, blaming him for the ouster of prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017. “The removal of Nawaz Sharif, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s [Khan] coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hameed. Nawaz Sharif was kept in prison during the 2018 elections. Imran [Khan] had put Nawaz Sharif, his family members and other politicians in jail through Faiz.” He claimed Mr Khan was made the prime minister through rigging under Hameed’s supervision and alleged that they played a ‘dangerous game’ with the country during the next four years. He said the ex-spymaster facilitated the ‘imprisonment of political opponents’. While terming the period a ‘shameful chapter’ in country’s history, the defence minister said parliament was converted into an ISI ‘subsidiary’. “During the Faiz’s tenure [as ISI chief], the agency used to dictate legislation to parliament.” He claimed that after Hameed’s transfer, the ‘project’ started to slowly ‘unravel’, but as a corps commander he continued to facilitate Mr Khan. “Faiz used to plan mischief in Pakistan, and the PTI provided the manpower to execute those plans.” ‘Conspirators still active’ While admitting that the current system of governance a ‘hybrid system’ involving cooperation bet­ween the government and the military, the defence minister said the stability was brought through this. But, he added, conspirators were again attempting to prop up the PTI founder and bring him back to power, adding that ‘all these seeds were sown by Faiz’. He said 3,000 to 4,000 Afghans were brought to and settled in Pakistan to cause mischief in the country. “These Afghans were accommodated in the homes of citizens.” He accused PTI leaders of bribing the Taliban, alleging that party wanted to hold talks with Pakistan’s ‘enemies’.

      "summary_orig": "Three United States military personnel, two soldiers and a civilian interpreter, were killed on Saturday by a suspected Islamic State (IS) attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces, the US military said. Three other US soldiers were wounded, the US military’s Central Command said. In a statement, Central Command said the attack by a lone gunman occurred “as the soldiers were conducting a key leader engagement” in the central Syrian town of Palmyra. “Partner forces” killed the attacker, US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth wrote in a social media post. IS did not immediately claim responsibility, but a senior US official said initial assessments indicate the militant group probably carried out the attack. It took place in an area not controlled by the Syrian government, the official said. The soldiers’ names will be withheld until 24 hours after the next-of-kin notification, the US military said. Syrian state news agency SANA quoted a security source as saying two Syrian service personnel were injured, without providing further details. The source told SANA that American helicopters evacuated the injured to a US base in Syria’s Al-Tanf region near the Iraqi border. Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkiye and special envoy to Syria, condemned the attack. “We mourn the loss of three brave US service members and civilian personnel and wish a speedy recovery to the Syrian troops wounded in the attack,” Barrack said in a statement. “We remain committed to defeating terrorism with our Syrian partners.” The attack came barely a month after Syria announced it had signed a political cooperation agreement with the US-led coalition against IS, which coincided with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa’s visit to the White House. The coalition has carried out air strikes and ground operations in Syria targeting IS suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces. Syria last month also carried out a nationwide campaign arresting more than 70 people accused of links to the group. The US has troops stationed in northeastern Syria as part of a decade-long effort to help a Kurdish-led force there.",

As a part of a so-called GOAT Tour, the 38-year-old Argentina and Inter Miami superstar touched down in the eastern state of West Bengal early Saturday, greeted by a chorus of exuberant fans chanting his name. Hours later, thousands of fans wearing Messi jerseys and waving the Argentine flag packed into Salt Lake stadium in the state capital Kolkata, but heavy security around the footballer left fans struggling to catch a glimpse of him. Messi walked around the pitch waving to fans and left the stadium earlier than expected. Inter Miami’s Argentine forward #10 Lionel Messi arrives at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata on December 13. —AFP Frustrated fans, many having paid more than $100 for tickets, ripped out stadium seats and hurled water bottles onto the track. Many others stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents. “For me, to watch Messi is a pleasure, a dream. But I have missed the chance to have a glimpse because of the mismanagement in the stadium,” businessman Nabin Chatterjee, 37, told AFP. Before the chaos erupted, Messi unveiled a 21-metre (70-foot) statue which shows him holding aloft the World Cup. He was also expected to play a short exhibition game at the stadium. Another angry fan told the Press Trust of India ( PTI ) that people had spent “a month’s salary” to see Messi.

The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame,” Ajay Shah, told PTI . Javed Shamim, a senior police official in the state, told reporters that the event’s “chief organiser” had been arrested, without giving any further details. “There is total normalcy,” he said, adding that authorities would look into how organisers could refund money to those who bought tickets. State chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was “disturbed” and “shocked” at the mismanagement. “I sincerely apologise to Lionel Messi, as well as to all sports lovers and his fans, for the unfortunate incident,” she said in a post on X, adding that she had ordered a probe into the incident. The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said it was not involved in the “organisation, planning, or execution” of the “private event”. “Furthermore, the details of the event were neither communicated to the AIFF, nor was any clearance sought from the Federation,” a statement said.
