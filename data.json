      "summary_orig": "Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Muhammad Mehar Ali Shah on Sunday said India’s claim of placing the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in “abeyance” has no legal basis and that the treaty remains fully in force under international law. In April 2025, India held the IWT in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war” . In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration held that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. Speaking on Geo News ‘ programme ‘Jirga’, Shah talked about the legality of India holding the IWT in abeyance and said: “As far as holding the treaty in abeyance is concerned, the word ‘abeyance’ is not recognised under international treaty law. It is a coined term, because we believe India understands that it cannot suspend, breach or terminate the treaty.” However, he cautioned that India’s continued non-cooperation within the rules-based framework, effectively sidestepping its obligations on self-created grounds, was “alarming”, prompting Pakistan to pursue a formal and carefully calibrated legal and diplomatic response. “To address this, Pakistan is employing efforts carefully, and whatever steps are being taken are formal in nature,” he said. He said the treaty was carefully negotiated to withstand political tensions and disputes, stressing that its dispute-resolution mechanism was designed to prevent unilateral actions. About Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s threats of stopping the flow of Pakistan’s share of water, Shah asserted: “There is no room for stopping or partially stopping Pakistan’s water. This also goes against moral standards. “Technically, if one party is stubborn on diverting the western rivers flowing into Pakistan, to reduce it to stop it, so naturally, there have been inter-basin transfer examples in the world,” he observed. “When we gave the three eastern rivers to India, we have been facing consequences since the beginning of the treaty. Sutlej is always dry, barring the flooding season. Ravi is dry,” the water commissioner said. Shah reiterated that any move by India to reduce water flows to Pakistan “would be considered an act of war”. “There is no fixed amount of water allocated to Pakistan,” he said, adding that the waters should be available to Pakistan based on the “natural pattern of the western rivers”. “So far, Chenab, Jhelum and Indus are receiving water in a natural pattern. But since April 24, 2025, India has created three such episodes, which we picked up — twice in May and once in December — when they increased the flow and then decreased it for a few days,” Shah pointed out. Speaking about the procedures stated under the “well-thought-out” pact, Shah said one clause stated that in the face of conflict, Pakistan and India will peacefully solve the water matter. “Otherwise, they will hand it to a neutral party,” he added. The official noted, “The 12th and last article of this treaty has four provisions. In the last paragraph, it says that with the passage of time, some changes can be made to the pact, but both parties have to mutually agree; otherwise, the pact will remain fully enforced. “And it clearly says that no one party can unilaterally change it,” the water commissioner stressed. Asked whether the IWT favoured India, Shah replied that the three eastern rivers — Beas, Ravi and Sutlej — have a “geographic advantage”, unlike the western rivers. Recalling the history of water disputes between the two neighbours, Shah said India halted the rivers’ flow to Pakistan on March 31, 1948, which Pakistan protested on a bilateral level and took the issue to the United Nations. After the IWT was agreed upon in 1960, India first violated the pact when it was building the Salal Dam , with which Pakistan had issues, and they were subsequently resolved through the treaty. “The pact does not have a guarantor as such, but it has its own mechanism,” the official observed. The water commissioner said the basic feature of the IWT was that the western rivers’ natural flow must not be altered. “India was allowed to use the western rivers for hydroelectric power generation only in line with the pact guidelines. If there is a violation, then any party can take the matter to a third forum,” Shah said. Providing an example of such an instance, Shah recalled that Pakistan decided to take the matter to a third forum when India built the Baglihar Dam on the western rivers, “violating five of the conditions”. The official noted there were two third-party forums where conflicts could be taken — “one is a neutral forum, and the other is the Court of Arbitration forum”. The procedure for it, Shah added, was that the water commissioners must inform each other and suggest whether the matter should go to a neutral party or a court. “So if one party does not agree to going to the court, for instance, then the matter must go to a neutral party, who will decide whether the matter falls within their expertise,” he explained, adding that internationally recognised experts are part of the team when the issue is taken to a neutral forum. “When the Baglihar Dam decision was taken, it was not in favour of Pakistan. The extent of that decision was only confined to the Baglihar Dam and it did not apply to any future development plans,” Shah said. The water commissioner highlighted that although Pakistan did not agree with the decision, it was binding under the IWT. “So in order to stop India from taking future decisions based on the decision of the Baglihar Dam, Pakistan filed a case at the Court of Arbitration for a general interpretation.” Detailing more water conflicts, Shah said that after Baglihar, Pakistan raised the issue about India constructing the 850 megawatt Ratle Hydroelectric Plant on the Chenab river bilaterally first, and also went to a third forum. The water commissioner then mentioned that Pakistan had also raised objections on the Kiru and Kwar hydroelectric projects in India, whose designs New Delhi shared with Islamabad prior to the April 2025 developments.",

      "title_orig": "Rubio says US to work with current Venezuela leaders if they make ‘right decision’; Maduro now in NY jail",
      "summary_orig": "The United States is ready to work with Venezuela’s remaining leaders if they make “the right decision”, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday after an audacious US operation removed the oil-rich country’s president, Nicolas Maduro. “We‘re going to judge everything by what they do, and we‘re going to see what they do,” Rubio told CBS News ’ ‘Face the Nation’. “I do know this: that if they don’t make the right decision, that the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage.” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was in a New York detention centre on Sunday after US President Donald Trump ordered a US raid to capture the South American leader and take control of the country and its vast oil reserves. As part of the dramatic operation early on Saturday that knocked out electricity in parts of Caracas and included strikes on military installations, US Special Forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and transported them via helicopter to a US Navy ship offshore before flying them to the US. Rubio appeared to significantly soften Trump’s extraordinary statements on Saturday that the US will “ run” Venezuela and that he would not be afraid to put military “boots on the ground”. Instead, he made clear that Washington is ready to try working with Maduro’s vice president and now acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, and the rest of the ousted leader’s cabinet. “We are going to see what happens moving forward,” he said. “We’re going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, what they’ve done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.” He also gave no indication that the Trump administration would support opposition figures who have previously been hailed by Washington as the country’s legitimate leaders. Asked about backing Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado , last year’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate , Rubio said he had “admiration” for her, but avoided any demands that she — or her party’s candidate in the 2024 election, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia — become interim leaders. He said the US wanted to avoid getting mired in nation-building. “The whole foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan,” he said, referring to previous US interventions. “This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different.” Rubio’s remarks contrasted with Trump’s statements that “we’re going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place” and that his own cabinet officials would be in charge of the country. Rubio said US pressure would remain on Venezuela in the form of the large naval presence in the Caribbean and an oil export embargo “that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next”. Pakistan urges de-escalation “Pakistan attaches great importance to the well being of the people of Venezuela and views with concern the evolving situation in Venezuela,” said a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO) late on Sunday. It stated: “We urge the need for restraint and de-escalation to end the crisis, and underscore the necessity for adherence to the principles of the UN Charter as well as international law to resolve all outstanding issues. “We are closely monitoring the developments and remain engaged in ensuring the safety and security of members of the Pakistani community in Venezuela,” the FO added. Maduro in New York A plane carrying Maduro landed near New York City on Saturday night, and he was helicoptered to the city before being taken by a large convoy to the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn under a heavy police guard. Images released by US authorities showed the leader handcuffed and blindfolded during the flight, and later being led down a hallway at the offices of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, where he was heard wishing a “happy New Year”. Indicted on various federal charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, Maduro expected to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court on Monday, according to a Justice Department official. It is unclear how Trump plans to oversee Venezuela. US forces have no control over the country, and Maduro’s government appears not only to still be in charge but to have no appetite for cooperating with Washington. Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared on Venezuelan television on Saturday afternoon with other top officials to decry what she called a kidnapping. “We demand the immediate release of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores,” Rodriguez said, calling Maduro “the only president of Venezuela”. A Venezuelan court ordered Rodriguez to assume the position of interim president. One aspect that became clearer was Trump’s interest in Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies … go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure,” he said. “We’ll be selling large amounts of oil.” “We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump told a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. For months, his administration criticised Maduro, 63, alleging his involvement in shipping drugs to the US. It ramped up pressure with a massive military build-up in the Caribbean and a series of deadly missile attacks on alleged drug-running boats . Trump dismisses opposition leader US-backed opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, posted on social media that “the hour of freedom has arrived”. She called for the opposition’s 2024 election candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, to “immediately” assume the presidency. But Trump was surprisingly cold about expectations that Machado could become Venezuela’s new leader, saying she doesn’t have “support or respect” there. Instead, he touted Rodriguez, saying “she’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again”. Rodriguez poured cold water on that, demanding Maduro’s release and vowing to “defend” the country. Mamdani opposes ‘pursuit of regime change’ New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said on Saturday he had called Trump and voiced his opposition to a “pursuit of regime change” in Venezuela. “I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law,” he said while speaking to reporters. Separately, in a post on social media platform X, he said he had been briefed about the US military capture of Venezuelan President Maduro and his wife, as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City. “Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law. “This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home. My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance,“ he added. China, North Korea condemn US actions Venezuela’s ally China initially said it “strongly condemns” the US operation, while France warned a solution cannot “be imposed from outside”. China’s foreign ministry later said on Sunday that the United States should immediately release Maduro and his wife and resolve the situation in Venezuela through dialogue and negotiation. The ministry said in a statement on its website that the United States should also ensure the personal safety of Maduro and his wife, saying that their deportation violated international law and norms. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected”. At Venezuela’s request, the UN Security Council will meet on Monday to discuss the crisis. While many Western allies oppose Maduro and say he stole Venezuela’s 2024 election, Trump’s boasts about controlling the nation and exploiting its oil revived painful memories of past US interventions in Latin America, Iraq and Afghanistan. Some legal experts questioned the legality of an operation to seize the head of state of a foreign power, while Democrats who said they were misled during recent Congress briefings demanded a plan for what is to follow. Trump said as part of the takeover, major US oil companies would move back into Venezuela, which has the world’s largest oil reserves, and refurbish badly degraded oil infrastructure, a process experts said could take years. North Korea also denounced the US strikes as “the most serious form of encroachment of sovereignty,” state news agency KCNA said today. “The incident is another example that clearly confirms once again the rogue and brutal nature of the United States,” KCNA said, citing a spokesperson for North Korea’s foreign ministry. The statement came after North Korea launched ballistic missiles earlier on Sunday, the day the leader of South Korea begins a state visit to China, Pyongyang’s chief ally. Pyongyang said the current situation in Venezuela “caused a catastrophic consequence to ensuring the identity of the regional and international relations structure”. UK seeks peaceful transition to ‘legitimate’ Venezuelan govt Meanwhile, the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK has “long supported a transition of power in Venezuela”. “We regarded Maduro as an illegitimate president and we shed no tears about the end of his regime,” he said on X. “I reiterated my support for international law this morning. The UK government will discuss the evolving situation with US counterparts in the days ahead as we seek a safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people.” The US and numerous European governments did not recognise Maduro’s legitimacy, saying he stole elections in 2018 and 2024. Maduro — in power since 2013 after taking over from leftist mentor Hugo Chavez — long accused Trump of seeking regime change in order to control Venezuela’s oil reserves. Trump has offered several justifications for the aggressive policy toward Venezuela, at times stressing illegal migration, narcotics trafficking and oil. But he had previously avoided openly calling for regime change. Several members of Congress quickly questioned the legality of the operation. But Trump’s key ally Mike Johnson, top Republican in the House of Representatives, said it was “justified”. Blackout and bombing Venezuelans had been bracing for attacks as US forces spent months massing off the coast. Caracas residents woke to explosions and the whir of military helicopters around 2am local time (11am PKT). Air strikes hit a major military base and an airbase, among other sites, for nearly an hour. The top US military officer, General Dan Caine, said 150 aircraft took part in the operation, supporting troops who choppered in to seize Maduro with the help of months of intelligence into his daily habits — down to “what he ate” and what pets he kept. Maduro and his wife “gave up” without a struggle, and there was “no loss of US life,” he said. Venezuelan authorities have yet to release casualty figures. But Trump told the New York Post that “many” Cubans in Maduro’s security detail were killed. Within hours of the operation, Caracas had fallen eerily quiet, with police stationed outside public buildings and the smell of smoke drifting through the streets.",

      "summary_en": "The United States is ready to work with Venezuela’s remaining leaders if they make “the right decision”, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday after an audacious US operation removed the oil-rich country’s president, Nicolas Maduro. “We‘re going to judge everything by what they do, and we‘re going to see what they do,” Rubio told CBS News ’ ‘Face the Nation’. “I do know this: that if they don’t make the right decision, that the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage.” Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was in a New York detention centre on Sunday after US President Donald Trump ordered a US raid to capture the South American leader and take control of the country and its vast oil reserves. As part of the dramatic operation early on Saturday that knocked out electricity in parts of Caracas and included strikes on military installations, US Special Forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and transported them via helicopter to a US Navy ship offshore before flying them to the US. Rubio appeared to significantly soften Trump’s extraordinary statements on Saturday that the US will “ run” Venezuela and that he would not be afraid to put military “boots on the ground”. Instead, he made clear that Washington is ready to try working with Maduro’s vice president and now acting president, Delcy Rodriguez, and the rest of the ousted leader’s cabinet. “We are going to see what happens moving forward,” he said. “We’re going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, what they’ve done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.” He also gave no indication that the Trump administration would support opposition figures who have previously been hailed by Washington as the country’s legitimate leaders. Asked about backing Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado , last year’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate , Rubio said he had “admiration” for her, but avoided any demands that she — or her party’s candidate in the 2024 election, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia — become interim leaders. He said the US wanted to avoid getting mired in nation-building. “The whole foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan,” he said, referring to previous US interventions. “This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different.” Rubio’s remarks contrasted with Trump’s statements that “we’re going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place” and that his own cabinet officials would be in charge of the country. Rubio said US pressure would remain on Venezuela in the form of the large naval presence in the Caribbean and an oil export embargo “that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next”. Pakistan urges de-escalation “Pakistan attaches great importance to the well being of the people of Venezuela and views with concern the evolving situation in Venezuela,” said a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO) late on Sunday. It stated: “We urge the need for restraint and de-escalation to end the crisis, and underscore the necessity for adherence to the principles of the UN Charter as well as international law to resolve all outstanding issues. “We are closely monitoring the developments and remain engaged in ensuring the safety and security of members of the Pakistani community in Venezuela,” the FO added. Maduro in New York A plane carrying Maduro landed near New York City on Saturday night, and he was helicoptered to the city before being taken by a large convoy to the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn under a heavy police guard. Images released by US authorities showed the leader handcuffed and blindfolded during the flight, and later being led down a hallway at the offices of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, where he was heard wishing a “happy New Year”. Indicted on various federal charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy, Maduro expected to make an initial appearance in Manhattan federal court on Monday, according to a Justice Department official. It is unclear how Trump plans to oversee Venezuela. US forces have no control over the country, and Maduro’s government appears not only to still be in charge but to have no appetite for cooperating with Washington. Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, appeared on Venezuelan television on Saturday afternoon with other top officials to decry what she called a kidnapping. “We demand the immediate release of President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores,” Rodriguez said, calling Maduro “the only president of Venezuela”. A Venezuelan court ordered Rodriguez to assume the position of interim president. One aspect that became clearer was Trump’s interest in Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. “We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies … go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure,” he said. “We’ll be selling large amounts of oil.” “We will run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition,” Trump told a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. For months, his administration criticised Maduro, 63, alleging his involvement in shipping drugs to the US. It ramped up pressure with a massive military build-up in the Caribbean and a series of deadly missile attacks on alleged drug-running boats . Trump dismisses opposition leader US-backed opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, posted on social media that “the hour of freedom has arrived”. She called for the opposition’s 2024 election candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, to “immediately” assume the presidency. But Trump was surprisingly cold about expectations that Machado could become Venezuela’s new leader, saying she doesn’t have “support or respect” there. Instead, he touted Rodriguez, saying “she’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again”. Rodriguez poured cold water on that, demanding Maduro’s release and vowing to “defend” the country. Mamdani opposes ‘pursuit of regime change’ New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said on Saturday he had called Trump and voiced his opposition to a “pursuit of regime change” in Venezuela. “I called the president and spoke with him directly to register my opposition to this act and to make clear that it was an opposition based on being opposed to a pursuit of regime change, to the violation of federal international law,” he said while speaking to reporters. Separately, in a post on social media platform X, he said he had been briefed about the US military capture of Venezuelan President Maduro and his wife, as well as their planned imprisonment in federal custody here in New York City. “Unilaterally attacking a sovereign nation is an act of war and a violation of federal and international law. “This blatant pursuit of regime change doesn’t just affect those abroad, it directly impacts New Yorkers, including tens of thousands of Venezuelans who call this city home. My focus is their safety and the safety of every New Yorker, and my administration will continue to monitor the situation and issue relevant guidance,“ he added. China, North Korea condemn US actions Venezuela’s ally China initially said it “strongly condemns” the US operation, while France warned a solution cannot “be imposed from outside”. China’s foreign ministry later said on Sunday that the United States should immediately release Maduro and his wife and resolve the situation in Venezuela through dialogue and negotiation. The ministry said in a statement on its website that the United States should also ensure the personal safety of Maduro and his wife, saying that their deportation violated international law and norms. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected”. At Venezuela’s request, the UN Security Council will meet on Monday to discuss the crisis. While many Western allies oppose Maduro and say he stole Venezuela’s 2024 election, Trump’s boasts about controlling the nation and exploiting its oil revived painful memories of past US interventions in Latin America, Iraq and Afghanistan. Some legal experts questioned the legality of an operation to seize the head of state of a foreign power, while Democrats who said they were misled during recent Congress briefings demanded a plan for what is to follow. Trump said as part of the takeover, major US oil companies would move back into Venezuela, which has the world’s largest oil reserves, and refurbish badly degraded oil infrastructure, a process experts said could take years. North Korea also denounced the US strikes as “the most serious form of encroachment of sovereignty,” state news agency KCNA said today. “The incident is another example that clearly confirms once again the rogue and brutal nature of the United States,” KCNA said, citing a spokesperson for North Korea’s foreign ministry. The statement came after North Korea launched ballistic missiles earlier on Sunday, the day the leader of South Korea begins a state visit to China, Pyongyang’s chief ally. Pyongyang said the current situation in Venezuela “caused a catastrophic consequence to ensuring the identity of the regional and international relations structure”.

      "summary_orig": "Attacks by Sudan’s army and its paramilitary foes on two towns in the western Darfur region over the past week have killed 114 people, medical sources told AFP on Sunday. Since April 2023, Sudan has been gripped by a war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which in October seized the army’s last holdout position in Darfur. The RSF has since pushed west to the Chadian border and east through the vast Kordofan region, where a drone strike on the North Kordofan capital of El-Obeid on Sunday caused a blackout in the key army-controlled city. A medical source reported Sunday that 51 people were killed the day before in drone strikes attributed to the army on the North Darfur town of Al-Zuruq, 180 kilometres (112 miles) north of the RSF-overrun state capital El-Fashir. The strike hit a market and civilian areas, the source said. Al-Zuruq, under RSF control, is home to family members of RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the former deputy of his now rival, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. “Two of the Daglo family were killed, Moussa Saleh Daglo and Awad Moussa Saleh Daglo,” an eyewitness to the burial told AFP . Both the RSF and the army are accused of targeting civilian areas, in what the UN has called a “war of atrocities”. RSF fighters advancing westward towards the border with Chad last week killed another 63 people in and around the town of Kernoi, a medical source in the local hospital told AFP on Sunday. “Until Friday, 63 were killed and 57 injured… in attacks launched by the RSF around Kernoi,” they said, speaking on condition of anonymity for their safety. Local sources told AFP that 17 people were still missing. The entire Darfur region is largely inaccessible to reporters and is under years-long communications blackout, forcing local volunteers and medics to use satellite internet to get news to the world. According to the United Nations, over 7,000 people were displaced in just two days last month from Kernoi and the nearby village of Um Baru. Many are from the Zaghawa group, which has been targeted by the RSF.  Members of the group have fought in the current war alongside the army in a coalition known as the Joint Forces. ‘Attacked by drones’ Since the war began, tens of thousands have been killed and millions displaced. Much of the worst fighting has been in Darfur, reviving memories of mass ethnic atrocities committed in the 2000s by the Janjaweed, the RSF’s predecessor. The war’s fiercest violence is currently unfolding in Kordofan, Sudan’s vast oil-rich southern region that links Darfur to the capital Khartoum, which the army recaptured last year. Drone strikes on North Kordofan capital El-Obeid caused a power outage, the national electricity company said. “El-Obeid power station … was attacked by drones, leading to a fire in the machinery building, which led to a halt in the electricity supply,” the company said. Following its victory in El-Fasher, the RSF has sought to recapture Sudan’s central corridor, tightening its siege with its local allies around several army-held cities. Hundreds of thousands face mass starvation across the region. Last year, the army broke a paramilitary siege on El-Obeid, which the RSF has sought to encircle since. The Joint Forces said last week they had retaken several towns south of El-Obeid, which, according to a military source, could “open up the road between El-Obeid and Dilling” — one of South Kordofan’s besieged cities. Since mid-December, some 11,000 people have been displaced from North and South Kordofan states, according to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration. The war has forced more than 11 million people to flee internally and across Sudan’s borders, many of them seeking shelter in underdeveloped areas with a lack of nutrition, medicine and clean water.",

      "title_orig": "New clashes in Iran as protests sparked by rising cost of living enter 2nd week: rights groups",
      "summary_orig": "New deadly clashes between protesters and security forces erupted in Iran over the weekend, rights groups and local media said on Sunday, as demonstrations first sparked by anger over the rising cost of living entered a second week. At least 12 people, including members of the security forces, have been killed since the protests kicked off with a shopkeeper’s strike in Tehran on December 28, according to a toll based on official reports. Overnight, protests featuring slogans criticising the Islamic republic’s clerical authorities were reported in Tehran, Shiraz in the south, and in areas of western Iran where the movement has been concentrated, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) monitor. The demonstrations are the most significant in Iran since a 2022-2023 movement sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress code for women. The latest protests have been concentrated in parts of the west with large populations of the Kurdish and Lor minorities, and have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-2023 movement, let alone the mass street demonstrations that followed the disputed 2009 presidential elections . But they do present a new challenge for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — 86, and in power since 1989 — coming on the heels of a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw nuclear infrastructure damaged and key members of the security elite killed. The protests have taken place in 23 out of 31 provinces and affected, to varying degrees, at least 40 different cities, most of them small and medium-sized, according to an AFP tally based on official announcements and media reports. Deadly clashes The Norway-based Hengaw rights group said that Revolutionary Guards opened fire on protesters in the Malekshahi county of the western Ilam province on Saturday, killing four members of Iran’s Kurdish minority. The group said it was checking reports that two other people had been killed, adding that dozens more were wounded. It also accused the authorities of raiding the main hospital in the city of Ilam to seize the bodies of the protesters. The Iran Human Rights NGO, also based in Norway, gave an identical toll of four dead, as well as 30 wounded, after “security forces attacked the protests” in Malekshahi. Both organisations posted footage of what appeared to be bloodied corpses on the ground, in videos verified by AFP . Iran’s Mehr news agency alluded to the clashes, saying a Revolutionary Guard was killed in a confrontation with “rioters” at a police office. “Rioters attempted to storm a police station,” the Fars news agency reported, saying “two assailants were killed”. In Tehran, sporadic demonstrations on Saturday night were reported in districts in the east, west and south, the Fars news agency said. Videos verified by AFP showed security forces dispersing protesters who had gathered overnight and blocked a road by overturning garbage cans. On Sunday, the vast majority of shops were open in the capital, although the streets appeared less crowded than usual, with riot police and security forces deployed at major intersections, AFP observed. ‘Growing confrontation’ The protests began last week with a shutdown by merchants in the Tehran bazaar, an influential economic hub, and spread to other regions as well as universities. UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran Mai Sato said on Friday that “reports indicate growing confrontation between protesters and security forces”, and warned the violent response witnessed during the 2022-2023 movement “must not be repeated”. HRNA said that over the last week, at least 582 people have been arrested. Hengaw said almost all of those killed were from ethnic minorities, chiefly Kurds and Lors. United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that the US was “ locked and loaded ” to respond if Iran killed protesters — a day before the American operation to capture Iran’s ally Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the remarks “reckless” and warned that the armed forces were “on standby” in the event of any intervention. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said on Sunday that his country stood in “solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people”, adding it was possible they were “taking their destiny into their own hands”. Publicly, Iranian officials, including Khamenei, have taken a conciliatory tone when it comes to protesters’ economic demands, while warning that destabilisation and chaos will not be tolerated.",

In Tehran, sporadic demonstrations on Saturday night were reported in districts in the east, west and south, the Fars news agency said. Videos verified by AFP showed security forces dispersing protesters who had gathered overnight and blocked a road by overturning garbage cans. On Sunday, the vast majority of shops were open in the capital, although the streets appeared less crowded than usual, with riot police and security forces deployed at major intersections, AFP observed. ‘Growing confrontation’ The protests began last week with a shutdown by merchants in the Tehran bazaar, an influential economic hub, and spread to other regions as well as universities. UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran Mai Sato said on Friday that “reports indicate growing confrontation between protesters and security forces”, and warned the violent response witnessed during the 2022-2023 movement “must not be repeated”. HRNA said that over the last week, at least 582 people have been arrested. Hengaw said almost all of those killed were from ethnic minorities, chiefly Kurds and Lors. United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that the US was “ locked and loaded ” to respond if Iran killed protesters — a day before the American operation to capture Iran’s ally Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the remarks “reckless” and warned that the armed forces were “on standby” in the event of any intervention. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, said on Sunday that his country stood in “solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people”, adding it was possible they were “taking their destiny into their own hands”. Publicly, Iranian officials, including Khamenei, have taken a conciliatory tone when it comes to protesters’ economic demands, while warning that destabilisation and chaos will not be tolerated.",
      "title": "New clashes in Iran as protests sparked by rising cost of living enter 2nd week: rights groups",
      "summary": "New deadly clashes between protesters and security forces erupted in Iran over the weekend, rights groups and local media said on Sunday, as demonstrations first sparked by anger over the rising cost of living entered a second week. At least 12 people, including members of the security forces, have been killed since the protests kicked off with a shopkeeper’s strike in Tehran on December 28, according to a toll based on official reports. Overnight, protests featuring slogans criticising the Islamic republic’s clerical authorities were reported in Tehran, Shiraz in the south, and in areas of western Iran where the movement has been concentrated, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) monitor. The demonstrations are the most significant in Iran since a 2022-2023 movement sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested for allegedly violating Iran’s strict dress code for women. The latest protests have been concentrated in parts of the west with large populations of the Kurdish and Lor minorities, and have yet to reach the scale of the 2022-2023 movement, let alone the mass street demonstrations that followed the disputed 2009 presidential elections . But they do present a new challenge for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — 86, and in power since 1989 — coming on the heels of a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw nuclear infrastructure damaged and key members of the security elite killed. The protests have taken place in 23 out of 31 provinces and affected, to varying degrees, at least 40 different cities, most of them small and medium-sized, according to an AFP tally based on official announcements and media reports. Deadly clashes The Norway-based Hengaw rights group said that Revolutionary Guards opened fire on protesters in the Malekshahi county of the western Ilam province on Saturday, killing four members of Iran’s Kurdish minority. The group said it was checking reports that two other people had been killed, adding that dozens more were wounded. It also accused the authorities of raiding the main hospital in the city of Ilam to seize the bodies of the protesters. The Iran Human Rights NGO, also based in Norway, gave an identical toll of four dead, as well as 30 wounded, after “security forces attacked the protests” in Malekshahi. Both organisations posted footage of what appeared to be bloodied corpses on the ground, in videos verified by AFP . Iran’s Mehr news agency alluded to the clashes, saying a Revolutionary Guard was killed in a confrontation with “rioters” at a police office. “Rioters attempted to storm a police station,” the Fars news agency reported, saying “two assailants were killed”.

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday clarified that his “only stance” was to implement PTI founder Imran Khan’s directives to run his province and prepare for the party’s street movement. Afridi had previously announced that Karachi was his next destination for galvanising party supporters after he concluded his three-day visit to Lahore, where he also met with the families of jailed senior PTI leaders. In a post on social media platform X earlier today, the KP chief minister said, “I have only one stance. My leader (Imran) has directed me to prepare for a street movement, along with running the administrative affairs of my province. “God-willing, I will implement them in letter and spirit. Any other news attributed to me would be someone’s personal assumption,” he added. About his upcoming visit to Karachi, CM Afridi said Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, “respecting democratic values and his office’s dignity”, has invited him for a meeting. Afridi said he had thanked Murad for the invitation and told him that he would meet “the people of my province, and if they had any sort of concerns or issues”, he would definitely meet the Sindh chief minister to resolve those. While the KP CM had earlier stated January 9 (Friday) as the date for his planned trip to Karachi, in his statement today, Afridi said he would pay a visit to Mazar-i-Quaid at around 4pm on January 11 (Sunday). Afridi’s latest statement highlighting his focus on the street movement comes after it was reported that he had said he was ready to hold talks with the establishment on provincial matters and improve relations. But, at the same time, he also said that Imran had not instructed him on anything regarding talks with the establishment, and that the ex-premier had assigned the task to Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir, according to media reports. His reported remarks were from his interaction with journalists in Peshawar on Friday. Afridi was also reported to have said that if “any ceremony or meeting takes place, he would definitely meet” Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir. During his visit to Lahore, CM Afridi had cast doubt on the government’s sincerity in holding talks with the PTI and said he was actively making efforts to initiate the party’s street movement by reaching out to multiple stakeholders. Asked whether he believed issues with the federal government could be resolved through talks, Afridi had said during his Lahore visit that Imran had assigned the responsibility for “dialogue or protest” to the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP).",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: At least three people, including a school principal and Rescue 1122 official, were injured on Tuesday when unknown assailants targeted a private school with “back-to-back quadcopter attacks” in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali, local sources said. For months, banned militant organisations in the region have been using improvised munitions like quadcopters to drop explosives, targeting security forces and civilians. According to local sources, the incident took place in Khasokhel village, where “explosives were dropped from the quadcopter onto the premises of Al-Fatah Public School, injuring the school’s principal and security guard.” Soon after the incident, a Rescue 1122 medical team reached the site to provide first aid and evacuate the injured. However, rescue officials said that while rescue personnel were engaged in relief work, another quadcopter dropped a mortar shell near the scene, injuring a Rescue 1122 worker. “All the injured were provided initial medical treatment and later shifted to Bannu for further care, where their condition was stated to be stable,” a Rescue 1122 official said. Sources said that the attack triggered panic in the area, forcing people living near the school to rush out of their homes in fear. Residents strongly condemned the attack on rescue workers, calling it “highly deplorable”. Rescue officials said their personnel reached the area despite serious security threats and continued their duties under life-threatening conditions. A local told Dawn that targeting a school through a drone attack was “an act of hostility against education and a dangerous assault on the lives of innocent children.” Government authorities confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway, while no militant group had so far claimed responsibility for the attack. Parents and social figures of the area expressed grave concern over the incident, stating that attacks on educational institutions and emergency service providers were unacceptable. They urged the government to take immediate and effective security measures to ensure the safety of students, teachers, and civilians in the region. There has been a history of targeting schools, especially girls’ schools, in several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as the militants in the region don’t consider girls’ education legitimate as per their ideology. Earlier in December, the terrorists blew up a government girls’ school in Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, by planting explosives during the night hours. Around 250 girls were enrolled at the school. In the same month, the lives of over 600 school-going children were put at risk when unidentified militants blasted a government primary school by planting explosives.",

Qudratullah, spokesperson for the district police officer (DPO), told Dawn the three traffic policemen were on duty near the Dil Begu Khel area when “unidentified terrorists, who were on a motorcycle”, opened fire on them. As a result, they died on the spot, the spokesperson said. Ticketing officer in-charge Jalal Khan was among the martyred, he said, adding that two other personnel were identified as Azizullah and Abdullah. The bodies were moved to Naurang Hospital, and police have launched a search operation at the site of the incident, Qudratullah said. Later in the day, the funeral prayers of the martyred traffic cops were offered at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines with official honours. Police and district administration officers, the bereaved family members and other residents attended the prayers. Funeral prayers of three traffic policemen martyred in a gun attack are offered at the Lakki Marwat Police Lines on Jan 4, 2026. — KP Police via Ghulam Mursaleen A statement issued by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s office said he condemned the attack and termed the incident “unfortunate”. “Sacrifices of the martyred policemen will not go in vain. Enemies of the countries cannot succeed in their nefarious designs by such cowardly acts,” the statement quoted him as saying. He added that policemen were on the front line in the fight against terrorism and had been rendering sacrifices. The CM said that attackers would be brought to justice and the provincial government was standing with the police. He extended condolences to the bereaved families and prayed for the departed souls. Separately, a police constable was martyred in firing by unidentified attackers in the Kashfi Khel area of KP’s Bannu district, spokesperson for the Bannu DPO Asif Hasan told Dawn . He said that martyred constable, Rashid Khan, was leaving his home for work on Sunday morning when armed assailants, who were on a motorcycle, shot him. Following the incident, a large contingent of police reached the scene, cordoned off the area, and collected evidence, the spokesperson said. A search operation was also launched to arrest the attackers, he added. President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his deep grief over the martyrdom of policemen in the firing incidents in Lakki Marwat and Bannu, a statement issued by the PPP said. The president paid tribute to the cops’ sacrifices and prayed for their high ranks. “The services and sacrifices of policemen and security forces to establish law and order are worthy of pride,” he was quoted as saying. Attacks in recent months Law enforcement personnel have increasingly come under attack in KP in recent days. Last month, five policemen were martyred when a police vehicle was ambushed in KP’s Karak. In response to the attack, a large police contingent, including the Counter-Terrorism Department’s commandoes, had launched an operation to hunt down the attackers. Eight terrorists were killed in that operation. On December 1, two policemen embraced martyrdom and five others were injured in a suicide bombing and a gun attack in Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts. In late November, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in KP’s Hangu. Similarly, a police head constable was martyred when unidentified assailants had opened fire at him in Mohammad Akbar village in the jurisdiction of Gul Imam police station of Tank district on November 9. Prior to that, on October 24, three cops, including a superintendent of police, were martyred when back-to-back blasts had rocked Hangu.",

      "summary_orig": "On December 18, 2025, a 25-year-old Hindu garment worker was lynched by a mob of approximately 150 people in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district. Following accusations of blasphemy, the victim was beaten to death. Mob lynchings in Bangladesh, known locally as gono-pituni , have a long history. But this crisis is not unique to Bangladesh. According to the Human Rights Watch’s World Report 2025 , South Asia has emerged as a global epicentre for collective vigilantism, with similar violence frequently reported in India and Pakistan as well. The recent surge in mob violence across India, Bangladesh and Pakistan is propelled by similar drivers: a decaying public confidence in the judiciary and the rapid spread of digital disinformation. This combination allows ‘street justice’ to effectively supersede state authority. As American political scientist Paul Staniland observed in a 2020 analysis for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, these patterns in South Asia are not recent developments. They are historical continuities. Rooted in colonial-era structures and galvanised by the 1947 partition of India, this culture of vigilantism has simply been recalibrated for the digital age. From Bangladesh to India and Pakistan, lynchings have become a grim substitute for justice, but South Asia’s mobs are not simply spontaneous eruptions of rage The 2017 lynching of university student Mashal Khan in Mardan, Pakistan, serves as a grim illustration of how false allegations (circulated on social media) are weaponised to orchestrate violence. Targeted by a campus mob under the guise of blasphemy, Mashal was brutally murdered, and his death was filmed by mobile phones and then uploaded on social media sites. The plan of the attack was hatched by university staff and Mashal’s political rivals who wanted to silence his criticism of administrative corruption in the university. This tragedy highlights a broader historical pattern in South Asia, where the mob has evolved into a calculated tool for political mobilisation and social policing. Over the last century, the psychological mechanisms of ‘mob mentality’ have become deeply integrated into the region’s sociopolitical terrain. Mob mentality is driven by a psychological phenomenon known as ‘deindividuation’, where individuals lose their ‘sense of self’ and personal identity within a large group. When a person becomes part of an energised crowd, they often experience a feeling of anonymity. They believe they are indistinguishable from those around them and feel shielded from personal recognition or judgement. Since the individual perceives their actions as being shared by the collective, the weight of personal accountability is diminished. Deindividuation often overrides a person’s moral compass, pushing individuals to engage in behaviours they are likely to find unthinkable if they were acting alone. Research suggests that individuals in ‘collectivist societies’, where group harmony is prioritised over individual identity, may be more susceptible to participate in or cheer mob violence. According to a 2023 study by Chinese researchers Jingjing Jio and Jun Zhao, people in collectivist cultures are conditioned from birth to subordinate their personal identity to the community. Consequently, the transition from being an individual actor to becoming part of a collective mass is fluid, allowing personal moral standards to be easily overwhelmed by a crowd’s passions. But what about China? It is a collectivist society, like most South Asian cultures. But mob violence in China is rare. While China saw significant mob activity in the 1960s and 1970s, the Chinese state (especially after 1989) has maintained a strict monopoly on force through its policy of ‘ weiwen [stability maintenance].’ Unauthorised gatherings, even if they are pro-government, are swiftly dismantled. All forms of mob action are perceived as a threat to the state’s authority. The divergence between South Asia and China regarding mob violence lies in the nature of the ‘moral trigger.’ In South Asia, religious anxieties, such as allegations of blasphemy (Pakistan, Bangladesh) or disputes over cow slaughter (India), serve as ‘sacred’ justifications that allow a crowd to emotionally and morally bypass legal frameworks. In contrast, China’s secular and strictly regulated environment lacks these sacred pretexts, making it far more difficult to ignite the emotional frenzy required for a lynching. Digital dynamics further separate these two regions. South Asia grapples with viral, unregulated disinformation that facilitates rapid mobilisation, whereas China’s heavily monitored digital space prevents the formation of frenzied mobs. Within China’s one-party system, capitalist growth has birthed a lifestyle individualism which, while not political, acts as a buffer against the more destructive elements of rigid groupthink. But capitalism in South Asia has not catalysed a similar shift toward individualism. Instead, economic power remains deeply intertwined with collectivist traditions. For example, business communities and traders often provide significant financial support to both mainstream and radical religious groups that are often at the forefront of fomenting mob violence. This creates a feedback loop, where economic success reinforces traditional group identities rather than diluting them, maintaining the collective as the primary unit of social and political life. The Indian historian Meera Nanda has brilliantly investigated this in her book The God Market. Individualism functions as a psychological safeguard, anchoring the person to their internal moral convictions. By prioritising personal integrity over collective impulse, the individual becomes resilient to deindividuation. While capitalism and individualism are historically symbiotic, this synergy faces resistance in South Asia, despite the expansion of capitalism in the region. Here, individualism is often stigmatised as a threat to communal harmony. Consequently, while Western discourse frames individuality/ self-reliance as a hallmark of ‘maturity’, South Asian cultural paradigms frequently interpret personal autonomy as a form of egoism or a betrayal of domestic duty. Nevertheless, as capitalism expands across South Asia, the burgeoning middle class is cultivating what the Indian psychologist Jai B. P. Sinha terms “localised individualism”. This model does not abandon communal ties but strategically renegotiates them, to serve personal and economic advancement. However, this shift is unlikely to curb the region’s propensity for mob violence nor neutralise the moral triggers behind lynchings. Rather than dismantling the moral narratives that incite such behaviour, South Asian middle classes have co-opted these narratives through populist movements, to protect their own socio-economic and political standing. The solution requires a two-pronged approach: the cultivation of a more robust individualism and a decisive shift in state policy. The government must treat all mob activity as a direct challenge to state sovereignty and respond with appropriate force. Furthermore, the state must actively deconstruct and reframe the moral rationales that serve as triggers for collective violence. Currently, these remedies are more feasible in Pakistan’s pragmatic-centrist hybrid regime than in its neighbouring states. In India, a populist Hindu-nationalist government often relies on these very triggers for political mobilisation, while Bangladesh remains in a state of flux, struggling to navigate the volatile transition from autocracy to democracy.

In contrast, China’s secular and strictly regulated environment lacks these sacred pretexts, making it far more difficult to ignite the emotional frenzy required for a lynching. Digital dynamics further separate these two regions. South Asia grapples with viral, unregulated disinformation that facilitates rapid mobilisation, whereas China’s heavily monitored digital space prevents the formation of frenzied mobs. Within China’s one-party system, capitalist growth has birthed a lifestyle individualism which, while not political, acts as a buffer against the more destructive elements of rigid groupthink. But capitalism in South Asia has not catalysed a similar shift toward individualism. Instead, economic power remains deeply intertwined with collectivist traditions. For example, business communities and traders often provide significant financial support to both mainstream and radical religious groups that are often at the forefront of fomenting mob violence. This creates a feedback loop, where economic success reinforces traditional group identities rather than diluting them, maintaining the collective as the primary unit of social and political life. The Indian historian Meera Nanda has brilliantly investigated this in her book The God Market. Individualism functions as a psychological safeguard, anchoring the person to their internal moral convictions. By prioritising personal integrity over collective impulse, the individual becomes resilient to deindividuation. While capitalism and individualism are historically symbiotic, this synergy faces resistance in South Asia, despite the expansion of capitalism in the region. Here, individualism is often stigmatised as a threat to communal harmony. Consequently, while Western discourse frames individuality/ self-reliance as a hallmark of ‘maturity’, South Asian cultural paradigms frequently interpret personal autonomy as a form of egoism or a betrayal of domestic duty. Nevertheless, as capitalism expands across South Asia, the burgeoning middle class is cultivating what the Indian psychologist Jai B. P. Sinha terms “localised individualism”. This model does not abandon communal ties but strategically renegotiates them, to serve personal and economic advancement. However, this shift is unlikely to curb the region’s propensity for mob violence nor neutralise the moral triggers behind lynchings. Rather than dismantling the moral narratives that incite such behaviour, South Asian middle classes have co-opted these narratives through populist movements, to protect their own socio-economic and political standing. The solution requires a two-pronged approach: the cultivation of a more robust individualism and a decisive shift in state policy. The government must treat all mob activity as a direct challenge to state sovereignty and respond with appropriate force. Furthermore, the state must actively deconstruct and reframe the moral rationales that serve as triggers for collective violence. Currently, these remedies are more feasible in Pakistan’s pragmatic-centrist hybrid regime than in its neighbouring states. In India, a populist Hindu-nationalist government often relies on these very triggers for political mobilisation, while Bangladesh remains in a state of flux, struggling to navigate the volatile transition from autocracy to democracy.

      "title": "SMOKERS’ CORNER: THE MOB AND THE STATE",
      "summary": "On December 18, 2025, a 25-year-old Hindu garment worker was lynched by a mob of approximately 150 people in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district. Following accusations of blasphemy, the victim was beaten to death. Mob lynchings in Bangladesh, known locally as gono-pituni , have a long history. But this crisis is not unique to Bangladesh. According to the Human Rights Watch’s World Report 2025 , South Asia has emerged as a global epicentre for collective vigilantism, with similar violence frequently reported in India and Pakistan as well. The recent surge in mob violence across India, Bangladesh and Pakistan is propelled by similar drivers: a decaying public confidence in the judiciary and the rapid spread of digital disinformation. This combination allows ‘street justice’ to effectively supersede state authority. As American political scientist Paul Staniland observed in a 2020 analysis for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, these patterns in South Asia are not recent developments. They are historical continuities. Rooted in colonial-era structures and galvanised by the 1947 partition of India, this culture of vigilantism has simply been recalibrated for the digital age. From Bangladesh to India and Pakistan, lynchings have become a grim substitute for justice, but South Asia’s mobs are not simply spontaneous eruptions of rage The 2017 lynching of university student Mashal Khan in Mardan, Pakistan, serves as a grim illustration of how false allegations (circulated on social media) are weaponised to orchestrate violence. Targeted by a campus mob under the guise of blasphemy, Mashal was brutally murdered, and his death was filmed by mobile phones and then uploaded on social media sites. The plan of the attack was hatched by university staff and Mashal’s political rivals who wanted to silence his criticism of administrative corruption in the university. This tragedy highlights a broader historical pattern in South Asia, where the mob has evolved into a calculated tool for political mobilisation and social policing. Over the last century, the psychological mechanisms of ‘mob mentality’ have become deeply integrated into the region’s sociopolitical terrain. Mob mentality is driven by a psychological phenomenon known as ‘deindividuation’, where individuals lose their ‘sense of self’ and personal identity within a large group. When a person becomes part of an energised crowd, they often experience a feeling of anonymity. They believe they are indistinguishable from those around them and feel shielded from personal recognition or judgement. Since the individual perceives their actions as being shared by the collective, the weight of personal accountability is diminished. Deindividuation often overrides a person’s moral compass, pushing individuals to engage in behaviours they are likely to find unthinkable if they were acting alone. Research suggests that individuals in ‘collectivist societies’, where group harmony is prioritised over individual identity, may be more susceptible to participate in or cheer mob violence. According to a 2023 study by Chinese researchers Jingjing Jio and Jun Zhao, people in collectivist cultures are conditioned from birth to subordinate their personal identity to the community. Consequently, the transition from being an individual actor to becoming part of a collective mass is fluid, allowing personal moral standards to be easily overwhelmed by a crowd’s passions. But what about China? It is a collectivist society, like most South Asian cultures. But mob violence in China is rare. While China saw significant mob activity in the 1960s and 1970s, the Chinese state (especially after 1989) has maintained a strict monopoly on force through its policy of ‘ weiwen [stability maintenance].’ Unauthorised gatherings, even if they are pro-government, are swiftly dismantled. All forms of mob action are perceived as a threat to the state’s authority. The divergence between South Asia and China regarding mob violence lies in the nature of the ‘moral trigger.’ In South Asia, religious anxieties, such as allegations of blasphemy (Pakistan, Bangladesh) or disputes over cow slaughter (India), serve as ‘sacred’ justifications that allow a crowd to emotionally and morally bypass legal frameworks.

South Korea said peace on the Korean peninsula would be on the agenda during President Lee Jae Myung’s visit to Beijing, which will include a summit with his counterpart, Xi Jinping. The launches from the capital Pyongyang into the sea between the Koreas and Japan represent “a message to China to deter closer ties with South Korea and to counter China’s stance on denuclearisation”, said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul. North Korea signals ‘we are different from Venezuela’ Eul-chul said North Korea also wanted to send a message that “we are different from Venezuela” — as a nuclear and military power, ready to respond with “aggressive deterrence”. Referring to North Korea‘s leader Kim Jong Un, Bong Youngshik, a visiting professor at Yonsei University, said: “After seeing what’s happening in Venezuela right now, the person who would be most afraid is Kim Jong Un.” Seoul and Tokyo criticised the missile launches. South Korea’s presidential office said it had held an emergency security meeting and urged North Korea to cease “provocative acts that violate United Nations Security Council resolutions”.

Japan said there were at least two missiles that flew about 900 km and 950 km. The last time Pyongyang tested a ballistic missile was on November 7. On Saturday, Kim Jong Un called for more than doubling the production capacity of tactical guided weapons during a visit to a munitions factory, North Korea’s state media reported. In recent weeks, Kim has made a series of visits to weapons factories, as well as to a nuclear-powered submarine, and has overseen missile tests ahead of this year’s Ninth Party Congress of the Workers’ Party, which will set out major policy goals.

Another problem is that unskilled workers are no longer needed in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries due to increasing influx from other countries. Moreover, Arab countries have started providing as many jobs to their own citizens as possible. “Only high-skilled labourers or experts in Information Technology have a chance to get a job in the coming months and years,” said the source.

      "summary_orig": "• UAE issues call for restraint; Saudi Arabia summons factions to Riyadh for ‘comprehensive’ talks • FM Dar speaks with Saudi counterpart about regional situation MUKALLA : Yemen’s Saudi-backed and internationally recognised government said on Saturday it had retaken control of Mukalla, the key eastern port in Yemen and capital of Hadramaut province, from separatists who seized it last month. The rapid government gains since Friday have reversed many of the advances made by the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and cast doubt on viability of its intention to hold a referendum on “independence”. As the fighting threatened to upend the regional order, the United Arab Emirates urged de-escalation, saying it was “deeply concerned” by the violence. Saudi Arabia appealed for factions to convene for talks in Riyadh. Saudi-backed forces said on Friday they had made advances and taken control of key locations in Hadramaut, a large province with stretches of desert along the Saudi border. By Saturday, military officials announced that “all military and civilian facilities” in Mukalla, the provincial capital, had “been secured”. An official said the military had seized the city’s principal military base. The STC confirmed the loss of territory. An STC official said there had been a “retreat of our forces” from the Al-Khasha area following “intense” Saudi airstrikes. The official said a separate strike on the Barshid camp, west of Mukalla, resulted in fatalities. He did not provide a specific number. Witnesses in Mukalla described a breakdown in security accompanied by looting, though Saudi-backed forces appeared to advance with little resistance. UAE calls for dialogue The conflict triggered an immediate diplomatic response. The UAE released a statement saying Yemenis should prioritise dialogue to safeguard security and stability. Saudi Arabia, in a statement posted by its foreign ministry to social media, called for “a comprehensive conference in Riyadh to bring together all southern factions to discuss just solutions to the southern cause”. Riyadh said the Yemeni government had issued the invitation for talks. Overnight, Presidential Council chief Rashad al-Alimi confirmed he had asked Saudi Arabia to host a forum to resolve the southern issue. Tensions boiled over early this week when Saudi Arabia bombed a base in Hadramaut and demanded all remaining UAE forces in Yemen depart, calling the separatist expansion a “red line” for its security. The STC responded with accusations that “northern Islamist factions” — a reference to the Islah party within the recognised government — had targeted civilians. The group appealed for international intervention against what it described as a “Saudi-backed military escalation”. In a clear signal of its secessionist intent, the STC announced on Friday the start of a two-year transitional period leading to a referendum on independence for a new “South Arabian state”. Aidaros Alzubidi, the STC chief, said the process would include dialogue with Yemen’s Houthi-controlled north, but warned the group would declare independence “immediately” if there was no dialogue or if southern Yemen was attacked again. The political infighting has also disrupted travel. Aden airport, the hub for areas outside Houthi control, has been closed since Thursday amid disputes over flight restrictions. The STC stated on Saturday that southern Yemen was being subjected to a land, sea, and land blockade. Separately, Pakistan expressed support on Saturday for Yemen’s territorial integrity and the Saudi-led push for de-escalation. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday had a phone call with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan shortly after landing in Beijing, the Foreign Office (FO) said. In a post on X today, the FO stated that the pair “deliberated on the recent situation in the region” during the phone call. “The DPM/FM welcomed the Saudi foreign ministry’s statement regarding Yemen and appreciated the efforts of all sides to resolve the regional situation amicably,” the FO stated. Meanwhile, the FO also welcomed the call by Yemen’s presidential council to hold a dialogue in Riyadh, urging all stakeholders to engage in “good faith” toward a negotiated political solution. The FO expressed Pakistan’s hope that, guided by the principles of unity and brotherhood, regional efforts will contribute to bringing lasting peace and stability in Yemen.

      "summary_orig": "TEHRAN: Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed on Saturday Tehran “will not yield” following US President Donald Trump’s threat to aid protesters, while warning that domestic “rioters” must be “put in their place” amid swelling unrest over soaring inflation. Speaking in a recorded television appearance marking a holiday, Ayatollah Khamenei addressed the mounting crisis facing Iran’s leadership. He adopted a dual approach to the demonstrations that have flared across more than two dozen cities since Sunday, acknowledging legitimate economic grievances while drawing a hard line against political dissent. “We will speak with the protesters, but talking to rioters is useless,” Khamenei said. “Rioters should be put in their place.” Khamenei’s defiance came just one day after Trump warned that the US was “locked and loaded and ready to go” regarding the situation in Iran. Although Trump did not specify what action he might take, the threat adds to the pressure on Tehran following US and Israeli airstrikes last summer targeting Iran’s nuclear sites and military leaders. ‘Bazaaris were right’ Addressing the geopolitical tension, the Iranian leader insisted the country “will not yield to the enemy”. However, he conceded the validity of frustrations expressed by market traders regarding the collapsing rial currency. “The bazaaris were right. They are right to say they cannot do business in these conditions,” Khamenei said. “The shopkeepers have protested against this situation and that is completely fair.” He noted that the president and high-ranking officials were working to resolve difficulties in the sanctions-battered economy. As authorities promised dialogue for economic complaints, rights groups reported a sharp rise in violence and arrests. Demonstrators calling for political change have clashed with security forces, resulting in at least 10 deaths. Authorities have said two members of the security services had died and more than a dozen were injured in the unrest. Hengaw, a Kurdish rights group, said late on Friday it had identified 133 people arrested, an increase of 77 from the previous day. State television reported additional arrests in western and central Iran, including individuals accused of manufacturing petrol bombs and homemade pistols. Discontent takes political turn The unrest began as an expression of discontent over high prices, but quickly expanded to include political demands. The semi-official Fars news agency reported that crowds in Karaj, on the outskirts of Tehran, burned the Iranian flag and shouted, “Death to the dictator!” Videos circulated by rights groups showed marchers chanting: “We don’t want spectators: join us.” State media offered accounts of deadly confrontations in smaller cities. The Mehr news agency reported that Ali Azizi, a member of the paramilitary Basij force, was “martyred after being stabbed and shot” in the western city of Harsin. The Tasnim news agency reported a man was killed in the holy city of Qom when a grenade he was attempting to use exploded “in his hands”. Social media posts reported unrest overnight in several districts of the capital, with activists proclaiming “this isn’t the last battle, Pahlavi is coming back!” While reports of violence have centred on Iran’s western provinces, the atmosphere in Tehran appeared quieter on Saturday, a public holiday, as rain and snow kept many streets empty.

      "summary_en": "TEHRAN: Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed on Saturday Tehran “will not yield” following US President Donald Trump’s threat to aid protesters, while warning that domestic “rioters” must be “put in their place” amid swelling unrest over soaring inflation. Speaking in a recorded television appearance marking a holiday, Ayatollah Khamenei addressed the mounting crisis facing Iran’s leadership. He adopted a dual approach to the demonstrations that have flared across more than two dozen cities since Sunday, acknowledging legitimate economic grievances while drawing a hard line against political dissent. “We will speak with the protesters, but talking to rioters is useless,” Khamenei said. “Rioters should be put in their place.” Khamenei’s defiance came just one day after Trump warned that the US was “locked and loaded and ready to go” regarding the situation in Iran.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad court on Saturday issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi over his repeated absences in a case registered against him under the cybercrime law for allegedly making online remarks against state institutions. Senior Civil Judge Abbas Shah observed that the CM had repeatedly ignored summons and remained absent from proceedings without any lawful justification. The court noted that despite being given multiple opportunities to present himself before the court and respond to the allegations, the accused failed to comply with judicial directions. The court took a serious view of the persistent non-appearance and termed it a deliberate attempt to evade the legal process. Consequently, the judge ordered law enforcement authorities to ensure Mr Afridi’s production before the court. Following the issuance of the arrest warrants, the court adjourned proceedings till January 17. According to the case record, the matter stems from a complaint registered by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which has booked the KP chief minister under various provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca). Civil judge describes non-compliance with orders as deliberate attempt to evade legal process Besides the cybercrime case, Mr Afridi and his colleagues are facing proceedings in an anti-terrorism court for their alleged involvement in the Nov 26 protest in Islamabad. The anti-terrorism court had initiated proclamation proceedings against them for repeatedly failing to appear before the court. The court had called upon CM Afridi, Meena Khan, Amjad Khan, Shafiullah Jan and Amjad Afridi to appear before it to face ongoing legal proceedings. In its order, the court had noted that the repeated absence of the defendants left it with “no option but to initiate proclamation proceedings,” while granting them a final opportunity to surrender. The notices had warned that failure to appear during the Section 87 proceedings would compel the court to proceed with further legal action in accordance with the law. The case is based on an FIR registered in connection with a November 26 protest, in which the chief minister and other individuals were nominated. Mr Afridi is also facing a case in the Election Commission of Pakistan for the code of conduct violation during a recent by-election on a national seat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. His lawyers have, however, challenged the ECP’s jurisdiction in the case while also moving the high court against the election watchdog. The ECP had summoned the CM after he threatened the election staff during a political gathering in Havelian, Abbott­abad, ahead of the by-poll in NA-18. It may be noted that Mr Afridi has been tasked by party leader Imran Khan, who is in jail, to lead the ‘street movement’ against the government. He visited Lahore last week to galvanise the party’s supporters, but the provincial authorities created hurdles in his political activities, prompting allegations from both sides. He is set to visit Karachi next week to whip up support for the planned protest drive. The CM had also staged a sit-in outside the Adiala jail after the authorities barred him from visiting Imran Khan. However, he refrained from participating in subsequent protests to avoid legal troubles. Published in Dawn, January 4th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The increasing use of AI, along with the impact of the global “chip war”, is becoming evident even in local markets, as smartphone prices have started to rise. While Infinix and Tecno have already announced higher rates, other brands, including Vgotel, Vivo, Realme, Oppo, etc., plan to announce new rates in the coming week. Manufacturers say this is due to the high cost of chipsets. “The memory chips have become costlier, between 20 and 30 per cent, and all of it is imported,” said Muzaffar Paracha, Senior Vice-Chairman of the Pakistan Mobile Phone Manufacturers Ass­ociation (PMPMA). Manufacturers cite higher memory-chip costs,  AI-driven demand and global supply constraints for rising handset prices Manufacturers noted that the cost of memory chips has increased by $20-30 per set. This is because the world is facing a shortage of memory chips. “There are only three key producers of mobile phones — Apple, Samsung and Chinese brands that dominate world markets,” said Amir Allawala, a senior member of the association. He added that, due to new developments, the prices of many items are rising rapidly, such as solar panels, ICs, and chipsets, as the world moves towards 5G-compatible mobile devices. Apart from Samsung and Apple, almost all mobile phone manufacturers globally have been hit by a severe shortage of memory chips. Most mobile phone chipsets for motherboards, such as processors and memory chips, are produced in Taiwan. Apple and Samsung phones, however, have their own supply lines for memory chips used in their devices. Supply of memory chips has been constrained in Taiwan and Japan due to continuously rising demand across all sectors, including non-mobile manufacturers. “This is because of extensive use of AI in almost all apps, which has led to the use of higher-capacity memory chips,” said Zeeshan Miannoor, vice chairman of the PMPMA. “Now almost all preloaded apps on phones have AI features, which has led to increased memory requirements for both RAM and ROM,” he added. Currently, the minimum smartphone memory configuration is 4GB RAM (random access memory) and 64GB ROM (read-only memory). RAM serves as short-term storage for what the CPU is currently using, while ROM stores permanent startup code and essential data. Taiwanese memory-chip makers have almost stopped producing 4GB/64GB chips, and prices of 4GB/128GB IC chips have increased significantly due to a shift in production towards 6GB/256GB chips. “This is because the world is shifting to higher-capacity and 5G-compatible sets,” said Naveed Gaba, CEO of VGOTel. As manufacturers shift to higher-capacity memory chips, there is a shortage of lower-capacity chips, while newer ones are more expensive. He added that Chinese companies have started focusing on chip manufacturing, but this will take time. Meanwhile, a senior expert in the field said recent conflicts in 2025 have highlighted the importance of autonomous weaponry such as missiles and drones. The expert added that high-grade chipsets and memory chips are in demand from sectors beyond IT and telephony. Mr Allawala added that smartphone prices will rise and that the government needs to devise innovative options. “There have been talks for some time about smartphones being sold on installments. This would allow consumers to buy phones more easily,” he said, adding that the government must facilitate greater localisation, which would help reduce the cost of other components used in mobile sets. Around 31 million mobile sets are produced locally, but about 47pc are still 2G feature phones, as 4G and data services are not available in many remote and low-population areas. After the upcoming spectrum auction, demand for smartphones with higher memory capacity is also expected to increase, as telecom operators roll out 4G services in more underserved areas.

Taiwanese memory-chip makers have almost stopped producing 4GB/64GB chips, and prices of 4GB/128GB IC chips have increased significantly due to a shift in production towards 6GB/256GB chips. “This is because the world is shifting to higher-capacity and 5G-compatible sets,” said Naveed Gaba, CEO of VGOTel. As manufacturers shift to higher-capacity memory chips, there is a shortage of lower-capacity chips, while newer ones are more expensive. He added that Chinese companies have started focusing on chip manufacturing, but this will take time. Meanwhile, a senior expert in the field said recent conflicts in 2025 have highlighted the importance of autonomous weaponry such as missiles and drones. The expert added that high-grade chipsets and memory chips are in demand from sectors beyond IT and telephony. Mr Allawala added that smartphone prices will rise and that the government needs to devise innovative options. “There have been talks for some time about smartphones being sold on installments. This would allow consumers to buy phones more easily,” he said, adding that the government must facilitate greater localisation, which would help reduce the cost of other components used in mobile sets. Around 31 million mobile sets are produced locally, but about 47pc are still 2G feature phones, as 4G and data services are not available in many remote and low-population areas. After the upcoming spectrum auction, demand for smartphones with higher memory capacity is also expected to increase, as telecom operators roll out 4G services in more underserved areas.

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The increasing use of AI, along with the impact of the global “chip war”, is becoming evident even in local markets, as smartphone prices have started to rise. While Infinix and Tecno have already announced higher rates, other brands, including Vgotel, Vivo, Realme, Oppo, etc., plan to announce new rates in the coming week. Manufacturers say this is due to the high cost of chipsets. “The memory chips have become costlier, between 20 and 30 per cent, and all of it is imported,” said Muzaffar Paracha, Senior Vice-Chairman of the Pakistan Mobile Phone Manufacturers Ass­ociation (PMPMA). Manufacturers cite higher memory-chip costs,  AI-driven demand and global supply constraints for rising handset prices Manufacturers noted that the cost of memory chips has increased by $20-30 per set. This is because the world is facing a shortage of memory chips. “There are only three key producers of mobile phones — Apple, Samsung and Chinese brands that dominate world markets,” said Amir Allawala, a senior member of the association. He added that, due to new developments, the prices of many items are rising rapidly, such as solar panels, ICs, and chipsets, as the world moves towards 5G-compatible mobile devices. Apart from Samsung and Apple, almost all mobile phone manufacturers globally have been hit by a severe shortage of memory chips. Most mobile phone chipsets for motherboards, such as processors and memory chips, are produced in Taiwan. Apple and Samsung phones, however, have their own supply lines for memory chips used in their devices. Supply of memory chips has been constrained in Taiwan and Japan due to continuously rising demand across all sectors, including non-mobile manufacturers. “This is because of extensive use of AI in almost all apps, which has led to the use of higher-capacity memory chips,” said Zeeshan Miannoor, vice chairman of the PMPMA. “Now almost all preloaded apps on phones have AI features, which has led to increased memory requirements for both RAM and ROM,” he added.

RAM serves as short-term storage for what the CPU is currently using, while ROM stores permanent startup code and essential data.
