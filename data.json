      "title_orig": "Denmark, Greenland in crunch White House talks as Trump ups pressure",
      "summary_orig": "Denmark and Greenland’s top diplomats held high-stakes talks at the White House on Wednesday, with US President Donald Trump warning it was “vital” for the United States to take control of the Arctic island. Shortly before the meeting with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Denmark announced it was immediately boosting its military presence in strategic Greenland. Footage from CNN showed Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt arriving at the White House campus, while AFP journalists saw Rubio and Vance heading into the talks. Trump’s escalating threats over Greenland — a vast and sparsely populated autonomous territory belonging to Nato ally Denmark — have deeply shaken transatlantic relations. The 79-year-old Republican insisted ahead of the talks that Nato should support the US effort to take control of Greenland, saying it was crucial for his planned Golden Dome air and missile defence system. “Nato becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES. Anything less than that is unacceptable,” he wrote on his Truth Social network. “IF WE DON’T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!” added Trump. Vance, who slammed Denmark as a “bad ally” during a visit to Greenland last year, is known for a hard edge, which was on display when he publicly berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last February. “If the US continues with, ‘We have to have Greenland at all costs,’ it could be a very short meeting,” said Penny Naas, a senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, a Washington think tank. Trump has derided recent Danish efforts to increase security for Greenland as amounting to “two dogsleds”. Denmark says it has invested almost $14 billion in Arctic security. Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen sought to further ease US concerns on Thursday, telling AFP his country was boosting its military presence in Greenland and was in talks with Nato allies. The Danish defence ministry then announced that it would do so “from today,” hosting a military exercise and sending in “aircraft, vessels and soldiers”. Swedish officers were joining the exercise at Denmark’s request, Stockholm said. ‘Big problem’ Denmark’s Rasmussen said ahead of the meeting that he was hoping to “clear up certain misunderstandings”. But it remains to be seen if there is a chance of de-escalating the situation. Greenland’s leader said on Tuesday that the island prefers to remain part of Denmark, prompting Trump to say “that’s going to be a big problem for him.” Shortly after the White House talks, a senior delegation from the US Congress — mostly Democrats, but with one Republican — will visit Copenhagen to offer solidarity. Trump has appeared emboldened on Greenland — and on what he views as the US backyard as a whole — since ordering a deadly January 3 attack in Venezuela that removed President Nicolas Maduro. The White House has said that military action against Greenland remains on the table. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an attack on a Nato ally would end the alliance that has been the bedrock of Western security since World War II. It is a founding member of Nato, and its military joined the United States in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the latter to much criticism. An agreement with Denmark currently allows the United States to station as many soldiers as it wants on Greenland. It also has a “space base” at Pituffik in northern Greenland. Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, meanwhile, said ahead of the Washington talks that “Greenland does not want to be part of the United States.” But Trump has been insistent that he wants to acquire Greenland wholesale, repeatedly insisting on what he calls the threat of a takeover by Russia or China. The two rival powers have both stepped up activity in the Arctic, where ice is melting due to climate change, but neither claims Greenland, which is home to 57,000 people.",

      "summary_orig": "Qatar said on Wednesday precautionary measures had been taken at the US-run Al Udeid Air Base, including the departure of some personnel, because of rising regional tensions, according to its International Media Office. The office said the steps were part of broader efforts to safeguard the security of citizens and residents and to protect critical infrastructure and military facilities, adding that any further developments would be announced through official channels. The development came as the US-based Wall Street Journal and CBS reported that the American military was evacuating some personnel from the air base as a precaution. Earlier, a senior Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran had warned its neighbouring countries hosting US troops that it would retaliate against American bases if Washington carried out threats to intervene in protests in Iran. The protest movement across Iran, initially sparked by economic grievances, has turned into one of the biggest challenges yet to the leadership since it took power in the 1979 revolution. Trump has warned Iran of intervention over crackdown on protesters. The Iranian official, a senior figure speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tehran had asked US allies in the region to “prevent Washington from attacking Iran”. “Tehran has told regional countries, from Saudi Arabia and UAE to Turkiye, that US bases in those countries will be attacked” if the US targets Iran, the official said. The official added that direct contacts between Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff had been suspended, reflecting mounting tensions. The US embassy in Doha had no immediate comment. There was no sign of a large-scale movement of troops off the base to a nearby soccer stadium and shopping mall, as took place last year in the hours before Iran targeted the base with missiles in retaliation for US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear targets. According to an Israeli assessment, Trump has decided to intervene, although the scope and timing of this action remain unclear, an Israeli official said. Separately, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Trump that an Iranian strike in June on an American base in Qatar had demonstrated its ability to respond to any attack. Trump should recall the attack on the Al Udeid Air Base, which proved “Iran’s will and capability to respond to any attack”, Ali Shamkhani wrote in a post on X after Washington repeatedly refused to rule out new military action against Iran. Iran vows to fast-track trials Iran on Wednesday also vowed to fast-track trials for people arrested over the massive wave of protests. In Tehran, authorities held a funeral ceremony for over 100 members of the security forces and other “martyrs” killed in the demonstrations, which authorities have branded as “riots” while accusing protesters of waging “acts of terror”. Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on a visit to a prison holding protest detainees that “if a person burned someone, beheaded someone and set them on fire, then we must do our work quickly”, in comments broadcast by state television. Iranian news agencies also quoted him as saying the trials should be held in public and said he had spent five hours in a prison in Tehran to examine the cases. Footage broadcast by state media showed the judiciary chief seated before an Iranian flag in a large, ornate room in the prison, interrogating a prisoner himself. The detainee, dressed in grey clothing and his face blurred, is accused of taking Molotov cocktails to a park in Tehran. Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Mudassir Tipu wrote on X that “international calls from Iran’s mobiles and landlines have resumed”. “This information will be helpful to our nationals to immediately establish contacts with their near and dear ones.” Trump again threatens intervention Trump on Tuesday said in a CBS News interview that the United States would act if Iran began hanging protesters. “We will take very strong action if they do such a thing,” said the American leader, who has repeatedly threatened Iran with military intervention. “When they start killing thousands of people — and now you’re telling me about hanging. We’ll see how that’s going to work out for them,” Trump said. Tehran called the American warnings a “pretext for military intervention”. Iran’s UN mission posted a statement on X, vowing that Washington’s “playbook” would “fail again”. “US fantasies and policy toward Iran are rooted in regime change, with sanctions, threats, engineered unrest, and chaos serving as the modus operandi to manufacture a pretext for military intervention,” the post said. Rights groups accuse the government of fatally shooting protesters and masking the scale of the crackdown with an internet blackout imposed on January 8. “Metrics show Iran remains offline as the country wakes to another day of digital darkness,” said internet monitor Netblocks on Wednesday in a post on X, adding that the blackout had lasted 132 hours. However, some information has trickled out of Iran. New videos on social media, with locations verified by AFP , showed bodies lined up in the Kahrizak morgue just south of the Iranian capital, with the corpses wrapped in black bags and distraught relatives searching for loved ones. Calls to halt executions Tehran prosecutors have said Iranian authorities would press capital charges of “waging war against God” on some detainees. According to state media, hundreds of people have been arrested. State media has also reported on the arrest of a foreign national for espionage in connection with the protests. No details were given on the person’s nationality or identity. The US State Department on its Farsi language X account said 26-year-old protestor Erfan Soltani had been sentenced to be executed on Wednesday. “Erfan is the first protester to be sentenced to death, but he won’t be the last,” the State Department said, adding more than 10,600 Iranians had been arrested. Rights group Amnesty International called on Iran to immediately halt all executions, including Soltani’s. Trump has urged on his Truth Social platform for Iranians to “KEEP PROTESTING”, adding: “I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” It was not immediately clear what meetings he was referring to or what the nature of the help would be. ‘Rising casualties’ European nations have also signalled their anger over the crackdown, with France, Germany and the United Kingdom among the countries that summoned their Iranian ambassadors, as did the European Union. “The rising number of casualties in Iran is horrifying,” said EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, vowing further sanctions. Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights claimed it had confirmed 734 people killed during the protests, including nine minors, but warned the death toll was likely far higher. “The real number of those killed is likely in the thousands,” IHR’s director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam insisted. Iran has not officially released any figures so far. Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies. Authorities in Tehran have announced a mass funeral ceremony in the capital on Wednesday for the “martyrs” of recent days. Amir, an Iraqi computer scientist, returned to Baghdad on Monday and described dramatic scenes in Tehran. “On Thursday night, my friends and I saw protesters in Tehran’s Sarsabz neighbourhood amid a heavy military presence. The police were firing rubber bullets,” he told AFP in Iraq. Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, called on the military to stop suppressing protests. “You are the national military of Iran, not the military of the Islamic Republic,” he said in a statement. ‘Serious challenge’ The government has sought to regain control of the streets with nationwide rallies that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protest movement was defeated, calling them a “warning” to the US. In power since 1989 and now aged 86, Khamenei has faced significant challenges, most recently the 12-day war in June against Israel, which forced him to go into hiding. Analysts have cautioned that it is premature to predict the immediate demise of the theocratic system, pointing to the repressive levers the leadership controls, including the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is charged with safeguarding the Islamic revolution. Nicole Grajewski, professor at the Sciences Po Centre for International Studies, told AFP the protests represented a “serious challenge” to the Islamic republic, but it was unclear if they would unseat the leadership, pointing to “the sheer depth and resilience of Iran’s repressive apparatus”.",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI on Wednesday strongly condemned the police action against its protesters outside the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi yesterday, terming it “oppression” and “injustice”. The condemnation comes a day after the police dispersed a sit-in staged by PTI supporters and party founder Imran Khan’s sisters at Factory Naka near the prison after the authorities did not allow them to meet the incarcerated former prime minister. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the party said it condemned the “government’s oppression, use of force through police, and unlawful actions” outside Adiala in the “strongest terms”. Detailing the alleged arrests, the PTI said 11 men were detained at the Rawat police station and three women — Zuleikha, Dr Asma and Sanaya Safeer — were taken into custody by the Rawalpindi police. “Similarly, Advocate Raja Yasir, [MNA] Shahid Khattak’s brother Adil, and Tanveer have also been arrested,” it added. In a list of demands, the PTI sought the immediate release of “all arrested men and women”. It added that “immediate criminal proceedings should be initiated against the responsible police officials”. The PTI asserted that Imran’s family and party workers were exercising their constitutional and legal right when they had gathered outside the prison to meet him. “[However], the government used force, violence and harassment to crush this peaceful and lawful activity,” it added. The party alleged that the baton charge, pushing and mistreatment continued late into the night “without any regard for women and children”. Furthermore, it alleged that the Rawalpindi police set up a checkpoint at Bahria Town on the route returning from Adiala, where they “snatched mobile phones from citizens, forcibly seized women’s vehicles and smashed the windshields of several cars”. According to the PTI, the mobile phones and vehicles were returned after “taking money” from the citizens, while those who “refused to pay bribes” had their vehicles impounded. The PTI claimed that “several citizens’ vehicles remained illegally impounded” at the Bahria Town checkpoint, with no first information report (FIR) registered so far. It demanded the return of all vehicles and mobile phones allegedly seized, and called for judicial inquiries into the “open extortion, vandalism and violations of human rights”. “This fascist conduct by the Rawalpindi police has been continuing in the same manner for the past many weeks,” the party lamented. “This is not merely political victimisation, but organised government hooliganism, looting and violation of law by the Maryam-led government,” it said, referring to the Punjab chief minister. It insisted that the aim of such actions was to “deprive Imran Khan and his family of their constitutional right to meetings and spreading fear among the public”. In the end, the PTI also demanded that Imran’s family members and lawyers be allowed to meet him without any obstruction. The PTI, in their statement, assured the public that the voice would be raised against this “oppression, injustice and government-backed strong-arm tactics at every constitutional, legal and democratic forum”. “This country is not the personal fiefdom of any police officer or authoritarian government, but a trust of the people, and those who plunder this trust will be held accountable,” the party said. PTI begins street mobilisation in AJK Separately, the PTI also announced that its Azad Kashmir president and former prime minister of the region, Sardar Abdul Qayyum, has launched a street movement from his constituency of Sehnsa. In December last year, the PTI announced it was launching a fresh countrywide street movement under Imran’s directives. The party initiated the movement from Lahore, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s visit. On Monday, he concluded his four-day visit to Sindh for the same purpose, announcing that his next stop will be areas in KP. The street mobilisation is aimed at garnering momentum in the lead-up to the opposition’s planned February 8 protests , which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged.",

According to the PTI, the mobile phones and vehicles were returned after “taking money” from the citizens, while those who “refused to pay bribes” had their vehicles impounded. The PTI claimed that “several citizens’ vehicles remained illegally impounded” at the Bahria Town checkpoint, with no first information report (FIR) registered so far. It demanded the return of all vehicles and mobile phones allegedly seized, and called for judicial inquiries into the “open extortion, vandalism and violations of human rights”. “This fascist conduct by the Rawalpindi police has been continuing in the same manner for the past many weeks,” the party lamented. “This is not merely political victimisation, but organised government hooliganism, looting and violation of law by the Maryam-led government,” it said, referring to the Punjab chief minister. It insisted that the aim of such actions was to “deprive Imran Khan and his family of their constitutional right to meetings and spreading fear among the public”. In the end, the PTI also demanded that Imran’s family members and lawyers be allowed to meet him without any obstruction. The PTI, in their statement, assured the public that the voice would be raised against this “oppression, injustice and government-backed strong-arm tactics at every constitutional, legal and democratic forum”. “This country is not the personal fiefdom of any police officer or authoritarian government, but a trust of the people, and those who plunder this trust will be held accountable,” the party said. PTI begins street mobilisation in AJK Separately, the PTI also announced that its Azad Kashmir president and former prime minister of the region, Sardar Abdul Qayyum, has launched a street movement from his constituency of Sehnsa. In December last year, the PTI announced it was launching a fresh countrywide street movement under Imran’s directives. The party initiated the movement from Lahore, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s visit. On Monday, he concluded his four-day visit to Sindh for the same purpose, announcing that his next stop will be areas in KP.

      "title": "‘Oppression, injustice’: PTI condemns latest police action outside Adiala jail",
      "summary": "The PTI on Wednesday strongly condemned the police action against its protesters outside the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi yesterday, terming it “oppression” and “injustice”. The condemnation comes a day after the police dispersed a sit-in staged by PTI supporters and party founder Imran Khan’s sisters at Factory Naka near the prison after the authorities did not allow them to meet the incarcerated former prime minister. In a statement issued on Wednesday, the party said it condemned the “government’s oppression, use of force through police, and unlawful actions” outside Adiala in the “strongest terms”. Detailing the alleged arrests, the PTI said 11 men were detained at the Rawat police station and three women — Zuleikha, Dr Asma and Sanaya Safeer — were taken into custody by the Rawalpindi police. “Similarly, Advocate Raja Yasir, [MNA] Shahid Khattak’s brother Adil, and Tanveer have also been arrested,” it added. In a list of demands, the PTI sought the immediate release of “all arrested men and women”. It added that “immediate criminal proceedings should be initiated against the responsible police officials”. The PTI asserted that Imran’s family and party workers were exercising their constitutional and legal right when they had gathered outside the prison to meet him. “[However], the government used force, violence and harassment to crush this peaceful and lawful activity,” it added. The party alleged that the baton charge, pushing and mistreatment continued late into the night “without any regard for women and children”. Furthermore, it alleged that the Rawalpindi police set up a checkpoint at Bahria Town on the route returning from Adiala, where they “snatched mobile phones from citizens, forcibly seized women’s vehicles and smashed the windshields of several cars”.

      "summary_orig": "A crane at a China-backed high-speed rail project in Thailand collapsed onto a passenger train on Wednesday and caused it to derail, killing at least 32 people, authorities said. The massive crane’s broken structure was left resting on giant concrete pillars, while smoke rose from the wreckage of the train below, footage from the scene verified by AFP showed. The company contracted to build the section of the high-speed rail where the crane fell, Italian-Thai Development — one of Thailand’s biggest construction firms — has seen a series of deadly accidents at its sites in recent years. The firm expressed condolences for those killed and the dozens injured, saying in a statement it would “take responsibility for compensating the victims’ families and covering medical expenses for those injured”. The Thai health ministry said 32 people were killed, three were missing and 64 were hospitalised, including seven in serious condition. Dozens of rescuers worked into the evening, using other cranes to remove wreckage and searching for missing people in the tilted carriages in Nakhon Ratchasima province, northeast of the capital Bangkok. Mitr Intrpanya, who was at the scene, said he heard a loud noise “like something sliding down from above, followed by two explosions”. “When I went to see what had happened, I found the crane sitting on a passenger train with three carriages,” the 54-year-old told AFP. “The metal from the crane appeared to strike the middle of the second carriage, slicing it in half.” ‘Only company in charge’ The accident happened at a construction site that is part of a more than $5 billion project backed by China to build a high-speed rail network in Thailand. It aims to connect Bangkok to Kunming in China via Laos by 2028 as part of Beijing’s vast Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Engineering consultant Theerachote Rujiviphat, an adviser on the high-speed project, told AFP that Italian-Thai Development was solely responsible for the crane collapse. Theerachote, from the China Railway Design Corporation, said the launching crane that fell onto the existing rail tracks also belonged to Italian-Thai. “It is the only company in charge. A similar accident also happened a few years ago under their responsibility,” Theerachote added. Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said authorities must determine the cause of the crane collapse and hold those responsible to account. “These kind of incidents happen very regularly,” he told reporters in Bangkok. “I have heard that it is the same company [involved in previous accidents]. It is time to change the law to blacklist construction companies that are repeatedly responsible for accidents.” Deadly accidents The Nakhon Ratchasima provincial public relations department said on Wednesday that the crane collapsed onto a train travelling from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani province, “causing it to derail and catch fire”. Transport Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said 195 people were on board. Italian-Thai Development and its director were among more than 20 people and firms indicted in August last year in a case linked to the collapse of a Bangkok high-rise in an earthquake . The collapse killed around 90 people, mostly construction workers. Five people were killed and 24 others were injured in March when a crane collapsed at a highway construction site, a joint venture including Italian-Thai. In 2017, a crane used in the construction of Bangkok’s elevated rail system by the firm collapsed in front of a Buddhist temple, killing three construction workers, according to local media. In a similar incident two years earlier, an Italian-Thai crane fell and crushed two cars in front of a Bangkok railway station, injuring one person. Wreckage at the site where a train was derailed when a construction crane collapsed and fell onto its carriages, causing several casualties, in Sikhio district, Nakhon Ratchasima province, Thailand on Jan 14, 2026. — Reuters Thailand has around 5,000 kilometres (3,107 miles) of railway but the run-down network has long driven people to favour travel by road. Upon completion of the 600km high-speed railway, Chinese-made trains will run from Bangkok to Nong Khai, on the Mekong River border with Laos, at up to 250 kilometres per hour. In 2020, then-Thai prime minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha, who pushed closer ties with Beijing, signed a deal for Thailand to cover all expenditures for the project, while using China-advised technology. China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday that Beijing “attaches great importance to the safety of this project and its personnel”, and expressed the nation’s condolences.",

It is time to change the law to blacklist construction companies that are repeatedly responsible for accidents.” Deadly accidents The Nakhon Ratchasima provincial public relations department said on Wednesday that the crane collapsed onto a train travelling from Bangkok to Ubon Ratchathani province, “causing it to derail and catch fire”. Transport Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said 195 people were on board. Italian-Thai Development and its director were among more than 20 people and firms indicted in August last year in a case linked to the collapse of a Bangkok high-rise in an earthquake . The collapse killed around 90 people, mostly construction workers. Five people were killed and 24 others were injured in March when a crane collapsed at a highway construction site, a joint venture including Italian-Thai. In 2017, a crane used in the construction of Bangkok’s elevated rail system by the firm collapsed in front of a Buddhist temple, killing three construction workers, according to local media. In a similar incident two years earlier, an Italian-Thai crane fell and crushed two cars in front of a Bangkok railway station, injuring one person. Wreckage at the site where a train was derailed when a construction crane collapsed and fell onto its carriages, causing several casualties, in Sikhio district, Nakhon Ratchasima province, Thailand on Jan 14, 2026. — Reuters Thailand has around 5,000 kilometres (3,107 miles) of railway but the run-down network has long driven people to favour travel by road. Upon completion of the 600km high-speed railway, Chinese-made trains will run from Bangkok to Nong Khai, on the Mekong River border with Laos, at up to 250 kilometres per hour. In 2020, then-Thai prime minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha, who pushed closer ties with Beijing, signed a deal for Thailand to cover all expenditures for the project, while using China-advised technology. China’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday that Beijing “attaches great importance to the safety of this project and its personnel”, and expressed the nation’s condolences.",

      "summary_orig": "The PPP on Wednesday continued questioning the government on the recent deforestation in Islamabad, expressing dissatisfaction with the answers given by the government in a session of the National Assembly (NA) a day earlier. In the past few days, there has been widespread criticism over the cutting of thousands of mature trees in various locations of the federal capital, including the levelling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian. On Tuesday, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had informed lawmakers that 29,115 trees had been removed from the Islamabad Capital Territory region (ICT), but that more than this number would be planted in the coming months. PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri, addressing a press conference, said that the issue had been raised in the NA as “all parliamentarians were concerned”, hoping that they would receive answers to the “questions that have been flying about”. However, she said, the response by the state minister for interior during Tuesday’s NA session had only raised more questions. “Sometimes it is said that it is because of pollen allergies … yesterday another impression was given, that there are some brown districts and some green districts — so you have to keep some brown and some green,” Marri said. “At what cost? At the cost of your environment? At the cost of urban planning? At the cost of biodiversity in your urban areas? At what cost?” She pointed out that not only were political parties asking these questions, but also civil society, adding that the World Wide Fund of Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan) had also shown serious concern about the way the trees were being cut down. “It is not just cutting,” she said. “It is an action that is challenging your environmental governance; it raises questions on transparency.” Marri particularly took exception to the lack of transparency shown by the government in its response to the outcry. “You tell us: for however many trees you have cut, how many have you planted? We are not being shown this. We are only shown trees being cut, not planted.“ “We don’t know how many trees are being planted — we are only told that these many thousands have been planted. But what proof is there of this?” she added. The lawmaker further said, “To give them some benefit of the doubt: if you cut the trees and there was some good reason for it, then why are you running from giving answers?” Marri added that Chaudhry “should have given a patient answer” in the NA session yesterday. “He felt that maybe the CDA [Capital Development Authority] was being attacked; it was not like that.” She further said, “If you’re going to cut trees by the thousands in Pakistan’s capital — that is the face of your country — and so boldly, then the question will be raised… and will not just be asked to you by political parties, by the PPP, but the public will ask, civil society will ask, journalists will ask. They ask you and you get upset — that is not appropriate.” “If there is indeed purity in this action of yours, then share it. Tell us,” she added. Marri regretted that the government had not given a press conference on the matter of the trees, saying, “There’s a press conference on everything. But why did the government not take the public into confidence on the cutting of trees, through a press conference or a media briefing? This should have happened, and I regret to say it did not.” The CDA has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed, as they had been causing pollen allergies . However, social media users had alleged that, besides paper mulberry, indigenous trees were also chopped down, making Shakarparian look like barren land. Climate Change Minister Musadiq Malik has defended the move , stating that paper mulberry was an invasive and “life-threatening” species. Load shedding concerns At the same press conference, Marri slammed the state of load shedding in Pakistan, particularly focusing on Sindh. She said that if one called their sub-divisional officer, they would be told that the load shedding was because a household had not paid their electricity bill: “If one house didn’t pay the electricity bill, then you’ll cut electricity for the whole neighbourhood? … If not paying the bill is illegal, then cutting the electricity of those who do pay the bill is also illegal.” Marri lamented that this was the state of affairs in winter, wondering what would happen in summer. She also condemned gas load shedding and the lack of gas provided to Sindh, including Karachi, although it was a natural resource found in Sindh. She added that according to Article 158 of the Constitution, the first right to gas went to the people of the wellhead region. However, she said, people were being deprived of gas and when gas was available, they were being sold imported gas at high prices.",

      "summary_orig": "An important bridge over the Kurram River in North Waziristan’s Shewa tehsil was blown up by unknown attackers using explosives on Wednesday. The structure was completely destroyed, severing land links between the area and Miranshah, Bannu and other adjoining regions. The incident has once again raised serious questions about the law and order situation in the volatile district. According to local sources, unidentified attackers planted a large quantity of explosives beneath the bridge during the early morning hours. The explosion was heard from many miles away, spreading fear and panic among the area’s residents. Following the incident, police and security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area. An investigation was launched into the incident. The destruction of the bridge — a vital line of communication in the region — is likely to cause severe hardships for the people as it served as an important route for the daily movement of civilians, patients, students, traders and government employees. Its collapse has also disrupted access to healthcare facilities, supply of essential goods and routine commercial activities, forcing the region’s residents to use much longer and more difficult alternative routes. Local sources added that security forces’ convoys occasionally used the route as well, leading to concerns that the attack may have been aimed at destabilising the region and undermining peace. According to official sources, the bridge was primarily used by civilians for relief operations and movement. Tribal elder Malik Islam Khan and other local elders strongly condemned the incident, calling it a “heinous and cowardly act”. They said such actions primarily harm innocent civilians who are already suffering due to years of insecurity and underdevelopment. They demanded immediate and strict action against those responsible. Local political leader Abdullah Khan also expressed grave concern over the incident, stating that the people of North Waziristan had made immense sacrifices for peace, and such attacks were an attempt to sabotage those efforts. He urged the government to further strengthen security in the area and ensure the protection of critical infrastructure. Authorities said a comprehensive investigation is underway, while a report has been sent to senior officials regarding the bridge’s reconstruction and interim alternative arrangements. Attacks on infrastructure While attacks targeting infrastructure are fairly common in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has also seen a rise in such incidents in recent months. On December 7 , unidentified terrorists blew up a link bridge in the Mamandkhel area of the Bannu district using explosive material, affecting public movement in the area. Also last month, within a span of a week, North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil witnessed two incidents of terrorists blowing up government schools. November also saw two incidents of terrorists attempting to blow up bridges in Bannu. One plot was foiled by the police’s bomb disposal squad, while the improvised explosive device (IED) in the other detonated prematurely, killing the attacker .",

      "summary_orig": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan on Wednesday, said a statement by the department. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “On the special instructions of the inspector general of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, targeted operations against Fitna-al-Khawarij have been intensified in response to the attacks on the police,” the CTD said. It added that this morning, DI Khan’s CTD successfully carried out an operation on a confirmed intelligence report. “CTD teams reached the spot and surrounded the terrorists, who opened fire to avoid arrest. CTD teams also retaliated in self-defence, as a result of which the khawariji terrorists were killed,” said the statement. During the search operation, it said, the bodies of three terrorists were recovered and identified. According to the CTD, the slain terrorists were directly involved in attacks on police and security forces. The statement added that three Kalashnikovs, nine magazines, two hand grenades and several cartridges were also recovered from the slain terrorists. “In view of the presence of more terrorists and facilitators in the area, the scope of the investigation, including search operations, has also been expanded,” it said. According to the press release, KP’s Inspector General (IG) of Police Zulfiqar Hameed and the CTD additional IG paid tribute to the personnel of the CTD special weapons and tactics teams for the successful operation, and said that the series of targeted operations would be further intensified to make an example of Fitna al-Khawarij . “He added that the response to attacks on police and security forces will be very severe and the struggle will continue until the last khawarij is destroyed,” the statement said. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi commended the CTD for “sending three Indian-sponsored terrorists to hell” in DI Khan, a statement from his ministry said. Hailing their courage and professional abilities, the statement said the CTD had thwarted the “nefarious intentions” of the terrorists. “The entire nation proudly stands with the brave forces in completely eradicating the menace of Fitna al-Hindustan ,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. The state has designated some terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Surge in terrorism Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. At least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts on Monday, officials said. On Saturday, the military’s media wing said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. Also on Saturday, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu. The day before, a policeman was martyred after gunmen attacked him in the Bajaur tribal district, while another died in Khyber when gunmen ambushed a car. Three cops were injured in Bannu last week as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists”. Also in Bannu, a former tehsil nazim was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on January 6.",

The statement added that three Kalashnikovs, nine magazines, two hand grenades and several cartridges were also recovered from the slain terrorists. “In view of the presence of more terrorists and facilitators in the area, the scope of the investigation, including search operations, has also been expanded,” it said. According to the press release, KP’s Inspector General (IG) of Police Zulfiqar Hameed and the CTD additional IG paid tribute to the personnel of the CTD special weapons and tactics teams for the successful operation, and said that the series of targeted operations would be further intensified to make an example of Fitna al-Khawarij . “He added that the response to attacks on police and security forces will be very severe and the struggle will continue until the last khawarij is destroyed,” the statement said. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi commended the CTD for “sending three Indian-sponsored terrorists to hell” in DI Khan, a statement from his ministry said. Hailing their courage and professional abilities, the statement said the CTD had thwarted the “nefarious intentions” of the terrorists. “The entire nation proudly stands with the brave forces in completely eradicating the menace of Fitna al-Hindustan ,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. The state has designated some terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Surge in terrorism Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. At least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and DI Khan districts on Monday, officials said. On Saturday, the military’s media wing said that security forces had killed 11 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP. Also on Saturday, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another was gunned down in Bannu. The day before, a policeman was martyred after gunmen attacked him in the Bajaur tribal district, while another died in Khyber when gunmen ambushed a car. Three cops were injured in Bannu last week as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists”. Also in Bannu, a former tehsil nazim was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on January 6.",

      "summary": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) killed three terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij in a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Dera Ismail Khan on Wednesday, said a statement by the department. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “On the special instructions of the inspector general of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, targeted operations against Fitna-al-Khawarij have been intensified in response to the attacks on the police,” the CTD said. It added that this morning, DI Khan’s CTD successfully carried out an operation on a confirmed intelligence report. “CTD teams reached the spot and surrounded the terrorists, who opened fire to avoid arrest. CTD teams also retaliated in self-defence, as a result of which the khawariji terrorists were killed,” said the statement. During the search operation, it said, the bodies of three terrorists were recovered and identified. According to the CTD, the slain terrorists were directly involved in attacks on police and security forces.

      "summary_orig": "THE Defence Department has spent more than a year testing a device purchased in an undercover operation that some investigators think could be the cause of a series of mysterious ailments impacting US spies, diplomats and troops that are colloquially known as Havana Syndrome , according to four sources briefed on the matter. According to CNN, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations, purchased the device for millions of dollars in the waning days of the Biden administration, using funding provided by the Defence Department, according to two of the sources. Officials paid “eight figures” for the device, these people said, declining to offer a more specific number. The device is still being studied and there is ongoing debate — and in some quarters of government, scepticism — over its link to the roughly dozens of anomalous health incidents that remain officially unexplained. CNN has asked the Pentagon, HSI and the DHS for comment. The CIA declined to comment. The device acquired by HSI produces pulsed radio waves, one of the sources said, which some officials and academics have speculated for years could be the cause of the incidents. Although the device is not entirely Russian in origin, it contains Russian components, this person added. Officials have long struggled to understand how a device powerful enough to cause the kind of damage some victims have reported could be made portable; that remains a core question, according to one of the sources briefed on the device. The device could fit in a backpack, this person said. The acquisition of the device has reignited a painful and contentious debate within the US government about Havana Syndrome, known officially as “anomalous health episodes”. The mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of US diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including vertigo and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world. In the subsequent decade the intelligence community and the Defense Department have sought to understand if those officials were the victims of some kind of directed energy attack by a foreign government — with senior intelligence officials saying publicly that there wasn’t enough evidence to support that conclusion and victims arguing that the US government has gaslit them and ignored important evidence that Russia was attacking American government officials. Still, defence officials considered their findings serious enough that they briefed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees late last year, including reference to the acquired device and its testing. One key concern now for some officials is that if the technology proves viable it may have proliferated, several of the sources said, meaning that more than one country could now have access to a device that may be capable of causing career-ending injuries to US officials. CNN was not able to learn where — or from whom — HSI purchased the device, but HSI has a history of collaboration with the Defence Department for operations that take place all over the globe. The office has broad jurisdiction to investigate crimes linked to customs violations, including investigations into the proliferation of US-controlled technology or expertise overseas. Those investigations are “the single biggest collaboration point between HSI and the US military,” according to a former Homeland Security official. Published in Dawn, January 14th, 2026",

The mysterious illness first emerged in late 2016, when a cluster of US diplomats stationed in the Cuban capital of Havana began reporting symptoms consistent with head trauma, including vertigo and extreme headaches. In subsequent years, there have been cases reported around the world. In the subsequent decade the intelligence community and the Defense Department have sought to understand if those officials were the victims of some kind of directed energy attack by a foreign government — with senior intelligence officials saying publicly that there wasn’t enough evidence to support that conclusion and victims arguing that the US government has gaslit them and ignored important evidence that Russia was attacking American government officials. Still, defence officials considered their findings serious enough that they briefed the House and Senate Intelligence Committees late last year, including reference to the acquired device and its testing. One key concern now for some officials is that if the technology proves viable it may have proliferated, several of the sources said, meaning that more than one country could now have access to a device that may be capable of causing career-ending injuries to US officials. CNN was not able to learn where — or from whom — HSI purchased the device, but HSI has a history of collaboration with the Defence Department for operations that take place all over the globe. The office has broad jurisdiction to investigate crimes linked to customs violations, including investigations into the proliferation of US-controlled technology or expertise overseas. Those investigations are “the single biggest collaboration point between HSI and the US military,” according to a former Homeland Security official. Published in Dawn, January 14th, 2026",
