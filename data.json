      "summary_orig": "Iran’s supreme leader on Sunday likened recent anti-government protests to a “coup”, warning that any US attack on the Islamic Republic following Washington’s military deployments in the Middle East would trigger a regional war. The Iranian authorities’ response to the protests sparked threats of intervention from US President Donald Trump, who dispatched an aircraft carrier group to the region. “The Americans should know that if they start a war, this time it will be a regional war,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said, telling Iranians they “should not be scared” of Trump’s rhetoric. The demonstrations in Iran began as an expression of discontent at the high cost of living, but grew into a mass anti-government movement that the country’s leaders have described as “riots” fomented by the United States and Israel. “They (rioters) attacked the police, government centres, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps centres, banks, and mosques, and burned the Quran … It was like a coup,” Khamenei said, adding that “the coup was suppressed”. Tehran has acknowledged more than 3,000 deaths during the protests, but insists that most were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, attributing the violence to “terrorist acts”. Rights groups and foreign governments, however, have accused Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) of carrying out a crackdown that killed thousands of protesters. The response prompted the European Union to list the IRGC as a terrorist organisation , with Iranian lawmakers retaliating on Sunday by slapping the same designation on European armies . Lawmakers wore the green uniform of the Guards in a display of solidarity at the legislative session, where they chanted “Death to America”, “Death to Israel”, and “Shame on you, Europe”, state television footage showed. Slamming the bloc’s “irresponsible action”, speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said that under “Article 7 of the Law on Countermeasures Against the Declaration of the IRGC as a terrorist organisation, the armies of European countries are considered terrorist groups”. It remained unclear what immediate impact the decision would have. The law was first passed in 2019, when the United States classified the Guards as a terrorist organisation. Sunday’s session was held on the 47th anniversary of the return from exile of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Islamic Republic in 1979. The Guards are the ideological arm of Iran’s military, tasked with safeguarding the Islamic revolution from external and internal threats. The European Union agreed on Thursday to list the Guards as a “terrorist organisation” over the response to the protests. The step matched similar classifications enacted by the United States, Canada and Australia. Ghalibaf said the decision had “accelerated Europe’s path to becoming irrelevant in the future world order”, adding it had only increased domestic support for the Guards. Threats and dialogue Iran and the United States have been trading warnings and threats of potential military action, even as their leaders appear to leave the door open for negotiations. Firouzeh, a 43-year-old homemaker who declined to give her full name, said the recent tensions had left her “very worried and scared”. “Lately, all I do is watch the news until I fall asleep. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night to check the updates.” IRGC official Ahmad Vahidi was quoted by the Mehr news agency as saying “enemies” sought to create a “war atmosphere”. “This is part of their psychological operations. Therefore, we should not fall into this trap,” Vahidi said. The ultra-conservative Kayhan daily ran the headline “West Asia, Iran’s home and America’s graveyard”, while Mehr said several thousand graves in Tehran were ready to receive the remains of American soldiers if the United States attacked. But Ali Larijani, head of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said on Saturday: “Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.” Trump also confirmed that dialogue was taking place, but without withdrawing his earlier threats, adding, “We’ll see what happens”. The US president previously said he believed Iran would make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face military action. Tehran, meanwhile, has said it is ready for nuclear talks if its missile and defence capabilities are not on the agenda. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that “a war would be in the interest of neither Iran, nor the United States, nor the region”, during a call with his Egyptian counterpart, according to his office.

      "title_orig": "‘We will fight this war’: CM Bugti says 145 terrorists killed in 40 hours across Balochistan",
      "summary_orig": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday expressed the firm resolve to eliminate terrorists after a spate of coordinated attacks across the province, adding that 145 militants were killed within a span of 40 hours. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed 92 terrorists. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Addressing a press conference in Quetta on Sunday, CM Bugti said 145 terrorists were killed in 40 hours, adding that their bodies were in the custody of the authorities. “This is the highest number since Pakistan is facing this war on terror,” he highlighted. “Our 17 law enforcement people, including police and FC and one Navy personnel, were martyred, and our civilian casualties are 31, including some injured,” CM Bugti said. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said on Saturday night that 15 personnel were martyred during the operations and 18 civilians, including women and children, were also killed during the attacks. Stating that the state shared the grief of bereaved families, CM Bugti assured them that the welfare of the martyrs’ children was the government’s responsibility. “We had intelligence reports that this kind of operation is being planned, and as a result of those, we had already started pre-operations a day before, in which around 40 terrorists were killed in Shaban and Panjgur,” he detailed. The chief minister noted that the terrorists had planned to attack Quetta from Shaban, adding that the forces were “very vigilant”. CM Bugti termed the Gwadar incident, where he said five women and three children were killed, as the “most painful”. After the press conference, he also played video statements of those injured in Gwadar. Noting that a narrative of independence had been created, he said terrorists were using the Baloch on India’s instructions. “Whenever Pakistan begins to take off economically or on foreign fronts, you try to destabilise Pakistan by carrying out such attacks on India’s directives.” The chief minister said the terrorists had planned to enter the Red Zone and occupy important assets, which were foiled. However, he added, “Except for Nushki, where it took us some time to disengage them. Nushki is completely clear now.” CM Bugti said tracing and combing operations were underway and vowed, “We will not let them go.” Asked about reports of the Nushki deputy commissioner being abducted, the chief minister confirmed that the official was “at a safe place and had escaped their grip” when he last spoke with him. “No city was taken over,” he clarified in response to a query, recalling that he visited various areas in Quetta. “Not a single bank was looted.” Detailing an attempt to target a police station, the chief minister said terrorists were forcefully using “children as human shields”. The Balochistan CM also assailed attempts to frame terrorism as a “political issue”. “Is BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) a registered party with whom you have to hold a dialogue? […] They purely want to impose their ideology on us with the force of guns and push the Baloch into a futile war. […] You are linking this war with deprivation and rationalising this violence too.” He asserted that “rationalising this violence in the name of ethno-nationalism was a direct support to BLA”. Bugti then asked what some people wished for to be the outcome of such a dialogue. “As a result of dialogue, they want us to surrender? We will not. We will fight this war for a thousand years,” he affirmed. “We are not ready to surrender even for a second. They can carry out a thousand such attacks. They can destabilise us, but they cannot take an inch from us. This Pakistan is not for breaking away. These people cannot do it. And neither can their masters.” CM Bugti said “tools such as certain Sardars and social media” were being used to “disintegrate” the youth from the state. He expressed the resolve to further boost engagement with the population and the youth. Responding to a question, he asserted that terrorists were only terrorists and that it upset him when they were called “Baloch terrorists”. At another query, he emphasised that the state had still kept the door for talks open — unlike in the case of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — “just because of this so-called narrative [and] confusion spread in Pakistan’s intelligentsia, mainstream political leadership, judiciary and media for the last 30 years”. The chief minister observed that in the National Action Plan , the government started treating “Baloch militants as separate” from other terrorists. “What a confused nation we are. Are we fighting a serious war? he said. Noting that terrorists blend themselves within the civilian population, the chief minister asked, “Should we become brutal like them? “We could kill 10 [terrorists] by throwing one mortar, but what about the 20 civilians with them? This is the only reason why we do not want to become brutal like them.” CM Bugti also took exception to those arguing that the Balochistan “issue cannot be solved with force”. “When has force ever been used in Balochistan?” he asked rhetorically, adding that no military operation was conducted in any city. “It is a purely intelligence-driven war,” the chief minister stressed, noting that only intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted in the province. He also accused India’s Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of backing the terrorist activities, asserting that the authorities had “solid and circumstantial evidence”. Responding to a question, CM Bugti expressed the state’s firm resolve to continue the war against terrorism. “Why will we get tired? We are the state of Pakistan. We will not get tired,” he said, adding that military operations were not needed currently as IBOs were being carried out. The chief minister noted that while “all kinds” of arms were employed in the recent attacks, those left behind after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan had “spread into the market and were provided to them by their masters”. Responding to a query about the Safe City project, CM Bugti highlighted that cameras linked to the network were also targeted as they were a “threat” to them. Asked about the surge in terrorism, the chief minister noted there were “people who adopted the policy of appeasement and the institutions” that did the same after 2018. Pointing out that the institution had “punished their person”, the PPP leader asked whether the political leadership that did the same had held its people accountable. “The biggest reason behind the rise [in terrorism] today is the post-2018 appeasement,” CM Bugti asserted, adding that the policy had always proved to be harmful for the state. “There shouldn’t be any appeasement to those who took up arms against the state of Pakistan.” The chief minister strongly refuted that there was any “public sympathy” for such acts, highlighting that the public across the entire country was strongly condemning terrorism. “The only problem is narrative and the second problem is operations in grey. This operation is grey is the biggest problem for us,” he said. CM Bugti also reiterated what he emphasised during his media talk in a statement on X, saying: “The Government of Balochistan had clearly announced that it is the responsibility of the families of those who have joined the ranks of terrorists to inform the government. “Law will take its course against all the family members of these terrorists who did not alert the government,” he asserted. ‘Mopping-up’ operation underway: defence minister Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said peace has been established in Balochistan after yesterday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”. “At this moment in time, peace has been established, and the coordinated attack has been repulsed completely, and they (terrorists) have retreated,” Asif said while addressing the media in Sialkot. The defence minister further said that attempts were made to “target the FC (Frontier Corps) headquarters” in Nushki and Dalbadin, adding that all attacks were foiled. “They attempted to carry out a suicide attack in Dalbadin,” he said, adding that “all targets have been neutralised”. Echoing Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statements, Asif blamed the incidents on neighbouring India, adding that the attacks aimed to “destabilise the country at a time when it is on the path to progress”. “Our intelligence and the confessional statements by terrorists all prove linkages to India,” the defence minister said. The minister said that the BLA was now “making use of female bombers”, detailing that women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted” on Saturday. He added that in an attack in Pasni, the terrorists made use of a “female suicide bomber”. “The minds of young women are being polluted,” he said, adding that the BLA was now targeting “labourers and poor people struggling to survive”. “Their handlers are sitting in Afghanistan, and indoctrinating young children to be used for their nefarious purposes,” he added. Asif noted that terrorists were able to “operate easily” owing to Balochistan’s vast and sparsely populated area, vowing that the government would “work towards ending this advantage”. Terrorists using civilians as human shields: Tallal Chaudhry In a separate televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said terrorists were using civilians as human shields. Therefore, security forces had to operate with great caution, which took some time, he added. He said they were “hiding behind them and in some places, using families and children as shields to escape”. “Terrorists could have been responded to within minutes, but the operation was carried out with caution on soft targets to avoid harming civilian women and children, who were being used as shields by terrorist,” Chaudhry said. “If they are so capable, why don’t they attack openly instead of hiding behind women and children?” he added. The state minister also took note of a “false narrative” being spread on social media that terrorists have taken control of some areas — a claim also rebutted by CM Bugti in his press conference. Noting that videos, in some cases AI-generated, were aired by Indian media, Chaudhry pointed out that the “extent of terrorists’ connection with Indian media” was apparent as they were “transmitting from areas with no mobile signals, creating narratives, and broadcasting them”. “This clearly indicates India is backing them financially and logistically.” The interior official further asserted, “This is not about Baloch rights; it is about targeting things used by Baloch civilians.” He also stated that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has visited Quetta, “proving that the situation is normal and showing the federal government’s support of Balochistan”. “Most terrorists were killed; many were arrested. Some escaped, but are being pursued,” the state minister said. Ban on gatherings, face masks In the wake of the attacks, the Balochistan government has imposed a ban on gatherings, processions and sit-ins of five or more people across the province for one month. According to a Home Department order issued on Sunday, a ban was also imposed on covering faces in public places by using mufflers, masks or any other means that obstruct identification The display or use of weapons, pillion riding, the use of tinted glasses on vehicles, and the use of unregistered vehicles were also prohibited under the order. The bans were placed under Section 144 (power to issue order absolute) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). US remains Pakistan’s ‘steadfast partner’ in efforts to ensure peace Earlier in the day, US Charge de’ Affaires Natalie Baker strongly condemned the Balochistan terrorist attacks and affirmed that the United States remained a “steadfast partner” of Pakistan in efforts to ensure peace. “The United States strongly condemns January 31 attacks and acts of terrorist violence against security personnel and civilians in Balochistan, claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Baker said on X. On behalf of the US, she extended condolences to the victims of terrorism, their families and all those affected. “The Pakistani people deserve to live free from violence and fear,” she said. Baker added: “The United States remains a steadfast partner of Pakistan in its efforts to ensure peace and stability. We stand in solidarity with Pakistan during this difficult time.” In August 2025, the US also designated the BLA and its Majeed Brigade squad as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs). Besides the US, the British High Commission, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also condemned the latest terrorist activities. In a statement issued on Sunday, the Iranian embassy in Pakistan strongly condemned the “recent terrorist attacks leading to the martyrdom of a number of innocent civilians and brave security personnel and soldiers”. It conveyed Iran’s “sincere and deepest condolences and sympathy to the government and the honourable people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families”. It also extended prayers for the martyrs and the injured. The statement affirmed that Iran, “as a matter of principle, unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism, which remains a serious threat and concern for the international community”. “Such heinous acts, often supported by extraterritorial actors, must be confronted through collective regional and international cooperation,” it noted.

Nushki is completely clear now.” CM Bugti said tracing and combing operations were underway and vowed, “We will not let them go.” Asked about reports of the Nushki deputy commissioner being abducted, the chief minister confirmed that the official was “at a safe place and had escaped their grip” when he last spoke with him. “No city was taken over,” he clarified in response to a query, recalling that he visited various areas in Quetta. “Not a single bank was looted.” Detailing an attempt to target a police station, the chief minister said terrorists were forcefully using “children as human shields”. The Balochistan CM also assailed attempts to frame terrorism as a “political issue”. “Is BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) a registered party with whom you have to hold a dialogue? […] They purely want to impose their ideology on us with the force of guns and push the Baloch into a futile war. […] You are linking this war with deprivation and rationalising this violence too.” He asserted that “rationalising this violence in the name of ethno-nationalism was a direct support to BLA”. Bugti then asked what some people wished for to be the outcome of such a dialogue. “As a result of dialogue, they want us to surrender? We will not. We will fight this war for a thousand years,” he affirmed. “We are not ready to surrender even for a second. They can carry out a thousand such attacks. They can destabilise us, but they cannot take an inch from us. This Pakistan is not for breaking away. These people cannot do it. And neither can their masters.” CM Bugti said “tools such as certain Sardars and social media” were being used to “disintegrate” the youth from the state. He expressed the resolve to further boost engagement with the population and the youth. Responding to a question, he asserted that terrorists were only terrorists and that it upset him when they were called “Baloch terrorists”. At another query, he emphasised that the state had still kept the door for talks open — unlike in the case of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — “just because of this so-called narrative [and] confusion spread in Pakistan’s intelligentsia, mainstream political leadership, judiciary and media for the last 30 years”. The chief minister observed that in the National Action Plan , the government started treating “Baloch militants as separate” from other terrorists. “What a confused nation we are. Are we fighting a serious war? he said. Noting that terrorists blend themselves within the civilian population, the chief minister asked, “Should we become brutal like them? “We could kill 10 [terrorists] by throwing one mortar, but what about the 20 civilians with them? This is the only reason why we do not want to become brutal like them.” CM Bugti also took exception to those arguing that the Balochistan “issue cannot be solved with force”. “When has force ever been used in Balochistan?” he asked rhetorically, adding that no military operation was conducted in any city. “It is a purely intelligence-driven war,” the chief minister stressed, noting that only intelligence-based operations (IBOs) were conducted in the province. He also accused India’s Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) of backing the terrorist activities, asserting that the authorities had “solid and circumstantial evidence”. Responding to a question, CM Bugti expressed the state’s firm resolve to continue the war against terrorism. “Why will we get tired? We are the state of Pakistan. We will not get tired,” he said, adding that military operations were not needed currently as IBOs were being carried out. The chief minister noted that while “all kinds” of arms were employed in the recent attacks, those left behind after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan had “spread into the market and were provided to them by their masters”. Responding to a query about the Safe City project, CM Bugti highlighted that cameras linked to the network were also targeted as they were a “threat” to them. Asked about the surge in terrorism, the chief minister noted there were “people who adopted the policy of appeasement and the institutions” that did the same after 2018. Pointing out that the institution had “punished their person”, the PPP leader asked whether the political leadership that did the same had held its people accountable. “The biggest reason behind the rise [in terrorism] today is the post-2018 appeasement,” CM Bugti asserted, adding that the policy had always proved to be harmful for the state. “There shouldn’t be any appeasement to those who took up arms against the state of Pakistan.” The chief minister strongly refuted that there was any “public sympathy” for such acts, highlighting that the public across the entire country was strongly condemning terrorism. “The only problem is narrative and the second problem is operations in grey. This operation is grey is the biggest problem for us,” he said. CM Bugti also reiterated what he emphasised during his media talk in a statement on X, saying: “The Government of Balochistan had clearly announced that it is the responsibility of the families of those who have joined the ranks of terrorists to inform the government. “Law will take its course against all the family members of these terrorists who did not alert the government,” he asserted. ‘Mopping-up’ operation underway: defence minister Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said peace has been established in Balochistan after yesterday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”. “At this moment in time, peace has been established, and the coordinated attack has been repulsed completely, and they (terrorists) have retreated,” Asif said while addressing the media in Sialkot. The defence minister further said that attempts were made to “target the FC (Frontier Corps) headquarters” in Nushki and Dalbadin, adding that all attacks were foiled. “They attempted to carry out a suicide attack in Dalbadin,” he said, adding that “all targets have been neutralised”. Echoing Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statements, Asif blamed the incidents on neighbouring India, adding that the attacks aimed to “destabilise the country at a time when it is on the path to progress”. “Our intelligence and the confessional statements by terrorists all prove linkages to India,” the defence minister said. The minister said that the BLA was now “making use of female bombers”, detailing that women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted” on Saturday. He added that in an attack in Pasni, the terrorists made use of a “female suicide bomber”. “The minds of young women are being polluted,” he said, adding that the BLA was now targeting “labourers and poor people struggling to survive”. “Their handlers are sitting in Afghanistan, and indoctrinating young children to be used for their nefarious purposes,” he added. Asif noted that terrorists were able to “operate easily” owing to Balochistan’s vast and sparsely populated area, vowing that the government would “work towards ending this advantage”. Terrorists using civilians as human shields: Tallal Chaudhry In a separate televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said terrorists were using civilians as human shields. Therefore, security forces had to operate with great caution, which took some time, he added. He said they were “hiding behind them and in some places, using families and children as shields to escape”. “Terrorists could have been responded to within minutes, but the operation was carried out with caution on soft targets to avoid harming civilian women and children, who were being used as shields by terrorist,” Chaudhry said. “If they are so capable, why don’t they attack openly instead of hiding behind women and children?” he added. The state minister also took note of a “false narrative” being spread on social media that terrorists have taken control of some areas — a claim also rebutted by CM Bugti in his press conference. Noting that videos, in some cases AI-generated, were aired by Indian media, Chaudhry pointed out that the “extent of terrorists’ connection with Indian media” was apparent as they were “transmitting from areas with no mobile signals, creating narratives, and broadcasting them”. “This clearly indicates India is backing them financially and logistically.” The interior official further asserted, “This is not about Baloch rights; it is about targeting things used by Baloch civilians.” He also stated that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has visited Quetta, “proving that the situation is normal and showing the federal government’s support of Balochistan”. “Most terrorists were killed; many were arrested. Some escaped, but are being pursued,” the state minister said. Ban on gatherings, face masks In the wake of the attacks, the Balochistan government has imposed a ban on gatherings, processions and sit-ins of five or more people across the province for one month. According to a Home Department order issued on Sunday, a ban was also imposed on covering faces in public places by using mufflers, masks or any other means that obstruct identification The display or use of weapons, pillion riding, the use of tinted glasses on vehicles, and the use of unregistered vehicles were also prohibited under the order. The bans were placed under Section 144 (power to issue order absolute) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). US remains Pakistan’s ‘steadfast partner’ in efforts to ensure peace Earlier in the day, US Charge de’ Affaires Natalie Baker strongly condemned the Balochistan terrorist attacks and affirmed that the United States remained a “steadfast partner” of Pakistan in efforts to ensure peace. “The United States strongly condemns January 31 attacks and acts of terrorist violence against security personnel and civilians in Balochistan, claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Baker said on X. On behalf of the US, she extended condolences to the victims of terrorism, their families and all those affected. “The Pakistani people deserve to live free from violence and fear,” she said. Baker added: “The United States remains a steadfast partner of Pakistan in its efforts to ensure peace and stability. We stand in solidarity with Pakistan during this difficult time.” In August 2025, the US also designated the BLA and its Majeed Brigade squad as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs). Besides the US, the British High Commission, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Iran have also condemned the latest terrorist activities. In a statement issued on Sunday, the Iranian embassy in Pakistan strongly condemned the “recent terrorist attacks leading to the martyrdom of a number of innocent civilians and brave security personnel and soldiers”. It conveyed Iran’s “sincere and deepest condolences and sympathy to the government and the honourable people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families”. It also extended prayers for the martyrs and the injured. The statement affirmed that Iran, “as a matter of principle, unequivocally condemns all forms of terrorism, which remains a serious threat and concern for the international community”. “Such heinous acts, often supported by extraterritorial actors, must be confronted through collective regional and international cooperation,” it noted.

      "title": "‘We will fight this war’: CM Bugti says 145 terrorists killed in 40 hours across Balochistan",
      "summary": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday expressed the firm resolve to eliminate terrorists after a spate of coordinated attacks across the province, adding that 145 militants were killed within a span of 40 hours. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed 92 terrorists. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Addressing a press conference in Quetta on Sunday, CM Bugti said 145 terrorists were killed in 40 hours, adding that their bodies were in the custody of the authorities. “This is the highest number since Pakistan is facing this war on terror,” he highlighted. “Our 17 law enforcement people, including police and FC and one Navy personnel, were martyred, and our civilian casualties are 31, including some injured,” CM Bugti said. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said on Saturday night that 15 personnel were martyred during the operations and 18 civilians, including women and children, were also killed during the attacks. Stating that the state shared the grief of bereaved families, CM Bugti assured them that the welfare of the martyrs’ children was the government’s responsibility. “We had intelligence reports that this kind of operation is being planned, and as a result of those, we had already started pre-operations a day before, in which around 40 terrorists were killed in Shaban and Panjgur,” he detailed. The chief minister noted that the terrorists had planned to attack Quetta from Shaban, adding that the forces were “very vigilant”. CM Bugti termed the Gwadar incident, where he said five women and three children were killed, as the “most painful”. After the press conference, he also played video statements of those injured in Gwadar. Noting that a narrative of independence had been created, he said terrorists were using the Baloch on India’s instructions. “Whenever Pakistan begins to take off economically or on foreign fronts, you try to destabilise Pakistan by carrying out such attacks on India’s directives.” The chief minister said the terrorists had planned to enter the Red Zone and occupy important assets, which were foiled.

      "title_orig": "Israel to terminate MSF work in Gaza for failing to provide list of Palestinian staff",
      "summary_orig": "Israel said on Sunday it was terminating the humanitarian operations of the international charity Doctors Without Borders in Gaza after the organisation failed to provide a list of its Palestinian staff. “The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism is moving to terminate the activities of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in the Gaza Strip,” the ministry said. The decision follows “MSF’s failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region”, it added, stating that the group will cease its work and leave Gaza by February 28. In December, the ministry announced it would prevent 37 aid organisations, including MSF, from operating in Gaza from March 1 for failing to provide detailed information about their Palestinian staff. It had alleged that two MSF employees had links with Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which the medical charity vehemently denies. On Sunday, the ministry said MSF had committed in early January that it would share the staff list as required by the Israeli authorities. “Despite its public commitment, the organisation refrained from transferring the lists,” the ministry said. “Subsequently, MSF announced it does not intend to proceed with the registration process at all, contradicting its previous statements and the binding protocol. “In accordance with the regulations, MSF will cease its operations and depart the Gaza Strip by February 28, 2026,” the ministry added. In a statement posted on its website on Friday, MSF acknowledged that it had, as an “exceptional measure”, agreed to share a list of names of its Palestinian and international staff with the Israeli authorities. “However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required,” the charity said. “These included that any staff information would be used only for its stated administrative purpose and would not [be used to put] colleagues at risk.” MSF said it had not received assurances on these fronts, so “concluded that we will not share staff information in the current circumstances”. Israel to partially reopen Gaza’s Rafah crossing today Meanwhile, Israel is set to partially reopen the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt today, following months of urging from humanitarian organisations, though access will be limited to the movement of people. The reopening comes amid ongoing violence in the Palestinian territory, with Gaza’s civil defence agency reporting dozens killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday, while the Israeli military said it was retaliating against ceasefire violations. The Rafah crossing is a vital gateway for both civilians and aid, but has remained closed since Israeli forces seized control of it in May 2024 during the war with Hamas, aside from a brief and limited reopening in early 2025. Israel had previously said it would not reopen the crossing until the remains of Ran Gvili — the last Israeli hostage held in Gaza — were returned. His remains were recovered days ago, and he was laid to rest in Israel on Wednesday. “The Rafah Crossing will open this coming Sunday (February 1) in both directions, for limited movement of people only,” COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body overseeing civil affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories, said on Friday. Entry and exit “will be permitted in coordination with Egypt, following prior security clearance of individuals by Israel, and under the supervision of the European Union mission”, it added. However, key details remain unclear, including how many people will be allowed to cross and whether those seeking to return to Gaza will be permitted entry. A source at the border told AFP that Sunday would be largely devoted to preparations and logistical arrangements. The crossing is set to open on Sunday on a trial basis to allow the passage of wounded individuals, ahead of a regular reopening scheduled for Monday, three sources at the crossing said. However, no agreement has yet been reached on the number of Palestinians permitted to enter or exit, the sources added, noting that Egypt plans to admit “all Palestinians whom Israel authorises to leave” the territory. “Every day that passes drains my life and worsens my condition,” said Mohammed Shamiya, 33, who suffers from kidney disease and requires dialysis treatment abroad. “I’m waiting every moment for the opening of the Rafah land crossing.” Anxious wait Safa al-Hawajri, who has received a scholarship to study overseas, is also eagerly awaiting the reopening on Sunday. “I’m waiting in the hope of fulfilling my ambition, which is tied to the reopening of the crossing,” said Hawajri, 18. “I hope to be able to travel as soon as it opens.” Located on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, Rafah is the only crossing into and out of the territory that does not pass through Israel. The crossing lies in an area held by Israeli forces following their withdrawal behind the so-called “Yellow Line” under the terms of a US-brokered ceasefire that came into effect on October 10. Israeli troops still control more than half of Gaza, while the rest remains under Hamas authority. The ceasefire has now entered its second phase and calls for reopening the crossing following the release or return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Hamas had called for its full reopening in both directions after the remains of Gvili were brought back to Israel. The reopening is expected to facilitate the entry of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic body, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), established to oversee the day-to-day governance of the territory’s 2.2 million residents. The committee is to operate under the supervision of the so-called “Board of Peace” chaired by US President Donald Trump. The NCAG, headed by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath , is expected to enter the Gaza Strip once the Rafah crossing reopens. Violence continued ahead of the crossing’s reopening. At least 32 people, including children, were killed on Saturday in Israeli air strikes in Gaza, reported the civil defence agency. Israel’s military said the strikes were retaliation for an incident on Friday in which eight Palestinian fighters exited a tunnel in the city of Rafah, which it said violated the ceasefire.",

      "summary_en": "Israel said on Sunday it was terminating the humanitarian operations of the international charity Doctors Without Borders in Gaza after the organisation failed to provide a list of its Palestinian staff. “The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism is moving to terminate the activities of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in the Gaza Strip,” the ministry said. The decision follows “MSF’s failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region”, it added, stating that the group will cease its work and leave Gaza by February 28. In December, the ministry announced it would prevent 37 aid organisations, including MSF, from operating in Gaza from March 1 for failing to provide detailed information about their Palestinian staff. It had alleged that two MSF employees had links with Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which the medical charity vehemently denies. On Sunday, the ministry said MSF had committed in early January that it would share the staff list as required by the Israeli authorities. “Despite its public commitment, the organisation refrained from transferring the lists,” the ministry said. “Subsequently, MSF announced it does not intend to proceed with the registration process at all, contradicting its previous statements and the binding protocol. “In accordance with the regulations, MSF will cease its operations and depart the Gaza Strip by February 28, 2026,” the ministry added. In a statement posted on its website on Friday, MSF acknowledged that it had, as an “exceptional measure”, agreed to share a list of names of its Palestinian and international staff with the Israeli authorities. “However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required,” the charity said. “These included that any staff information would be used only for its stated administrative purpose and would not [be used to put] colleagues at risk.” MSF said it had not received assurances on these fronts, so “concluded that we will not share staff information in the current circumstances”. Israel to partially reopen Gaza’s Rafah crossing today Meanwhile, Israel is set to partially reopen the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt today, following months of urging from humanitarian organisations, though access will be limited to the movement of people. The reopening comes amid ongoing violence in the Palestinian territory, with Gaza’s civil defence agency reporting dozens killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday, while the Israeli military said it was retaliating against ceasefire violations. The Rafah crossing is a vital gateway for both civilians and aid, but has remained closed since Israeli forces seized control of it in May 2024 during the war with Hamas, aside from a brief and limited reopening in early 2025. Israel had previously said it would not reopen the crossing until the remains of Ran Gvili — the last Israeli hostage held in Gaza — were returned. His remains were recovered days ago, and he was laid to rest in Israel on Wednesday. “The Rafah Crossing will open this coming Sunday (February 1) in both directions, for limited movement of people only,” COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body overseeing civil affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories, said on Friday. Entry and exit “will be permitted in coordination with Egypt, following prior security clearance of individuals by Israel, and under the supervision of the European Union mission”, it added. However, key details remain unclear, including how many people will be allowed to cross and whether those seeking to return to Gaza will be permitted entry. A source at the border told AFP that Sunday would be largely devoted to preparations and logistical arrangements. The crossing is set to open on Sunday on a trial basis to allow the passage of wounded individuals, ahead of a regular reopening scheduled for Monday, three sources at the crossing said. However, no agreement has yet been reached on the number of Palestinians permitted to enter or exit, the sources added, noting that Egypt plans to admit “all Palestinians whom Israel authorises to leave” the territory. “Every day that passes drains my life and worsens my condition,” said Mohammed Shamiya, 33, who suffers from kidney disease and requires dialysis treatment abroad. “I’m waiting every moment for the opening of the Rafah land crossing.” Anxious wait Safa al-Hawajri, who has received a scholarship to study overseas, is also eagerly awaiting the reopening on Sunday. “I’m waiting in the hope of fulfilling my ambition, which is tied to the reopening of the crossing,” said Hawajri, 18. “I hope to be able to travel as soon as it opens.” Located on Gaza’s southern border with Egypt, Rafah is the only crossing into and out of the territory that does not pass through Israel. The crossing lies in an area held by Israeli forces following their withdrawal behind the so-called “Yellow Line” under the terms of a US-brokered ceasefire that came into effect on October 10. Israeli troops still control more than half of Gaza, while the rest remains under Hamas authority. The ceasefire has now entered its second phase and calls for reopening the crossing following the release or return of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Hamas had called for its full reopening in both directions after the remains of Gvili were brought back to Israel. The reopening is expected to facilitate the entry of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic body, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), established to oversee the day-to-day governance of the territory’s 2.2 million residents.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan, along with seven other Muslim-majority countries, condemned on Sunday the repeated violations of the ceasefire in Gaza by Israel, asserting that these actions risked undermining efforts for restoring stability at a time when regional and international partners were working collectively to advance the second phase of US President Donald Trump’s plan. The eight countries — Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan , Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and United Arab Emirates — had worked with Trump’s administration on a plan last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. Implementation of the plan began in October 2025, leading to a ceasefire in Gaza more than two years after the onslaught began. Israel, however, has repeatedly violated the the truce, carrying out strikes in the Strip. Meanwhile, work is ongoing on the second phase of Trump’s plan, shifting focus from ceasefire implementation to demilitarisation, technocratic governance and reconstruction. In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the eight countries that worked on the plan, said strongly condemned Israel’s repeated violations of the ceasefire in Gaza, “which have resulted in the killing and injuring of more than a thousand Palestinians”. “These actions risk escalating tensions and undermining efforts aimed at consolidating calm and restoring stability, at a time when regional and international parties are working collectively to advance the second phase of President Donald Trump’s peace plan and to implement the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803,” the statement said. It said the foreign ministers of the eight countries “consider that these repeated violations constitute a direct threat to the political process and hinder ongoing efforts to create appropriate conditions for transitioning to a more stable phase in the Gaza Strip, both in terms of security and humanitarian conditions, and stress the necessity of full commitment to ensuring the success of the second phase of President Trump’s peace plan”. They called on all parties to “fully uphold their responsibilities during this critical period and to exercise the utmost restraint, in order to preserve and sustain the ceasefire, refrain from any actions that may undermine the current process, and create favourable conditions to move forward toward early recovery and reconstruction, as well as advancing a just and lasting peace grounded in the Palestinian right to self-determination and statehood, in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and the Arab peace initiative”.",

      "summary_orig": "UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan figured prominently in warnings sounded at the United Nations this week about the growing spillover of terrorist threats from Afghanistan, with both China and the UN chief expressing concern over militant violence affecting the country. Addressing a high-level briefing on the Counter-Terrorism Early Warning Network for Central Asia on Friday, Chinese Ambassador to the UN Sun Lei said that while the Central Asia region remained broadly stable, it continued to be affected by cross-border terrorism. “Currently, the Central Asia region remains generally stable, yet is still deeply affected by the spillover effect of terrorist threats,” he said, citing recent attacks in Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan that “deserve our high vigilance”. Emphasising Pakistan’s long-standing concerns , the Chinese envoy called for closer cooperation with Kabul. “We need to strengthen engagement and cooperation with Afghanistan to prevent it from once again becoming a safe haven for terrorist organisations, and to jointly prevent and address the return of foreign terrorist fighters,” he said. Beijing calls for cooperation with Kabul to stop militants using Afghan soil; Guterres flags TTP threat under Taliban regime Ambassador Sun also underlined the importance of development in countering extremism. “At the same time, it is imperative to accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to eliminate the root causes of terrorism,” he said. UN concerns A day earlier, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres raised similar concerns at a briefing in New York. He said the UN remained committed to four key objectives in Afghanistan, while voicing frustration over the Taliban’s failure to make progress on inclusivity, human rights and regional security. “We need to make sure that Afghan institutions are truly inclusive, that all ethnic groups are represented and that all sectors of society are represented,” he said, calling this “a basic condition for the consolidation of peace”. On women’s rights, the UN chief expressed concern over restrictions limiting women’s ability to work. “[UN Undersecretary General] Rosemary DiCarlo managed to guarantee the possibility for our female staff to work in the field, but not in our headquarters, and we are very frustrated by that.” He described the Taliban’s failure to meet the expectations of the international community as “unacceptable”. Turning to security, Guterres highlighted the threat posed by groups operating from Afghan soil. “Another aspect is the need to make sure that no terrorist organisations can operate from Afghanistan into other countries. We are particularly concerned about what has happened with the Pakistani Taliban [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan] and the support they might receive.” He added that the UN had seen meaningful progress on drug trafficking since the Taliban’s return, but lamented the lack of improvement on other fronts. “In relation to the three other aspects, we have frustration, because we do not see our legitimate concerns making the progress that is essential.” Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in terrorist incidents in recent years, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, with officials linking much of the violence to cross-border infiltration from Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021. Analysts say the resurgent TTP and allied groups have increased attacks inside Pakistan while allegedly enjoying safe havens across the Afghan border. Islamabad has consistently urged the international community to press Kabul to prevent its territory from being used by militants targeting Pakistan, arguing that regional and global security remain directly tied to stability in Afghanistan.

      "summary_orig": "THE latest blunder by the hybrid government in taking imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan to hospital for the treatment of a critical eye problem surreptitiously — without even informing his family or his personal physicians — can only be blamed on the PTI founder himself. Indeed, the responsibility rests squarely on his shoulders, because, if it weren’t for fear of his supporters converging on the hospital in droves, why would the authorities have kept something secret that would have come out in the open within days? Even after spending 32 months in prison since his arrest in the Toshakhana case, followed by his conviction, Mr Khan’s popularity has not waned nor has his cutting, effective narrative been blunted. So, the prisoner has made his captors themselves captives of fear. He is wielding influence and power way beyond the confines of his cell. And I say this when I have never voted for him or his party; and when I liked Imran Khan far more as an iconic cricketer and anti-cancer crusader than as a politician with traits defined by a populist rhetoric and disdain for opinions that differ from his own. Even a man committed to a fitness programme will show signs of wear and tear after a demanding sporting life. For example, as far as the media is concerned, Imran Khan’s government did exactly what the incumbents are doing. The media, as this newspaper knows well, was punished for merely reporting on the facts, articulating people’s aspirations and issues and calling out those at the helm for overstepping legal and constitutional boundaries when they did. His tenure in office with his intel chief (now a court-martialled former three-star) as his enforcer, was a nightmare for media houses as well as media professionals with all kinds of oppression unleashed against journalists as well as their employers for not toeing the line — ie, for coverage that was seen as out of line. And his disdain for the Constitution and the rule of law was evident from his conduct when, after falling out with his benefactors, he faced the certainty of being ousted in an establishment-backed no-confidence vote. He advised his party man, the president, to dissolve the Assembly. Even a judiciary which was largely seen as sympathetic to him could not digest the move and restored the Assembly and resurrected the no-trust vote. He blamed a ‘foreign (US) conspiracy’ for his ouster from office in April 2022. His supporters, in the eyes of whom he can do no wrong, lapped it up and his narrative snowballed into a firm belief among millions that he’d been horribly wronged. When his establishment backers of the time were building him up as a viable choice through the media in the first half of the last decade and many media houses gave him endless airtime, he rode the crest of the popularity wave. But side by side, he built a formidable social media machine. Now when the shoe is on the other foot and most of the media has fallen in line and remains largely unsympathetic to the PTI cause, the founder remains unaffected as his message and narrative reaches all his supporters through social media and other means. This is what has led to him being kept incommunicado, with family (consisting mainly of his sisters) ‘visits’, as per the jail manual, and party leaders barred for weeks on end because they are seen as the source through which his messages, often stripped of any niceties, reach his US-based social media team that runs his handle and amplifies the messages. To be honest, these messages so far have not proved effective in mobilising his support base to pour out into the streets to demand his freedom. But yes, the language used is often so bitter and severe — perhaps, because like many other Pakistanis, he believes he was cheated out of an election win in 2024 — that it probably irks those who wield power today. So by restricting his visitors the conduit for his messages is also blocked. Whether those moves and countermoves are legitimate is a debate for another time but there can be no question that denying he was taken to hospital for a procedure for nearly a week before admitting the truth shows the hybrid set-up in a very poor light. Even with a rudimentary knowledge of medical issues, I can say that anything to do with the eye is a very serious issue and needs addressing promptly because it can imperil one’s vision. No matter how hard the state may have now decided to be, this is taking things to ludicrous levels. The former iconic sports star is super fit no doubt, even at 73. Government ministers say he has been given exercise machines in prison and uses them regularly. But even a man committed to a fitness programme like him will show signs of wear and tear after a demanding sporting life. He deserves to be looked after well and by physicians of his choice. As far as I know, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust Hospital’s top executives and respected physicians Dr Asim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan have never been the source of any leak of Imran Khan’s political messages when they have seen him in their professional capacity. One blunder should not lead to a series of blunders. He is a former prime minister, a popular leader, and a national icon. Whatever hurt and offence his messages may cause, that should not be an obstacle to him receiving the best possible treatment by doctors he has faith in and trusts; his personal physicians’ visit ought to be facilitated. No point in waiting for Feb 8 to pass when he has called for mass protests. Every day counts if you don’t want to lose the narratives war.

      "summary_orig": "THE seemingly coordinated terrorist attacks across Balochistan on Saturday reinforce the fact that the state must confront the menace of terrorist violence in the province firmly. As per security sources and official media, terrorists belonging to Fitna al-Hindustan , the term the state uses for Baloch separatists, struck at least 12 cities and towns in the province, including Quetta. A large number of terrorists were killed by the security forces. Security men and civilians have also been martyred in the attacks. The sophistication of the strikes indicates that the militants had received training, and backs the state’s suspicions that hostile actors in the region are stirring up trouble in Balochistan. Yet it is also a matter of concern that the terrorists were able to hit such a large number of towns, including the provincial capital, which is supposed to be well-protected. The seriousness of the situation can be gauged from the federal interior minister’s dash to Balochistan to take stock of the situation. Were it not for the sacrifices of the police and security forces, the terrorists could have succeeded in causing greater havoc. Unfortunately, this pattern of violence in Balochistan is not new. Last year’s assault targeting the Jaffar Express , as well as a similar coordinated terror campaign in August 2024, shows that despite the state’s counterterrorism efforts, the problem of militancy remains unresolved in this troubled province. As per one think tank, there were over 250 terrorist attacks in Balochistan last year, causing over 400 fatalities. Along with KP, the province is the hardest hit by terrorist violence in the country. This atmosphere of violence and uncertainty exacerbates the socioeconomic woes of Balochistan, and slows development. While the immediate focus should be on sanitisation operations so that all affected areas are declared safe, the administration must think long term in order to bring lasting peace to Balochistan. Firstly, no ideology can justify the murder of innocent people — women and children were also reportedly martyred in Saturday’s attacks — therefore, the state must neutralise all those violent actors responsible for these atrocities. In the past, Baloch terrorists have also indulged in brutal slayings of ‘non-locals.’ Moreover, the links of the terrorist groups with hostile foreign actors need to be broken, and greater vigilance is needed at the country’s borders to prevent terrorists from entering the country. But while the kinetic element is essential, long-term peace can only come about through a full and unhindered political process in the province. Those estranged elements that renounce violence and pledge to respect the Constitution should be engaged by the rulers. Also, until Balochistan’s natural wealth reaches its people, and alleviates their poverty and suffering, hostile actors will continue to exploit the situation. Published in Dawn, February 1st, 2026",

But while the kinetic element is essential, long-term peace can only come about through a full and unhindered political process in the province. Those estranged elements that renounce violence and pledge to respect the Constitution should be engaged by the rulers. Also, until Balochistan’s natural wealth reaches its people, and alleviates their poverty and suffering, hostile actors will continue to exploit the situation. Published in Dawn, February 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Palestinian territory’s civil defence agency says victims include children • Bloodshed comes after Tel Aviv announced it would reopen Rafah crossing today for ‘limited movement of people’ GAZA CITY: Israeli air strikes killed 32 people including children in Gaza on Saturday, according to the Palestinian territory’s civil defence agency. Despite a US-brokered truce entering its second phase earlier this month, violence in the Palestinian territory has continued, with both Israel and Hamas accusing each other of violating the agreement. The latest bloodshed comes after Israel announced it would reopen the crucial Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Sunday (today) for the “limited movement of people”. “The death toll since dawn today has risen to 32, most of them children and women,” said the civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under the Hamas authority, updating an earlier toll of 28. “Residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station were targeted, resulting in this humanitarian catastrophe,” agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said in the statement. A unit in an apartment building of Gaza City’s Rimal neighbourhood was left entirely destroyed, and blood spatters from its occupants were visible on the street below, an AFP journalist reported. “Three girls died while they were sleeping. We found their bodies in the street”, Samer al-Atbash, a relative of the family, told AFP. “What truce are you talking about? Everyone is deceiving everyone else,” added Nael al-Atbash, another relative. One strike hit the police station in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City, the territory’s largest urban centre. Gaza’s general police directorate said seven people were killed in that attack, while Bassal said the dead included four women police officers. “The killed included police officers and personnel as well as civilians who were present at the station at the time,” the directorate said. Ceasefire violations About a dozen first responders rushed to the devastated building and pulled bodies from the rubble, according to an AFP journalist. Another Israeli attack hit a shelter in Al-Mawasi, an area of south Gaza where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians live in tents and makeshift shelters, an AFP journalist reported. Large plumes of smoke rose above the thousands of densely pitched tents. The number of casualties from this strike was still not known. Although people have been killed almost daily in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire on Oct 10, Saturday’s toll was particularly high. Israel’s military said that the air strikes were retaliation for an incident on Friday in which eight Palestinian fighters exited a tunnel in the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza, which it said violated the fragile ceasefire. It claimed that it targeted commanders and sites belonging to Hamas and its ally, Islamic Jihad. Hamas in a statement condemned Saturday’s strikes as “a brutal crime”. The health ministry, which operates under the Hamas authority, has said Israeli attacks have killed at least 509 people in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect. Rafah reopening Media restrictions and limited access in Gaza left journalists unable to independently verify casualty figures or freely cover the violence. Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, condemned Israel’s “repeated violations” of the truce and demanded all parties “exercise the utmost restraint” ahead of Sunday’s reopening of Rafah crossing. Israel has said reopening of the Rafah crossing will only allow the “limited movement of people”. The reopening is a key element in the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.

      "summary_orig": "• Interior minister, Balochistan CM reaffirm resolve against terrorism • Akhtar Mengal says he has ‘never seen such a dangerous situation’ QUETTA: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday held India responsible for a spate of attacks in Balochistan, stressing that authorities would go after every single one of those involved, while an opposition leader warned that the situation in the region had spiralled “completely out of control”. Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists. “We will expose them in the world — the face with which they meet the world and the face with which they support terrorists.” Mr Naqvi said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and devising strategies. CM Bugti expressed gratitude to Mr Naqvi for rushing to Quetta. “We chaired a high-level security meeting and visited the injured at the Combined Military Hospital,” he said. “In terms of the incident itself, information has yet to come, but I want to say that the operation is pretty much over,” he said. He lauded law enforcement and security personnel for their response to the attacks. Earlier, the interior minister and CM Bugti attended funeral prayers for the martyred personnel and visited Police Lines to meet the bereaved families in Quetta. They reaffirmed that the resolve of the people and the state against terrorism remained unshakable. “The people and security forces of Balochistan are brave and courageous,” an official statement quoted Mr Naqvi as saying. “Our soldiers took comprehensive and effective action against terrorists. The sacrifices of martyrs cannot be forgotten, and the nation salutes them.” Addressing the families, CM Bugti vowed that “every drop of the martyrs’ blood would be avenged” and urged them to remain steadfast and patient. He emphasised that the people of Balochistan owed a debt to their sacrifice. Situation ‘out of control’ Sardar Akhtar Mengal, president of his faction of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) and a former chief minister, offered a sharp contrast to the government’s assurances. “I have never seen such a dangerous situation in my entire life,” Mr Mengal said in a statement posted on the social media platform X. Mr Mengal, a member of the National Assembly, stated with “full conviction” that no tribal chief could enter his own area without fear of militant attacks. He called this a reality that should deeply alarm everyone, stressing that the security situation was “completely out of control”. He added: “We take no pleasure in seeing our land burn.” The BNP-M chief attributed the crisis to “hatred, oppression and the misuse of power” that, he said, had continued over the past three years. He argued that instead of heeding warnings, the government had funded propaganda against those trying to resolve the province’s issues. “If the government were to stop funding private media channels to propagate against him and others genuinely striving to address Balochistan’s issues, it could help foster at least a modest sense of security,” he said. “Everyone knew this day would come, but no one chose to listen,” Mr Mengal said, criticising federal institutions for “blindly” repeating the narrative that no problem existed.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: While maintaining the price of petrol for the next fortnight, the government has increased the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs11.30 per litre. The announcement by the Petroleum Division said the new prices had been set on the recommendations of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra). The price of HSD for the next fortnight, up to Feb 15, has been fixed at Rs268.38 per litre, compared to Rs257.08 during the previous 15 days. The increase has been made due “to higher crude oil prices over the past week amid regional tensions and an order by the US president to deploy a US Navy strike group to the Persian Gulf”. This development alone pushed up HSD prices in Arab and other international markets. As HSD is a key fuel for the industrial and business sectors and is widely used by trucks, buses and large generators, a strong reaction from the business community is expected over the Rs11.30 per litre increase. The price of petrol, consumed mainly by cars, mot­orcycles and small generators, has been kept unc­h­anged at Rs253.17 per litre. Due to the rise in HSD prices, jet fuel rates have also been increased slightly for the next fortnight. Meanwhile, despite the politically tense global environment, the US Energy Information Administration has forecast Brent crude prices to average lower in 2026 and 2027, driven by global production exceeding demand. International analysts have predicted that global production of liquid fuels will increase by 1.4 million barrels per day in 2026 due to higher production. LPG Ogra has also notified new prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for the month of February, showing an increase due to higher winter demand in global markets. The LPG consumer price has been increased by Rs6.37 per kg to Rs226.05 per kg for February, compared to Rs219.67 in January. The LPG producer price is linked to the Saudi Aramco contract price and the dollar exchange rate. Compared to the previous month, the Saudi Aramco contract price has increased by 3.83 per cent, while the average dollar exchange rate has declined marginally by 0.14pc, resulting in an increase of Rs75.71 per 11.8kg cylinder.

Compared to the previous month, the Saudi Aramco contract price has increased by 3.83 per cent, while the average dollar exchange rate has declined marginally by 0.14pc, resulting in an increase of Rs75.71 per 11.8kg cylinder.
