      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi arrives at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.—Reuters • Clarification follows concerns expressed by Imran’s son Kasim; Rana Sanaullah also dismisses reports of ex-PM’s transfer to another prison • KP CM Afridi stages sit-in outside jail after eighth snub at Adiala ISLAMABAD: As reports about PTI chief Imran Khan’s ill health swirled on social and foreign media, both government and PTI figures dismissed such speculation on Thursday, saying the former prime minister — currently held in isolation — was doing well. The clarification came when PTI activists staged a sit-in outside Adiala jail after authorities did not allow Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to meet the incarcerated party leader for the eighth time since he assumed office. His sisters and legal team were not allowed to meet Imran, either. The lack of access to Mr Khan also gave rise to unconfirmed reports about his ill health and transfer to a high-security prison — which were picked up by a Japanese newspaper and the BBC. ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trended on X on Thursday morning. In a statement shared by the PTI, Imran’s son Kasim Khan also called on the international community and global human rights organisations to intervene and “demand proof of life, enforce court-ordered access, end this inhumane isolation” faced by his father. Against this backdrop, Rana Sanaullah, who advises the PM on political affairs, told ARY News that Mr Khan was fine and his health was being taken care of. “There is a team of doctors that checks him on a weekly and daily basis [and looks after his] medicine, diet, facilities [and] exercises.” He said Mr Khan was getting everything befitting his position and status, adding that the PTI chief was still present in Adiala jail. PTI leader Ali Zafar also dismissed reports about Imran Khan’s health in a DawnNewsTV show. “Thank God, the news is baseless, but it is even more important after this report that the government immediately allow us the opportunity of a meeting so we can go and see ourselves,” said the PTI leader, adding that once a meeting was held, they could come out and tell everyone that everything was fine. “We think it is very necessary that a meeting is facilitated with Imran; it’s been a month,” he added. “There were news reports about Imran Khan, news from India and Afghanistan, attempts were made to spread discord; these reports have been denied. The government cannot harm Imran Khan,” said PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram while talking to Dawn. Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, in an appearance on Geo News , stated that jail officials had already provided information on Imran’s health. Senate protest On the other hand, the PTI staged a noisy protest against the alleged mistreatment meted out to the former prime minister. The issue was raised in the House by PTI lawmaker Faisal Javed soon after the question hour. He claimed that Mr Khan had been kept in solitary confinement and regretted that nobody, including his family members, lawyers and doctors, was allowed to see him. “This is against basic human rights, court orders, the jail manual and prison rules,” he remarked. Minister of State for Interior Talal Cha­udhry, in his response, described Imran Khan as a VIP prisoner enjoying the facilities of exercise machines and a personal cook. He said meetings with a prisoner are regulated under the jail manual. CM stages sit-in Meanwhile, a sit-in led by KP CM Afridi continued outside Adiala jail. Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Mehmood Khan Achakzai also joined the protest on Thursday night to show solidarity with the CM. Mr Achakzai said more sit-ins would be held across the country and “after that people will govern the country”. “It is unfortunate that the CM of a province is sitting outside the jail. MNAs and senators were not being allowed to meet Imran Khan,” he said. The KP chief minister, who replaced Ali Amin Gandapur last month, had arrived in Rawalpindi in the morning to meet Imran Khan, but the jail administration did not allow him to proceed. The CM and party supporters originally intended to march to the prison, where Imran Khan is incarcerated, but were stopped by a heavy contingent of police officials at the ‘factory naaka’. The CM asked the officials to inform him in writing regarding the decision to bar him from meeting the incarcerated former premier despite the court orders, but his request was declined. Amid uncertainty surrounding the health of Mr Khan, CM Afridi later told reporters that he wanted to meet Mr Khan to get “actual information” from him and share it with the nation. He said he had exhausted all legal and political avenues in his attempts to gain access to the PTI leader. Published in Dawn, November 28th, 2025",

According to statements issued by the High Commission, the debate centred on the motion “This House Believes India’s Policy Towards Pakistan is a Populist Strategy Sold as Security Policy” had been confirmed weeks in advance. It is scheduled for 12:30am PKT. Pakistan’s delegation, comprising former Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee chairman Lt Gen (R) Zubair Mahmood Hayat, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and former diplomat Dr Mohammad Faisal, was already in London for the event. The High Commission claimed that India’s originally announced speakers, General M.M. Naravane, Dr Subramanian Swamy and politician Sachin Pilot, “withdrew at the eleventh hour”, leaving the event without its opposing panel. It further alleged that India later proposed “obscure and low-profile replacements” that did not match the level of the Pakistani delegation and “undermined the credibility and balance of the debate.” “The collective retreat of the Indian delegation amounted to an unchallenged victory for Pakistan,” the High Commission stated, adding that India’s withdrawal “exposed the weakness of its narrative on a neutral academic platform”. Sources familiar with the matter told Dawn that the last-minute shift was “very bizarre”, noting that such debates were typically finalised far in advance and that delegations typically agreed knowing who they were debating. While the High Commission criticised what it described as India’s reluctance to face open questioning, many on social media questioned the reason behind India’s withdrawal, speculating that it may have been pressure from the Indian government on the panellists.",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) has condemned the attack which claimed the lives of three Chinese workers in Tajikistan, saying that the use of armed drones in the incident underlined the “gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it”. Tajik authorities said on Thursday that three Chinese workers in Tajikistan were killed in an attack launched from Afghanistan near the border. The foreign ministry said a drone and firearm attack hit workers of a Chinese company in the country’s south. “The attack, carried out with firearms and a drone loaded with grenades, claimed the lives of three employees of Chinese nationality,” it said in a statement. Dushanbe rarely comments officially on such incidents, and it did not say who it suspects carried out the attack. Subsequently, the FO, in a statement issued early on Friday, expressed Pakistan’s condolences and solidarity with China and Tajikistan over the lives lost in a “heinous terrorist attack in Tajikistan near its border with Afghanistan”. “Pakistan unequivocally condemns this cowardly attack on Chinese nationals. The use of armed drones in the incident underlines the gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it,” the FO said. “As a neighbour that has repeatedly suffered terrorist attacks orchestrated from Afghan soil, the people of Pakistan fully understand and share the grief and anguish of our Chinese friends and Tajik partners,” it said. “Pakistan has consistently stressed that Afghan territory must not be used for terrorism against its neighbours or any other country. The repeated use of Afghan soil by terrorist elements and their continued presence under the patronage of the Afghan Taliban regime, is a matter of serious concern for the entire region and the wider international community,” it said. It added that concrete and verifiable action against the perpetrators, abettors, facilitators and financiers of terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil was the only way to address “this growing menace”. “Pakistan will continue to work closely with China, Tajikistan and other regional partners to promote peace, stability and security in our shared neighbourhood,” the FO said. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. Last week, Denmark, in the capacity of the chair of the UN Security Council ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, pointed to the “serious threat” posed by the TTP in Central and South Asia and said that the terror outfit was receiving “logistical and substantial support” from the de facto Afghan authorities. Meanwhile, Muslim-majority Tajikistan, one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union, has been concerned about possible flare-ups in extremism since the Taliban returned to power in 2021. Militants are active in the mountainous border region, which spans around 1,350 kilometres between the two countries. Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, in power since 1992, is openly critical of the Taliban and urged the group to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks, estimated to make up around a quarter of Afghanistan’s 40-million population. At the same time, Tajikistan has cautiously engaged in some areas, including through diplomatic meetings, the opening of markets in border towns and supplying electricity. Tajikistan’s foreign ministry said on Thursday, “Criminal groups located in the neighbouring country (Afghanistan) continue to commit acts aimed at destabilising the situation in the border regions.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A plea asking the Federal Cons­titutional Court (FCC) to strike down the very law that brought it into being, i.e. the 27th Constitutional Amen­dment , was filed before the newly established court on Thursday. “It is most respectively prayed that this petition may kindly be accepted and the 27th Amendment passed with ‘malicious design’ may kindly be struck down in the larger interest of justice,” read the petition, which was moved by Advocate Muhammad Shoaib in person. Earlier on Nov 11, former chief justice Jawwad S. Khawaja challenged the 27th Amendment before the Supreme Court, seeking a direction that the court retains exclusive jurisdiction to determine the vires and constitutionality of the proposed amendment. At the time, the FCC did not exist as the amendment in question had not yet been approved by parliament. Similar pleas have been filed before high courts and the Federal Shariat Court, but this is the first time the FCC has been approached to strike down the law that created it in the first place. ‘One-man rule’ Filed under Article 175E of the Constitution, the fresh petition argued that the 27th Amendment was allegedly passed by a “puppet regime” with a “malicious design to establish one-man rule” in Pakistan by undermining the Constitution. “When the country was passing through a constitutional crisis with the law and order situation deteriorating day by day, the government tabled the 27th Amendment in parliament with the objective of undermining the independence of the judiciary in a mala fide manner,” the petitioner claimed. The petition said that the establishment of the FCC, by allegedly curtailing the powers of the SC under the garb of the 27th Amendment, was against the fundamental principles enshrined in the original provisions of the 1973 Constitution. It further claimed that the federal government was being exploited by certain individuals for the purpose of their vested interests, whereas parliament had been used as rubber-stamp just to implement the whims of powerful. It contended that the country was going through a “power-sharing crisis”, where one institution was overwhelming the powers of the others. It added that the country was being governed through an indirect martial law, which had camouflaged the entire system and thus “disgracing the green book”. ‘Constitutional crisis’ The petition pleaded that the amendment would create institutional incoherence amounting to a constitutional crisis, as all powers would be concentrated in the hands of a single individual. “This flagrant violation of the constitution by the government amounted to mockery of the parliament and the judicial system of the country,” the petition argued. It added that granting immunity to the highest officials of the country from all criminal liability was a clear violation of Article 227 of the Constitution, which ordains that no law will be enacted in contravention of the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah. Likewise, the introduction of Articles 175E and 185 of the Constitution would create a clash, as a parallel appellate system has been introduced, with one set of appeals to be filed before the SC and another before the FCCP, the plea read. The petition argued that this amounted to a violation of natural justice, adding that the judiciary was the custodian of the rights of the people. “Therefore, the FCCP should play its role by striking down the 27th Amendment in the interest of justice,” it added.

      "summary_orig": "• LHCBA petition wants ICAs ‘restored to their original forum’ • Says 27th Amendment ‘unlawful, undermining judiciary’ • Fears parliament can ‘abolish or replace forum for constitutional adjudication at will’ if permitted ISLAMABAD: The Lah­ore High Court Bar Asso­ciation (LHCBA) on Thur­sday filed an application before the Federal Consti­tution Court (FCC), requ­esting that the pending intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the May 7, 2025 judgement on military trials of civilians be returned to the Supreme Court. The application has been moved under Order 35, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, which the FCC has adopted for the time being until it frames its own rules. On June 13, the LHCBA and the Lahore Bar Asso­ciation filed ICAs before the SC, seeking to revisit and set aside the May 7, 2025 judgement on the military trials of civilians. These appeals were filed through senior counsel Hamid Khan. In addition, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Jawwad S. Khawaja and senior lawyer Barr­ister Aitzaz Ahsan also filed similar ICAs, highlighting that if the May 7 verdict was not overturned, it would serve as a constant reminder of the judiciary ceding its space to the executive by accepting that the latter could act as judges to try civilians in criminal cases. On May 7, a five-judge Constitutional Bench of the SC restored key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow for the trial of civilians in military courts. The court ruled by a five-two majority in favour of overturning its earlier decision on Oct 23, 2023, in which a previous five-judge bench had held that the military trials of civilians involved in the May 9 , 2023 acts of arson and attacks on military installations was illegal and unconstitutional. Except for Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afg­han, who dissented from the majority verdict, the detailed reasoning of the majority judgement has yet to be issued. ‘Without lawful authority’ The fresh application pleaded that the pending appeals should be retu­r­ned to their original forum — the SC — as both the purported transfer and the 27th Consti­tutional Amen­dment itself were without lawful authority, unconstitutional, and non-est. The application contended that the 27th Ame­ndment was in violation of the salient and essential features of the Constitution, stating that the 1973 Constitution defined the powers of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. “While parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it does not function as a constituent assembly and is subject to both express and implied limitations,” it added. The application pointed out that the jurisprudence of the SC — most recently the authoritative 17-member judgement in the Rawalpindi District Bar Association case — had affirmed that parliament could not, through any amendment, alter or abrogate the salient or essential features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary. The application pleaded that both the 26th and 27th amendments impermissibly encroached upon judicial independence and restructured the constitutional architecture in a manner inconsistent with these unamendable features. Therefore, they constituted an invalid exercise of amendatory power. It argued that a constitutional amendment, which undermined judicial independence while simultaneously divesting pre-existing constitutional courts of jurisdiction to examine its validity, violated fundamental constitutional principles. “If permitted, parliament can abolish or replace the forum for constitutional adjudication at will, thereby insulating unconstitutional amendments from judicial scrutiny,” the plea feared. The application further noted that the SC had consistently distinguished betw­een “jurisdiction” and “judicial power”. “Even where parliament modifies jurisdiction, judicial power — i.e. the authority to determine whether jurisdiction exists — remains inherent in the superior judiciary,” it read. “Accordingly, notwithstanding the 27th Amendment, it lies within the judicial power of the SC to determine whether it has been validly divested of jurisdiction. The subject appeal must therefore be restored to the SC for that purpose.” The application maintained that the FCC could not adjudicate upon its own validity, since it was a creation solely of the 27th Amendment. “It is therefore legally precluded from pronouncing upon the validity of the amendment, as such adjudication would determine the legality of its own existence,” it added. “This principle is affirmed in the Sabir Shah case and earlier jurisprudence, which hold that a forum cannot declare unconstitutional the very instrument that constitutes it.” The application also highlighted that the pending appeals did not fall within Articles 175E or 175F, as they were filed under Section 5 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023. “The 27th Amendment neither amends that statute nor addresses statutory appeals filed thereunder,” it added. “Article 175F(2) applies only to proceedings ‘falling under this Article’. Since the present appeal was not instituted under Articles 175E or 175F, its transfer to the FCC is without legal effect.” Published in Dawn, November 28th, 2025",

The court ruled by a five-two majority in favour of overturning its earlier decision on Oct 23, 2023, in which a previous five-judge bench had held that the military trials of civilians involved in the May 9 , 2023 acts of arson and attacks on military installations was illegal and unconstitutional. Except for Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afg­han, who dissented from the majority verdict, the detailed reasoning of the majority judgement has yet to be issued. ‘Without lawful authority’ The fresh application pleaded that the pending appeals should be retu­r­ned to their original forum — the SC — as both the purported transfer and the 27th Consti­tutional Amen­dment itself were without lawful authority, unconstitutional, and non-est. The application contended that the 27th Ame­ndment was in violation of the salient and essential features of the Constitution, stating that the 1973 Constitution defined the powers of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary. “While parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it does not function as a constituent assembly and is subject to both express and implied limitations,” it added. The application pointed out that the jurisprudence of the SC — most recently the authoritative 17-member judgement in the Rawalpindi District Bar Association case — had affirmed that parliament could not, through any amendment, alter or abrogate the salient or essential features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary. The application pleaded that both the 26th and 27th amendments impermissibly encroached upon judicial independence and restructured the constitutional architecture in a manner inconsistent with these unamendable features. Therefore, they constituted an invalid exercise of amendatory power. It argued that a constitutional amendment, which undermined judicial independence while simultaneously divesting pre-existing constitutional courts of jurisdiction to examine its validity, violated fundamental constitutional principles. “If permitted, parliament can abolish or replace the forum for constitutional adjudication at will, thereby insulating unconstitutional amendments from judicial scrutiny,” the plea feared. The application further noted that the SC had consistently distinguished betw­een “jurisdiction” and “judicial power”. “Even where parliament modifies jurisdiction, judicial power — i.e. the authority to determine whether jurisdiction exists — remains inherent in the superior judiciary,” it read. “Accordingly, notwithstanding the 27th Amendment, it lies within the judicial power of the SC to determine whether it has been validly divested of jurisdiction. The subject appeal must therefore be restored to the SC for that purpose.” The application maintained that the FCC could not adjudicate upon its own validity, since it was a creation solely of the 27th Amendment. “It is therefore legally precluded from pronouncing upon the validity of the amendment, as such adjudication would determine the legality of its own existence,” it added. “This principle is affirmed in the Sabir Shah case and earlier jurisprudence, which hold that a forum cannot declare unconstitutional the very instrument that constitutes it.” The application also highlighted that the pending appeals did not fall within Articles 175E or 175F, as they were filed under Section 5 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023. “The 27th Amendment neither amends that statute nor addresses statutory appeals filed thereunder,” it added. “Article 175F(2) applies only to proceedings ‘falling under this Article’. Since the present appeal was not instituted under Articles 175E or 175F, its transfer to the FCC is without legal effect.” Published in Dawn, November 28th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has initiated legal action, through the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), against those involved in spreading fabricated information on social media regarding the offloading of passengers. Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway. According to sources, more than 15 such social media accounts have initially been found to be involved in spreading baseless propaganda and hatred against provinces. It has been learned that the FIA has initiated action by identifying social media accounts spreading fabricated information. Legal action is being taken through the NCCIA under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, against those involved in the baseless propaganda. According to FIA officials, some elements were sharing fake and misleading posts regarding the offloading of passengers, aimed at damaging the institution’s reputation and creating concern among the public. They added that the FIA Immigration Wing does not offload passengers who have complete documents and a legitimate reason for travel at any airport in the country. Passengers with incomplete or fake travel documents are offloaded. Those who provide suspicious or unclear information, as well as those suspected of being influenced by human traffickers or illegal agents, are also offloaded. In the past, strict action was taken against individuals with a history of illegal activities or problematic travel records, added the officials. The FIA officials made it clear that the public should not be overly concerned about the matter. Rather, they should stay away from illegal agents and always travel with complete and verified documents. They advised that in case of a complaint, the public should contact the deputy director of the FIA Immigration Wing or its helpline at 1991. Earlier today, the agency clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers. In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”. “All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”.",

      "summary_orig": "The man suspected of shooting two National Guard soldiers near the White House on Wednesday was an Afghan national who worked alongside US forces in Afghanistan, US media reported. Washington has labeled the violence an “act of terror” and announced increased oversight of foreigners who entered the United States from Afghanistan in recent years. What we know about the suspected shooter Multiple media outlets, including CNN , The New York Times , CBS and NBC identified the man as 29-year old Rahmanullah Lakanwal and say he arrived in America in 2021. A relative of Lakanwal told NBC that he arrived after serving in the Afghan army for 10 years in support of US Special Forces. The relative told NBC that Lakanwal originally came from Afghanistan’s southeastern Khost province and had spent some of his military service at a base in the southern province of Kandahar. Kandahar is the birthplace of the Taliban and was the center of heavy fighting during the 20-year war between the then-insurgents and foreign-backed forces. 2021 arrival US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the suspected shooter “was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome.” She said the Afghan national, whom she did not name, entered the United States on September 8, 2021, less than a month after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban. US President Donald Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban in February 2020 to pave the way for the significant drawdown of US troops in Afghanistan by the end of that year – though the timeline was pushed back and conducted under the subsequent Biden administration. ‘Operation Allies Welcome’ Shortly after the Taliban took over Kabul on August 15, 2021, and as US forces withdrew, then-president Joe Biden introduced “Operation Allies Welcome” to coordinate efforts across the multiple government agencies resettling Afghans, including those who worked with US forces. At the time, more than 40 percent of Afghans included in the program were eligible for “Special Immigrant Visa” (SIVs) for those who took “significant risks to support our military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan” on behalf of the US government in Afghanistan, as well as their family members. Other vulnerable groups, such as advocates and journalists, also entered the US under the program. Authorities have not confirmed whether Lakanwal received an SIV. Those who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome received security vetting from several government agencies, including the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center. The Biden administration renamed the efforts in September 2022 “Enduring Welcome” (EW) to signify a pivot to a long-term strategy that would focus on helping Afghans obtain more durable, long-term legal status, primarily through the SIV program or the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Mass evacuations During the turbulent US withdrawal from Afghanistan that saw Kabul’s airport deteriorate into chaos as thousands tried to evacuate, Biden pledged his administration would find a way out for those who helped the US. Hundreds of thousands of Afghans worked for foreign forces and embassies and joined US-funded NGOs throughout the 20-year foreign presence. Many feared that made them a target for violence, including by the Taliban. The United Nations has reported extrajudicial killings and disappearances of former Afghan officials under the Taliban authorities, despite them declaring an amnesty against former enemies. More than 190,000 Afghans have been resettled to the United States through EW and its predecessor Operation Allies Welcome since the Taliban takeover, according to the US State Department. Tens of thousands more, including many former military translators and members of the Afghan security forces, are in the pipeline for resettlement, according to advocacy groups. In June, Trump declared a sweeping new travel ban on 12 countries, including Afghanistan, which complicated matters, according to Shawn VanDiver, the president of the AfghanEvac non-profit group. VanDiver said it was especially hard for some 12,000 people awaiting reunification with family members already living in the United States.",

      "summary_en": "The man suspected of shooting two National Guard soldiers near the White House on Wednesday was an Afghan national who worked alongside US forces in Afghanistan, US media reported. Washington has labeled the violence an “act of terror” and announced increased oversight of foreigners who entered the United States from Afghanistan in recent years. What we know about the suspected shooter Multiple media outlets, including CNN , The New York Times , CBS and NBC identified the man as 29-year old Rahmanullah Lakanwal and say he arrived in America in 2021. A relative of Lakanwal told NBC that he arrived after serving in the Afghan army for 10 years in support of US Special Forces. The relative told NBC that Lakanwal originally came from Afghanistan’s southeastern Khost province and had spent some of his military service at a base in the southern province of Kandahar. Kandahar is the birthplace of the Taliban and was the center of heavy fighting during the 20-year war between the then-insurgents and foreign-backed forces. 2021 arrival US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said the suspected shooter “was one of the many unvetted, mass paroled into the United States under Operation Allies Welcome.” She said the Afghan national, whom she did not name, entered the United States on September 8, 2021, less than a month after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban. US President Donald Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban in February 2020 to pave the way for the significant drawdown of US troops in Afghanistan by the end of that year – though the timeline was pushed back and conducted under the subsequent Biden administration. ‘Operation Allies Welcome’ Shortly after the Taliban took over Kabul on August 15, 2021, and as US forces withdrew, then-president Joe Biden introduced “Operation Allies Welcome” to coordinate efforts across the multiple government agencies resettling Afghans, including those who worked with US forces. At the time, more than 40 percent of Afghans included in the program were eligible for “Special Immigrant Visa” (SIVs) for those who took “significant risks to support our military and civilian personnel in Afghanistan” on behalf of the US government in Afghanistan, as well as their family members. Other vulnerable groups, such as advocates and journalists, also entered the US under the program. Authorities have not confirmed whether Lakanwal received an SIV. Those who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome received security vetting from several government agencies, including the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center. The Biden administration renamed the efforts in September 2022 “Enduring Welcome” (EW) to signify a pivot to a long-term strategy that would focus on helping Afghans obtain more durable, long-term legal status, primarily through the SIV program or the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). Mass evacuations During the turbulent US withdrawal from Afghanistan that saw Kabul’s airport deteriorate into chaos as thousands tried to evacuate, Biden pledged his administration would find a way out for those who helped the US. Hundreds of thousands of Afghans worked for foreign forces and embassies and joined US-funded NGOs throughout the 20-year foreign presence. Many feared that made them a target for violence, including by the Taliban.

Needing 10 off the last six balls with three wickets in hand, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha (unbeaten 63 off 44) could only manage a single and watch helplessly as Faheem Ashraf (seven) holed out to long-on and Mohammad Wasim blocked the final perfect yorker. A packed house fell silent as Sri Lanka clinched victory and stormed into the Saturday final. Pakistan were reeling at 43 for 4 in the sixth over after Chameera removed Sahibzada Farhan (nine) and Babar Azam (zero) in the space of three deliveries and young pacer Eshan Malinga rattled Saim Ayub’s (27 off 18) stumps. From that precarious position, Salman and Usman Khan (33 off 23) launched a spirited counter-attack, adding 56 for the fifth wicket and keeping the asking rate in sight. Usman fell trying one big shot too many against Wanindu Hasaranga (1-27), but Mohammad Nawaz (27 off 16) joined his skipper to raise Pakistan’s hopes again. The pair smashed 70 in just 36 balls for the sixth wicket, with Nawaz clubbing two sixes and Salman bringing up a classy fifty. When Nawaz skied one to long-off with 22 needed off 12, the equation still looked gettable. However, Chameera — who finished with superb figures of 4-20 — returned to dismiss Faheem in the penultimate over and then sealed the game with ice-cool execution under pressure. Pakistan’s chase had begun confidently with Sahibzada and Saim adding 28 in the first three overs. But Chameera’s double strike in the fourth over — Sahibzada caught at cover and Babar trapped plumb in front — triggered a familiar top-order wobble. Saim’s flamboyant 27 ended when Malinga (2-54) dragged one back to crash into off-stump, and when Fakhar Zaman (one) miscued to midwicket, Pakistan were staring at another collapse. Salman, though, stood firm. Elegant drives were followed by audacious ramps and inside-out lofts as he carried the fight almost single-handedly. His unbeaten 63 — laced with four fours and three sixes — ensured Pakistan took it to the final delivery, but it proved just short. Earlier, Kamil Mishara’s scintillating 76 off 48 balls — studded with six fours and three sixes — formed the backbone of Sri Lanka’s imposing 184 for 5. Put in to bat by Pakistan, Sri Lanka lost Pathum Nissanka early to a beauty from Salman Mirza, but Kusal Mendis (40 off 23) and the 23-year-old Mishara added a brisk 66 for the second wicket to wrest the initiative. Even after Mendis fell lbw to a straighter one from leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed, Mishara continued to dominate, reaching his fifty in style with an inside-out six off part-timer Saim. Pakistan’s bowlers struggled to contain the flow of runs on a batting-friendly surface. Wasim and Faheem proved expensive, while Abrar (2-28) was the pick of the attack with his clever variations. A late flourish from Dasun Shanaka (17 off 10) and a run-out off the final ball — Shanaka stranded after a mix-up with Janith Liyanage (24 not out) — pushed Sri Lanka past 180, a total that looked unlikely during a brief mid-innings wobble. Sri Lanka raced to 58 without loss in the six-over powerplay, with Mendis particularly severe on anything short. The wicket of Nissanka — bowled by a clever slower cutter from Salman — briefly applied the brakes, but Mendis and Mishara ensured the scoring rate never dipped below nine an over. Abrar provided Pakistan their second breakthrough when he trapped Mendis in front with one that skidded straight, ending a dazzling knock that contained six fours and a six. Kusal Perera’s struggle continued as he holed out to backward point off Saim for a labored six, leaving Sri Lanka 96 for 3 in the 11th over. Mishara, however, refused to allow Pakistan any breathing space. He switch-hit Abrar for six, lofted Nawaz over long-on and punished anything short or wide with disdain. His dismissal in the 17th over — skying a slog-sweep to long-on off Abrar — finally gave Pakistan some relief, but by then the damage was done. Liyanage and Shanaka added 31 in quick time for the fifth wicket. Shanaka’s cameo included two towering sixes and two crunching fours, though his innings ended in unfortunate fashion when a desperate second run off the last ball resulted in a run-out, Babar’s direct hit from midwicket finding him well short.",

      "title_orig": "Sindh Assembly rejects Indian defence minister’s ‘delusional’ remarks on province as attempt to distort history",
      "summary_orig": "The Sindh Assembly on Thursday rejected the remarks of India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh regarding the province as “delusional” and said they were a deliberate attempt to distort history. On Sunday, Singh said that “civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India”, and that “who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again”. His words were strongly rebuked by the Foreign Office as “dangerously revisionist remarks” that revealed an expansionist Hindutva mindset. The Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution today, stating that the House “unequivocally condemns the Defence Minister of India’s statement as delusional, inflammatory, and a deliberate distortion of history, made in violation of diplomatic norms and international law”. The resolution, moved by Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla, said the assembly asserted “with absolute clarity that Sindh is, and will forever remain, an inseparable and integral part” of Pakistan, and rejected any narrative, however absurd, which suggested otherwise. The lawmakers rejected “with full force all revisionist, expansionist, and politically motivated claims emanating from India that attempt to rewrite the history of Sindh, Pakistan, or the movement for independence”. It further condemned the extremist policies of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government that “threaten regional peace, undermine civilisational heritage, weaponise water resources, and endanger the environmental security of millions”. The resolution also called upon the government to “pursue decisive diplomatic, legal, and multilateral action to protect the Indus River, defend Pakistan’s rights under international treaties, and hold India accountable for violations of water, environmental, or humanitarian norms”. New Delhi unilaterally held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in April this year based on unsubstantiated claims regarding the Pahalgam attack, which were strongly refuted by Islamabad. A Sydney-based think-tank warned last month that India could manipulate river flows in the near term, presenting an “acute” danger for Pakistan. In its resolution, the House expressed “firm solidarity with all communities, within Pakistan and across India, who respect the sanctity of the Indus, reject extremism and revisionism, and uphold the principles of justice, coexistence, and peace”. The resolution presented by Chawla noted that Sindh was an “ancient civilisation with its own enduring identity, culture, a political consciousness, rooted in history far older and deeper than any modern state”. It highlighted that the “people of Sindh, asserting their right to autonomy and dignity, chose in 1936 to separate from the Bombay Presidency , long before the creation of Pakistan, thereby demonstrating a clear and unequivocal will for self-governance”. “Sindh was the first province to adopt the historic resolution in favour of the creation of Pakistan, playing a decisive and irreplaceable role in the establishment of the nation envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,” it stated. The House described statements made by senior members of the Modi government as not only “historically baseless but also reflect a reckless, provocative, and revisionist agenda aimed at distorting facts and destabilising the region”. “The people of Sindh, the people of Pakistan, and all fair-minded citizens of India reject such destructive policies and recognise the Indus as a sacred, life-giving artery of our collective civilisation,” it added. The resolution stated: “The Modi government has overseen the gravest aggression against the Indus River in recorded history — an act that constitutes a violation of international laws and a breach of the Indus Waters Treaty, and an assault on the very ecological civilisational foundations of South Asia. “An attack on the Indus River is an attack on a shared civilisation and millions of livelihoods, and on the cultural and environmental heritage that binds the region together,” it added. The National Assembly later passed a similar resolution by PPP MNA Asad Alam Niazi denouncing the remarks. “These statements are historically incorrect, politically irresponsible and contrary to the recognised geopolitical realities of the Indo-Pak region. The House reaffirms that Sindh is an integral part of the sovereign State of Pakistan and urges all individuals and institutions to refrain from making misleading, biased and destabilising statements,” it reads. CM Murad urges Centre to raise issue on int’l level During the assembly session, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah delivered a strong speech, condemning Singh’s statements and demanding that the federal government raise the issue at the international level. “We demand from the Centre through this resolution that the Government of Pakistan raise this matter before the world,” he said. “The Government of Pakistan should send this resolution to the world and tell them that India wants to occupy the Sindh River,” the chief minister added. Reaffirming the province’s loyalty, he declared: “Sindh is a part of Pakistan and will always remain so, and its boundaries can not be changed.” CM Murad stressed that the international community must be informed of India’s aggressive actions and statements. Following his speech, the resolution against the Indian defence minister’s remarks was unanimously approved by the Sindh Assembly. The chief minister labelled Singh as panicked. “He is suffering from a state of perplexity. India’s panic began after [a specified event]. “The Indian defence minister was born in Uttar Pradesh. He has never drunk the water of Sindhu (Indus), and that is why his mind is corrupted,” Murad quipped, accusing India of attempting to weaponise the river. Emphasising the historical and cultural significance of Sindh, the chief minister said, “The impression given by the defence minister of India is deplorable.” He highlighted Sindh’s ancient history, noting its existence even before the Common Era. “The resolution that was presented narrates the entire history,” he pointed out. “Multan and Makran were included in the ancient maps of Sindh,” he added. CM Murad highlighted the contributions of Sindhi leaders to the nation’s founding. “The Muslim League Sindh Chapter presented the Pakistan Resolution,” he said, adding that Pakistan was formed “due to the sacrifices of our elders”.

His words were strongly rebuked by the Foreign Office as “dangerously revisionist remarks” that revealed an expansionist Hindutva mindset. The Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution today, stating that the House “unequivocally condemns the Defence Minister of India’s statement as delusional, inflammatory, and a deliberate distortion of history, made in violation of diplomatic norms and international law”. The resolution, moved by Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla, said the assembly asserted “with absolute clarity that Sindh is, and will forever remain, an inseparable and integral part” of Pakistan, and rejected any narrative, however absurd, which suggested otherwise. The lawmakers rejected “with full force all revisionist, expansionist, and politically motivated claims emanating from India that attempt to rewrite the history of Sindh, Pakistan, or the movement for independence”. It further condemned the extremist policies of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government that “threaten regional peace, undermine civilisational heritage, weaponise water resources, and endanger the environmental security of millions”. The resolution also called upon the government to “pursue decisive diplomatic, legal, and multilateral action to protect the Indus River, defend Pakistan’s rights under international treaties, and hold India accountable for violations of water, environmental, or humanitarian norms”. New Delhi unilaterally held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in April this year based on unsubstantiated claims regarding the Pahalgam attack, which were strongly refuted by Islamabad. A Sydney-based think-tank warned last month that India could manipulate river flows in the near term, presenting an “acute” danger for Pakistan. In its resolution, the House expressed “firm solidarity with all communities, within Pakistan and across India, who respect the sanctity of the Indus, reject extremism and revisionism, and uphold the principles of justice, coexistence, and peace”. The resolution presented by Chawla noted that Sindh was an “ancient civilisation with its own enduring identity, culture, a political consciousness, rooted in history far older and deeper than any modern state”. It highlighted that the “people of Sindh, asserting their right to autonomy and dignity, chose in 1936 to separate from the Bombay Presidency , long before the creation of Pakistan, thereby demonstrating a clear and unequivocal will for self-governance”. “Sindh was the first province to adopt the historic resolution in favour of the creation of Pakistan, playing a decisive and irreplaceable role in the establishment of the nation envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,” it stated. The House described statements made by senior members of the Modi government as not only “historically baseless but also reflect a reckless, provocative, and revisionist agenda aimed at distorting facts and destabilising the region”. “The people of Sindh, the people of Pakistan, and all fair-minded citizens of India reject such destructive policies and recognise the Indus as a sacred, life-giving artery of our collective civilisation,” it added. The resolution stated: “The Modi government has overseen the gravest aggression against the Indus River in recorded history — an act that constitutes a violation of international laws and a breach of the Indus Waters Treaty, and an assault on the very ecological civilisational foundations of South Asia. “An attack on the Indus River is an attack on a shared civilisation and millions of livelihoods, and on the cultural and environmental heritage that binds the region together,” it added. The National Assembly later passed a similar resolution by PPP MNA Asad Alam Niazi denouncing the remarks. “These statements are historically incorrect, politically irresponsible and contrary to the recognised geopolitical realities of the Indo-Pak region. The House reaffirms that Sindh is an integral part of the sovereign State of Pakistan and urges all individuals and institutions to refrain from making misleading, biased and destabilising statements,” it reads. CM Murad urges Centre to raise issue on int’l level During the assembly session, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah delivered a strong speech, condemning Singh’s statements and demanding that the federal government raise the issue at the international level. “We demand from the Centre through this resolution that the Government of Pakistan raise this matter before the world,” he said. “The Government of Pakistan should send this resolution to the world and tell them that India wants to occupy the Sindh River,” the chief minister added. Reaffirming the province’s loyalty, he declared: “Sindh is a part of Pakistan and will always remain so, and its boundaries can not be changed.” CM Murad stressed that the international community must be informed of India’s aggressive actions and statements. Following his speech, the resolution against the Indian defence minister’s remarks was unanimously approved by the Sindh Assembly. The chief minister labelled Singh as panicked. “He is suffering from a state of perplexity. India’s panic began after [a specified event]. “The Indian defence minister was born in Uttar Pradesh. He has never drunk the water of Sindhu (Indus), and that is why his mind is corrupted,” Murad quipped, accusing India of attempting to weaponise the river. Emphasising the historical and cultural significance of Sindh, the chief minister said, “The impression given by the defence minister of India is deplorable.” He highlighted Sindh’s ancient history, noting its existence even before the Common Era. “The resolution that was presented narrates the entire history,” he pointed out. “Multan and Makran were included in the ancient maps of Sindh,” he added. CM Murad highlighted the contributions of Sindhi leaders to the nation’s founding. “The Muslim League Sindh Chapter presented the Pakistan Resolution,” he said, adding that Pakistan was formed “due to the sacrifices of our elders”.

      "title_orig": "PTI demands clarification from govt regarding ‘rumours’ about Imran’s health",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI has demanded a clarification from the government regarding recent “rumours” about the health of jailed party founder Imran Khan, calling on authorities to arrange a meeting between the former premier and his family. The development comes as Imran’s sisters have in recent weeks been repeatedly denied a meeting with him, leading them to question the whereabouts of the ex-prime minister and stage sit-ins outside the Adiala jail. Further, several social media accounts on X have shared unverified claims of his death, with Indian media also reporting on the alleged rumours about his health. The trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ was also trending on X on Thursday morning. In a statement issued early on Thursday on X, the party said “rumours of a despicable nature” were being spread from “Afghan and Indian media, and foreign social media accounts” regarding Imran’s health. The party demanded that the “current government and the interior ministry immediately and clearly dismiss and clarify the rumour and immediately arrange a meeting between Imran and his family”. “A formal and transparent statement should be issued on behalf of the state regarding the health, security and current status of Imran,” the party demanded. It further called on the state to investigate those responsible for spreading rumours of a “sensitive nature” and demanded that the “facts be presented before the nation”. The party, in its statement, warned that “the nation will not tolerate any uncertainty regarding the status of its leader (Imran)”. “The government is directly responsible for protecting Imran’s security, human rights and constitutional rights,” the party said. The PTI also vowed to take “every legal and political step to counter these rumours and bring the truth to light”. Meanwhile, PTI leader Meher Bano Qureshi, who is also the daughter of former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said on X that rumours regarding Imran’s health were concerning. “The government is responsible for Khan sahib’s safety and is duty-bound to issue a statement updating the nation. As far as putting an end to these rumours goes, the best, most credible way possible is to allow Khan sahib’s sisters, lawyers and party members to meet with him,” she said. ‘Afghan origin’ claim debunked Separately, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MOIB) debunked “false claims by Afghan and Indian social media alleging that Imran had been killed in jail”. “Anonymous Afghan accounts circulated an unverified rumour that Imran was killed in custody and his body moved. Indian outlets repeated the rumour using two old photos from 2013 and 2022 as ‘fresh evidence’,” the ministry’s official fact-checking cell said on X. It added that “disinformation originated from two Afghan propaganda handles known for fabrications”. “Their posts appeared only 46 minutes apart, a clear indication of a coordinated attempt rather than independent reporting. Both accounts falsely claimed a “Pakistani source” confirmed the death but provided no documentation, proof, or institutional verification,” it said. The account clarified that the photos of Imran used by the accounts, and presented as “fresh evidence”, dated back to 2022 and 2013. The fact-checking account said that the “first image used to support the rumour is actually from 2013, when Imran fell from a forklift stage during an election rally.” “Afghan and Indian networks repurposed this 12-year-old image to imply a recent incident inside jail,” it added. It detailed that “at 12:06pm PKT, Republic TV aired a false claim of ‘PTI supporters storming Adiala Jail”. It added that “within hours”, India’s Republic TV started running the rumour as well, followed by other indian outlets at 3pm — all of whom were “relying on the same two Afghan accounts”. Tracing the origin of the second picture used by the Afghan-origin accounts, the fact-checking account clarified that the picture was from November 4, 2022, from an assassination attempt on Imran in Wazirabad. “This photo predates Imran’s imprisonment and has zero connection to jail or custody,” it said. Elaborating on the Indian media’s role in amplifying the rumour, the account said that “despite PTI representatives telling Indian channels that no such information existed, the rumour was aired repeatedly.” “No journalist, official, hospital, or government agency confirmed any abnormal development,” it said. Citing Republic TV as an example, the account said that indian channels continued to run the rumour as a “possible developing story” despite admitting that the rumour was of Afghan origin. It added that the Indian media also misrepresented the “routine, court-ordered family visitation schedule as ‘suspicious.’ “In reality, jail meetings follow judicial guidelines, not intelligence or law enforcement discretion,” it said. The account noted that the “timing, coordination, and rapid cross-border amplification suggest a deliberate attempt to create unrest within Pakistan.” “The rumour was designed to provoke agitation, fuel anti-state narratives, and manufacture a false sense of instability,” it said. ‘Imran has TV, allowed use of exercise machine in jail’ Earlier on Wednesday, Defence Minister and PML-N leader Khawaja Asif had responded to a video on X in which Imran criticised ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif for demanding amenities while in jail. “He (Imran) himself has a TV in his jail cell … and his food comes from outside,” he claimed. “There are exercise machines available for him as well,” he added. Asif, recalling his own time in prison, said, “We used to sleep on the cold floor and eat the food [prepared] at the jail.” He continued: “It was the month of January, and we had only two blankets, and there was no hot water.” On the other hand, Imran, he alleged, had “a double bed and velvet bedding”, claiming that the jail superintendent personally tended to him. Asif called on the PTI founder to “listen to his own speech on the jail’s loudspeaker,” adding that “he (Imran) should fear God.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The party has previously also raised concerns over the health of Imran, who is 73-years-old.",

The incident, which left two Guard members critically wounded, was “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror,” Trump said. “It was a crime against our entire nation.” He confirmed that the man taken into custody after the daylight shooting two blocks from the White House was “a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan”. The suspect had arrived in the United States in 2021 “on those infamous flights,” Trump said, referring to the evacuations of Afghans fleeing as the Taliban took over the country in the wake of the US retreat after 20 years of war. “We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan” under former president Joe Biden, Trump said. “We must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country if they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.” The Department of Homeland Security identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national. According to CNN, the suspect applied for asylum in 2024, which was granted by the Trump administration in April 2025. Separately, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it had stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely. “The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission,” the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a post on X. Reacting to the incident, former US president Barack Obama said “violence has no place in America”. “Michelle and I are praying for the servicemembers shot in Washington, DC today, and send our love to their families as they enter this holiday season under the most tragic of circumstances,” he said. ‘Targeted shooting’ Trump was in Florida at the time of the attack, which prompted the White House to go into lockdown as law enforcement from multiple federal and city agencies swarmed the area. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called it “a targeted shooting” by a single assailant. “That individual has been taken into custody,” she said. The shooting occurred around 2:15 pm local time, when the two soldiers — a man and a woman — were conducting what authorities described as a “high-visibility patrol”. According to DC Police Executive Assistant Chief Jeffrey Carroll, the attacker rounded a corner, raised a firearm, and “ambushed these members of the National Guard” without warning. Both soldiers were struck multiple times and rushed to local trauma centers, where they remain in critical condition. The suspect was also injured during the encounter. Carroll said investigators were still working to determine whose gunfire wounded him, but confirmed that there were no additional suspects and no ongoing threat. Senior counterterrorism officials confirmed to ABC News that the FBI was examining the shooting as a possible act of international terrorism, and investigators were looking into whether the attack may have been inspired by a foreign militant group. Authorities stressed, however, that no motive had been established. Trump was the first to announce the incident publicly, writing on social media that “the animal that shot the two National Guardsmen” was also severely wounded and would “pay a very steep price”. He praised the National Guard and federal law-enforcement agencies as “truly great people”. Following the shooting, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said the president directed him to deploy an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington “immediately,” saying: “This happened just steps away from the White House. It will not stand.” A brief security lockdown was also imposed at the White House as the situation unfolded, though Trump was not in the capital at the time. “The president has been briefed,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. Confusion briefly erupted when West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued — then retracted — a statement saying the two soldiers had died. His office later said the information was based on “early and conflicting reports”. Unease within Muslim communities A relative of Lakanwal’s told NBC News that the suspect had arrived in the US in September 2021, after serving for 10 years in the Afghan army alongside US Special Forces. According to the relative, Lakanwal spent part of his military service stationed at a base in Kandahar. The relative who spoke to NBC News had also served with him, supporting US troops. “We were the ones targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,” he said. “I cannot believe that he might have done this,” the relative added. Lakanwal came to the US five months after Biden announced the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan. Originally from Khost province, Lakanwal had been living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said. The attack also triggered unease within Muslim communities. “We hope this report is incorrect,” a Muslim political commentator, who declined to be named, told Dawn after initial reports about the nationality of the suspect. “If it turns out to be true, it may trigger a strong backlash against Muslim communities across the United States.” National Guard personnel from several Republican-led states, including West Virginia, have been deployed in Washington since August, when Trump expanded an earlier mission aimed at combating street crime and supporting immigration enforcement initiatives. The soldiers shot on Wednesday were part of that deployment.",

      "summary_orig": "Amid reports regarding the arbitrary offloading of passengers travelling abroad, an official from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Thursday clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers. Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway. In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”. “All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”. However, the FIA officer noted that a lot of people were those “who get deceived by various human smugglers in some way”. Zia detailed that FIA immigration officials at airports check the travel documents of “all those people and profile them”, asserting that no one going abroad for a valid purpose was being stopped. “All those who are denied from going abroad are refused due to them not having valid documents, or if they have permits or visas wherein the companies stated do not exist, and we have suspicions that human smugglers are trapping them and taking them abroad.’’ “We have seen cases where people get deceived by these human smugglers and change their routes mid-transit, or take an accomplice with them in the form of their mother or sister, through which they can exit here with the [safeguard] of an Umrah [visa],” Zia said. He added there had been past cases where such people were deported from other countries, following which the FIA’s Anti-Human Trafficking Cell registers a case, conducts an inquiry and “such human traffickers are brought to a halt”. He urged the public not to be fooled by migrant smugglers . The FIA officer said those networks were negatively portraying the matter to “create unrest” and secure financial gains for themselves. He recalled the Mauritania and Greece boat capsize incidents, saying that innocent people were shown “dreams of Europe” and smuggled out of Pakistan via dunki (illegal land routes) or by transiting in other countries, only to be pressured into handing over exorbitant amounts of cash or even losing their lives. “Not only does Pakistan’s name on an international level get maligned and the value of our green passport declines, but many countries have also created difficulties for us in obtaining visas,” the FIA Lahore director said. Zia assured the public that immigration staff would facilitate all those who were travelling abroad for legitimate reasons with valid documents. The FIA’s Facebook post said “such fabricated content aims to misguide the public and undermine institutional credibility”, and urged citizens to rely only on verified information from official FIA platforms. Earlier this week, BBC Urdu reported that it spoke to some of the offloaded individuals, including a 25-year-old man from Hyderabad who had obtained a work visa for Saudi Arabia. Another person, aged 35, who hailed from Punjab’s Sargodha, was stopped from travelling to Saudi Arabia from Karachi, and later also barred from travelling to Dubai from Lahore for work. A resident of Punjab’s Jhang told BBC Urdu he was offloaded from Karachi as officials questioned why he was using that airport instead of the nearby one in Lahore, the reason for which he said was a cheaper ticket. Earlier this week, it emerged that a number of genuine businessmen and tourists lodged a strong protest against the “harsh policy” to offload even those going for business trips or tourism. Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Ahmed Hassan Mattu told Dawn that he had received several complaints from members of the Gujrat chamber about being offloaded from Lahore, Sialkot and other airports despite having genuine travel documents and recommendation letters. He said that the business fraternity had been very concerned over such a harsh policy of FIA Immigration as genuine businessmen should not be stopped or bothered at the airports. When asked about the reasons of offloading, FIA Gujranwala Zone Director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that there was no harsh policy or new directions issued in this regard of offloading passengers with fake documents or suspicious motives.",

Another person, aged 35, who hailed from Punjab’s Sargodha, was stopped from travelling to Saudi Arabia from Karachi, and later also barred from travelling to Dubai from Lahore for work. A resident of Punjab’s Jhang told BBC Urdu he was offloaded from Karachi as officials questioned why he was using that airport instead of the nearby one in Lahore, the reason for which he said was a cheaper ticket. Earlier this week, it emerged that a number of genuine businessmen and tourists lodged a strong protest against the “harsh policy” to offload even those going for business trips or tourism. Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Ahmed Hassan Mattu told Dawn that he had received several complaints from members of the Gujrat chamber about being offloaded from Lahore, Sialkot and other airports despite having genuine travel documents and recommendation letters. He said that the business fraternity had been very concerned over such a harsh policy of FIA Immigration as genuine businessmen should not be stopped or bothered at the airports. When asked about the reasons of offloading, FIA Gujranwala Zone Director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that there was no harsh policy or new directions issued in this regard of offloading passengers with fake documents or suspicious motives.",

      "summary": "Amid reports regarding the arbitrary offloading of passengers travelling abroad, an official from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Thursday clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers. Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway. In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”. “All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”. However, the FIA officer noted that a lot of people were those “who get deceived by various human smugglers in some way”. Zia detailed that FIA immigration officials at airports check the travel documents of “all those people and profile them”, asserting that no one going abroad for a valid purpose was being stopped. “All those who are denied from going abroad are refused due to them not having valid documents, or if they have permits or visas wherein the companies stated do not exist, and we have suspicions that human smugglers are trapping them and taking them abroad.’’ “We have seen cases where people get deceived by these human smugglers and change their routes mid-transit, or take an accomplice with them in the form of their mother or sister, through which they can exit here with the [safeguard] of an Umrah [visa],” Zia said. He added there had been past cases where such people were deported from other countries, following which the FIA’s Anti-Human Trafficking Cell registers a case, conducts an inquiry and “such human traffickers are brought to a halt”. He urged the public not to be fooled by migrant smugglers . The FIA officer said those networks were negatively portraying the matter to “create unrest” and secure financial gains for themselves. He recalled the Mauritania and Greece boat capsize incidents, saying that innocent people were shown “dreams of Europe” and smuggled out of Pakistan via dunki (illegal land routes) or by transiting in other countries, only to be pressured into handing over exorbitant amounts of cash or even losing their lives. “Not only does Pakistan’s name on an international level get maligned and the value of our green passport declines, but many countries have also created difficulties for us in obtaining visas,” the FIA Lahore director said. Zia assured the public that immigration staff would facilitate all those who were travelling abroad for legitimate reasons with valid documents. The FIA’s Facebook post said “such fabricated content aims to misguide the public and undermine institutional credibility”, and urged citizens to rely only on verified information from official FIA platforms. Earlier this week, BBC Urdu reported that it spoke to some of the offloaded individuals, including a 25-year-old man from Hyderabad who had obtained a work visa for Saudi Arabia.
