      "summary_orig": "China, Saudi Arabia, and Iran on Thursday welcomed Pakistan and  Afghanistan’s agreement to a 48-hour ceasefire after the two neighbours witnessed a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict. China’s foreign ministry said today it supported countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire. “China stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the foreign ministry, told a regular press briefing. Iran also welcomed the ceasefire between its eastern neighbours, urging dialogue and diplomacy after days of deadly clashes. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for stronger regional cooperation to combat terrorism, while reaffirming Tehran’s readiness “to assist in any effort to maintain calm and reduce tensions between the two neighbouring Muslim countries”. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar held a telephonic conversation with his Saudi Arabian counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, and held a discussion regarding the matter. According to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO), “H.H. Prince Faisal appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to peace and security in the region and emphasised the importance of collective efforts for stability.” Per the statement, FM Dar “expressed gratitude for the Kingdom’s continued support” and also reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Saudi Arabia to further strengthen cooperation on regional and international issues. Following the announcement of the ceasefire, Dar also received a message from Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, who commended Pakistan’s “constructive engagement” in promoting regional peace. On Wednesday, the Foreign Office (FO) said that a temporary ceasefire had been agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid recent border hostilities between the two countries. “A temporary ceasefire has been decided between the Pakistani government and the Afghan Taliban regime, with the mutual consent of both parties, for the next 48 hours from 6pm today, at the request of the Taliban. “During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the FO said. Taliban regime spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said on X that Afghan forces were instructed to respect the ceasefire, “unless any aggression takes place”. Pakistani officials on the northern and southern border with Afghanistan told AFP that “no violence was reported overnight, and the ceasefire remains in effect”. Separately, United Nations rights chief Volker Turk welcomed the ceasefire and appealed to “both parties to prevent any further harm to civilians & commit to a lasting ceasefire,“ according to AFP . The announcement came after the Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and capital Kabul, state media PTV reported. Earlier in the day, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said security forces repulsed a separate attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 of their members. It said Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said. The fighting was the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following an incident in Kurram and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations. Twenty-three Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 were injured in the incident that began with Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border, ISPR said. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself against terrorist groups such as the TTP. Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries, and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.",

      "summary_orig": "The Torkham and Chaman border crossings with Afghanistan remained closed for all trade activities last Sunday, in light of the “escalating security situation” along the Pak-Afghan border, it emerged on Thursday. This development comes in the wake of military hostilities between Kabul and Islamabad. Pakistan and Afghan­istan on Wednesday agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours. According to a notification from the Directorate General of Transit Trade — dated October 15 and available with Dawn.com — transit vehicles headed to Afghanistan have arrived at the crossings but are unable to leave Pakistani territory. “These vehicles are mounted with tracking devices and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) seals under the new tracking and monitoring system that was launched on October 1,” the notification read. “These border terminals have limited parking spaces, leading to severe congestion,” it added. “Moreover, prolonged parking/stoppage of vehicles can encourage device theft as well as seal tampering that can lead to pilferage of bonded cargo. In addition, in the absence of return journeys, there is [a] possibility of a shortage of tracking devices at the Port terminals.” The directorate stated that as of Wednesday, 107 vehicles arrived at Torkham, while 357 arrived at Chaman. An additional 37 vehicles are en route to Torkham and another 85 to Chaman. “In order to avoid congestion at border stations and to ensure the security of the bonded goods, this directorate, in consultation with port terminal operators, bonded carriers, Afghan clearing agents and tracking companies, has temporarily stopped the processing of transit consignments till normalisation of border operations,” the notification concluded. Torkham and Chama are key trade corridors between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with goods such as fresh produce moving across the border. Official data showed that Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan surged 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25, up from $558.03m in the previous fiscal year. Trade across the border has been halted several times. Earlier this month, the disruption in internet service in Afghanistan impacted bilateral trade between Islamabad and Kabul via the Torkham border, with Pakistani customs authorities struggling to clear goods due to the non-availability of internet on the Afghan side. In March, the cross-border movement of people via the Torkham border crossing was abruptly suspended after Pakistani and Afghan security forces were at loggerheads over construction activities on both sides of the border.",

      "summary_orig": "The Peshawar High Court on Thursday granted protective bail to new Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi till November 18. After a week-long constitutional and political crisis in the province over the chief minister’s election, Afridi was sworn in as the KP CM yesterday evening, with hundreds of PTI supporters present during the ceremony at the Governor House in Peshawar. A two-member bench comprising PHC’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar took up Afridi’s bail application today, with the chief minister appearing before the court in person. During the hearing, Justice Ijaz asked whether there were any first information reports (FIR) registered against the KP chief minister. “We do not know how many FIRs there are. It is possible that there might be an FIR against me as well,” KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel told the court. Subsequently, the court approved CM Afridi’s bail plea, barring his arrest in any case till November 18. According to the court order, available with Dawn.com , the bench directed that details regarding criminal cases, if any, registered against Afridi be provided at the next hearing on November 18. Speaking to the media outside the PHC, Afridi said that the federal and “those individuals who are preventing the meeting [with Imran] should realise that a province’s chief minister is coming”. Responding to a reporter’s query, Afridi said he has not met Imran since he was imprisoned. He also refuted a list of names for his new cabinet that has been circulating on social media as “fake”. Asked whether the provincial cabinet will be finalised after his meeting with the PTI founder, CM Afridi replied in the affirmative. “No action will be taken without the approval of our lifelong [party] chairman sahib ,” he asserted. ‘Peaceful protest always an option’ Yesterday, the KP Home and Tribal Affairs Department had requested the secretary of its Punjab counterpart and the interior ministry secretary that “necessary arrangements” be made to facilitate Afridi’s meeting with Imran today, according to a letter shared by Niazi. Shortly after today’s hearing, PTI lawyer Naeem Panjhuta said on social media platform X that Afridi had departed for Adiala Jail to meet party founder Imran Khan, who has been incarcerated since August 2023 in multiple cases. CM’s Focal Person on Digital Media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi also shared a video on X, saying that the chief minister was on his way to Adiala Jail. Later in the afternoon, the PTI claimed that the authorities were “not letting” CM Afridi meet Imran, terming it the “real anti-Pakistan act”. “They are isolating the very leadership that millions of Pakistanis trust. They fear the people standing together with Imran Khan,” the party said on its official X account. Speaking at a checkpoint situated near Adiala jail, the chief minister assured the people gathered there that he would not disappoint them. Later, he also spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, he said he had come there to meet Imran. “Yesterday, the KP government had informed the federal and Punjab government that the [KP] chief minister would be meeting Imran today, but they did not respond,” he said, adding that he also spoke to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “I thanked Shehbaz Sharif sahib , he called and congratulated me. I told him that […] our people should not [get affected] by our personal and political differences. I requested him to let me meet Imran, at which he said he would enquire [about the matter] and get back to me. But till now, there has been no response from him,” Afridi said. The KP CM said they were trying to adopt all constitutional and legal means for his meeting with Imran. “Previously, too, we tried all means and will try them again,” he asserted. But, he continued, in that case the PTI was criticised for practicing the politics of protests. “But if courts don’t serve justice, if we adopted all constitutional means and still are not served justice, then peaceful protest is the only solution. We have always protested peaceful and we always have that option,” Afridi added.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said Islamabad was ready to talk if Kabul agreed to fulfil Pakistan’s “justified” conditions following recent hostilities between the two countries. Pakistan and Afghan­istan on Wednesday agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours. The announcement followed sustained hostilities between the two countries over the weekend. Addressing the federal cabinet today after the latest round of conflict, the premier stated that the Afghan side had requested a ceasefire and made a formal request. “Yesterday we decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready. The ball is in their court.” He added that if the Afghan side was sincere and serious, then it would initiate steps to hold talks, adding that Pakistan’s allied nations, particularly Qatar, were also making efforts to resolve the situation. The premier expressed hope that the latest situation between the two countries would be resolved on a long-term basis, including the elimination of the Fitna al-Khawarij from Afghan soil so the neighbouring country’s territory would no longer be used by terrorists. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. PM Shehbaz reiterated his hope that the ceasefire be maintained for the future on the basis of “solid demands”. “If this was only done to buy time then we won’t accept it,” the premier warned. He elaborated that officials from Pakistan had visited Kabul many times and engaged in cordial dialogue on resolving their issues together with mutual agreement for the sake of peace and prosperity. “Unfortunately, despite all efforts, this was not possible and when this attack was ongoing on Pakistan, on India’s complete incitement, their (Afghan) Foreign Minister [Amir] Muttaqi was in New Delhi, so we were forced to give a comprehensive response.” The premier said the Qatari emir had condemned the entire episode in talks with him in Egypt and expressed his desire to play a role in cooling down tensions. Shehbaz also commended the armed forces and Field Marshal Asim Munir for their response to the Afghan side during the conflict, saying it was “necessary” to do so due to the many martyrdoms suffered by the security forces in operations against terrorists. Gaza ceasefire The premier also addressed the ceasefire in Gaza, pointing out the high casualties in the besieged territory during the conflict and Pakistan’s efforts towards peace in the matter. He also criticised the politicisation of the issue within the country, saying it was a “great achievement” if fighting and deaths had stopped in Gaza. PM Shehbaz lauded the role of United States President Donald Trump and all Muslim countries for their role in achieving the ceasefire, singling out Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. The prime minister said the Palestinians should get their own state, adding that Pakistan would continue to strive and make efforts towards this end. Welcomes IMF agreement PM Shehbaz also welcomed the recent staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and commended his team and the finance ministry for working day and night to pull it off. “This should be the last programme that Pakistan enters with the IMF.” He said the time had come to rid the country of loans, adding it would not be easy and would require continuous struggle and effort.",

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. PM Shehbaz reiterated his hope that the ceasefire be maintained for the future on the basis of “solid demands”. “If this was only done to buy time then we won’t accept it,” the premier warned. He elaborated that officials from Pakistan had visited Kabul many times and engaged in cordial dialogue on resolving their issues together with mutual agreement for the sake of peace and prosperity. “Unfortunately, despite all efforts, this was not possible and when this attack was ongoing on Pakistan, on India’s complete incitement, their (Afghan) Foreign Minister [Amir] Muttaqi was in New Delhi, so we were forced to give a comprehensive response.” The premier said the Qatari emir had condemned the entire episode in talks with him in Egypt and expressed his desire to play a role in cooling down tensions. Shehbaz also commended the armed forces and Field Marshal Asim Munir for their response to the Afghan side during the conflict, saying it was “necessary” to do so due to the many martyrdoms suffered by the security forces in operations against terrorists. Gaza ceasefire The premier also addressed the ceasefire in Gaza, pointing out the high casualties in the besieged territory during the conflict and Pakistan’s efforts towards peace in the matter. He also criticised the politicisation of the issue within the country, saying it was a “great achievement” if fighting and deaths had stopped in Gaza. PM Shehbaz lauded the role of United States President Donald Trump and all Muslim countries for their role in achieving the ceasefire, singling out Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. The prime minister said the Palestinians should get their own state, adding that Pakistan would continue to strive and make efforts towards this end. Welcomes IMF agreement PM Shehbaz also welcomed the recent staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and commended his team and the finance ministry for working day and night to pull it off. “This should be the last programme that Pakistan enters with the IMF.” He said the time had come to rid the country of loans, adding it would not be easy and would require continuous struggle and effort.",

      "summary": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said Islamabad was ready to talk if Kabul agreed to fulfil Pakistan’s “justified” conditions following recent hostilities between the two countries. Pakistan and Afghan­istan on Wednesday agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict. Pakistan’s Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time on October 15 and would last for 48 hours. The announcement followed sustained hostilities between the two countries over the weekend. Addressing the federal cabinet today after the latest round of conflict, the premier stated that the Afghan side had requested a ceasefire and made a formal request. “Yesterday we decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready. The ball is in their court.” He added that if the Afghan side was sincere and serious, then it would initiate steps to hold talks, adding that Pakistan’s allied nations, particularly Qatar, were also making efforts to resolve the situation. The premier expressed hope that the latest situation between the two countries would be resolved on a long-term basis, including the elimination of the Fitna al-Khawarij from Afghan soil so the neighbouring country’s territory would no longer be used by terrorists.

      "summary_orig": "New York’s Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday apologised to the New York Police Department (NYPD) for remarks he made in 2020 during the height of the George Floyd protests. “I apologise for the language that I used, and I spoke to them about the fact that I want to work with them to deliver public safety because what we’re seeing in the city right now is we’re asking officers to do nearly everything we can think of,” Mamdani said in an interview on US media outlet Fox News. “We used to ask officers to focus on serious crimes. Now we’re asking them to focus also on the mental health crisis, to focus also on homelessness. In one year alone, the NYPD receives 200,000 mental health calls,” he added. Fox host Martha MacCallum said officers she spoke with had requested a public apology from Mamdani. He responded: “I’ll apologise to police officers right here, because this is the apology that I’ve been sharing with many rank-and-file officers. I apologise because of the fact that I’m looking to working with these officers.“ Mamdani, who continues to hold a strong lead in the polls, said his views on policing have evolved over time during his tenure in the state Legislature. “One of my focuses was, ‘How do we deliver that justice?’ And now what I know, having represented 100,000 people in western Queens, is that to deliver that justice, you have to also deliver that safety. And that means representing the men and women in the NYPD,” Mamdani said. “It means representing the Black and brown New Yorkers who have been victims of police brutality. It means representing the Muslim New Yorkers in my district who were surveilled on the basis of their faith,” he added. In June 2020, Mamdani wrote on the US social media company X, then known as Twitter: “We don’t need an investigation to know that the NYPD is racist, anti-queer & a major threat to public safety. What we need is to #DefundTheNYPD .” Floyd , an unarmed Black man, was killed on May 25, 2020, when Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on his neck for nearly 10 minutes. His death sparked global protests against racism and police brutality, with demonstrations spreading far beyond the US.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have killed 34 “India-backed” terrorists during multiple operations that took place across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the last three days, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Thursday. According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “From 13-15 October 2025, thirty-four khawarij belonging to Indian-proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij were killed in multiple engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The security forces, per the ISPR, conducted intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Bannu districts of the province. The first operation, it said, was carried out in the Spinwam area of North Waziristan district. “During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, eighteen khawarij were sent to hell,” it said. According to the statement, another IBO was conducted in the South Waziristan district, during which eight more terrorists were neutralised following an intense exchange of fire with the security forces. “In [the] third encounter, [which] took place in [the] Bannu district, own troops successfully neutralised eight more khawarij .” The ISPR added that sanitisation operations were being carried out in the said areas “to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji ”. It further said that a “relentless counterterrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam — as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan (NAP) —  by security forces and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) of Pakistan, will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.” President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement, lauded the armed forces and security agencies for successfully carrying out the counterterrorism operations, saying that the “timely actions of the security forces have improved the peace and stability situation in the country.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces for “thwarting the nefarious plans of the terrorists with their professional expertise.” In a statement, he said that all possible measures will be taken for the safety of the Pakistani people and the country’s integrity. “The counter-terrorism campaign will continue with full vigour until the complete eradication of the menace of terrorism from the country,” he said. Pakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel. Last week, ISPR Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that as of September 15, a total of 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025. During these operations, 970 terrorists were killed, while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred. He added that in 2024, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP during which 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians lost their lives. Lt Gen Chaudhry attributed the surge in terrorist incidents across the country to several factors, including the non-implementation of the NAP, the politicisation of counterterrorism efforts, India’s use of Afghanistan as a “ base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the supply of modern weapons to militants in Afghanistan, and a “terrorism-crime nexus” that he said enjoyed “complete local and political backing.” On October 8, security forces neutralised 19 “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an operation in KP’s Orakzai district, according to the ISPR. However, eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred . Additional reporting by Nadir Guramani.",

      "summary_orig": "An Afghan man accused of a deadly knife attack on a group of toddlers in Germany went on trial on Thursday, nine months after an incident that inflamed a heated pre-election debate on immigration . Germany was shocked by the stabbing spree that killed a two-year-old boy and a 41-year-old man who tried to protect the children and left three others wounded in the southern city of Aschaffenburg. Five toddlers from a kindergarten class were in a public park, accompanied by two teachers, when the assailant attacked them with a kitchen knife. The suspect arrested at the scene of the January 22 attack has been only partially named, in line with usual practice by the German judiciary, as 28-year-old Enamullah O. He has a long history of mental illness, and prosecutors said an expert assessment concluded his psychiatric state meant he was not criminally responsible. The public prosecutor’s office has previously said there was no indication the suspect acted out of extremist or terrorist motivation, and they were seeking to have him permanently confined to a psychiatric facility. The trial is expected to stretch over several days of proceedings in October. The suspected attacker injured a two-year-old Syrian girl, one of the teachers, as well as a 72-year-old man who had also tried to protect the children. He was arrested shortly afterwards, and it soon emerged that the authorities had tried and failed in 2023 to deport him to Bulgaria — the first EU country he had arrived in. In August 2024, he allegedly threatened a fellow resident at an accommodation for asylum seekers in the nearby town of Alzenau with a butcher’s knife and caused her minor injuries. The Aschaffenburg stabbings, which followed a string of other bloody attacks in Germany, provoked intense political reactions. Friedrich Merz , the leader of the centre-right Christian Democrats who went on to become chancellor, promised a “fundamental” overhaul of asylum rules and strict border controls “from day one” if elected. About a week later, Merz, then the opposition leader, relied on support from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) to pass a non-binding resolution through parliament demanding stricter immigration and refugee policies. Merz’s decision to rely on far-right support broke a longstanding taboo in post-World War II German politics, prompting fierce criticism and mass street protests.",

      "title_orig": "Trump authorises CIA operations in Venezuela, raising pressure on Maduro",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump confirmed on Wednesday that he authorised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, marking a sharp escalation in US efforts to pressure President Nicolas Maduro’s government. The New York Times first reported the classified directive, citing US officials familiar with the decision, saying the Trump administration’s Venezuela strategy aims to remove Maduro from power. The administration has offered $50 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest and conviction on drug trafficking charges. The new authority would allow the CIA to carry out lethal operations in Venezuela and conduct a range of operations in the Caribbean, the Times reported. Asked why he authorised the CIA to operate in Venezuela, Trump told reporters his reasons were migration of Venezuelans to the United States and drug trafficking. “I authorised for two reasons really,” Trump said. “Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America…they came in through the border. They came in because we had an open border,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “And the other thing are drugs,” Trump said. Trump has not provided evidence for his claim that Venezuela is sending former prisoners to the US. He added that the US has made progress intercepting drug shipments at sea, and that additional efforts are now focused on overland routes. “We are looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” Trump said. Reuters could not independently determine what specific actions Trump has authorised and the White House declined to elaborate on the president’s comments. Historically, the agency’s involvement in such operations has varied widely from direct paramilitary engagement to intelligence gathering and support roles with little to no physical footprint. The CIA has a long history of operations in Latin America, particularly during the Cold War, and helped topple South America’s cocaine trafficking empires at the end of the 20th century. Reuters has reported that the CIA has been running covert operations in Mexico for years to track down the country’s most-wanted drug traffickers. Venezuela’s government said Trump’s remarks constituted a violation of international law and said US actions were aimed at legitimising a “regime change” operation with the goal of seizing the country’s oil resources. “Our Permanent Mission to the UN will raise this complaint with the Security Council and the secretary general tomorrow, demanding accountability from the United States government,” Venezuela said in a statement released by Foreign Minister Yvan Gil on his Telegram account. ‘Venezuela feeling heat’ Trump has repeatedly accused Venezuela of being a hub for trafficking of the deadly drug fentanyl, but US records have shown that Mexico is the main source of fentanyl. Trump was asked by a reporter why he did not have the Coast Guard stop suspected drug trafficking boats, which has been US practice for decades. Trump called such efforts “politically correct” and said they had not worked. Trump declined to answer when asked if the CIA has the authority to execute Maduro, saying: “I think Venezuela is feeling heat.” Trump has ordered a large US military buildup in the southern Caribbean, and the troops have conducted at least five strikes on vessels the Trump administration has described as involved in drug trafficking, without providing evidence. The campaign is the most recent example of Trump’s efforts to use US military power in new, and often legally contentious, ways, from deploying active-duty US troops in Los Angeles to carrying out counterterrorism strikes against drug trafficking suspects. The Pentagon recently disclosed to Congress that Trump has determined the United States is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels. ‘Venezuela also released prisoners into US’ Trump also accused Venezuela of releasing large numbers of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the United States, although he did not specify which border they were crossing. Neither Maduro’s Information Ministry nor press representatives for opposition leader Maria Corina Machado immediately responded to requests for comment on Trump’s remarks. The Trump administration has provided scant information about the strikes, frustrating members of Congress, including some of his fellow Republicans. On Wednesday, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration moved the US closer to outright conflict. “The American people deserve to know if the Administration is leading the US into another conflict, putting service members at risk or pursuing a regime-change operation,” she said in a statement.",

Reuters has reported that the CIA has been running covert operations in Mexico for years to track down the country’s most-wanted drug traffickers. Venezuela’s government said Trump’s remarks constituted a violation of international law and said US actions were aimed at legitimising a “regime change” operation with the goal of seizing the country’s oil resources. “Our Permanent Mission to the UN will raise this complaint with the Security Council and the secretary general tomorrow, demanding accountability from the United States government,” Venezuela said in a statement released by Foreign Minister Yvan Gil on his Telegram account. ‘Venezuela feeling heat’ Trump has repeatedly accused Venezuela of being a hub for trafficking of the deadly drug fentanyl, but US records have shown that Mexico is the main source of fentanyl. Trump was asked by a reporter why he did not have the Coast Guard stop suspected drug trafficking boats, which has been US practice for decades. Trump called such efforts “politically correct” and said they had not worked. Trump declined to answer when asked if the CIA has the authority to execute Maduro, saying: “I think Venezuela is feeling heat.” Trump has ordered a large US military buildup in the southern Caribbean, and the troops have conducted at least five strikes on vessels the Trump administration has described as involved in drug trafficking, without providing evidence. The campaign is the most recent example of Trump’s efforts to use US military power in new, and often legally contentious, ways, from deploying active-duty US troops in Los Angeles to carrying out counterterrorism strikes against drug trafficking suspects. The Pentagon recently disclosed to Congress that Trump has determined the United States is engaged in “a non-international armed conflict” with drug cartels. ‘Venezuela also released prisoners into US’ Trump also accused Venezuela of releasing large numbers of prisoners, including individuals from mental health facilities, into the United States, although he did not specify which border they were crossing. Neither Maduro’s Information Ministry nor press representatives for opposition leader Maria Corina Machado immediately responded to requests for comment on Trump’s remarks. The Trump administration has provided scant information about the strikes, frustrating members of Congress, including some of his fellow Republicans. On Wednesday, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the administration moved the US closer to outright conflict. “The American people deserve to know if the Administration is leading the US into another conflict, putting service members at risk or pursuing a regime-change operation,” she said in a statement.",

      "summary": "US President Donald Trump confirmed on Wednesday that he authorised the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, marking a sharp escalation in US efforts to pressure President Nicolas Maduro’s government. The New York Times first reported the classified directive, citing US officials familiar with the decision, saying the Trump administration’s Venezuela strategy aims to remove Maduro from power. The administration has offered $50 million for information leading to Maduro’s arrest and conviction on drug trafficking charges. The new authority would allow the CIA to carry out lethal operations in Venezuela and conduct a range of operations in the Caribbean, the Times reported. Asked why he authorised the CIA to operate in Venezuela, Trump told reporters his reasons were migration of Venezuelans to the United States and drug trafficking. “I authorised for two reasons really,” Trump said. “Number one, they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America…they came in through the border. They came in because we had an open border,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “And the other thing are drugs,” Trump said. Trump has not provided evidence for his claim that Venezuela is sending former prisoners to the US. He added that the US has made progress intercepting drug shipments at sea, and that additional efforts are now focused on overland routes. “We are looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” Trump said. Reuters could not independently determine what specific actions Trump has authorised and the White House declined to elaborate on the president’s comments.

      "title_orig": "Ceasefire declared after Pakistan hits targets in Kabul, Kandahar",
      "summary_orig": "• 48-hour ‘Qatar-brokered’ truce initiated at Afghan Taliban’s request • Both sides pledge to seek resolution through dialogue • Khawaja Asif says ceasefire may not hold as Taliban have become ‘proxy for Delhi’ • Latest round of clashes erupted after Afghan fighters target Chaman border posts overnight • Pakistan confirms retaliatory strikes on militant camps in Kandahar city, Spin Boldak • Two explosions rock Afghan capital; TTP leadership targeted in ‘precision strikes’, state-run PTV reports ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Afghan­istan on Wednesday agreed to a temporary ceasefire after a fresh round of deadly cross-border clashes that threatened to escalate into a wider conflict. Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the ceasefire, implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, took effect at 6pm local time and would last for 48 hours. “During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the Foreign Office said in a statement. The announcement from Islamabad came before the Taliban’s version appeared on social media. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a post on X that “at the request and insistence of the Pakistani side”, the ceasefire would begin after 5:30pm Kabul time and remain in force “unless there is a violation”. The statements differed on key points, with each side claiming the ceasefire was requested by the other. Pakistan specified a 48-hour duration, while the Taliban described an open-ended truce. Only Pakistan mentioned a follow-up dialogue process. A senior Pakistani military official, speaking on background, said the Taliban requested the ceasefire after facing what he described as a “powerful response” from Pakistani forces. Although neither side disclosed whe­ther external mediation played a role, diplomatic sources suggested Qatar helped facilitate the understanding. Soon after the announcement, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received a message from Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Dr Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, who commended Pakistan’s “constructive engagement” in promoting regional peace. Mr Dar thanked Qatar for its “consistent support and positive role”, the statement added. This was the second ceasefire between the two neighbours since hostilities erupted on Oct 11, though the first truce was not publicly announced. Diplomatic insiders said that both Saudi Arabia and Qatar had intervened on that occasion to defuse tensions. ‘Ceasefire may not hold’ The ceasefire, while a pause in hostilities, highlights the diminishing leverage Pakistan wields over Kabul despite its historical role as the Taliban’s principal external supporter. Observers warn that the ceasefire may prove temporary without a framework for structured dialogue or a third-party monitoring mechanism in place. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also expressed a lack of confidence in the ceasefire, stressing that the Afghan Taliban had become a “proxy of Delhi”, Dawn.com reported. Speaking to Geo News on Wednesday night, the defence minister said that the Afghan Taliban are “fighting a proxy war” on behalf of India and stated that they have become a “stooge” for New Delhi. “I have my doubts that the ceasefire will hold, because the [Afghan] Taliban are being sponsored by Delhi,” he added. “Right now, Kabul is fighting a proxy war for Delhi.” Mr Asif reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness and capability to defend itself in the face of further aggression from Kabul. “We have the capability and we will attack them, God willing, if they escalate or widen the radius of this war,” he said. “There have been deep strikes in Afghanistan and a ceasefire was agreed on after the intervention of friendly countries, but it is fragile. I don’t believe this will last long.” However, Mr Asif added that in this situation, Pakistan will respond positively to any constructive dialogue but will not tolerate ceasefire violations or attacks on its territory. “If they bombard our border areas or attack our posts, then we have to respond in kind,” he said. “We do not want to fight, but if we are attacked, we have the right to respond.” To a question about whether the mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia could come into play here, the minister said friendly countries will “effectively intervene” but noted that it is speculation at present. Latest escalation The latest escalation began late on Tuesday and continued into early Wednesday, when Taliban fighters launched a series of coordinated attacks on Pakistani border positions in the Chaman sector of Balochistan. According to officials, the fighting erupted around 2am after Taliban forces opened heavy fire on a Pakistani post in the Sui Karez area of the Kozak Pass using mortars and other heavy weapons. Pakistani troops stationed in the area retaliated immediately, and intense exc­hanges continued for several hours. The clashes expanded when Taliban forces opened fire across multiple points along the border, including the border town of Chaman, damaging the Pakistan-Afgha­nistan Friendship Gate on their side. Officials said Taliban fighters also targeted nearby villages, injuring many civilians, including women and children. “At least five civilians were brought to the district hospital with bullet and splinter injuries,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, medical superintendent of the Chaman government hospital. Authorities declared an emergency in all Chaman hospitals and closed schools, while the anti-polio campaign in the area was suspended as residents began fleeing to safer areas. “The attack started in the early hours and heavy fighting continued until around 8am,” said Habib Ullah Bangulzai, deputy commissioner of Chaman. He confirmed that additional troops had been deployed to the sector to reinforce the defences. Pakistan’s military said its troops repulsed the Taliban attacks and launched retaliatory strikes targeting militant camps and installations in Kandahar and Spin Boldak, from where the attacks had been mounted. “Pakistani jets targeted these important camps being used by Fitna al-Khawarij,” an official said, using a term referring to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the Afghanistan-based terrorist group Islam­a­b­ad blames for recent cross-border attacks. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) later said that at least 20 Taliban fighters were killed and several of their installations destroyed. Sources in Kandahar said the Taliban confirmed eight deaths in Spin Boldak, including a couple in Vesh Mandi, the first Afghan town across the border. A large number of Taliban fighters were reported wounded in Pakistani strikes. By morning, heavy exchanges of fire were also reported from multiple points along the Kurram border region, with ISPR saying 25 to 30 Taliban and Fitna al-Khawarij militants were killed in the Pakistani response that destroyed several posts and tanks. Kabul explosions Shortly before the ceasefire announcement, two explosions rocked Kabul’s Taimani neighbourhood around 4pm local time. The Taliban said the blasts were caused by an oil tanker fire, but residents reported two separate explosions roughly 20 minutes apart. Videos circulating on social media showed a multi-story building engulfed in flames. Kabul Surgical Centre said it had received 40 casualties, including five fatalities. While Pakistan’s military did not officially claim responsibility, state-run PTV reported that “precision strikes” had targeted the leadership of Fitna al-Khawarij. Tensions between Pakistan and the Taliban regime have soared since Oct 9, when Kabul accused Islamabad of conducting airstrikes inside Afghanistan — an allegation Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied. The Taliban launched coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts on Oct 11, in which 23 soldiers were martyred. Pakistan claimed its retaliatory operations killed about 200 Taliban fighters. As both sides enter the temporary tru­ce, questions remain over the next steps. A Pakistani diplomat, speaking anonymously, said the focus will now be on “disengagement details and getting assurances about dismantling cross-border terrorist sanctuaries — the central issue behind this unprecedented escalation”. The crisis underscores a sharp deterioration in Pakistan-Taliban relations that once appeared anchored in mutual dependence. Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant. For Pakistan’s military, the recent border clashes are not merely a border management issue but a reflection of Afgh­anistan’s unwillingness to curb cross-border militancy. For the Taliban, Pakistani airstrikes are seen as violations of sovereignty, reinforcing its domestic narrative of resistance to external interference.

Speaking to Geo News on Wednesday night, the defence minister said that the Afghan Taliban are “fighting a proxy war” on behalf of India and stated that they have become a “stooge” for New Delhi. “I have my doubts that the ceasefire will hold, because the [Afghan] Taliban are being sponsored by Delhi,” he added. “Right now, Kabul is fighting a proxy war for Delhi.” Mr Asif reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness and capability to defend itself in the face of further aggression from Kabul. “We have the capability and we will attack them, God willing, if they escalate or widen the radius of this war,” he said. “There have been deep strikes in Afghanistan and a ceasefire was agreed on after the intervention of friendly countries, but it is fragile. I don’t believe this will last long.” However, Mr Asif added that in this situation, Pakistan will respond positively to any constructive dialogue but will not tolerate ceasefire violations or attacks on its territory. “If they bombard our border areas or attack our posts, then we have to respond in kind,” he said. “We do not want to fight, but if we are attacked, we have the right to respond.” To a question about whether the mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia could come into play here, the minister said friendly countries will “effectively intervene” but noted that it is speculation at present. Latest escalation The latest escalation began late on Tuesday and continued into early Wednesday, when Taliban fighters launched a series of coordinated attacks on Pakistani border positions in the Chaman sector of Balochistan. According to officials, the fighting erupted around 2am after Taliban forces opened heavy fire on a Pakistani post in the Sui Karez area of the Kozak Pass using mortars and other heavy weapons. Pakistani troops stationed in the area retaliated immediately, and intense exc­hanges continued for several hours. The clashes expanded when Taliban forces opened fire across multiple points along the border, including the border town of Chaman, damaging the Pakistan-Afgha­nistan Friendship Gate on their side. Officials said Taliban fighters also targeted nearby villages, injuring many civilians, including women and children. “At least five civilians were brought to the district hospital with bullet and splinter injuries,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, medical superintendent of the Chaman government hospital. Authorities declared an emergency in all Chaman hospitals and closed schools, while the anti-polio campaign in the area was suspended as residents began fleeing to safer areas. “The attack started in the early hours and heavy fighting continued until around 8am,” said Habib Ullah Bangulzai, deputy commissioner of Chaman. He confirmed that additional troops had been deployed to the sector to reinforce the defences. Pakistan’s military said its troops repulsed the Taliban attacks and launched retaliatory strikes targeting militant camps and installations in Kandahar and Spin Boldak, from where the attacks had been mounted. “Pakistani jets targeted these important camps being used by Fitna al-Khawarij,” an official said, using a term referring to Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the Afghanistan-based terrorist group Islam­a­b­ad blames for recent cross-border attacks. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) later said that at least 20 Taliban fighters were killed and several of their installations destroyed. Sources in Kandahar said the Taliban confirmed eight deaths in Spin Boldak, including a couple in Vesh Mandi, the first Afghan town across the border. A large number of Taliban fighters were reported wounded in Pakistani strikes. By morning, heavy exchanges of fire were also reported from multiple points along the Kurram border region, with ISPR saying 25 to 30 Taliban and Fitna al-Khawarij militants were killed in the Pakistani response that destroyed several posts and tanks. Kabul explosions Shortly before the ceasefire announcement, two explosions rocked Kabul’s Taimani neighbourhood around 4pm local time. The Taliban said the blasts were caused by an oil tanker fire, but residents reported two separate explosions roughly 20 minutes apart. Videos circulating on social media showed a multi-story building engulfed in flames. Kabul Surgical Centre said it had received 40 casualties, including five fatalities. While Pakistan’s military did not officially claim responsibility, state-run PTV reported that “precision strikes” had targeted the leadership of Fitna al-Khawarij. Tensions between Pakistan and the Taliban regime have soared since Oct 9, when Kabul accused Islamabad of conducting airstrikes inside Afghanistan — an allegation Pakistan has neither confirmed nor denied. The Taliban launched coordinated attacks on Pakistani border posts on Oct 11, in which 23 soldiers were martyred. Pakistan claimed its retaliatory operations killed about 200 Taliban fighters. As both sides enter the temporary tru­ce, questions remain over the next steps. A Pakistani diplomat, speaking anonymously, said the focus will now be on “disengagement details and getting assurances about dismantling cross-border terrorist sanctuaries — the central issue behind this unprecedented escalation”. The crisis underscores a sharp deterioration in Pakistan-Taliban relations that once appeared anchored in mutual dependence. Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, Islamabad had hoped for cooperation on counterterrorism, particularly against TTP. Instead, the Taliban’s refusal to rein in the TTP has become the core irritant. For Pakistan’s military, the recent border clashes are not merely a border management issue but a reflection of Afgh­anistan’s unwillingness to curb cross-border militancy. For the Taliban, Pakistani airstrikes are seen as violations of sovereignty, reinforcing its domestic narrative of resistance to external interference.
