      "summary_orig": "Yemen’s Saudi-backed government launched an operation to take back military positions from southern separatists on Friday and said it had reclaimed one of the largest military camps in Hadramout province. The operation in Hadramout marks the latest escalation in Yemen. Hadramout’s governor, Salem Ahmed Saeed al-Khunbashi, said in a statement on Friday that his forces had taken control of a military camp in al-Khasha’a, the largest and most important base in the province. The governor had earlier said his forces were launching what he called a “peaceful” operation. A senior official of the Southern Transitional Council told Reuters the operation had not been peaceful. Yemen’s government said it had appointed Hadramout’s governor to take overall command of the “Homeland Shield” forces in the eastern province, granting him full military, security and administrative authority in what it said was a move to restore security and order. This is not a declaration of war, the governor said in a speech on Yemen TV, adding that the move aims to prevent the use of camps to threaten security and to protect Hadramout from sliding into chaos. The oil-producing Hadramout province borders Saudi Arabia and many prominent Saudis trace their origins to it, lending it cultural and historical significance for the kingdom. A spokesperson for the STC, Mohammed al-Naqeeb, said on Friday that forces were on full alert across the region and warned that it was ready to respond forcefully in a post on X. The STC told Reuters that three of the airstrikes targeted the al-Khasha’a military camp. Three Yemeni sources told Reuters armoured vehicles belonging to the government had been moving towards the Khasha’a camp, which has the capacity to house thousands of troops and was taken over by the STC in December. The STC, which seized large swathes of southern Yemen last month from the internationally recognised government, which in turn saw the move as a threat. The UAE last week said it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for its forces to leave within 24 hours. OPEC+ members will meet online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates have said they will extend a policy of maintaining first-quarter production unchanged. Aden airport shut Today, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Yemen blamed STC leader Aidarus Al-Zubaidi for refusing to grant landing permission the previous day for a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden. A halt in flights at Aden international airport on Thursday continued into Friday as both sides traded blame as to who was responsible for the air traffic shutdown. “For several weeks and until yesterday, the Kingdom sought to make all efforts with the Southern Transitional Council to end the escalation … but it faced continuous rejection and stubbornness from Aidarus Al-Zubaidi,” the Saudi ambassador, Mohammed Al-Jaber, said on X. Zubaidi issued directives to close air traffic at Aden’s airport on Thursday, the ambassador added, saying that a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden aiming to find solutions to the crisis was denied permission to land. Aden’s international airport is the main gateway for regions of the country outside Houthi control.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: The Utmanzai tribe of North Waziristan staged a peace rally in Mir Ali on Friday and warned of launching a civil disobedience movement if its demands, including restoring peace, lifting the curfew, and reopening the Ghulam Khan border crossing, were not fulfilled by Jan 20. Thousands of people from the tribe, along with other political and local leaders, gathered at Noor Islam Shaheed Chowk in Mir Ali, where Friday prayers were also offered, led by Member of the National Assembly Mufti Misbahuddin. Speakers stressed that peace was a fundamental right of citizens and demanded that residents of North Waziristan be allowed to live peacefully like people in other parts of the country. Misbahuddin told the rally that Waziristan could no longer withstand further military operations. “Peace is the greatest blessing, and tribal elders have always cooperated with the state, but the authorities never appear serious about restoring lasting stability,” he lamented. Chief of Waziristan Jirga Malik Nasrullah said every child in the region yearned for peace and warned that if the government failed to act, the tribes would be compelled to announce “civil disobedience and block all internal and external routes”. He also demanded compensation for damaged shops, and the immediate return of seized vehicles that had not paid customs duties. “If affected drivers block roads in protest, Utmanzai elders and the public will fully support them.” Nasrullah also criticised the placement of tribal elders on the Fourth Schedule, demanding the immediate removal of restrictions to allow them free movemen. Addressing the gathering, Utmanzai tribes’ elders said, “The continued insecurity, restrictions on movement, and economic blockades have made life unbearable for the local population”. They warned that if their demands were ignored, they would be left with no option but to resort to civil disobedience after the deadline. Jamaat-e-Islami leader Malik Imshadullah said the region had endured more than “two decades of inconsistent policies”, marked by a persistent gap between the “state’s commitments and actions”. Awami National Party leader Malik Nisar Ali Khan urged the authorities to allow the youth of the region to live normal lives. Utmanzai tribe’s spokesperson, Mufti Baitullah Aman, said peace was a sacred demand, adding that Islam placed great emphasis on security and human dignity. “The people are asking for peace, not confrontation,” he said, calling on the state to fulfil its constitutional responsibilities. Participants demanded that the police be empowered and all check-posts handed over to them, while security forces should focus on border security. They also urged militant groups to stay away from populated areas, saying “homes, shops, hospitals, and other civilian properties cannot be turned into bunkers or occupied by force”. Elders also called for the reopening of the Ghulam Khan border terminal for trade with Afghanistan, stating that nearly 20,000 people depended on cross-border trade for their livelihoods. Other demands included lifting restrictions on development projects, ending what they described as discriminatory treatment, and immediately ending the curfew. They said if restrictions were unavoidable, they should be limited to Sundays only, adding that curfews under Section 144 after 10pm on Saturdays were unacceptable. Elders claimed thousands of residents had their passports and national identity cards blocked and demanded their immediate restoration, alleging that heavy bribes were being demanded for unblocking documents. The rally concluded with a unanimous warning that if their demands were not accepted, a campaign of “civil disobedience and social boycott” would be launched after the January 20. In May last year, the locals in North Waziristan also staged a sit-in for days, protesting against a suspected drone strike that killed four children. Later, the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations, had clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned TTP. Last year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year.",

      "summary_orig": "Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death among men globally, and South Asian countries are no exception. As men continue to balance careers, family, and daily pressures, their hearts often bear the silent strain. Experts remind us that understanding and protecting men’s cardiac health is not just a medical need but a matter of self-care and longevity. Dr Ashraf Ur Rahman is a Medicine Specialist and a Cardiologist at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD). He notes that the majority of cardiac cases he encounters involve men above the age of forty. Image showing a person holding a cardboard heart. — Ryan’O Niel / Unsplash Dr Rahman explains that the difference between men’s and women’s heart health begins with hormones. Women benefit from the protective effects of oestrogen, which usually helps maintain healthy blood vessels and cholesterol levels. Men, however, lack this hormonal shield. As a result, they are naturally more susceptible to ischemic heart disease (IHD) from an earlier age. Once women reach menopause and oestrogen levels drop, their risk becomes nearly identical. “Hormonal protection gives women a head start,” Dr Rahman says. “Men, without that advantage, face heart-related risks much sooner, especially if unhealthy habits come into play.” The lifestyle link While biology sets the stage, daily habits often determine the outcome. “Many men also compromise food quality because they are always on the go,” notes Dr Rahman. “Add irregular sleep, stress, and addictive habits like smoking, and you have a combination that quietly damages the heart over time.” Stress itself plays a major role. With modern work-life demands, men often shoulder significant financial and emotional pressures, leading to hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD). Genetics can intensify this risk further. Men with a family history of cardiac problems are particularly vulnerable and should begin routine screenings earlier than others. Common conditions and overlooked symptoms Among South Asian men, the most frequently diagnosed heart conditions include coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension. These typically develop silently, progressing over years before showing clear warning signs. “The problem is that men often do not take minor symptoms seriously,” Dr Rahman warns. “Headaches, easy fatigue, chest discomfort, or swelling in the feet are not just signs of tiredness. They can be the heart’s way of asking for help.” Other early indicators include shortness of breath or decreased productivity at work. When left unchecked, these symptoms can escalate into severe cardiac events. Dr Rahman emphasises that awareness and timely response can prevent a tragedy. “Many heart attacks could have been avoided if men had sought medical attention earlier,” he adds. The need for early diagnosis One of Rahman’s strongest messages is the importance of early screening. “Early diagnosis makes a big difference. It can significantly prevent or slow down the severity of heart disease,” he says firmly. “Prevention is always better than a cure.” He advises men over 40, especially those with a family history of heart disease, to undergo annual check-ups. Simple tests such as blood pressure measurement, lipid profiles, ECGs, and stress tests can uncover silent risk factors long before symptoms appear. “Cardiac issues don’t appear overnight,” Rahman explains. “They develop gradually. The earlier you identify them, the better chance you have to protect your heart.” ) Small changes, big impact While the idea of an overhauled lifestyle can sound daunting, Dr Ashraf Ur Rahman insists that heart protection does not require radical change; it requires consistency. “Start with what you can control,” he advises. “Quit smoking, choose home-cooked meals over processed or oily food. Even small steps, if done regularly, make a real difference.” Exercise remains one of the most effective tools for maintaining heart health. Cardiologists recommend at least 30 to 45 minutes of physical activity several times a week, whether it’s brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling. Dr Rahman adds that the mental benefits are equally important: “Exercise helps release stress, which in turn keeps blood pressure and heart rhythm in check.” In addition, managing stress through exercise, mindfulness, adequate rest, and time away from screens can improve cardiovascular function. Too often, men ignore their symptoms or delay medical consultations out of fear or overconfidence. “It’s time to change that mindset,” Dr Rahman says. “Health is not about appearing tough. It’s about being wise enough to care for yourself.” Heart health, he stresses, is a lifelong responsibility, not a short-term goal. Early prevention, annual check-ups, and mindful habits are the pillars of a stronger, longer life. Men often devote their energy to providing for others but forget that their own health forms the foundation of everything they do. Dr Ashraf Ur Rahman concludes, “Your health is not an expense but an investment. Care for your heart now, and it will take care of you for years to come.” Header image: A man wearing a heart rate monitoring watch. — Nik/ Unsplash This article was originally published on The Daily Star , an ANN partner of Dawn.",

They can be the heart’s way of asking for help.” Other early indicators include shortness of breath or decreased productivity at work. When left unchecked, these symptoms can escalate into severe cardiac events. Dr Rahman emphasises that awareness and timely response can prevent a tragedy. “Many heart attacks could have been avoided if men had sought medical attention earlier,” he adds. The need for early diagnosis One of Rahman’s strongest messages is the importance of early screening. “Early diagnosis makes a big difference. It can significantly prevent or slow down the severity of heart disease,” he says firmly. “Prevention is always better than a cure.” He advises men over 40, especially those with a family history of heart disease, to undergo annual check-ups. Simple tests such as blood pressure measurement, lipid profiles, ECGs, and stress tests can uncover silent risk factors long before symptoms appear. “Cardiac issues don’t appear overnight,” Rahman explains. “They develop gradually. The earlier you identify them, the better chance you have to protect your heart.” ) Small changes, big impact While the idea of an overhauled lifestyle can sound daunting, Dr Ashraf Ur Rahman insists that heart protection does not require radical change; it requires consistency. “Start with what you can control,” he advises. “Quit smoking, choose home-cooked meals over processed or oily food. Even small steps, if done regularly, make a real difference.” Exercise remains one of the most effective tools for maintaining heart health. Cardiologists recommend at least 30 to 45 minutes of physical activity several times a week, whether it’s brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or cycling. Dr Rahman adds that the mental benefits are equally important: “Exercise helps release stress, which in turn keeps blood pressure and heart rhythm in check.” In addition, managing stress through exercise, mindfulness, adequate rest, and time away from screens can improve cardiovascular function. Too often, men ignore their symptoms or delay medical consultations out of fear or overconfidence. “It’s time to change that mindset,” Dr Rahman says. “Health is not about appearing tough. It’s about being wise enough to care for yourself.” Heart health, he stresses, is a lifelong responsibility, not a short-term goal. Early prevention, annual check-ups, and mindful habits are the pillars of a stronger, longer life. Men often devote their energy to providing for others but forget that their own health forms the foundation of everything they do. Dr Ashraf Ur Rahman concludes, “Your health is not an expense but an investment. Care for your heart now, and it will take care of you for years to come.” Header image: A man wearing a heart rate monitoring watch. — Nik/ Unsplash This article was originally published on The Daily Star , an ANN partner of Dawn.",
      "title": "Why men must pay closer attention to cardiac health",
      "summary": "Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death among men globally, and South Asian countries are no exception. As men continue to balance careers, family, and daily pressures, their hearts often bear the silent strain. Experts remind us that understanding and protecting men’s cardiac health is not just a medical need but a matter of self-care and longevity. Dr Ashraf Ur Rahman is a Medicine Specialist and a Cardiologist at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD). He notes that the majority of cardiac cases he encounters involve men above the age of forty. Image showing a person holding a cardboard heart. — Ryan’O Niel / Unsplash Dr Rahman explains that the difference between men’s and women’s heart health begins with hormones. Women benefit from the protective effects of oestrogen, which usually helps maintain healthy blood vessels and cholesterol levels. Men, however, lack this hormonal shield. As a result, they are naturally more susceptible to ischemic heart disease (IHD) from an earlier age. Once women reach menopause and oestrogen levels drop, their risk becomes nearly identical. “Hormonal protection gives women a head start,” Dr Rahman says. “Men, without that advantage, face heart-related risks much sooner, especially if unhealthy habits come into play.” The lifestyle link While biology sets the stage, daily habits often determine the outcome. “Many men also compromise food quality because they are always on the go,” notes Dr Rahman. “Add irregular sleep, stress, and addictive habits like smoking, and you have a combination that quietly damages the heart over time.” Stress itself plays a major role. With modern work-life demands, men often shoulder significant financial and emotional pressures, leading to hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD). Genetics can intensify this risk further. Men with a family history of cardiac problems are particularly vulnerable and should begin routine screenings earlier than others. Common conditions and overlooked symptoms Among South Asian men, the most frequently diagnosed heart conditions include coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension. These typically develop silently, progressing over years before showing clear warning signs. “The problem is that men often do not take minor symptoms seriously,” Dr Rahman warns. “Headaches, easy fatigue, chest discomfort, or swelling in the feet are not just signs of tiredness.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) handed out two life sentences each to YouTuber Adil Raja, journalists Wajahat Saeed Khan, Sabir Shakir and Shaheen Sehbai, anchorperson Haider Raza Mehdi, analyst Moeed Pirzada and former army official Akbar Hussain in cases related to riots in the country on May 9, 2023. The riots — during which government and military installations were also vandalised — had erupted following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan. The prosecution had accused the convicted individuals of “digital terrorism against state institutions” in relation to the events of May 9, 2023. The cases stemmed from allegations that the accused used digital platforms to incite, facilitate and amplify attacks against state institutions during the May 9 unrest. Reserved verdicts in the cases were announced by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra on Friday after the completion of trials in absentia. The trials were conducted in absentia at the prosecution’s request and by means of invoking the relevant provisions of anti-terrorism laws. According to court orders issued by Judge Sipra — copies of which are available with Dawn — cases against Raja, Khan, Sehbai and Mehdi were registered at Islamabad‘s Ramna police station. Similarly, cases against Shakir, Hussain and Pirzada were registered at the Aabpara police station. The court sentenced the individuals to rigorous life imprisonment on two counts — waging or attempting to wage or abetting in waging war against Pakistan and criminal conspiracy. They have also been directed to pay Rs500,000 in fines for each of the two offences. They have been further handed out 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs200,000 for committing an offence under Section 121-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The said provision deals with the subject of conspiracy to commit offences that are punishable under Section 121 (waging or attempting to wage war against Pakistan) of the PPC. Moreover, they have also been penalised with another 10-year sentence of rigorous imprisonment and Rs200,000 fine for committing an offence under Section 131 (abetting mutiny or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from their duty) of the PPC. They have also been handed out triple 5-year sentences of rigorous imprisonment on three counts under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. They are also required to pay Rs200,000 for each of the three offences. In case they fail to pay the fine for any of the offences they have been found guilty of committing, the period of their imprisonment will extend by six months, according to the court orders. The orders further stated that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was being extended to the convicts, and that all sentences handed out to them were to run concurrently. “The convict is informed that he has the right to file/prefer an appeal in the Hon’ble Islamabad High Court, Islamabad within seven days,” each of the orders said. The court also authorised and instructed the relevant station house officers to arrest the convicts “upon his availability and to forward him to jail for the commitment of his sentence”. During the trials in the cases, the prosecution produced 24 witnesses. Public prosecutor Raja Naveed Hussain Kayani represented the prosecution while Advocate Gulfam Ashraf Goraiya appeared on behalf of the accused. Records show that Advocate Goraiya was appointed as the defence counsel by the court. A detailed written judgement, which is yet to be issued by the court, is expected to outline the evidentiary basis and legal reasoning underpinning the multiple convictions and sentences. The cases against the seven convicted individuals were registered in 2023. The case against Shakir, Pirzada and Hussain was registered by Islamabad police on charges of sedition and terrorism for their alleged involvement in the violence and vandalism amid protests that erupted in the wake of PTI chief Imran’s arrest. Similarly, Sehbai, Khan, Raja and Mehdi were booked for “abetting mutiny” and inciting people to attack military installations across the country on May 9, 2023. Rights organisation Amnesty International and global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) had raised concerns and called out Pakistani authorities in June 2023, following the registration of these cases. “At least seven journalists and commentators have been charged with offences against the state and anti-terror laws in the past four days,” Amnesty International had said in a statement, expressing concern over “the crackdown on voices critical of the state and military”. “The use of these laws to silence commentators and journalists is a violation of the right to freedom of expression,” the statement said.",

      "summary_orig": "Former special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) Mirza Shahzad Akbar has said that his house in the United Kingdom (UK) — where he has been living in self-imposed exile — was subjected to a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”. The development comes a little over a week after Akbar said he suffered a fractured nose and other facial injuries after being attacked at his home. In a post on X on Thursday, Akbar said that his home in Cambridgeshire, England came under attack on December 31, 2025, in a “deliberate and targeted criminal attack with the intent to cause serious harm”. He said that the perpetrators “criminally damaged the property and attempted to set it on fire, placing lives at immediate risk”. Akbar maintained it was the second such attack “within one week against my home, myself, and my family, each carried out with clear malicious intent”. He held that the incidents were not isolated. “I was physically assaulted in a targeted attack on Dec 24, leaving me with substantial injuries,” Akbar recalled. He added that UK authorities were actively investigating both events, which are being treated as targeted attacks”. “The UK has a legal and moral obligation to exhaust all available powers and resources to ensure that it remains a safe country for all, particularly for political dissidents and individuals at risk of persecution,” he further said. In response to a written query from Dawn regarding Akbar’s statement on the latest incident, a London Counter-Terrorism Policing (CTP) spokesperson’s reply appeared to address last week’s assault on the ex-PM’s aide. “Officers from CTP London are investigating an assault of a man in his 50s, which happened in the Cambridge area on the morning of December 24. “The investigation was passed to CTP London due to what appears to be the highly targeted nature of the assault against the victim. At this stage, however, we retain an open mind as to any potential motivation behind the attack. There is not believed to be any wider threat to the public in connection with this incident,“ the spokesperson said. No arrests have been made, and the investigation remains ongoing, the spokesperson added. Akbar, who was the accountability czar in the PTI government, said last week that an unk­nown assailant dressed in “construction or waste-collection attire” attacked him in Cambridge. “The individual asked, ‘Are you Shahzad Akbar?’ and immediately began assaulting me,” Akbar posted on X. “I sustained facial injuries, including bruising and a fractured nose.” The former accountability adviser termed the assault “cowardly” and urged the British government to ensure the safety of dissidents. “Violence will not intimidate me or deter me from speaking out,” he wrote, vowing to continue exposing “corruption, human rights violations, and the erosion of democratic norms in Pakistan”. This is the third such incident Akbar has reported since November 2023, when a masked individual threw acidic liquid at Akbar’s home in Hertfordshire. While Akbar had initiated legal action alleging Pakistani state involvement, Pakistan’s Foreign Office has “categorically rejected” those claims as “preposterous”. Recently declared a proclaimed offender by an Islamabad court, Akbar also faces extradition efforts. Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had met United Kingdom High Commissioner Jane Marriott and handed over extradition papers for Akbar.",

      "title_orig": "Iranian official reacts to Trump’s statement on protests, warns US interference ‘would mean destabilising region’",
      "summary_orig": "After US President Donald Trump warned Iran on Friday of intervention if authorities in the Middle Eastern country “violently kill” peaceful protesters, a top official of the Islamic Republic said any interference by Washington would mean “destabilising the entire region and destroying America’s interests”. “If Iran shots [ sic ] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” Trump said in a Truth Social post. Reacting to his statement, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, posted on X: “With the statements by Israeli officials and Donald Trump, what has been going on behind the scenes is now clear. “We distinguish between the stance of the protesting shopkeepers and the actions of disruptive actors, and Trump should know that US interference in this internal matter would mean destabilising the entire region and destroying America’s interests.” He added, “The American people should know — Trump started this adventurism. They should be mindful of their soldiers’ safety.” These statements follow the deaths of several people as Iran’s biggest protests in three years over economic hardship turned violent across multiple provinces. The clashes between protesters and security forces mark a significant escalation in the unrest that has spread across the country since shopkeepers began protesting on Sunday over the government’s handling of a sharp currency slide and rapidly rising prices. Iran’s economy has struggled for years since the US reimposed sanctions in 2018 , after Trump withdrew from an international nuclear agreement during his first term. Meanwhile, the senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ali Larijani, said that US interference in Iranian protests would lead to chaos across the region.",

      "summary_orig": "Eight Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, on Friday expressed concern at the “deteriorating” humanitarian conditions in the Gaza Strip — exacerbated by severe weather conditions — and stressed the need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts. In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), expressed their “deepest concern” at the humanitarian situation in Gaza. These countries had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. A fragile ceasefire has been in place in Gaza since October as a result of the effort, with Israel violating the truce multiple times by carrying out attacks in the Gaza Strip. Last month, the UN International Organisation for Migration had said that hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians were facing flooding of their tents and shelters due to heavy rains , and materials for shelters and sandbags were not being allowed to enter the enclave. Much of Gaza’s infrastructure has also been destroyed because of the war, and Palestinians are facing grim living conditions. In their joint statement on Friday, the eight Muslim-majority nations highlighted that severe, harsh, and unstable weather conditions, including heavy rainfall and storms, had exacerbated the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. The situation had been further “compounded by the continued lack of sufficient humanitarian access, acute shortages of essential life-saving supplies, and the slow pace of the entry of essential materials required for the rehabilitation of basic services and the establishment of temporary housing”, the statement said. It added that the “severe weather has laid bare the fragility of existing humanitarian conditions, particularly for almost 1.9 million people, and displaced families living in inadequate shelters.” “Flooded camps, damaged tents, the collapse of damaged buildings and exposure to cold temperatures, coupled with malnutrition, have significantly heightened risks to civilian lives, including due to disease outbreaks, especially among children, women, the elderly, and individuals with medical vulnerabilities.” The foreign ministers, in their joint statement, also lauded the “tireless efforts“ of United Nations’ organisations, in particular the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), and other humanitarian international NGOs, in continuing to assist Palestinian civilians and deliver humanitarian assistance under extremely difficult and complex circumstances. They demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs were able to operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable, and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip. “Any attempt to impede their ability to operate is unacceptable,” the statement said. The foreign ministers also expressed “full support” for a US-drafted resolution that endorses Trump’s plan to end the war in Gaza and was adopted by the UN Security Council in November last year. They also reaffirmed their support for Trump’s Gaza plan and their “intention to contribute to the successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the war in Gaza, to secure a dignified life for the Palestinian people who have endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” . They also called for the “urgent need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts”, including the provision of durable and dignified shelter to protect the population from the severe winter conditions. The joint statement further said that the international community should “uphold its legal and moral responsibilities to pressure Israel, as the occupying power, to immediately lift constraints on the entry and distribution of essential supplies, including tents, shelter materials, medical assistance, clean water, fuel, and sanitation support.” The ministers also called for “immediate, full, and unhindered humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip without any interference by either party, through the UN and its agencies, the rehabilitation of infrastructure and hospitals, and the opening of the Rafah Crossing in both directions as stipulated in President Trump’s plan,” the statement read.",

      "summary_orig": "Investigators raced on Friday to identify the victims of a fire that ripped through a bar in the Swiss Alps town of Crans-Montana, turning a New Year’s celebration into one of the country’s worst tragedies. It is not yet clear what set off the blaze at Le Constellation, killing around 40 people and injuring about 115 others, many seriously. Bystanders described scenes of panic and chaos as people tried to break the windows to escape and others, covered in burns, poured into the street. Swiss police warned it could take days or even weeks to identify everyone who perished, leaving an agonising wait for family and friends. “We’ve tried to reach our friends. We took loads of photos and posted them on Instagram, Facebook, all possible social networks to try to find them,” said Eleonore, 17. “But there’s nothing. No response.” “Even the parents don’t know,” she added. The exact number of people who were at the bar when it went up in flames remains unclear, and police have not specified how many are still missing. Le Constellation had a capacity of 300 people, plus another 40 people on its terrace, according to the Crans-Montana website . Swiss President Guy Parmelin, who took over on Thursday, called the fire “a calamity of unprecedented, terrifying proportions”, and announced that flags would be flown at half-mast for five days. Local police commander Frederic Gisler said authorities were “in close contact with the victims’ families, whom we are informing in real time, as well as with the various embassies involved”. “Given the international nature of the Crans resort, we can expect foreign nationals to be among the victims,” he told reporters. The canton’s chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, said significant resources have been deployed “to identify the victims and return their bodies to the families as quickly as possible”. ‘The apocalypse’ The fire broke out around 1:30 am (0030 GMT) Thursday at Le Constellation, a bar popular with young tourists. “We thought it was just a small fire — but when we got there, it was war,” Mathys, from neighbouring Chermignon-d’en-Bas, told AFP. “That’s the only word I can use to describe it: the apocalypse. It was terrible.” Authorities have declined to speculate on what caused the tragedy, saying only that it was not an attack. Several witness accounts, broadcast by Swiss, French and Italian media, meanwhile, pointed to sparklers that were apparently mounted on champagne bottles held aloft by restaurant staff as part of a regular “show” for patrons who made special orders to their tables. There were “waitresses with champagne bottles and little sparklers. They got too close to the ceiling, and suddenly it all caught fire”, Axel, a witness present at the time of the incident, told the Italian media outlet Local Team . Pilloud said the investigation would look into whether the bar met safety standards and had the required number of exits. Red and white caution tape, flowers and candles adorned the street where the tragedy occurred, while police shielded the site with white screens. After the emergency units at the local hospitals filled up, many of the injured were transported across Switzerland and to neighbouring countries. The European Union said it has been in contact with Swiss authorities about providing medical assistance, while French President Emmanuel Macron said some of the injured were being cared for in French hospitals. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told Italian broadcaster Rete 4 that around 15 Italians had been injured in the fire, and a similar number remained missing. The French foreign ministry said nine French citizens figured among the injured, and eight others remained unaccounted for. Multiple sources told AFP that the bar owners are French nationals: a couple originally from Corsica who, according to a relative, are safe, but have been unreachable since the tragedy.",

      "summary_orig": "The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan on Friday expressed concern over the roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt during a court appearance in Karachi earlier this week. On Monday, Butt was physically assaulted at the Karachi City Court premises during the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said on X that “a few lawyers launched a life-threatening attack on him within the court premises” and registered a case against them. A video of the incident in question had showed Butt, clad in a shirt with the neckline torn open, attempting to move through a crowd surrounding him. “The HRCP expresses grave concern over the reported physical assault on YouTuber Rajab Butt within the Karachi city court premises and the alleged involvement of members of the legal fraternity,” the HRCP said in a statement today on social media platform X. “Violence, intimidation and vigilantism — particularly inside courts — undermine the rule of law and the right to due process,” it said. The commission urged a “prompt, impartial investigation”, accountability for responsible parties and effective measures to ensure the safety of litigants, lawyers and court officials. The first information report (FIR) of the incident registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer, had named Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers”. Solangi is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt. Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers. On Tuesday, a group of lawyers had stormed the City Courts police station, manhandled a station house officer (SHO) and then staged a protest sit-in on M.A. Jinnah Road demanding an FIR against Mr Butt. A day later, police had registered a criminal case against several lawyers, including Solangi, for allegedly assaulting the City Courts SHO after he lodged an FIR against them for assaulting Butt. Meanwhile, the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended Ashfaq’s practising licence for representing Butt before the court despite a strike called by the local bar. It said that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”. It added Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”.",

Meanwhile, the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Thursday suspended Ashfaq’s practising licence for representing Butt before the court despite a strike called by the local bar. It said that while defending his client, the advocate made statements against the legal fraternity, which the PbBC described as “serious professional impropriety”. It added Ashfaq’s conduct created an “atmosphere of dispute and disharmony, gravely damaging the reputation, unity and collective integrity of the legal community”.",

      "summary": "The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan on Friday expressed concern over the roughing up of YouTuber Rajab Butt during a court appearance in Karachi earlier this week. On Monday, Butt was physically assaulted at the Karachi City Court premises during the hearing of his bail plea in a case registered against him for allegedly hurting religious sentiments. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, said on X that “a few lawyers launched a life-threatening attack on him within the court premises” and registered a case against them. A video of the incident in question had showed Butt, clad in a shirt with the neckline torn open, attempting to move through a crowd surrounding him. “The HRCP expresses grave concern over the reported physical assault on YouTuber Rajab Butt within the Karachi city court premises and the alleged involvement of members of the legal fraternity,” the HRCP said in a statement today on social media platform X. “Violence, intimidation and vigilantism — particularly inside courts — undermine the rule of law and the right to due process,” it said. The commission urged a “prompt, impartial investigation”, accountability for responsible parties and effective measures to ensure the safety of litigants, lawyers and court officials. The first information report (FIR) of the incident registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer, had named Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers”. Solangi is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt. Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.

      "summary_orig": "Usman Khawaja said on Friday he will retire from international cricket after the fifth and final Ashes clash against England, leaving a legacy as Australia’s first Muslim Test cricketer while lashing out at perceived “racial stereotyping” during his 15-year career. The 39-year-old will pad up for the last time, should he be selected, when the Test gets under way in Sydney on Sunday, ending months of speculation about his future. It would be an 88th Test for the classy left-hander, culminating a career where it began after making his debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2011, also against England. “The number one emotion is contentment. I’m very lucky to have played so many games for Australia the way I have,” Khawaja said. “I hope I have inspired people along the way. “I’m a proud Muslim coloured boy from Pakistan who was told that he would never play for the Australian cricket team. Look at me now, and you can do the same.” Khawaja immigrated to Australia from Islamabad as a child, battling the odds to become the country’s first Pakistan-born, and first Muslim, national player. At one point, he was the only Asian first-class player in Australia and is credited as a role model who opened doors for others. “Usman has made a huge contribution to Australian cricket both through his outstanding achievements as one of our most stylish and resilient batters since his Test debut 15 years ago, and off field, particularly through the Usman Khawaja Foundation,” said Cricket Australia chief Todd Greenberg. “On behalf of Australian cricket I would like to thank and congratulate Usman for all he has achieved.” Khawaja’s foundation helps youths from refugee, immigrant, Indigenous, and poor socioeconomic backgrounds through introductory cricket programs and educational support. ‘Attacked me’ Khawaja, a qualified pilot, has plundered 6,206 runs in Test cricket with 16 centuries, averaging 43.39. He smashed a career-high 232 against Sri Lanka a year ago, but has not made three figures since. The current Ashes series has been a rollercoaster ride, with the veteran batsman coming under scrutiny. He injured his back in the first Test in Perth and was replaced as opener in the second innings by Travis Head who blasted a match-winning century. Khawaja did not feature in the next match at Brisbane and was omitted from the team for the third Test in Adelaide, only to get a lifeline when Steve Smith dropped out ill just before the toss. View this post on Instagram He came in at number four and hit 82 and 40 before making 29 and 0 in the fourth Test at Melbourne. “I’m glad I get to leave on amy own terms, with a little bit of dignity, and go out at the SCG where I love,” he said, while expressing frustration at how he was treated. “When I did my back (in Perth), I hurt my back and had back spasms and it was something I couldn’t control. “The way the media and past players came out and attacked me. I could have copped it for a couple of days but it went on for five days. “The way everyone came out at me about my preparation, ‘he’s not committed to the team. Only worried about himself. Playing a golf competition. He’s selfish, he didn’t train hard enough. He’s lazy’. “These are the same racial stereotypes (I thought we had moved past). “But obviously we haven’t fully moved past that. I haven’t seen anyone treated like that in the Australian cricket team before.” He nevertheless admitted the writing was on the wall during the current Ashes series. “Going into Adelaide and then not being picked initially for that game was probably a sign for me to say ‘all right, it’s time to move on’,” he said. Khawaja also played 40 one-dayers and nine Twenty20 internationals.",

      "summary_orig": "Canada’s transport regulator has asked Air India to investigate an incident of a pilot reporting for duty under the influence of alcohol and failing two breathalyser tests, a person familiar with the matter said. The tests were conducted by Canadian police at Vancouver International Airport, after the pilot was asked to leave the aircraft, the person said. The incident was labelled as a “serious matter” by Transport Canada in a letter to Air India, and authorities are likely to pursue enforcement action, the person added. The person requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Transport Canada did not respond to an emailed request for comment outside regular working hours. In a statement, Air India confirmed the flight from Vancouver to Delhi on December 23 experienced a last-minute delay due to the incident, adding that an alternate pilot was brought in to operate the flight. “The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations,” Air India said. “Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy.” The letter from Transport Canada official Ajit Oommen has asked Air India to provide its findings and details of steps taken to prevent future occurrences by January 26, the person familiar with the matter said. India has been under intense scrutiny since the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner killed 260 people. India’s aviation regulator has flagged multiple safety lapses at the airline, which was previously owned by the government until 2022. Pilots at Air India, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, have also come under scrutiny. This week, India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation sent warning notices to four Air India pilots, flagging “serious safety concerns” related to regulatory compliance and flight crew decision-making. The DGCA said the pilots accepted an aircraft for operation last year despite prior knowledge of “repeated snags” and “existing systems degradations,” according to warning notices dated December 29 seen by Reuters . The aircraft is a Boeing 787 used for long-haul flights, according to Flightradar24.",

Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations,” Air India said. “Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy.” The letter from Transport Canada official Ajit Oommen has asked Air India to provide its findings and details of steps taken to prevent future occurrences by January 26, the person familiar with the matter said. India has been under intense scrutiny since the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner killed 260 people. India’s aviation regulator has flagged multiple safety lapses at the airline, which was previously owned by the government until 2022. Pilots at Air India, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, have also come under scrutiny. This week, India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation sent warning notices to four Air India pilots, flagging “serious safety concerns” related to regulatory compliance and flight crew decision-making. The DGCA said the pilots accepted an aircraft for operation last year despite prior knowledge of “repeated snags” and “existing systems degradations,” according to warning notices dated December 29 seen by Reuters . The aircraft is a Boeing 787 used for long-haul flights, according to Flightradar24.",

      "summary_orig": "• Pak Institute for Peace Studies report counts 699 terrorist attacks in outgoing year • Burden of violence fell on security personnel, constituting over 42pc of fatalities ISLAMABAD: Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year. This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. These are the findings of the “Pakistan Security Report 2025,” released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) on Thursday. Besides rising border violence and militant resurgence, evolving militant tactics from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan fuel a widening security challenge, the report says. The burden of this violence fell disproportionately on the state’s defenders as security and law-enforcement personnel suffered over 42pc of all terrorism-related fatalities, with 437 lives lost, the data shows. The report notes that this stark figure highlights the frontline nature of the conflict and the relentless targeting of army, police and paramilitary forces. Civilians were also heavily affected, with 354 non-combatants losing their lives. Meanwhile, 243 militants were killed, either in suicide attacks they carried out or during retaliatory fire by security forces following some of the terrorist attacks. The PIPS report says that the conflict remained intensely regionalised, with over 95pc of attacks concentrated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Balochistan. In KP, a 40pc rise in incidents illustrated the entrenched presence of groups like the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates. The province experienced the highest number of terrorist incidents in the country in 2025, with 413 attacks. These violent incidents claimed a total of 581 lives and left 698 others injured. The province faced not just more frequent attacks, but more complex ones, including a coordinated wave of assaults across 11 districts on Independence Day — a symbolic challenge to state authority, the report says. In Balochistan, the insurgency evolved qualitatively. The province experienced 254 militant attacks in 2025, resulting in 419 deaths and injuries to 607 others. A 26pc increase in attacks was accompanied by a shift towards high-impact, coordinated operations. Militant groups like the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) moved beyond hit-and-run tactics to execute highway blockades, sieges, and hijackings, directly targeting economic infrastructure and state symbols to amplify their political message and disrupt governance. Sindh province recorded 21 terrorist attacks, including 16 in Karachi, two in Shikarpur, and one each in Hyderabad, Jacobabad, and Jamshoro. These incidents resulted in 14 fatalities and left 17 others injured. Punjab witnessed seven terrorist attacks in 2025, a decline from 11 incidents in the previous year. These attacks killed five people including four militants and one policeman, and injured two policemen. A suicide blast outside the judicial complex housing the Islamabad district and sessions courts killed 12 people. Jamaatul Ahrar, a faction of the banned TTP, claimed the attack. In Gilgit-Baltistan, three attacks were reported, including two in Diamir district and one in Gilgit. These incidents claimed the lives of three security personnel, including two Scouts and one Frontier Corps official, and injured six others. Published in Dawn, January 2nd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• FO says Islamabad advocating peace and diplomacy between allied Gulf states • Confirms Pakistan-India prisoner, nuclear list exchanges amid strained ties • Asks India to share details of Dulhasti-II project under Indus treaty ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office said on Thursday that Pakistan was seeking a diplomatic resolution of the dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen, underscoring Islamabad’s push for dialogue as tensions persisted between two of its closest Gulf partners. The comments, which were the most categorical since the start of the Saudi-UAE row about Pakis­tan’s role in defusing tensions, came during the weekly media briefing by FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi, who said Islamabad was actively engaging both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to encourage restraint and diplomacy. “We have been advocating peace and diplomacy to reach a solution. So, this is part of our exchanges that is taking place between our leadership and the leadership in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” Mr Andrabi said. Tensions peaked on Dec 30 when Saudi Arabia carried out air stri­kes on Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla, targeting what it said were weapons and armoured vehicles allegedly supplied to the Sou­thern Transitional Council (STC). No casualties were reported. Abu Dhabi later announced a voluntary pullout of its remaining counterterrorism units the same day. Thus far, Pakistan has pursued carefully balanced diplomacy. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Dec 30 in Rahim Yar Khan during the Emirati leader’s private visit, officially focusing on bilateral ties but widely viewed as urging de-escalation. A day later, PM Shehbaz spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan was pursuing the issue through multilateral forums as well, including the UN Security Council. At the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, he added, Pakistan advocated “for peace, dialogue, role for diplomacy, including peace­ful settlement for a Yemeni-led, Yemeni-owned political process”. “So, this is in that spirit that we take our role as a mediator and a facilitator for bringing peace and prosperity for Yemen and for the brotherly people of Yemen,” Mr Andrabi said. Exchange of lists Meanwhile, Pakistan and India on Thursday exchanged lists of nuclear installations and prisoners, a long-standing confidence-building practice that has endured despite unprecedented strains in bilateral ties, which brought relations close to a virtual breakdown. Mr Andrabi confirmed the exchange, saying: “Today, on 1st January, as per our bilateral agreements, Pakistan and India exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody. Accordingly, the government of Pakistan today handed over a list of 257 Indian prisoners (58 civilians and 199 fishermen) in Pakistan to the High Commission of India in Islamabad.” He said the move was in line with existing bilateral commitments. “This step is consistent with the provisions of the Consular Access Agreement between Pakistan and India, signed on May 21, 2008, under which both countries are required to exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody twice a year, on Jan 1 and July 1, respectively,” the spokesman added. India said it shared information about 391 civilian prisoners and 33 fishermen in its custody who are Pakistani or believed to be Pakistani. The two sides also exchanged lists of nuclear installations and facilities that cannot be attacked in the event of hostilities, under a separate agreement aimed at reducing the risk of escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours. “Also, on Jan 1, Pakistan and India exchange the lists of their respective nuclear installations pursuant to the Agreement on Prohibition of Attacks against Nuclear Installations and Facilities between Pakistan and India,” Mr Andrabi said. Dulhasti power project The Foreign Office also urged India to respond to formal queries raised by its Indus Waters Commissioner over India’s proposed Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project, saying New Delhi failed to share prior information as required under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan had not been notified in advance about the project, describing the omission as a breach of international obligations. “No prior information or notification was shared with Pakistan with regard to this project (Dulhasti State-II Hydroelectric Project) as mandated under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960,” he said. “Such acts of commission and omission yet again exemplify a complete disregard of international law.” The Dulhasti hydropower project is located on the Chenab River in the disputed region of India-held Jammu and Kashmir. Its original 390-megawatt, run-of-the-river Stage I plant was commissioned in 2007 and operated for years without major objections from Pakistan. However, concerns have surfaced following India’s approval last month of a 260MW Stage II extension. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan’s Indus Waters Commissioner has formally sought details from his Indian counterpart. Calling for immediate engagement, Mr Andrabi said: “We therefore call upon India to urgently return to treaty compliance and respond to the queries raised by our Indus Waters Commissioner in his latest as well as earlier communications.” He also stressed that Pakistan considers the treaty legally binding despite India’s position.

      "summary_en": "• FO says Islamabad advocating peace and diplomacy between allied Gulf states • Confirms Pakistan-India prisoner, nuclear list exchanges amid strained ties • Asks India to share details of Dulhasti-II project under Indus treaty ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office said on Thursday that Pakistan was seeking a diplomatic resolution of the dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen, underscoring Islamabad’s push for dialogue as tensions persisted between two of its closest Gulf partners. The comments, which were the most categorical since the start of the Saudi-UAE row about Pakis­tan’s role in defusing tensions, came during the weekly media briefing by FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi, who said Islamabad was actively engaging both Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to encourage restraint and diplomacy. “We have been advocating peace and diplomacy to reach a solution. So, this is part of our exchanges that is taking place between our leadership and the leadership in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi,” Mr Andrabi said. Tensions peaked on Dec 30 when Saudi Arabia carried out air stri­kes on Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla, targeting what it said were weapons and armoured vehicles allegedly supplied to the Sou­thern Transitional Council (STC). No casualties were reported. Abu Dhabi later announced a voluntary pullout of its remaining counterterrorism units the same day. Thus far, Pakistan has pursued carefully balanced diplomacy. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Dec 30 in Rahim Yar Khan during the Emirati leader’s private visit, officially focusing on bilateral ties but widely viewed as urging de-escalation. A day later, PM Shehbaz spoke by phone with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Mr Andrabi said Pakistan was pursuing the issue through multilateral forums as well, including the UN Security Council. At the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, he added, Pakistan advocated “for peace, dialogue, role for diplomacy, including peace­ful settlement for a Yemeni-led, Yemeni-owned political process”. “So, this is in that spirit that we take our role as a mediator and a facilitator for bringing peace and prosperity for Yemen and for the brotherly people of Yemen,” Mr Andrabi said. Exchange of lists Meanwhile, Pakistan and India on Thursday exchanged lists of nuclear installations and prisoners, a long-standing confidence-building practice that has endured despite unprecedented strains in bilateral ties, which brought relations close to a virtual breakdown. Mr Andrabi confirmed the exchange, saying: “Today, on 1st January, as per our bilateral agreements, Pakistan and India exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody. Accordingly, the government of Pakistan today handed over a list of 257 Indian prisoners (58 civilians and 199 fishermen) in Pakistan to the High Commission of India in Islamabad.” He said the move was in line with existing bilateral commitments. “This step is consistent with the provisions of the Consular Access Agreement between Pakistan and India, signed on May 21, 2008, under which both countries are required to exchange lists of prisoners in each other’s custody twice a year, on Jan 1 and July 1, respectively,” the spokesman added.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Mismanagement at a musical concert organised as part of New Year celebrations at a private housing society turned violent when people were allegedly denied entry despite holding valid tickets. Police sources said tickets for the musical night were sold at Rs5,000 for families and Rs2,000 for individuals. However, tickets were allegedly sold beyond the venue’s capacity and adequate arrangements for spectators were not made. As a result, the area reserved for spectators became overcrowded. A large number of ticket-holders also gathered outside the venue in an attempt to gain entry. Security guards of the housing society stopped the gathering and did not allow them to enter the concert venue, prompting protests by the ticket-holders. It has yet to be established how the protest turned violent and which side took the first step in disrupting law and order. A police contingent was deployed at the venue for security and crowd control, but it reportedly remained a silent spectator until the situation worsened. During the protest, a physical confrontation broke out between the ticket-holders who were denied entry and the security guards. Both sides pelted stones at each other, while the guards also used batons to disperse the crowd. The use of force further angered the gathering, which then began damaging property. Police intervened when the situation went out of control and used force along with anti-riot gear to disperse the protesters. During the police action, a couple of protesters were picked up and taken to police installations. Videos that went viral on social media showed some youngsters throwing stones at the guards and damaging property. In the clips, guards can also be seen chasing and manhandling some of the youths. The housing society management had arranged the musical concert and sold tickets in different categories. Some participants alleged that despite purchasing tickets, they were not allowed entry, which became the initial cause of the disturbance. Sources said the society management was planning to register an FIR, but no official complaint had been lodged so far. According to sources, the management told the police that they would come to lodge a complaint, but it remains unclear when this will happen. Published in Dawn, January 2nd, 2026",
