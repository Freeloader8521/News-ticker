Under the plan, dubbed the \"500,000 drone warrior\" project, the ministry will allocate some 33 billion won ($22.9 million) next year to acquire around 11,000 small commercial drones required for training. The plan comes as part of the military's efforts to enhance combat skills using drones, which have become increasingly effective, low-cost combat equipment in modern warfare. Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back earlier proposed the plan in September, saying nurturing 500,000 drone warriors will not only strengthen the military's drone operation capabilities but also serve as the \"foundation\" for troops to work in relevant industries after their service.",

      "summary_orig": "Double-decker buses were introduced in Karachi on Wednesday, with Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon saying that they would be available to the public from January 1 (Thursday). “Today marks the beginning of double-decker bus [services] in the city. They will be available to the public from tomorrow, and today, they will be tested [on the city’s road],” Memon, who also has the transport portfolio, said while speaking to the media at the inauguration of the bus service in Karachi. Memon inaugurated the bus service along with Sindh Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah. View this post on Instagram The development comes more than a year after the Sindh government announced the initiative in October 2024 for the city of over 23 million that has faced mobility issues for long . Memon recalled that the Sindh government had promised to introduce double-decker buses in Karachi by December 2025, pointing out that today was December 31. He further said the Sindh government aimed to provide transport facilities across the province in 2026, adding that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had also instructed to introduce “double-decker buses on every road in Karachi” in the coming year. Yesterday, while announcing the launch of double-decker buses in the city, Memon said the buses would operate from Malir to Sharea Faisal. He had added that more double-decker buses would be brought to Karachi as these would help solve traffic problems. His spokesperson, Hussain Mansoor, separately told Dawn that the buses would run between Zainab Market in Saddar and Model Colony. He further said that stops were designated for double-decker buses along this route at/near Malir Halt, airport, Colony Gate, Natha Khan Bridge, Drigh Road, Nursery, Baloch Colony and Finance and Trade Centre. Meanwhile, a handout issued by Memon’s office said the double-decker bus service was “being introduced again for Karachiites after 65 years”. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, he said new routes for electronic buses would also be designated in Sindh, including Karachi, from next week, the minister said. Acknowledging that public transport was a necessity, he expressed the Sindh government’s intention to facilitate the public in this regard. Without specifically mentioning any of the bus services launched by the government, he said these transport facilities were being provided at a subsidised rate. “The Sindh government pays that subsidy to facilitate passengers,” the minister said, further claiming that over 125,000 commuters were using transport services being provided under the People’s Bus Service project in Karachi daily. In response to a question about criticism of the poor condition of roads, Memon said the Sindh cabinet had allocated more than Rs9 billion out of the budget just for roads in industrial areas to address complaints. He said work on several other projects was also under way, particularly mentioning the Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway in Karachi. When asked whether double-decker buses’ routes would also cover tourist spots in Sindh to present a “positive image” of the province, the minister replied, “Yes, definitely. We aim to cover not just tourist spots but every road.” ‘A gift from CM’ A handout from the Sindh CM’s office termed double-decker buses “a gift” from the provincial chief executive. The statement quoted CM Murad as saying that Karachiites had the right to better transport facilities and that the new bus service would make commuting easier for them. “The city is now not just running, it’s progressing. Today, a bus has started running, and tomorrow, the city will transform. “Better transport facilities for Karachi is not a mere promise, it is now becoming a reality,” the CM was quoted as saying. He further said that better facilities strengthen cities, expressing the ambition to make Karachi join the ranks of modern cities. Additional input from Imtiaz Ali",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: A first information report (FIR) has been registered against several lawyers for allegedly assaulting a station house officer (SHO) after a case was registered against them and others for roughing up YouTuber Rajab Butt during a court appearance in Karachi, it emerged on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it emerged that a case was registered against more than a dozen lawyers after Butt was physically assaulted during a court appearance in Karachi on Monday. The FIR nominated Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah Chandio and “another 15-20 lawyers”. Subsequently, lawyers stormed the City Courts police station demanding a case against the YouTuber and others. They also staged a protest on M.A. Jinnah Road outside the City Courts against the SHO of the City Courts police station for allegedly failing to register their FIR. The fresh FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn and which emerged on Wednesday, was registered on the complaint of City Court SHO Jahangir Bhutto. The FIR was registered under sections 337-A (punishment of shajjah), Section 504 (intentional insult), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 147 (punishment for rioting), and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of their duty) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The complainant said that on December 30 (Tuesday), he received a call while out patrolling that “around 40-50 lawyers“ led by Abdul Fatah Chandio, Advocate Abdul Wahab Rajper, and Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi had forced their way into the Risala police station, which had been temporarily set up at the City Courts police station. He alleged that they were creating a ruckus and demanding that a FIR be registered against Butt and his lawyer. “When I reached the police station around 2pm, the lawyers demanded to know why I had allowed a FIR to be registered against them,“ Bhutto said. “They asked me to register a FIR against Butt and his lawyer,” he added. “I tried to make them understand that a case had already been registered [..] upon hearing this, they started verbally abusing me and then proceeded to kick and punch me,“ he recalled. He said that the lawyers left after the police staff came to his rescue. “However, they started chanting slogans and gave me death threats as they marched out of the station,” he said. The FIR nominated three people — Chandio, Rajper, and Solangi, along with 40-50 others, who were unnamed. It should be mentioned that Solangi was named in the case registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer. He is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments, for which the YouTuber had appeared in court on Monday. Bhutto said that the accused had “stopped me from performing my duty, gave me death threats, assaulted me and verbally abused me“. Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, had registered a case against Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers” under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 337-A (Punishment of shajjah) of the PPC. Ashfaq stated in the FIR that his client had arrived at City Courts at 9am to seek bail, but when he reached the inner premises near the West building, lawyers Solangi and Fatah, along with 15-20 other lawyers, attacked and started beating the YouTuber, causing him injuries. “The attackers assaulted me as well and other lawyers from my office,” he added. He alleged that during the attack, Butt was holding a bag containing Rs300,000, which was snatched from him. He said that Solangi later returned the bag, but the cash was missing. Advocate Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.",

Ashfaq stated in the FIR that his client had arrived at City Courts at 9am to seek bail, but when he reached the inner premises near the West building, lawyers Solangi and Fatah, along with 15-20 other lawyers, attacked and started beating the YouTuber, causing him injuries. “The attackers assaulted me as well and other lawyers from my office,” he added. He alleged that during the attack, Butt was holding a bag containing Rs300,000, which was snatched from him. He said that Solangi later returned the bag, but the cash was missing. Advocate Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.",

      "summary_orig": "Winter’s first spell of rain drenched parts of Karachi late on Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, bringing a dip in temperature. Light to moderate rain was reported in Old City area, Lyari, Keamari, Mauripur, DHA, Clifton, Saddar, North Nazimabad, Malir, Mehmoodabad and Akhtar Colony. According to data released by the Pakistan Meteorological Department at 8am on Wednesday, Keamari received the highest level (6mm) of rain. Masroor Base received 5mm while Orangi Town, DHA and Saddar received 3mm of rainfall. Korangi and Faisal Base received 2mm, and 1mm was recorded across Old Area Airport, Jinnah Terminal, University Road, Gulshan-i-Hadeed and Surjani Town. Rainfall was also reported in parts of Sindh. PMD data showed that Rohri recorded the highest rainfall at 32mm, followed by Sukkur at 24mm. A total of 19mm was recorded in Hyderabad (13mm in the city and 6mm in the airport area), 11mm in Tando Jam, 10mm in Mohenjo Daro, 8mm in Khairpur, 6mm in Larkana, 5mm in Jacobabad, 4mm in Mirpur Khas and 3mm in Dadu and Padidan. Trace amounts of rainfall were also recorded in Sakrand and Thatta. Asked if more cool weather and rain were forecast for Karachi, PMD spokesperson Anjum Nazir Zaighum said on Wednesday that westerly winds had been affecting the country since Dec 29, “the effect of which we saw last night in Karachi”. “There has been light rain in almost all areas of Karachi,” he said, but added that this situation was almost over. He said that clouds were still present and that some light rain might be seen in some areas, which would be over by this evening. The spokesperson also said that a drop in temperature would be felt in Karachi from Jan 4 or 5, when this weather event left Pakistan and moved eastward. He added that when the northern winds, known as Siberian winds, began to impact the country, Karachi would experience increased cold weather. “In the coming days, Karachi’s temperature could go into the single digits,” he said. Separately, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana, in a post on X, urged people to “exercise caution when using electrical appliances“ in light of the rain. “A brief spell of rain was recorded in various areas across Karachi; K-Electric’s power system has remained stable,” he said. He further advised people to “maintain safe distance from power transmission installation.” “Obtaining electricity through illegal means and using hooked connections can cause fatal accidents,” he said. On Sunday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had forecast rain and thunderstorms, with snowfall over the hills, in most parts of the country during this week. In Sindh, it predicted isolated light rain or drizzle in Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Larkana, Thatta, Badin and adjoining areas on Dec 30 (Tuesday).",

      "summary_orig": "Bashir Ahmed lives in a two-room government quarter in Quetta. A father of five children who are currently on winter vacation, he is constantly being asked when they will travel to Peshawar. Before annual examinations, the children were planning to spend their winter vacations with cousins in Peshawar. Ahmed has also been invited to the wedding of a close relative, scheduled in Peshawar for the first week of January. In his words, his wife and children look at him expectantly every day when he returns from work, hoping that their tickets to Peshawar have been booked and the date for their journey has been fixed. “I wanted to take my family to Peshawar on the Jaffar Express … It is the only train available for travel to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as all others have been discontinued,” Ahmed tells Dawn . But how can he think of putting his family aboard the train that comes under attack near the Bolan Pass on a weekly basis? Rocket attacks, railway tracks and bridges being blown up, and attempted terrorist attacks on the train have become a commonplace occurrence now, with most people too scared to take the Jaffar Express. This is not a new phenomenon: those old enough to remember would recall that attacks on railway tracks and gas pipelines have been a standard occurrence since the insurgency started in Balochistan in the year 2000. However, passenger trains running between Quetta and the rest of the country have not faced such a volley of attacks since the 1970s, when the province experienced its first major insurgency, during the regime of then-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. The trigger was the first, and deadliest, attack of the year — the hijacking of the Peshawar-bound passenger train by Baloch separatist terrorists on March 11. At the time, the train was carrying around 500 passengers, including women, children and security personnel. Passengers who were rescued from Jaffar Express train after it was attacked by terrorists, walk with their belongings at the Railway Station in Quetta, March 12, 2025. — Reuters/File It was stopped and held hostage — along with its passengers — between the Hirk and Mushkaf areas, close to a tunnel. The hostage situation lasted for two days, resulting in several casualties among passengers and security personnel. However, a subsequent operation by security forces prevented any further loss of life, with the train and the remaining passengers being successfully rescued. “The hijacking of the Jaffar Express was the biggest and worst terrorist incident to have taken place in Balochistan during 2025,” a senior security official tells Dawn , adding that since then, the Jaffar Express had become a primary target for the separatist elements. A soldier stands guard at a railway station in the Sibi district of Balochistan on March 12, during a security operation against terrorists a day after they hijacked a passenger train. — AFP/File Deadly alternative One might think that if the train is no longer a safe bet, one can always travel by road. But there is a catch: passenger coaches that run between Quetta and every major city of Pakistan have also been in terrorists’ crosshairs, with several tragic incidents occurring over the past 18 months in which armed men allegedly intercepted coaches and, after checking identity papers, dragged out passengers who did not belong to Balochistan and executed them. A photo of the bus carrying students after the explosion in Khuzdar on May 21. — DawnNewsTV/File The situation worsened when bomb and suicide attacks and firing incidents started taking place on the national highways that link Balochistan with other provinces. The takeover of highways by armed groups further created fear among the people, prompting the Balochistan government to impose a ban on night travel by coaches, buses and other forms of transport. ‘Business as usual’ But railway authorities have a different perspective on travel via the Jaffar Express. While acknowledging the frequent attacks on railway tracks and bridges, they insist that passenger numbers on the train are still quite encouraging. “We have bookings for the Jaffar Express up to Jan 10,” Muhammad Kashif, the railway chief controller in Quetta, tells Dawn . While that may be true, it is also a fact that during the past year, the line used by the Jaffar Express witnessed at least 10 incidents of track blasting , which sometimes led to the suspension of train services. Similarly, at least one railway bridge was blown up , while four derailment incidents also took place at different areas along the route this year. An image of a crater left after a railway track was attacked with a bomb in Sukkur on June 18. — Waseem Shamsi/File The train also faced sabotage twice, in the Shikarpur and Jacobabad areas of Sindh, while in a separate incident, five bogies were derailed and some passengers were injured in Jacobabad. When asked why militants were only targeting the Jaffar Express, Quetta Divisional Superintendent (DS) Imran Hayat said that while its final destination was Peshawar, the train travels through Punjab. “This is not something new; such attacks have been taking place here since 1877,” he says, referring to the time when the British Raj first built a railway through the Bolan Pass, connecting Sibi and Quetta. At the time, the tribes living in the area considered it an occupation of their lands and resisted the only way they knew how — by attacking the train, which was the main physical manifestation of the colonisers that passed through their territory. In view of such attacks, the colonial rulers established a levies force, recruiting people from local tribes to protect the railway lines and tunnels built through the Bolan Pass. Locals wait as the road is blocked after railway tracks collapsed, a day after separatist militants conducted deadly attacks, in Bolan district of Balochistan on August 27, 2024. — Reuters/File According to Hayat, this route was actually built by the British Empire for strategic, rather than commercial, purposes. The line passes through difficult mountainous terrain, but with towering mountains on both sides of the track, it is tough going. Security forces are positioned in Aab-i-Gum, Mach and Kolpur, from where they monitor the line and provide security. The March 11 hijacking occurred in just such an area, near a tunnel surrounded by mountains and difficult terrain. Officials Dawn spoke to attributed the casualties incurred in the incident to the remote location of the terrorist attack, which was eventually put down by SSG commandos. According to Hayat, there has been no major attack on the Jaffar Express since the hijacking attempt in March. However, track blasting, damage to railway bridges and other disruptions have occurred, but these, he claims, were not fatal. The only exception was a derailment following a blast on the railway track in Dasht area of Mastung district, in which eight passengers were slightly injured. A photo of the Jaffar Express after a blast derailed its bogies near the Spezand station in the Dasht tehsil of Balochistan’s Mastung district on September 23. — DawnNewsTV/File “Many other attacks were staged on the track and train in Nasirabad, Jaffarabad and Kachhi districts, but no significant losses took place. Sometimes, the train service between Quetta and the rest of the country had to be suspended as a result of the track being blown up,” a railway official says. Presently, three trains run from Quetta: the Jaffar Express to Peshawar, the Bolan Mail to Karachi and the Chaman Passenger to the border with Afghanistan. All other trains, including the Akbar Bugti, Chiltan Express, Awami Express, Sindh Express, Quetta Passenger and Harnai Passenger, were cancelled by Pakistan Railways over the past five years or so. ‘Symbolic, strategic importance’ Security experts believe that the Jaffar Express is targeted due to its strategic role: security personnel, including army troops, use it to travel to Punjab and KP. People living in Balochistan also use the Jaffar Express for travel. Muhammad Amir Rana, a security analyst and director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) in Islamabad, is of the opinion that the train passes through a critical railway route, which connects Balochistan with the rest of the country. It is widely used by Baloch students studying in Punjab, Punjab-based families and lower-ranking public sector employees, including personnel from various security services. This civilian-heavy passenger profile gives the route both symbolic and strategic importance, making it a prime target for insurgent groups. A soldier stands guard near a train containing empty coffins that are dispatched to Bolan where a passenger train that was attacked by separatist militants, at a railway station in Quetta on March 12. — Reuters “An attack on the Jaffar Express carries repercussions far beyond Balochistan. Its impact is felt strongly in Punjab, which is precisely what insurgents seek: to widen the psychological and political footprint of violence and draw national attention,” Rana said, explaining why the train remains a preferred target for miscreants. The most dangerous stretch of the route passes through areas where multiple insurgent groups, including the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Baloch Republican Army (BRA) and their allied factions, have a significant presence. A soldier (L) works to evacuate freed train passengers at the Mach railway station, which has been turned into a makeshift hospital, after Pakistani security forces freed nearly 80 passengers following a security operation against armed militants who ambushed the train in the remote mountainous area, in Mach on March 11. — AFP/File Securing this corridor is particularly challenging due to the rugged terrain, limited access points and the vast expanse of difficult geography. But, he says, “despite these risks, the state cannot afford to suspend or abandon the service. Doing so would amount to conceding space and narrative to the insurgents, granting them a symbolic victory and reinforcing their ability to disrupt vital civilian connectivity.” Best-laid plans For Bashir Ahmed — the father of five — all of these are risks he can’t afford. “I cannot take the risk of travelling with my family on the Jaffar Express or by coach, nor can I afford to travel by air, as all airlines, even PIA, have increased the prices of air tickets,” he said. Even ministers and MPAs have taken this issue to the assembly, saying they cannot purchase such exorbitantly priced air tickets. “How can a government employee travel with his family by air?” Ahmed asks, before revealing that he has cancelled his plans to visit Peshawar and will spend the winter vacations in Quetta instead.",

At the time, the train was carrying around 500 passengers, including women, children and security personnel. Passengers who were rescued from Jaffar Express train after it was attacked by terrorists, walk with their belongings at the Railway Station in Quetta, March 12, 2025. — Reuters/File It was stopped and held hostage — along with its passengers — between the Hirk and Mushkaf areas, close to a tunnel. The hostage situation lasted for two days, resulting in several casualties among passengers and security personnel. However, a subsequent operation by security forces prevented any further loss of life, with the train and the remaining passengers being successfully rescued. “The hijacking of the Jaffar Express was the biggest and worst terrorist incident to have taken place in Balochistan during 2025,” a senior security official tells Dawn , adding that since then, the Jaffar Express had become a primary target for the separatist elements.

But there is a catch: passenger coaches that run between Quetta and every major city of Pakistan have also been in terrorists’ crosshairs, with several tragic incidents occurring over the past 18 months in which armed men allegedly intercepted coaches and, after checking identity papers, dragged out passengers who did not belong to Balochistan and executed them. A photo of the bus carrying students after the explosion in Khuzdar on May 21. — DawnNewsTV/File The situation worsened when bomb and suicide attacks and firing incidents started taking place on the national highways that link Balochistan with other provinces. The takeover of highways by armed groups further created fear among the people, prompting the Balochistan government to impose a ban on night travel by coaches, buses and other forms of transport. ‘Business as usual’ But railway authorities have a different perspective on travel via the Jaffar Express. While acknowledging the frequent attacks on railway tracks and bridges, they insist that passenger numbers on the train are still quite encouraging. “We have bookings for the Jaffar Express up to Jan 10,” Muhammad Kashif, the railway chief controller in Quetta, tells Dawn . While that may be true, it is also a fact that during the past year, the line used by the Jaffar Express witnessed at least 10 incidents of track blasting , which sometimes led to the suspension of train services. Similarly, at least one railway bridge was blown up , while four derailment incidents also took place at different areas along the route this year. An image of a crater left after a railway track was attacked with a bomb in Sukkur on June 18. — Waseem Shamsi/File The train also faced sabotage twice, in the Shikarpur and Jacobabad areas of Sindh, while in a separate incident, five bogies were derailed and some passengers were injured in Jacobabad. When asked why militants were only targeting the Jaffar Express, Quetta Divisional Superintendent (DS) Imran Hayat said that while its final destination was Peshawar, the train travels through Punjab. “This is not something new; such attacks have been taking place here since 1877,” he says, referring to the time when the British Raj first built a railway through the Bolan Pass, connecting Sibi and Quetta. At the time, the tribes living in the area considered it an occupation of their lands and resisted the only way they knew how — by attacking the train, which was the main physical manifestation of the colonisers that passed through their territory. In view of such attacks, the colonial rulers established a levies force, recruiting people from local tribes to protect the railway lines and tunnels built through the Bolan Pass. Locals wait as the road is blocked after railway tracks collapsed, a day after separatist militants conducted deadly attacks, in Bolan district of Balochistan on August 27, 2024. — Reuters/File According to Hayat, this route was actually built by the British Empire for strategic, rather than commercial, purposes. The line passes through difficult mountainous terrain, but with towering mountains on both sides of the track, it is tough going. Security forces are positioned in Aab-i-Gum, Mach and Kolpur, from where they monitor the line and provide security. The March 11 hijacking occurred in just such an area, near a tunnel surrounded by mountains and difficult terrain. Officials Dawn spoke to attributed the casualties incurred in the incident to the remote location of the terrorist attack, which was eventually put down by SSG commandos. According to Hayat, there has been no major attack on the Jaffar Express since the hijacking attempt in March. However, track blasting, damage to railway bridges and other disruptions have occurred, but these, he claims, were not fatal. The only exception was a derailment following a blast on the railway track in Dasht area of Mastung district, in which eight passengers were slightly injured. A photo of the Jaffar Express after a blast derailed its bogies near the Spezand station in the Dasht tehsil of Balochistan’s Mastung district on September 23. — DawnNewsTV/File “Many other attacks were staged on the track and train in Nasirabad, Jaffarabad and Kachhi districts, but no significant losses took place. Sometimes, the train service between Quetta and the rest of the country had to be suspended as a result of the track being blown up,” a railway official says. Presently, three trains run from Quetta: the Jaffar Express to Peshawar, the Bolan Mail to Karachi and the Chaman Passenger to the border with Afghanistan. All other trains, including the Akbar Bugti, Chiltan Express, Awami Express, Sindh Express, Quetta Passenger and Harnai Passenger, were cancelled by Pakistan Railways over the past five years or so. ‘Symbolic, strategic importance’ Security experts believe that the Jaffar Express is targeted due to its strategic role: security personnel, including army troops, use it to travel to Punjab and KP. People living in Balochistan also use the Jaffar Express for travel. Muhammad Amir Rana, a security analyst and director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) in Islamabad, is of the opinion that the train passes through a critical railway route, which connects Balochistan with the rest of the country. It is widely used by Baloch students studying in Punjab, Punjab-based families and lower-ranking public sector employees, including personnel from various security services. This civilian-heavy passenger profile gives the route both symbolic and strategic importance, making it a prime target for insurgent groups. A soldier stands guard near a train containing empty coffins that are dispatched to Bolan where a passenger train that was attacked by separatist militants, at a railway station in Quetta on March 12. — Reuters “An attack on the Jaffar Express carries repercussions far beyond Balochistan. Its impact is felt strongly in Punjab, which is precisely what insurgents seek: to widen the psychological and political footprint of violence and draw national attention,” Rana said, explaining why the train remains a preferred target for miscreants. The most dangerous stretch of the route passes through areas where multiple insurgent groups, including the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Baloch Republican Army (BRA) and their allied factions, have a significant presence. A soldier (L) works to evacuate freed train passengers at the Mach railway station, which has been turned into a makeshift hospital, after Pakistani security forces freed nearly 80 passengers following a security operation against armed militants who ambushed the train in the remote mountainous area, in Mach on March 11. — AFP/File Securing this corridor is particularly challenging due to the rugged terrain, limited access points and the vast expanse of difficult geography. But, he says, “despite these risks, the state cannot afford to suspend or abandon the service. Doing so would amount to conceding space and narrative to the insurgents, granting them a symbolic victory and reinforcing their ability to disrupt vital civilian connectivity.” Best-laid plans For Bashir Ahmed — the father of five — all of these are risks he can’t afford. “I cannot take the risk of travelling with my family on the Jaffar Express or by coach, nor can I afford to travel by air, as all airlines, even PIA, have increased the prices of air tickets,” he said. Even ministers and MPAs have taken this issue to the assembly, saying they cannot purchase such exorbitantly priced air tickets. “How can a government employee travel with his family by air?” Ahmed asks, before revealing that he has cancelled his plans to visit Peshawar and will spend the winter vacations in Quetta instead.",

      "summary_orig": "Medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, expects to be barred from operating in Gaza once it misses Wednesday’s deadline to comply with new registration rules for relief agencies that Israel claims are meant to prevent Hamas from exploiting international aid. The organisation, which provided care to nearly half a million people during a two-year Gaza Strip war, says deregistration would cut off life-saving medical assistance for hundreds of thousands in the Palestinian enclave. COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, said MSF had refused to provide Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Ministry with a list of its employees as required. The Diaspora Affairs Ministry claims individuals affiliated with MSF have links to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. MSF rejects the accusations as unsubstantiated. When asked, MSF did not state if it had provided names. In May, aid agency Oxfam said the requirement to share staff details raised protection concerns, following attacks on humanitarian workers in Gaza. MSF told Reuters that the impact would be devastating if it is barred from operating, as the humanitarian crisis deepens. “If MSF is prevented from working in Gaza, it will deprive hundreds of thousands of people from accessing medical care,” the group said, highlighting the stakes for civilians already struggling to access health services. Dozens of other international aid groups are at risk of deregistration, potentially forcing closures or restrictions on operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, within 60 days, if they did not comply by December 31 with new criteria set by Israeli authorities. While some international aid groups have been registered under the system that was introduced in March, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Oxfam told Reuters they too are preparing for possible deregistration. If that happened, the NRC said it would likely be forced to shutter its East Jerusalem office and will not be able to bring foreign aid workers into Gaza. It has around 200 local staff as well as 35 international staff across Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. “At a time when needs in Gaza far exceed the available aid and services, Israel has and will continue to block life-saving aid from entering,” Shaina Low, spokesperson for the NRC, said. Oxfam’s Policy Lead in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Bushra Khalidi told Reuters that its Palestinian staff and partners would continue supporting communities but said forcing aid agencies to rely on obtaining supplies locally — as they will not be permitted to bring in goods from outside — was part of a wider dismantling of the humanitarian aid system. On Tuesday, the British Foreign Office published a statement alongside France, Canada and others saying Israel should allow NGOs to work in Israel in a sustained and predictable way, and shared concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. COGAT said 4,200 aid trucks will continue to enter every week via the UN, donor countries, the private sector, and more than 20 international organisations that have been reregistered.",

POS machines digitally record transactions, through touchscreen/terminal, barcode scanners, card readers, etc., and includes receipt printers. Due to POS machines all business transactions can be recorded and taxable income is easily traced by the FBR. The announcement was made during a rally held from Aabpara Chowk to old Embassy Road against mandatory installation of POS. They tried to enter the Red Zone, but they were not allowed. The traders had announced to hold a protest demonstration in front of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) office at Constitution Avenue, but the authorities stopped them from entering the Red Zone. Hold rally from Aabpara Chowk to old Embassy Road against mandatory installation of POS The rally was stopped by a heavy police contingent near Serena Hotel, following which traders staged a strong protest at the same spot and held a protest gathering. The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran and Traders Action gathering (TAC). A large number of trader representatives and shopkeepers from Islamabad and Rawalpindi participated in the rally. Leaders of various traders’ associations from Islamabad and Rawalpindi addressed the gathering, including representatives of market associations and chambers of small traders. Addressing the rally, President TAC, Islamabad, Ajmal Baloch said that the government should immediately withdraw what he termed the “black law” of installing POS devices. In a fiery speech he called for the passage of legislation awarding the death penalty for corruption. Citing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, he claimed that corruption worth Rs53 trillion occurs annually across the country, and FBR had the largest share. “These corrupt elements had now turned towards traders, and that the installation of POS machines at small shops will only create new options to fleece the traders for bribery,” Mr Baloch added. He informed about some incidents involving FBR, that legally imported tyres worth millions of rupees were seized, with only half returned while the remainder were allegedly distributed among corrupt officials. Ajmal Baloch also alleged that children of thousands of FBR employees were studying abroad. “We have  a simple demand why there should not be any inquiry into their assets, claiming that even low-ranking staff own luxury vehicles worth millions of rupees,” he said. He further alleged that customs authorities had seized 26,000 non-custom-paid vehicles that were being used by bureaucrats and their relatives. He warned that if the FBR attempted to install POS machines by force or seal any small shop in Islamabad, traders would resist strongly. The leaders of the protest announced that in the next phase of protests they plan to block Kashmir Highway and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on Jan 16. The speakers said that if FBR continued its oppressive policies, traders would call a nationwide shutter-down strike and stage a protest at D-Chowk. They demanded the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to protect traders from corruption and high-handedness by the tax authorities. Published in Dawn, December 31st, 2025",

      "title_orig": "UAE says it is withdrawing its remaining forces in Yemen ‘voluntarily’ after tensions flare with Saudi Arabia",
      "summary_orig": "The United Arab Emirates said on Tuesday it was pulling out its remaining forces in Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for UAE forces to leave the country within 24 hours. “In light of recent developments and their potential implications for the safety and effectiveness of counterterrorism missions, the Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism personnel in Yemen of its own volition, in a manner that ensures the safety of its personnel and in coordination with the concerned partners,” said the UAE’s Ministry of Defence on X. The statement added that UAE’s presence in Yemen was limited to specialised personnel “as part of counterterrorism efforts, in coordination with relevant international partners”. The Gulf monarchy also rejected Saudi Arabia’s accusations that it supplied weapons to a Yemeni separatist faction amid rising tensions between the two Gulf monarchies. “The shipment in question did not contain any weapons, and the vehicles unloaded were not intended for any Yemeni party,” said the UAE. Saudi Arabia declared a UAE-backed separatist advance in Yemen a threat to the kingdom’s national security and called Abu Dhabi’s actions “highly dangerous”, as the rivalry between the Gulf monarchies boiled over into an open dispute. The strongly worded foreign ministry statement came hours after the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it had struck a United Arab Emirates weapons shipment destined for separatist forces. A screenshot from footage released by the Saudi-led Coalition shows what is says is vehicles parked, after they were unloaded from the “Greeland” ship, which arrived from Al Fujairah port to Al Mukalla Port, carrying what it described as foreign military support to UAE-backed southern separatists. — Reuters “The steps taken by the UAE are considered highly dangerous,” it said, adding “the Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat”. In recent weeks, separatists seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen, have made sweeping territorial gains in a lightning offensive. “Given the danger and escalation posed by these weapons… the coalition air forces carried out a limited military operation this morning targeting weapons and combat vehicles that had been unloaded from the two ships at the port of Al-Mukalla,” the alliance said, according to the Saudi state news agency. AFP footage of the port showed dozens of parked military vehicles and pick-ups, several of which were burnt out and smouldering as workers hosed them down. After the strikes, the leader of Yemen’s presidential council, which sits atop the Aden-based government, declared a state of emergency and cancelled a security pact with Abu Dhabi after the forces of the Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized swaths of territory. The STC is also a key member of the government - a fractious patchwork of groups held together by its opposition to the Houthi rebels who control swaths of northern and western Yemen including the capital Sanaa. Oil prices steady amid rising tensions in Gulf Despite growing tensions between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, oil prices saw little change as investors took stock of the situation in the Middle East. Brent crude futures for February delivery, which expire on Tuesday, were up by 24 cents, or 0.39 per cent, at $62.18 a barrel at 1315 GMT (6:15pm PKT). The more active March contract was up by 26 cents, or 0.42pc, at $61.75. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 26 cents, or 0.45pc, to $58.34. The Brent and WTI benchmarks settled more than 2pc higher in the previous session as Saudi Arabia launched today’s airstrikes. Smoke rises in the aftermath of a Saudi-led coalition airstrike, which targeted what it described as foreign military support to UAE-backed southern separatists, in Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla. — Reuters Despite renewed fears of potential supply disruptions, perceptions of an oversupplied global market remain and could cap prices, analysts say. Prices are likely to trend downwards in the first quarter of 2026 because of a “growing oil glut”, said Marex analyst Ed Meir. Meanwhile, Gulf equity indexes mostly ended lower on Tuesday as tension flared between regional oil powers and neighbours Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Dubai’s main share index retreated 2pc, LSEG data showed, while Abu Dhabi’s main index and Saudi Arabia both dropped 1pc each. The Dubai index saw its biggest daily decline since June. Blue-chip developer Emaar Properties fell 2.8pc and Sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank lost 2.3pc. Among Saudi shares, Saudi Arabian Mining Co slipped 2.6pc and Al Rajhi Bank eased 0.3pc. Oil giant Saudi Aramco was down 0.3pc. ‘A red line’ Saudi Arabia and the UAE - traditionally close allies who joined forces against the Houthis - have increasingly been at odds over the conflict as well as the war in Sudan. “The Kingdom expresses its disappointment by the actions taken by the brotherly United Arab Emirates, pressuring the Southern Transitional Council’s forces to conduct military operations on the southern border of the Kingdom,” the Saudi foreign ministry statement said. It called them “a threat to the Kingdom’s national security, as well as to security and stability in the Republic of Yemen and the region,” it said. Abu Dhabi denied that it was behind the separatist offensive, saying it “condemns the claims made regarding the exertion of pressure or direction on any Yemeni party to carry out military operations that affect the security of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”. A source close to the Saudi military coalition told AFP on Tuesday after the strikes that a diplomatic solution remained on the table. “The coalition was forced to do that. All diplomacy efforts met deaf ears,” said the source. “Diplomacy is still an option to stop any further escalation.” 24-hour deadline Riyadh also backed a demand from Yemen’s presidential council for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country within 24 hours, and urged Abu Dhabi to cut off military and financial support for Yemeni groups. Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, issued decrees on Tuesday announcing a 90-day state of emergency and annulling a security pact with the UAE over the separatists’ advance. The STC members of the council later rejected the decision, saying the move threatened to “drag Yemen into new confrontations”. Following the strikes, broadcasters in Saudi Arabia aired segments showing surveillance footage of the alleged Emirati ships delivering the combat equipment to the port of Mukalla in southern Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition said the ships had arrived from the UAE port of Fujairah, adding that the operation was conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law and without causing collateral damage. An official at the port said they had received an evacuation warning. ‘Unacceptable to God’ Abdullah Bazuhair, whose home overlooks the port, showed AFP the damage to his property, with windows blasted clear out of the walls and glass strewn across the floor. The strikes were “unacceptable to God” he said, adding “the children were terrified and the women frightened”. The Saudi-led coalition had warned that it would back Yemen’s government in any military confrontation with separatist forces and urged them to withdraw from recently seized territories in Hadramawt and Mahra governorates. Tuesday’s strike came days after reported Saudi air raids on separatist positions in resource-rich Hadramawt last week. A Yemeni military official said on Friday that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were massed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory.",

The strongly worded foreign ministry statement came hours after the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it had struck a United Arab Emirates weapons shipment destined for separatist forces. A screenshot from footage released by the Saudi-led Coalition shows what is says is vehicles parked, after they were unloaded from the “Greeland” ship, which arrived from Al Fujairah port to Al Mukalla Port, carrying what it described as foreign military support to UAE-backed southern separatists. — Reuters “The steps taken by the UAE are considered highly dangerous,” it said, adding “the Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat”. In recent weeks, separatists seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen, have made sweeping territorial gains in a lightning offensive. “Given the danger and escalation posed by these weapons… the coalition air forces carried out a limited military operation this morning targeting weapons and combat vehicles that had been unloaded from the two ships at the port of Al-Mukalla,” the alliance said, according to the Saudi state news agency. AFP footage of the port showed dozens of parked military vehicles and pick-ups, several of which were burnt out and smouldering as workers hosed them down. After the strikes, the leader of Yemen’s presidential council, which sits atop the Aden-based government, declared a state of emergency and cancelled a security pact with Abu Dhabi after the forces of the Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized swaths of territory. The STC is also a key member of the government - a fractious patchwork of groups held together by its opposition to the Houthi rebels who control swaths of northern and western Yemen including the capital Sanaa. Oil prices steady amid rising tensions in Gulf Despite growing tensions between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, oil prices saw little change as investors took stock of the situation in the Middle East. Brent crude futures for February delivery, which expire on Tuesday, were up by 24 cents, or 0.39 per cent, at $62.18 a barrel at 1315 GMT (6:15pm PKT). The more active March contract was up by 26 cents, or 0.42pc, at $61.75. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 26 cents, or 0.45pc, to $58.34. The Brent and WTI benchmarks settled more than 2pc higher in the previous session as Saudi Arabia launched today’s airstrikes. Smoke rises in the aftermath of a Saudi-led coalition airstrike, which targeted what it described as foreign military support to UAE-backed southern separatists, in Yemen’s southern port of Mukalla. — Reuters Despite renewed fears of potential supply disruptions, perceptions of an oversupplied global market remain and could cap prices, analysts say. Prices are likely to trend downwards in the first quarter of 2026 because of a “growing oil glut”, said Marex analyst Ed Meir. Meanwhile, Gulf equity indexes mostly ended lower on Tuesday as tension flared between regional oil powers and neighbours Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Dubai’s main share index retreated 2pc, LSEG data showed, while Abu Dhabi’s main index and Saudi Arabia both dropped 1pc each. The Dubai index saw its biggest daily decline since June. Blue-chip developer Emaar Properties fell 2.8pc and Sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank lost 2.3pc. Among Saudi shares, Saudi Arabian Mining Co slipped 2.6pc and Al Rajhi Bank eased 0.3pc. Oil giant Saudi Aramco was down 0.3pc. ‘A red line’ Saudi Arabia and the UAE - traditionally close allies who joined forces against the Houthis - have increasingly been at odds over the conflict as well as the war in Sudan. “The Kingdom expresses its disappointment by the actions taken by the brotherly United Arab Emirates, pressuring the Southern Transitional Council’s forces to conduct military operations on the southern border of the Kingdom,” the Saudi foreign ministry statement said. It called them “a threat to the Kingdom’s national security, as well as to security and stability in the Republic of Yemen and the region,” it said. Abu Dhabi denied that it was behind the separatist offensive, saying it “condemns the claims made regarding the exertion of pressure or direction on any Yemeni party to carry out military operations that affect the security of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”. A source close to the Saudi military coalition told AFP on Tuesday after the strikes that a diplomatic solution remained on the table. “The coalition was forced to do that. All diplomacy efforts met deaf ears,” said the source. “Diplomacy is still an option to stop any further escalation.” 24-hour deadline Riyadh also backed a demand from Yemen’s presidential council for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country within 24 hours, and urged Abu Dhabi to cut off military and financial support for Yemeni groups. Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, issued decrees on Tuesday announcing a 90-day state of emergency and annulling a security pact with the UAE over the separatists’ advance. The STC members of the council later rejected the decision, saying the move threatened to “drag Yemen into new confrontations”. Following the strikes, broadcasters in Saudi Arabia aired segments showing surveillance footage of the alleged Emirati ships delivering the combat equipment to the port of Mukalla in southern Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition said the ships had arrived from the UAE port of Fujairah, adding that the operation was conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law and without causing collateral damage. An official at the port said they had received an evacuation warning. ‘Unacceptable to God’ Abdullah Bazuhair, whose home overlooks the port, showed AFP the damage to his property, with windows blasted clear out of the walls and glass strewn across the floor. The strikes were “unacceptable to God” he said, adding “the children were terrified and the women frightened”. The Saudi-led coalition had warned that it would back Yemen’s government in any military confrontation with separatist forces and urged them to withdraw from recently seized territories in Hadramawt and Mahra governorates. Tuesday’s strike came days after reported Saudi air raids on separatist positions in resource-rich Hadramawt last week. A Yemeni military official said on Friday that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were massed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory.",

      "summary": "The United Arab Emirates said on Tuesday it was pulling out its remaining forces in Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for UAE forces to leave the country within 24 hours. “In light of recent developments and their potential implications for the safety and effectiveness of counterterrorism missions, the Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism personnel in Yemen of its own volition, in a manner that ensures the safety of its personnel and in coordination with the concerned partners,” said the UAE’s Ministry of Defence on X.

      "summary_orig": "The United States Embassy in India on Tuesday warned Indian nationals of “significant criminal penalties” for illegally migrating to the US and breaking its laws. Relations between Washington and New Delhi have become strained over the course of the year, due to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between the two South Asian rivals. In a post on X, the US Embassy posted a message reading, “If you break US law, you will be punished with significant criminal penalties. The Trump Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration to the United States and protecting our nation’s borders and our citizens.” Neither the US State Department nor US missions in Pakistan or other nations, including Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar or China, have issued similar warnings. Since taking office in January this year, Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration in the US, rolling out policies and enacting mass deportations through 2025. In February, a US military aircraft carried 104 deported Indians and landed in Amritsar. Although illegal Indian immigrants have been deported home by previous US administrations, it was the first time Washington used a military aircraft for the purpose. In addition to deportations, Washington has made it harder for immigrants to obtain visas. In September, Trump ordered a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled worker visas. H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years, but extendable to six years. India’s foreign ministry said that the Trump administration’s move to increase H1-B visa fees was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy. Similarly, India’s leading trade body Nasscom said the timeline for implementing the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas for high-tech workers in the United States was a “concern”. Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump’s administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft. Around 16,000 of the visa revocations were tied to cases of driving under the influence, while about 12,000 were for assault and another 8,000 for theft. “These three crimes accounted for almost half of revocations this year,” said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. In August, a State Department spokesperson said Washington had revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small number for “support for terrorism”.",

Both nations have a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies , with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
