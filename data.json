In a phone call with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the premier emphasised that Afghan authorities must take immediate and effective steps to dismantle terror networks operating on Afghan soil, said a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). During a state visit by the premier earlier in October, the two leaders resolved to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc. “He reaffirmed that Pakistan had agreed to a temporary ceasefire at the request of the Afghan authorities to facilitate dialogue in Doha, and stressed the importance of tangible action against all terrorist entities, including Fitna-al-Khwarij, Fitna-al-Hindustan, TTP, and BLA, to restore peace and stability along the border,” added the PMO. Ibrahim, expressing concern at the developments, offered to play a constructive role in “reducing tensions and restoring peace and stability in the region”. The two leaders also discussed other regional developments and PM Shehbaz briefed the Indonesian prime minister on his participation in the signing ceremony of the Gaza Peace Agreement in Sharm-el-Sheikh. The two leaders expressed home that “it would help bring an immediate end to the suffering of the Palestinian people, ensure unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza, and pave the way for lasting peace and stability in the region”. Concluding the call, both leaders agreed to remain in touch. During a state visit by the premier earlier in October, the two leaders resolved to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc. In a joint statement issued following their bilateral meeting in Indonesia during Shehbaz’s visit, both prime ministers expressed satisfaction with the strong and ongoing defence collaboration under the Joint Committee on Defence Cooperation (JCDC) established in 1997. Anwar and Shehbaz also agreed to explore collaboration in healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical devices with the aim of enhancing public health and commercial exchanges in these sectors. Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",

      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Saturday that the only constructive solution to tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan is for Kabul to fully abide by the Doha Agreement, which bars the use of Afghan soil for terrorist activities. Amid ongoing hostilities with Afghanistan, a high-level delegation — led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — is holding discussions with a delegation from Kabul today in the Qatari capital Doha, the Foreign Office said today. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the state minister noted that Pakistan has tried to resolve the issue through diplomatic channels and the military’s connections to Afghanistan, but so far these attempts have failed. “For the first time, a third country is getting involved to convey that Afghanistan has to abide by the Doha agreement, whereby they will not allow the use of their territory for acts of terrorism by anyone,” he said. “Through a third country, a conversation is ongoing. The only positive way forward is that Afghanistan prohibits the use of its soil to all actors using it to stage acts of terror, as laid out in the Doha agreement.” When asked if Pakistan would respond to attacks by targeting terrorists on Afghan soil, Chaudhry replied: “Why don’t things improve? It’s because they (Afghans) lack resolve and commitment. Khawarij are trained and sponsored there before they enter Pakistan.” Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan. “Now, Afghanistan is shaking hands with India and recognising [occupied] Kashmir as Indian territory. We kept saying ‘they are proxies’ and now they have proven it.” The state minister said that “proxy forces” need to remember that Pakistan will maintain its stance and do whatever is necessary to defend its people and territorial integrity. “If terrorism is Pakistan’s internal issue, then why do they [terrorists] come from Afghanistan?” he asked, referring to recent remarks from Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi stating that terrorism is a country’s internal issue. “We have identified their camps and hideouts and how they enter Pakistan. We have sent them multiple dossiers with this information, but nothing has been done,” he emphasised. Since last weekend, Islamabad and Kabul have been engaged in a series of border clashes. Last Sunday, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side, the Inter-Services Public Relations said in a statement. Afghanistan claims it carried out the border attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last Thursday — a charge Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . Clashes broke out again earlier this week on Tuesday, with the Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij exchanging fire with Pakistan troops at the Kurram border. Pakistan followed this on Wednesday by launching “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and Kabul. The FO on Wednesday announced that a temporary ceasefire was agreed with Afghanistan for the next 48 hours amid the recent border hostilities, due to expire at 6pm PKT on Friday. Later on Friday, the ceasefire was extended , according to a senior diplomatic source. Additionally, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan that same day. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group. The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.",

      "summary_orig": "Zimbabwe Cricket on Saturday accepted the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) invitation to participate in a T20I tri-series also featuring Sri Lanka, following the withdrawal of the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB). The ACB pulled out of the series after alleging that three of its cricketers were killed in a strike carried out by Islamabad. Pakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group. The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day ceasefire. “Zimbabwe Cricket has accepted the Pakistan Cricket Board’s invitation to participate in a T20I tri-series also featuring Sri Lanka,” a statement from the PCB said. The maiden tri-series on Pakistan soil has been scheduled to provide all three sides with preparation ahead of next year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the cricket board added. ICC ‘appalled’ by deaths of three Afghan cricketers The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday night issued a statement on the deaths of three Afghan cricketers in an airstrike in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, stating it was “deeply saddened and appalled”. “The three young men had returned home after participating in a friendly cricket match when they were killed in an attack that also claimed the lives of several civilians,” the governing body said. “The ICC strongly condemns this act of violence that has robbed families, communities, and the cricketing world of three bright talents whose only ambition was to play the sport they loved,” it added. “The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief.” Afghanistan pulls out of series In a post on social media platform X late Friday night, the ACB said three players — identified as Kabeer, Sibghatullah and Haroon — and “five other countrymen” from Urgun district were killed and seven others were injured in a strike. It said the players had earlier travelled to Sharana to participate in a friendly cricket match. “The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan’s sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,” the cricketing board said. As a result, the ACB decided to withdraw from participating in the tri-nation series scheduled to be played in November. Afghanistan’s ace spinner Rashid Khan, in a post on X, said he welcomed the ACB’s decision to withdraw from the upcoming fixtures against Pakistan. Pakistan was set to host the series from November 17 to 29. Earlier, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Spokesperson Amir Mir told Dawn.com that the tri-series was still on and the third team would be finalised shortly. Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said earlier today that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan against the outlawed Gul Bahadur group last night. “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said on X. Cricket icon Shahid Afridi took to X and said that Afghanistan, in its acts of aggression, had forgotten Pakistan’s hospitality and “favours”. “Pakistan has always stood by its Afghan brothers, considering the troubles of Afghans as its own trouble,” the former all-rounder wrote. “It opened its borders for its brothers. It accommodated 4 million refugees on its land. “I have to say that in recent days, Afghanistan, forgetting all these favours, committed open aggression on the borders, to which our forces gave a full response,” he added. Afridi wrote that Afghanistan should think of Pakistan as a brotherly Islamic country and should not allow its land to be used to aid acts of terrorism. Pak Afghan tensions Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. For its part, Kabul has batted aside accusations of support for militancy, alternating between vehement denials of Afghan soil being used to launch attacks across the border, assurances that have failed to materialise, and simply telling the Pakistani state to negotiate with the TTP. Tensions have flared between the two countries over the last few days, with Kabul and Islamabad engaging in border skirmishes on October 11. According to the military, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed at the border following an attack from the Afghan side. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier in the week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintained that Kabul must “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. Subsequently, Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and artillery pounded Afghanistan’s posts, targeting hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika. On Tuesday night, fighting flared up again on between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, a temporary ceasefire was then announced. The Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire was implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, and would last for 48 hours. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, made it clear on Thursday that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks. “We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks. On Friday, with representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan. It had come after an attack on a military installation in North Waziristan and after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire. There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day. Meanwhile, in a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past. “There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.",

Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said earlier today that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan against the outlawed Gul Bahadur group last night. “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said on X. Cricket icon Shahid Afridi took to X and said that Afghanistan, in its acts of aggression, had forgotten Pakistan’s hospitality and “favours”. “Pakistan has always stood by its Afghan brothers, considering the troubles of Afghans as its own trouble,” the former all-rounder wrote. “It opened its borders for its brothers. It accommodated 4 million refugees on its land. “I have to say that in recent days, Afghanistan, forgetting all these favours, committed open aggression on the borders, to which our forces gave a full response,” he added. Afridi wrote that Afghanistan should think of Pakistan as a brotherly Islamic country and should not allow its land to be used to aid acts of terrorism. Pak Afghan tensions Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. For its part, Kabul has batted aside accusations of support for militancy, alternating between vehement denials of Afghan soil being used to launch attacks across the border, assurances that have failed to materialise, and simply telling the Pakistani state to negotiate with the TTP. Tensions have flared between the two countries over the last few days, with Kabul and Islamabad engaging in border skirmishes on October 11. According to the military, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed at the border following an attack from the Afghan side. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier in the week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintained that Kabul must “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. Subsequently, Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and artillery pounded Afghanistan’s posts, targeting hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika. On Tuesday night, fighting flared up again on between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, a temporary ceasefire was then announced. The Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire was implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, and would last for 48 hours. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, made it clear on Thursday that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks. “We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks. On Friday, with representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan. It had come after an attack on a military installation in North Waziristan and after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire. There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day. Meanwhile, in a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past. “There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.",

      "summary": "Zimbabwe Cricket on Saturday accepted the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) invitation to participate in a T20I tri-series also featuring Sri Lanka, following the withdrawal of the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB). The ACB pulled out of the series after alleging that three of its cricketers were killed in a strike carried out by Islamabad. Pakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group. The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day ceasefire. “Zimbabwe Cricket has accepted the Pakistan Cricket Board’s invitation to participate in a T20I tri-series also featuring Sri Lanka,” a statement from the PCB said. The maiden tri-series on Pakistan soil has been scheduled to provide all three sides with preparation ahead of next year’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the cricket board added. ICC ‘appalled’ by deaths of three Afghan cricketers The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday night issued a statement on the deaths of three Afghan cricketers in an airstrike in Afghanistan’s Paktika province, stating it was “deeply saddened and appalled”. “The three young men had returned home after participating in a friendly cricket match when they were killed in an attack that also claimed the lives of several civilians,” the governing body said. “The ICC strongly condemns this act of violence that has robbed families, communities, and the cricketing world of three bright talents whose only ambition was to play the sport they loved,” it added. “The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief.” Afghanistan pulls out of series In a post on social media platform X late Friday night, the ACB said three players — identified as Kabeer, Sibghatullah and Haroon — and “five other countrymen” from Urgun district were killed and seven others were injured in a strike. It said the players had earlier travelled to Sharana to participate in a friendly cricket match. “The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan’s sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,” the cricketing board said. As a result, the ACB decided to withdraw from participating in the tri-nation series scheduled to be played in November. Afghanistan’s ace spinner Rashid Khan, in a post on X, said he welcomed the ACB’s decision to withdraw from the upcoming fixtures against Pakistan. Pakistan was set to host the series from November 17 to 29.

      "summary_orig": "Amid ongoing hostilities with Afghanistan, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday that a high-level delegation — led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — is holding discussions with a delegation from the neighbouring country today in Doha. “The talks will focus on immediate measures to end cross-border terrorism against Pakistan emanating from Afghanistan and restore peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border,” it said. “Pakistan does not seek escalation but urges the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities,” it said. “Pakistan appreciates the mediation efforts of Qatar and hopes these discussions contribute to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said. It was not immediately clear how long the talks would last. Officials on both sides have said they could be extended from Saturday, adding senior intelligence officials from both countries were part of the talks. Earlier, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesperson for the Taliban government, had also confirmed that talks between the two countries would take place in the Qatari capital. In a post on social media platform X, Mujahid said, “As it was promised that negotiations would be held with the Pakistani side, a high-level delegation of the Islamic Emirate, led by the Minister of Defence Maulvi Sahib Muhammad Yaqub Mujahid, left for Doha today.” Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would also include intelligence chief, Mullah Wasiq, besides the defence minister. Minister says Pakistan carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan last night Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Pakistan struck verified camps of the outlawed Gul Bahadur group in border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border. In a post on X, he said that during the 48-hour ceasefire, terrorists operating from Afghanistan attempted to launch multiple terrorists attacks inside Pakistan, which were effectively countered by security forces. “During the effective responses by security forces, more than 100 kharjis were sent to hell,” he said. He said that terrorist also carried out an improvised explosive device (IED) attack in North Waziristan in which civilians and a soldier were martyred while multiple others were injured. “Against kharjis of Gul Bahadur Group, precision strikes were undertaken last night. In these precision strikes, [a] minimum [of] 60-70 kharjis and their leadership have been sent to hell based on confirmed intelligence reports,” the minister said. “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said. “Pakistan sincerely believes that [the] path forward lies in resolving this complex issue of Indian-sponsored terrorism emanating from Afghan soil through talks and control of non-state actors by Afghan authorities. However, Pakistan has all the rights to safeguard its territorial integrity and the lives of the people of Pakistan, and we shall not allow terrorists operating from inside Afghanistan to live in peace,” he said. Pakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group. The attacks came on the heels of an attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended a two-day ceasefire. The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) also said that it was pulling out of a T20I tri-nations series scheduled to be held in Pakistan next month after alleging that three cricketers were killed in a strike. The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night had cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks. “The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday. The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period. Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.” He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.” No bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.",

How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.",
      "title": "Delegation led by defence minister holds talks with Taliban representatives in Doha",
      "summary": "Amid ongoing hostilities with Afghanistan, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday that a high-level delegation — led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif — is holding discussions with a delegation from the neighbouring country today in Doha. “The talks will focus on immediate measures to end cross-border terrorism against Pakistan emanating from Afghanistan and restore peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border,” it said. “Pakistan does not seek escalation but urges the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities,” it said. “Pakistan appreciates the mediation efforts of Qatar and hopes these discussions contribute to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said. It was not immediately clear how long the talks would last. Officials on both sides have said they could be extended from Saturday, adding senior intelligence officials from both countries were part of the talks. Earlier, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesperson for the Taliban government, had also confirmed that talks between the two countries would take place in the Qatari capital. In a post on social media platform X, Mujahid said, “As it was promised that negotiations would be held with the Pakistani side, a high-level delegation of the Islamic Emirate, led by the Minister of Defence Maulvi Sahib Muhammad Yaqub Mujahid, left for Doha today.” Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would also include intelligence chief, Mullah Wasiq, besides the defence minister. Minister says Pakistan carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan last night Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Pakistan struck verified camps of the outlawed Gul Bahadur group in border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border. In a post on X, he said that during the 48-hour ceasefire, terrorists operating from Afghanistan attempted to launch multiple terrorists attacks inside Pakistan, which were effectively countered by security forces. “During the effective responses by security forces, more than 100 kharjis were sent to hell,” he said. He said that terrorist also carried out an improvised explosive device (IED) attack in North Waziristan in which civilians and a soldier were martyred while multiple others were injured. “Against kharjis of Gul Bahadur Group, precision strikes were undertaken last night. In these precision strikes, [a] minimum [of] 60-70 kharjis and their leadership have been sent to hell based on confirmed intelligence reports,” the minister said. “All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said. “Pakistan sincerely believes that [the] path forward lies in resolving this complex issue of Indian-sponsored terrorism emanating from Afghan soil through talks and control of non-state actors by Afghan authorities. However, Pakistan has all the rights to safeguard its territorial integrity and the lives of the people of Pakistan, and we shall not allow terrorists operating from inside Afghanistan to live in peace,” he said. Pakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group. The attacks came on the heels of an attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended a two-day ceasefire. The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) also said that it was pulling out of a T20I tri-nations series scheduled to be held in Pakistan next month after alleging that three cricketers were killed in a strike. The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night had cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks. “The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday. The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period. Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.” He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action.

How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.",

      "title_orig": "No space for war in nuclearised environment, COAS Munir cautions India",
      "summary_orig": "Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday cautioned India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on 7 May, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “ Operation Bunyanum Marsoos ”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire. Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul, COAS Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.” Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms. “The onus of ensuing escalations — one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond — will squarely lie with India.” “Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators,” COAS Munir warned. View this post on Instagram “With diminishing distinctions between conflict and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India’s geographic warspace. “The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses inflicted will be much beyond the imagination and calculation of the perpetrators of chaos and instability,” he said. “The battle-hardened army, which has fought for over two decades in the sub-conventional domain, has successfully displayed its capabilities in the conventional domain , as well as by delivering a swift and decisive blow to the adversary,” he said. “Ever since the creation of Pakistan, the armed forces, with full support of the nation, have defended the external and internal frontiers of the country with unfailing resolve, conviction and pride. “The most recent display of this spirit and resolve of the armed forces of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq [and] Operation Bunyan um Marsoos has further strengthened the trust and confidence of the people of Pakistan in the competence and far-reaching capabilities of its armed forces by neutralising all threats with remarkable professionalism,” COAS Munir said, referring to the four-day May conflict with India . View this post on Instagram “Downing advanced […] Rafales , targeting multiple bases including S-400s , and showcasing multi-domain warfare capabilities, Pakistan has displayed its capabilities and will to defend,” COAS Munir asserted. He further said that “people of hues and colours, age, gender, ethnicity or creed, stood firm and tall like a wall of steel, leading to a renewed spirit of patriotism and national fervour, which prevails across the length and breadth of Pakistan”. “Our collective success has re-energised and strengthened the proud and illustrious memories of our earlier successes. Pakistan once again came out victorious against a treacherous enemy marked by strategic blindness and naivety, and filled with hubris and rhetoric about its misguided hegemonic ambitions. “India’s eagerness to adjudge culpability, aversion to neutral investigations and staking self-created evidence was indicative of politicisation of terrorism for vested interests of the ruling regime,” he added. COAS Munir went on to say, “Pakistan, on the other hand, gained deep admiration of the people of Pakistan and the international community because of the legitimacy and the clear victory against a numerically superior adversary. “Internally, it has further unified our nation and strengthened our resolve to defend against any threat, whether external or internal. It has reinforced confidence, particularly amongst the youth, that the armed forces of Pakistan are an essential element of national power and trusted with the responsibility to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state,” he said, assuring the nation that “we will not lose an inch of this sacred land”. He commended the “valour of the people of Pakistan — every soldier, sailor, airman; the brave men, women and children and the elderly who laid their lives during these testing times; and the warriors who fought with the utmost conviction to defend their motherland at all costs”. “The national leadership, the bureaucracy, scholars, scientists, media, academia, and most importantly, the youth deserve rich tribute for standing firmly against aggression,” the army chief added. The army chief also spoke on Pakistan’s economy, hailing the government’s “relentless efforts” for relative stability and noting that positive economic indicators were attracting investments from across the world. “The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future. Our vibrant youth, filled with talent, is making marvels in a multitude of domains.” He also reiterated his cautions about social media, calling on people to be cognisant of threats “proliferating via digital media, populist anarchism and social subversion”. “Unfortunately, in the post-truth era in which we live, perceptions bear more weight than reality and half-truths spread faster than facts. Your strength will lie in thinking critically and discerning fact from fiction,” he said, urging them to not become “tools of disinformation”. Choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS tells Kabul The army chief also reiterated Pakistan’s stance that India “continues with state-sponsored terrorism”. “Our adversary’s use of Fitna al-Hind and Fitna al-Khawarij as hired guns exposes its … hypocritical and heinous face to the world. Equally disconcerting is the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan,” he said. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Urging the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS Munir urged the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”. “Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”. Speaking on occupied Kashmir, the army chief said India’s “oppression and widespread atrocities” in the valley will also come to an end. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s diplomatic and moral support for the Kashmiris’ freedom struggle till the resolution of the dispute in accordance with United Nations’ resolutions. View this post on Instagram ‘Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser’ During his address, COAS Munir noted that the world was witnessing “increased fragility and volatility, with a discernible shift towards violence as an instrument for attaining political objectives”. “Amidst the chaos, Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser. Our relations with key global and regional powers, particularly Muslim countries, have further strengthened.” View this post on Instagram The army chief stated that Pakistan had persistently “proven to be a key contributor toward peace and stability in the region and beyond”, highlighting Pakistan’s armed forces’ contributions to UN peacekeeping missions. He also mentioned the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, terming it a “reinforcement and formalisation of Pakistan-Saudi brotherhood and a step towards ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East and South Asia”. COAS Munir said Islamabad had also made “humble contributions towards peaceful steering of the negotiations with Iran”, adding that Pakistan’s relations with all Muslim countries were “thriving at an exponential” rate. Hailing Pakistan’s historic “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership“ with China, the army chief also noted: “Re-energisational and strong and growing relations with the United States of America are an encouraging and welcome development.” He lauded US President Donald Trump, saying that his “personal efforts and strategic leadership to bring peace to multiple conflict-prone areas of the world are really praiseworthy”. “We will further nurture these relations with key global and regional players for the interest of peace, security, and development.” COAS Munir also assailed Israel for its “blatant aggression, genocide and forced displacement waged upon Palestinians”. Highlighting Pakistan’s “significant” role in the diplomatic efforts to secure the recent peace in Gaza, the field marshal said Pakistan expects the ceasefire to continue, followed by a smooth flow of humanitarian relief and the reconstruction of Gaza. “Pakistan stands by its principled stance of indispensability of the two-state solution and the need for an independent, sovereign and viable State of Palestine based on pre-1967 war borders, with Al Quds Sharif as its capital,” he reaffirmed . ‘Enemies hell-bent upon driving a wedge between people, armed forces’ Addressing the cadets, he highlighted that they were being commissioned into “one of the finest armies across the world, which is second to none, respected by all and sundry”. “This demands your absolute loyalty to [Pakistan, to the armed forces and the sacred task being entrusted onto your shoulders,” he underscored. “Remember, our enemies are hell-bent upon driving a wedge between our people and the armed forces for their ulterior motives. Let me remind them that the bond between the people and the armed forces is unshakable,” the field marshal asserted. He told the cadets that nothing should be more sacred than the safety and security of the people of Pakistan and no duty more binding than the defence of the country. “The defence doctrine of Pakistan is predicated on credible deterrence and perpetual readiness, encompassing the full spectrum of capabilities. As a professional standing army, our conventional prowess through constant doctrinal and technological evolution has been optimised into a dynamic, integrated and adaptive force,” the army chief said. Underscoring the need for intellectual readiness and technological advancements, COAS Munir told the cadets to “embrace innovation, life-long learning and adaptability to meet modern threats”. At the outset of his address, the army chief extended his warm greetings and appreciation to the “immaculately turned-out gentlemen and lady cadets for the outstanding display of professionalism and discipline”. He also expressed his compliments to the cadets from friendly countries of Malaysia, Nepal, Palestine, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Yemen, Mali, Maldives, and Nigeria for “successful completion of the formative training at this prestigious institution”. “This is a moment of pride for you and all of us, reflective of the strong bond of military cooperation and international camaraderie,” COAS Munir said. He highlighted that the PMA’s role “as a cornerstone of military excellence has always remained commendable, and the standards exhibited today are no less reflective of the same”.",

      "summary_en": "Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Saturday cautioned India that there was “no space for war in a nuclearised environment” as he hailed Pakistan’s “clear victory” during the May conflict with the neighbouring country. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on 7 May, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “ Operation Bunyanum Marsoos ”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire. Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul, COAS Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.” Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms. “The onus of ensuing escalations — one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond — will squarely lie with India.” “Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators,” COAS Munir warned. View this post on Instagram “With diminishing distinctions between conflict and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India’s geographic warspace. “The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses inflicted will be much beyond the imagination and calculation of the perpetrators of chaos and instability,” he said. “The battle-hardened army, which has fought for over two decades in the sub-conventional domain, has successfully displayed its capabilities in the conventional domain , as well as by delivering a swift and decisive blow to the adversary,” he said. “Ever since the creation of Pakistan, the armed forces, with full support of the nation, have defended the external and internal frontiers of the country with unfailing resolve, conviction and pride. “The most recent display of this spirit and resolve of the armed forces of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq [and] Operation Bunyan um Marsoos has further strengthened the trust and confidence of the people of Pakistan in the competence and far-reaching capabilities of its armed forces by neutralising all threats with remarkable professionalism,” COAS Munir said, referring to the four-day May conflict with India . View this post on Instagram “Downing advanced […] Rafales , targeting multiple bases including S-400s , and showcasing multi-domain warfare capabilities, Pakistan has displayed its capabilities and will to defend,” COAS Munir asserted. He further said that “people of hues and colours, age, gender, ethnicity or creed, stood firm and tall like a wall of steel, leading to a renewed spirit of patriotism and national fervour, which prevails across the length and breadth of Pakistan”. “Our collective success has re-energised and strengthened the proud and illustrious memories of our earlier successes. Pakistan once again came out victorious against a treacherous enemy marked by strategic blindness and naivety, and filled with hubris and rhetoric about its misguided hegemonic ambitions. “India’s eagerness to adjudge culpability, aversion to neutral investigations and staking self-created evidence was indicative of politicisation of terrorism for vested interests of the ruling regime,” he added. COAS Munir went on to say, “Pakistan, on the other hand, gained deep admiration of the people of Pakistan and the international community because of the legitimacy and the clear victory against a numerically superior adversary. “Internally, it has further unified our nation and strengthened our resolve to defend against any threat, whether external or internal.

Citing Talha Bin Zasim, an officer at the Fire Service and Civil Defence Media Cell, 36 firefighting units are already working to douse the flames, the report added. “All our aircraft are confirmed safe. Further updates will be provided as the situation develops,” the newspaper reported, citing a spokesperson for the airport. Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Daily Star , citing fire service sources, reported that the fire erupted in the cargo section near Gate 8 of the airport around 2:30pm local time (1:30pm PKT). “Meanwhile, according to the [Bangladeshi] Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Bangladesh Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh Fire Service, Bangladesh Navy, and two fire units of the Bangladesh Air Force are working to extinguish the fire,” the report read, adding that two platoons from the Bangladesh Border Guard were also involved in firefighting efforts. Sources at Dhaka Airport told The Daily Star that at least five flights scheduled to land in Dhaka were diverted to Shah Amanat International Airport in Chattogram and Osmani International Airport in Sylhet. “The airfield at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka will remain closed until 6pm today,” the report read quoting Mohammad Ibrahim Khalil, the public relations officer at Shah Amanat International Airport. Due to the closure, two flights operated by US-Bangla Airlines and two by Biman Bangladesh Airlines were diverted to Shah Amanat airport, The Daily Star reported. With the latest diversions, a total of eight domestic and international flights landed at Shah Amanat airport. The newspaper added that authorities said the diverted flights will return to Dhaka once the situation normalises, as outbound passengers were left waiting at Hazrat Shahjalal due to the suspension of flight operations.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran said on Saturday that it was no longer bound by restrictions on its nuclear programme as a landmark 10-year deal between it and world powers expired, though Tehran reiterated its “commitment to diplomacy”. The 2015 deal — signed in Vienna by Iran, China, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — saw the lifting of international sanctions against the Islamic Republic in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear programme. But the pact had already been in tatters after Washington unilaterally withdrew during President Donald Trump’s first term, with Iran later pulling back from its commitments. The reimposition last month of UN sanctions at the urging of three of the deal’s European signatories rendered the accord effectively moot. From now on, “all of the provisions (of the deal), including the restrictions on the Iranian nuclear programme and the related mechanisms are considered terminated”, Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement on the day of the pact’s expiration. “Iran firmly expresses its commitment to diplomacy,” it added. Western powers have long accused Iran of secretly seeking nuclear weapons — something it has repeatedly denied , insisting its nuclear programme is solely for civilian purposes such as energy production . The deal’s “termination day” was set for October 18, 2025, exactly 10 years after it was enshrined in the UN’s Security Council resolution 2231. The accord capped Iran’s uranium enrichment at 3.67 per cent in exchange for sanctions relief and provided for strict supervision of its nuclear activities by the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But Washington left the deal in 2018 and reinstated sanctions, after which Tehran began stepping up its nuclear programme. According to the IAEA, Iran is the only country without a nuclear weapons programme to enrich uranium to 60pc That is close to the threshold of 90pc required for a bomb, and well above the level needed for civilian nuclear use. ‘Irresponsible actions’ In July, Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA following the war with Israel, with Tehran pointing to the agency’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear facilities. The unprecedented bombing campaign by Israel and the retaliation by Iran during the 12-day war derailed ongoing nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington. At the initiative of France, Britain and Germany, widespread UN sanctions against Iran returned into force in late September for the first time in a decade. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a letter addressed to the United Nations on Saturday that the expiration of the 2015 deal renders the sanctions “null and void”. Britain, France and Germany accuse Iran of not cooperating with the IAEA and would like it to return to negotiations with the United States. “Iran’s efforts to revive the exchanges (with the IAEA) that led to the agreement in Cairo were also sabotaged by the irresponsible actions of the three European countries,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in Saturday’s statement, referring to a recent framework to resume cooperation.",

The accord capped Iran’s uranium enrichment at 3.67 per cent in exchange for sanctions relief and provided for strict supervision of its nuclear activities by the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But Washington left the deal in 2018 and reinstated sanctions, after which Tehran began stepping up its nuclear programme. According to the IAEA, Iran is the only country without a nuclear weapons programme to enrich uranium to 60pc That is close to the threshold of 90pc required for a bomb, and well above the level needed for civilian nuclear use. ‘Irresponsible actions’ In July, Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA following the war with Israel, with Tehran pointing to the agency’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear facilities. The unprecedented bombing campaign by Israel and the retaliation by Iran during the 12-day war derailed ongoing nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington. At the initiative of France, Britain and Germany, widespread UN sanctions against Iran returned into force in late September for the first time in a decade. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a letter addressed to the United Nations on Saturday that the expiration of the 2015 deal renders the sanctions “null and void”. Britain, France and Germany accuse Iran of not cooperating with the IAEA and would like it to return to negotiations with the United States. “Iran’s efforts to revive the exchanges (with the IAEA) that led to the agreement in Cairo were also sabotaged by the irresponsible actions of the three European countries,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in Saturday’s statement, referring to a recent framework to resume cooperation.",

      "summary_orig": "Three terrorists were killed after they attempted to attack a police checkpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu late last night, police said in a statement on Saturday. KP police said that three terrorists belonging to the Fitna-al-Khawarij had made an unsuccessful attempt to target the Mazanga police checkpost last night. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Police said the terrorists were attempting to attack the Mazanga police checkpost using a rickshaw loaded with explosive material. During this attempt, they were intercepted by police officials who tried to stop them due to their suspicious activity, the police said. When they did not stop, officials opened fire which caused the rickshaw to explode, the statement said, adding that all three terrorists were killed while police personnel remained safe. The explosion caused minor damage to nearby houses, it added. According to the statement, Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan and Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kalachi lauded the prompt and courageous response of the policemen, saying they had “set an exemplary standard of duty, bravery, and professionalism“. The statement said that Bannu police was “fully committed to protecting the lives and property of the people at all costs”. The statement added that the DIG and the DPO had also announced cash rewards and certificates for the officers stationed at the checkpoint. Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022 , the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel. On Thursday, the military said security forces had killed 34 “India-backed” terrorists during multiple operations that took place across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the span of three days.",

The National Assembly Standing Committee’s decision came following a briefing given by Pakistan Rail­ways’ officials to the committee about the October 7 attack on the Jaffer Express. The officials said that Jaffer Exp­ress was targeted with an improvised explosives device on October 7 near Sultan Kot Railways Station in Sindh. The blast derailed five bogies and damaged the track. Seven passengers, including Pakistan Railw­ays employees, suffered injuries. The standing committee, chaired by Ramesh Lal in the absence of the chairman, heard updates on the Jaffer Express train blast, encroachments of railways lands and Kara­chi-Pipri freight corridor project. Briefing the committee on the freight corridor project, the secretary of Pakistan Railways said the project would start from Keamari, linking Karachi Port to Pipri. On this route, he said, two new railway lines will be laid to connect it with Motorway M-9. The committee also discussed various aspects of the project. The panel was informed that the terminal will initially operate on a small scale, and the first pha­­se is expected to be co­­m­­pleted within six months. The committee was further informed that 17 freight trains will operate on a daily basis and the project will cost $400 million.

He stressed that the promotion of religious education is a collective responsibility and called on all segments of society to ensure lasting peace, tolerance, and harmony.

In addition, security forces claimed to have foiled a terror bid in Bajaur after a large cache of explosives, loaded into a non-Customs paid vehicle, was destroyed in Lowi Mamund tehsil. In Lakki Marwat, officials said an operation was launched on reports about the presence of militants in the rural area located on the border with Punjab, near Mianwali. Security forces spotted the terrorist hideout in the forest between Kaichi Kamar and Sultankhel, which was reportedly targeted through a unmanned drone. Forces foil major terror bid in Bajaur by disabling explosive-laden vehicle During the operation, eight militants were eliminated and their hideouts were destroyed, while security forces seized a large quantity of arms, ammunition and explosives and launched a sanitisation operation to neutralise any other threats in the area. Separately, TTP ‘commander’ Tariq Kochi, who hails from Toi Khula tehsil of Lower South Waziristan, was reportedly killed near the border with Balochistan by unidentified gunmen. Sources said the incident occurred near the Tesh mountain range, where Kochi and other militants were ambushed by unidentified individuals. Police said that Kochi had been involved for the past year in multiple incidents of attacks, shootings, and target killings targeting security forces, police personnel, and civilians in the area. Security forces also claimed to have foiled a terrorism bid by destroying a huge cache of explosives loaded in a car in Bajaur. A senior police official said that the sabotage bid was foiled in Thangai area at around 11:15 am, when the security personnel targeted a suspected vehicle laden with explosives. DPO Waqas Rafique said the explosives-laden vehicle was disabled by firing at it, adding that no loss of life was reported. The official, however, said that an investigation was underway to ascertain who was behind the failed sabotage bid. Published in Dawn, October 18th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Hafiz Gul Bahadur group’s positions in the crosshairs hours after audacious gun-and-bomb attack in North Waziristan • Strikes come despite extension of ceasefire; security officials say ‘truce with Afghan govt, not terror outfits’ • Khawaja Asif accuses Afghan Taliban of ‘sitting in India’s lap’; says terrorists will be made to pay heavy price, wherever they are • Questions remain over Qatar-mediated talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in absence of clarity over who will attend ISLAMABAD: With representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, a telling statement from the country’s defence minister indicated that the gloves were off, as Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack, targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day ceasefire . Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters. “If someone attacks Afgha­nistan, our forces are ready to respond,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Ariana News. However, Pakistani security sources pointed out that the ceasefire agreement bet­ween the Afghan government and Pakistan did not preclude stri­kes on terror outfits and their hideouts. There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day. Although there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on losses suffered, security sources claimed to have foiled the attack by eliminating all attackers. The attack began on Friday morning, with local sources describing a massive explosion, followed by heavy gunfire as terrorists attempted to enter the military camp. Sources said that “all four” attackers were killed. Heavy price to pay In a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past. “There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote. Mr Asif accused Afghanistan of “sitting in India’s lap and plotting conspiracies against Pakis­tan”, saying that Islamabad “can no longer afford to have relations with Kabul like in the past”. “All Afghans on Pakistani soil will have to go back to their homeland,” he wrote. “Now they have their own government [or] caliphate in Kabul. It has been five years since the Islamic revolution… they must live with Pakistan as neighbours.” In the post, the defence minister elaborated on the visits by Pakistani delegations to Kabul and provided figures for acts of terrorism by groups operating out of Afghanistan and the total number of casualties. Since the Taliban took power in 2021, Pakistani foreign ministers visited Kabul four times; defence ministers and the ISI chiefs visited twice; the special representative and foreign secretaries carried out five visits each; the national security adviser visited once, and the Joint Coordination Committee had eight meetings in the Afghan capital. He added that there were 225 border flag meetings, 836 protest notes and 13 demarches. “From 2021 to date: 3,844 mar­tyred (civilians, military, and law enforcement agencies combined). Terrorist incidents: 10,347,” the defence minister listed. Truce talks? The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks. “The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday. The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period. Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.” He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.” No bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said. Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would include Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub Mujahid and intelligence chief Mullah Wasiq.  Pakistan’s Foreign Office stayed silent on the matter, but a late-evening meeting between National Security Adviser and ISI chief Lt. Gen. Asim Malik and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar suggested that Gen Malik may travel to Doha. Return of victims’ remains Earlier on Friday, Afghan authorities handed over the bodies of seven Pakistani citizens — including two security personnel — to Pakistani officials at the border following the deadly Taliban attack in the Chaman sector on Tuesday. “The Taliban authorities handed over all the seven bodies to Pakistan through Hilal-e-Ahmar Pakistan (Red Cres­cent),” Abdul Wali Khan Ghabizai of the Balochistan chapter of the organization confirmed. He said Taliban officials announced at the Vesh Mandi border post that they were returning the remains of Pakistanis who had died “in the armed clash between two countries.” The bodies were taken to the District Hospital in Chaman for identification and medicolegal formalities. “Five bodies were brought to the district hospital Chaman,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, the hospital’s medical superintendent. “Four out of five martyrs have been identified as residents of the border town, while the fifth could not be identified so far.” Two of the deceased were identified as security personnel — Naik Suleman and Sepoy Sabir — whose remains were later transferred to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta. Officials said that four of the five civilians were killed by mortar shell splinters, while one was hit in the forehead. The victims — identified as Syed Ali Adozai, Muhammad Asghar Ashaizai, Rozi Khan Salehzai, and Nasibullah Salehzai — were local daily-wage workers. They were buried in their native villages Friday evening. Local residents in Chaman claimed that at least 12 Pakistani civ­ilians were killed earlier in Taliban attacks in Spin Boldak, the first Afghan district across the border. Responding to reports that bodies of some Pakistani soldiers had been mutilated, the Foreign Office spokesman at the weekly media briefing said, “This kind of savagery, bestiality, is condemnable, and it needs to be condemned in the strongest words possible. This is beyond the pale. It is beyond humanity, and this has deeply offended us and deeply hurt the Pakistani people.” “It is not something to be forgi­ven and forgotten easily,” Mr Khan added.

      "title_orig": "Three more ministers quit AJK cabinet, two urge PM to step down",
      "summary_orig": "Three more ministers from the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) cabinet on Friday announced their resignation, with two of them calling upon Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq to step down for what they described as his “failure to safeguard the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees”. Earlier this week, AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed announced that he had resigned from his position, citing “some unavoidable reasons”. However, a senior official at the AJK prime minister’s office told Dawn.com that the resignation had been “received but not yet accepted”. AJK Finance Minister Abdul Majid Khan and Food Minister Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim announced today they would step down at a joint press conference at the Muzaffarabad Press Club, while Sports, Youth and Culture Minister Asim Sharif Butt sent his resignation directly to the prime minister, opting to stay away from media interaction. All three were elected on PTI tickets in the 2021 general elections from LA-45 (Valley-VI), LA-38 (Jammu-V) and LA-42 (Valley-III) — constituencies reserved for Kashmiri refugees who migrated to Pakistan after 1947. However, the trio had later joined the faction of PTI defectors led by PM Haq in 2023. Their resignations came in protest against the agreement recently signed by a seven-member federal government committee and the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC), which, among other matters, addressed the contentious issue of the 12 legislative assembly seats reserved for Kashmiri refugees settled across Pakistan. Calling the JAAC an “unelected, baton-wielding group”, Khan and Ibrahim said the accord had effectively legitimised an “unconstitutional and morally indefensible demand, reached under pressure and without wider consultation”. They alleged that the deal violated the fundamental rights of thousands of Kashmiri refugees and struck at the heart of AJK’s constitutional and political framework. They maintained that the campaign against the refugee seats was a malicious move by a small group of traders and self-styled representatives pursuing narrow interests “under the guise of reforms”. The real target, they asserted, was not the government but the identity, representation and political recognition of the refugee community that had made immense sacrifices for Pakistan and the cause of Kashmir’s accession. Both ministers argued that these seats were not a privilege but a historic and conscious constitutional decision, which was part of AJK’s political setup since 1947. The reserved seats, they said, symbolised the constitutional acknowledgment of the sacrifices and long displacement endured by those who lost everything for the cause of Pakistan. They termed the JAAC’s questioning of these seats’ existence a denial of the pain, identity and political significance of an entire generation exiled for its struggle for accession to Pakistan. They said they had brought this issue to the notice of the president and prime minister of Pakistan in black and white, and added that they would “knock on all doors to frustrate the designs of the elements hellbent upon creating a wedge between local and migrant Kashmiris and thus damaging the Kashmir cause”. Khan also shared his two-page resignation letter, in which he reaffirmed his belief in the ideology of the State of Jammu and Kashmir’s lawful accession and integration with Pakistan, in accordance with the wishes of its entire population, including the 2.5 million Pakistan-based refugees. He said it had become “utterly impossible to continue to serve under the present government, which has failed to effectively defend and protect the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees, nor shown the will to assume responsibility or challenge this serious constitutional violation”. Declaring that he had no moral choice but to resign from the AJK cabinet, effective today, Khan vowed to continue defending the rights of Jammu and Kashmir refugees and to raise his voice for their rightful place in the political and constitutional structures of both AJK and Pakistan. In his resignation letter, Ibrahim echoed similar views, stating that Prime Minister Haq had failed to stop the “unlawful demand” raised by the JAAC and to protect the rights of around three million Pakistan-based refugees from occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Both Khan and Ibrahim charged PM Haq of conspiring against the refugee members of the legislative assembly and called upon him to resign from office. Butt, in his letter, expressed his and his constituents’ loss of confidence in the AJK government in the wake of the agreement, saying he could no longer remain part of it. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down at the end of September. Since then, rival groups staged protests and strikes, trading blame for the violence which marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. On October 2, a delegation from the federal government travelled to Muzaffarabad for talks with the JAAC in a bid to put an end to the ongoing unrest in the territory. The agreement was signed after two rounds of talks .",

      "summary_en": "Three more ministers from the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) cabinet on Friday announced their resignation, with two of them calling upon Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq to step down for what they described as his “failure to safeguard the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees”. Earlier this week, AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed announced that he had resigned from his position, citing “some unavoidable reasons”. However, a senior official at the AJK prime minister’s office told Dawn.com that the resignation had been “received but not yet accepted”. AJK Finance Minister Abdul Majid Khan and Food Minister Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim announced today they would step down at a joint press conference at the Muzaffarabad Press Club, while Sports, Youth and Culture Minister Asim Sharif Butt sent his resignation directly to the prime minister, opting to stay away from media interaction. All three were elected on PTI tickets in the 2021 general elections from LA-45 (Valley-VI), LA-38 (Jammu-V) and LA-42 (Valley-III) — constituencies reserved for Kashmiri refugees who migrated to Pakistan after 1947.
