Melissa began as a cluster of thunderstorms off the coast of west Africa, which travelled west and developed into a depression, reaching tropical storm status to the north of Venezuela on 21 October. Rapid intensification over the weekend strengthened Melissa to category 4 as it slowly meandered west through the Caribbean Sea. Melissa reached category 5 intensity on Monday morning with sustained winds of 160mph (257km/h). Melissa is forecast to take a turn to the north-east towards Jamaica on Monday afternoon, making landfall on Tuesday by about midday, maintaining it’s current strength, which would make it the strongest of only five hurricanes ever recorded to hit Jamaica directly.

      "summary_orig": "Posts from multiple pro-Indian and pro-Afghan users on social media platform X on Monday shared a video, claiming to show recent cross-border shelling between Pakistan and India in Leepa Valley at the Line of Control (LoC). However, the video is old and was previously shared in May 2025 during the Pakistan–India standoff. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. Pakistan later launched the retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a United States-led push helped broker a ceasefire. On Monday night, Indian forces apparently violated the cea­sefire in the Leepa Sector of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. While there was no official word on losses, locals reported an intense exchange of fire on Sunday evening. Today, an Indian propaganda account shared a video on X with the following caption: “At least seven Pakistani soldiers killed in overnight clashes in Leepa Valley (PoK) after Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked firing at Indian posts in Tangdhar sector. Indian Army retaliated with 15× intensity, destroying two enemy posts and a supply vehicle. (Sources).” The post gained over 97,000 views. Another Indian propaganda account shared the same video with the following caption: “Pakistani accounts have accidentally exposed their own embarrassment sharing videos showing the Indian Army pounding Pak Army posts in Leepa Valley (PoK) after Pakistan violated the ceasefire near Tangdhar. Artillery fire. Precision strikes.” The post garnered over 20,000 views. Journalist Sumair Jamil also shared the video with the following caption: “Pak India LoC firing update. Indian army intermittently firing in the Leepa Valley sector of Azad Kashmir. Pakistan army is responding with full force.” His post received 1,000 views. The video was also shared by a pro-military account with the following caption: “Five Indian posts that were firing on the Leepa Valley sector in Kashmir have been blown away. The enemy has raised white flags. Our losses are zero, the enemy will report its own losses. Silence has also prevailed in the Tatta Pani and Haji Pir sectors .” Several other pro-Indian and pro-Afghan accounts reshared the same footage as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here , gaining over 19,000 views collectively. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and to dispel any confusion about the incident, about which very few details have been released so far. A keyword search to corroborate whether the footage was from the fresh hostilities did not yield any video report featuring the same footage from Pakistani or Indian media outlets. A reverse image search of the video’s keyframes showed that the same clip was shared previously on May 9, 2025, by multiple users. No older shares of the video were found from before the May conflict. Those sharing the video at the time, including Geo News correspondent Murtaza Ali Shah , also said that it was from live firing between Pakistan and India. While the exact location of the older video along the LoC could not be conclusively determined due to a lack of details, it is clear that it is not from the current outbreak of shelling in Leepa Valley. On May 9, 2025, heavy fighting erupted along the Pakistan-India border and LoC, with both sides accusing each other of major ceasefire violations. Pakistani media reported civilian casualties in Hajira and Neelum Valley, while India claimed to have intercepted multiple drone incursions from across the border. Shelling had forced residents to flee border villages, and emergency shelters were opened amid fears of further escalation. International observers warned that the clashes marked the most serious escalation in years between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows cross-border shelling from a recent flare-up in violence between India and Pakistan in the Leepa Valley is false . The footage is old and was shared previously in the May 2025 conflict between the two countries. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

However, Islamic Jihad denied it was planning an attack. Speaking aboard US President Donald Trump’s plane during a trip to Asia, Rubio said: “We don’t view that as a violation of the ceasefire.” The US top diplomat added that Israel has not surrendered its right to self-defence as part of the agreement brokered by Washington, Egypt and Qatar that saw Hamas release the remaining living hostages held in Gaza this month. “They have the right if there’s an imminent threat to Israel, and all the mediators agree with that,” Rubio insisted. Rubio said the ceasefire in Gaza, which remains in force between Israel and Hamas just over two years since the conflict began, was based on obligations on both sides, reiterating that Hamas needs to speed up the return of the remains of hostages who died in captivity.

      "summary_orig": "Eight people, including seven Levies Force personnel, were injured in a bomb blast targeting the convoy of Kech Deputy Commissioner (DC) Major (retd) Bashir Barech in Balochistan’s Turbat on Monday, according to police. Kech Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Captain (retd) Zohaib Mohsin told Dawn.com that a remote-controlled bomb was used in the attack that took place at Press Club road. “The bomb, which was planted in a motorcycle, was triggered using a remote control when the DC’s convoy was passing by the area,” he said, adding that five Levies personnel and a passerby were injured in the incident. He later told Dawn.com that the number of the injured had increased to eight, including seven Levies personnel. The Kech DC remained safe as he was in a bulletproof vehicle, he added. He was travelling from his home to office and his car was only partially damaged in the incident, the SSP said. “The blast was so intense that four of the vehicles parked nearby and closely located buildings were also damaged,” SSP Mohsin added. Police and Frontier Corps personnel had reached the site of the incident and were further investigating the matter, he said. Pakistan has witnessed an increase in terrorist attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The increase followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s move to end a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. On Saturday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while addressing the Balochistan Workshop in Islamabad, regretted the resurgence of terrorism in Balochistan and other regions, calling for a serious look at “the reasons that led to the unrest”. One of the recent incidents of terrorism in the province took place on October 9, when a bomb exploded on a railway track near Dera Murad Jamali. The track connects Balochistan to the rest of the country. A railway employee was killed in the incident while train services were suspended following the fourth incident of such nature in a month. This incident followed a blast in the provincial capital of Quetta on September 30. At least 10 people were martyred and 32 injured in the incident when a bomb blast had ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s FC headquarters. A week prior to that, women and chil­dren were among 12 people injured wh­en the Quetta-bound Jaf­far Express was targeted in a bomb blast in the Spizend area of Balochistan’s Mas­tung district. In another explosion near a taxi stand in the Pak-Afghan border area of ​​Chaman on September 18, at least five people were killed and one was injured. Similarly, at least five people were killed and 29 injured in a blast at a rally of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium on September 2.",

      "title_orig": "Kundi seeks PM’s intervention against ‘unconstitutional’ restrictions on inter-provincial movement of wheat",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Monday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif against “unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province. The development comes as the Punjab government has faced criticism by the KP and Sindh governments for choking wheat flow to the two provinces. However, a day earlier, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari insisted that there was no ban on the inter-provincial movement of wheat, terming the “ongoing propaganda in this regard baseless and contrary to facts”. In a post on social media platform X today, the KP governor said he had written to the premier, urging his “immediate intervention to lift the unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province. “Such limitations not only affect the province’s food security but also go against the spirit of cooperative federalism enshrined in our Constitution,” he said. He expressed his confidence that the matter would be resolved promptly “under the prime minister’s leadership”. The letter, which Kundi also posted on X, termed the restrictions a “serious concern”, pointing out that KP was a “wheat-deficient province and depends substantially on inter-provincial inflows to meet its essential food requirements”. It said that the restrictions were against Article 151 of the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse among the provinces. “Any disruption in supply risks creating artificial shortages, price escalation and public hardship,” he said. “It has further been observed that these limitations are unintentionally encouraging illegal and informal transportation of wheat through alternate means and routes, which is resulting in uncontrollable supply distortions in the open market. This diversion is causing [a] rapid escalation in wheat and flour prices, directly burdening the general public and potentially triggering unwarranted public resentment,” he said. Kundi requested PM Shehbaz’s “kind and immediate intervention in this matter and direction to the concerned authorities” to withdraw the restrictions in order to ensure the “uninterrupted and legally protected movement of wheat” into KP. “I remain confident that, under your leadership, the constitutional rights of the people of KP will be safeguarded effectively and without delay,” he said. Kundi seeks restoration of daily int’l flights from Peshawar Separately, the KP governor wrote to Defence Minister Khawaja Asif requesting him to restore daily flights between Peshawar and Karachi, as well as international ones, “particularly to the Gulf and Middle Eastern countries”. “The suspension of these (international) flights has caused considerable hardship for overseas Pakistanis, entrepreneurs and their families,” Kundi said in a later post on X, noting that a “large expatriate population” from KP was employed in the Middle East. Kundi further said a “single private airline is operating with absolute monopoly” on the route between Peshawar and Karachi, inconveniencing people and traders due to exorbitant fares and limited seat availability. The governor requested Asif to issue directions to restore the flight services, adding, “I also earnestly hope and pray that our National Flag Bearer airline will once again ascend to command the skies of the world as it gloriously did during the golden decades of the 1960s and 1970s.” KP’s grievances In the aftermath of the recent floods, the Punjab government had begun tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage. The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement. While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. On Sept 7, Kundi had regretted the reports that Punjab had banned the movement of wheat to other provinces. He had issued another condemnation of the reported ban the very next day in a post on social media platform X. “The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi had said on X. The Constitution’s Article 151 states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”. The KP governor had further said: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation. “On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban.” Meanwhile, on Sept 7, the KP Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province. Subsequently, the government had approved a national wheat policy earlier this month. According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, stakeholders were told during a briefing about the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat. Then, in a letter dated October 23, the KP government had asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province. KP’s food secretary, in a letter to his Punjab counterpart, said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security. The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depended on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day. “The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read. While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements. KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force. “This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said. The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by PM Shehbaz, on October 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025 . “The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said. Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed. Last week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had again condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to the province, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province. Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat. Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable. Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5m tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces.",

      "summary_orig": "• Held under watchful eye of Qatari, Turkish mediators, talks spill over into second day after Pak-Afghan delegations fail to reach consensus • Pakistani officials share photo, documentary evidence of terror groups operating from Afghan territory • Amid mixed signals from Taliban power centres in Kabul & Kandahar, Islamabad refuses suggestion to directly negotiate with TTP ISLAMABAD: Stalemate persisted on Sunday at the Pakistan-Afghanistan talks in Istanbul, with the Afghan Taliban delegation appearing reluctant to take verifiable action against sanctuaries of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil. This was the second day of the dialogue, which stretched into Sunday after both sides failed to find common ground on the issue of ending terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan. After nearly nine hours of intense discussions late into the night, Pakistani security officials said their delegation had presented its “final position” to the Afghan side, insisting that the Taliban regime must take “concrete and verifiable steps to eliminate cross-border terrorism from and inside Afghanistan”. “Pakistan has made it clear that the ongoing patronage of terrorists by the Afghan Taliban is unacceptable,” the senior security official said. Taliban responses to Pakistani assertions about terrorism emanating from Afghan soil were rejected as “illogical and opposite to ground realities”. In a thinly veiled reference to India, which has recently deepened ties with Kabul, the security official said the Taliban delegation “appeared to be following someone else’s agenda”. This stance seemed to be vindicated when, in the midst of the Istanbul process, Indian forces apparently violated the cea­sefire in the Leepa Sector of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. While there was no official word on losses, locals reported an intense exchange of fire on Sunday evening. The official cautioned that this position of the Taliban “was not in the interest of Afghanistan, Pakistan, or the region”. The source added that any further progress in the talks would depend on the “positive attitude of the Afghan Taliban”. Earlier in the day, the Afghan delegation presented a written response to Pakistan’s demands submitted the previous day, after which Pakistan shared its counter-response. A second session subsequently began after midday, in the presence of senior Turkish and Qatari mediators. There was initial optimism following the exchange of documents and the start of a second session that had not been planned earlier. However, after protracted negotiations, the optimism faded as the Taliban delegation refused to provide any written assurances. The Afghan representatives, who were receiving directions from Kabul and Kandahar, appeared to lack the mandate to make decisions, officials said. Their reluctance to provide written commitments was interpreted by the Pakistani side as a sign of unwillingness to act against the TTP and other militant groups with hideouts in Afghanistan. During the two days of talks, Pakistan presented photographic and documentary evidence of TTP, BLA, and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, including details of their leadership and movements. The Pakistani delegation also shared photographs and Afghan identity documents of infiltrators captured during recent border incidents, insiders said. At one stage, the Afghan Taliban offered to bring the TTP to the table for direct talks with Pakistani authorities. Islamabad, however, categorically refused, reiterating that it would not negotiate with a terrorist group and that it was the Taliban’s responsibility to end their patronage of the TTP. Echoing Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s earlier remarks, Pakistani negotiators told the Afghan side that Islamabad was ready to pay any price to neutralise the threat emanating from Afghan soil for the safety of its people. They cautioned that the Afghan population would suffer because of the Taliban regime’s continued intransigence. Pakistan’s core demand throughout the talks remained decisive action against terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan. While the dialogue continued in Istanbul, Pakistan’s military reported major infiltration attempts across the Pak-Afghan border, further casting doubt on the Taliban’s intentions. The two attempts, occurring in Kurram and North Waziristan, were framed by ISPR as occurring “while delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye”. “This casts doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan government regarding its commitment to addressing terrorism emanating from its soil,” the military noted. The two-day talks followed the Oct 19 Doha ceasefire , mediated by Qatar, which ended a week of deadly border clashes . Türkiye hosted the current round as part of its expanded mediation role, while Qatar acted as guarantor of the truce and facilitator of dialogue. The Pakistani delegation comprised senior security and intelligence officials, including representatives from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Directorate of Military Operations, and the Foreign Office. The Afghan side was led by Deputy Interior Minister Mawlawi Rahmatullah Najeeb and included senior Taliban figures such as Anas Haqqani, Suhail Shaheen, Noorur Rahman Nusrat, and Abdul Qahar Balkhi. Diplomatic sources said mediators were attempting to keep both sides engaged to prevent a complete breakdown in communication. Published in Dawn, October 27th, 2025",
