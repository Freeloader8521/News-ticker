      "summary_orig": "NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in New Delhi for a globally watched strategic visit on Thursday. The high-profile two-day dash is being seen as a diplomatic tightrope walk for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, coping with a brusque and demanding US President Donald Trump over India’s ties with Russia , particularly its oil purchases from Moscow. Mr Modi signalled the importance of the occasion by personally receiving Mr Putin at the airport, though he also continued to breach a long held protocol by denying the Russian head of state a meeting with India’s opposition leaders. To Rahul Gandhi, leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha, Mr Modi’s decision to not allow him a meeting with Mr Putin indicated the government’s “insecurity”. Given that three European ambassadors had published a strong critique of Mr Putin in Indian newspapers in the run up to the visit last week, there eviden­tly was a strong need for Mr Modi to keep the talks close to his chest. This would be the first visit to India by Mr Putin since the war in Ukraine began in 2022, and “is not without some anxious moments for New Delhi,” said The Hindu . “The government manages a tense tightrope walk between Russia and Wes­tern countries, particularly Europe, on a number of issues including the optics of the visit, oil imports and trade, defence, nuclear cooperation and a mobility agreement.” The visit was earlier slated for January this year, and the Russian side had announced it in October 2024. Then it curiously disappeared from the radar evidently in deference to Mr Modi’s proximity to Mr Trump. When that relationship soured, however, Mr Modi found himself clasping the only stable hand available. While high-grade defence purchases have been pencilled for the talks, an unusual centre-piece of Mr Putin’s visit is the dire need for Rus­sia to find skilled labour for his cou­ntry that has put much of its manpower in the debilitating Ukraine war. The India-Russia labour mobility agreement to be launched as the “centrepiece” of the visit on Friday, will also be crucial for Indian skilled and semi-skilled workers, who are seeking jobs as other Western markets tighten immigration controls. According to The Hindu a war-weary and heavily-sanctioned Russia is facing a labour shortfall of what is estimated to be about 3.1 million jobs by the end of the decade. Russia is seeking Indian workers in construction, technology and manufacturing sectors. A controversy over an editorial piece written by the envoys of Fra­n­­ce, Germany and the United Kin­gdom to India criticising Mr Putin over the war and accusing him of delaying peace talks stalks Mr Modi. Indian officials tamely said the editorials were unacceptable. On the other hand, New Delhi is expecting to host German Chan­­cel­lor Friedrich Merz in early January, followed by EU’s top leadership Ursula Von Der Leyen and Antonio Costa as guests for Republic Day, and hopes to finalise the EU-India FTA at the EU-India Leaders’ Sum­m­it at that time. Given the circumstances, the Indian government cou­ld only lean on Russian Ambassador Denis Alipov writing a rebuttal piece the next day. Russian oil remains a key component of the visit. After a leap in India’s oil purchases, which went from less than 2 per cent before the war, to 40pc last year, India is now drastically curtailing import of Russian oil. Russian sources have said the reduction was expected to be temporary amid reports that the Ukraine war could be coming to an end under the twin pressure of Mr Trump’s engagements with Mr Putin and Russia’s widely acknowledged successes in the battlefield. India had earlier given up on purchasing Iranian and Venezuelan oil. In the final equation, as Mr Putin put it in October, it is India that stands to lose, a whopping 9-10 billion dollars, whether it braves sanctions or gives up on Russian oil.

      "summary_orig": "• US president pushes Netanyahu to ‘adjust his approach’ • Ceasefire negotiations drag on sans progress WASHINGTON: US Pres­ident Donald Trump has indicated that the next stage of his administration’s plan for Gaza is poised to begin soon, making the declaration even as violence flared anew in the region. Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office on Wednesday when phase two will commence, Trump avoided answering directly, saying the process is “going along well”, the Times of Israel reported. “It’s going on very well. We have peace in the Middle East. People don’t realise it,” Yeni Safak quoted him as saying — a claim immediately challenged by the reported casualties from Israeli airstrikes. The attacks followed a threat from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netan­yahu to respond after soldiers were injured in clashes with Palestinian fighters in the city of Rafah. “Phase two is moving along. It’s going to happen pret­ty soon,” he added. Tru­mp had previously declared on October 14 that phase two “had already begun”. According to the Middle East Monitor , during a recent phone call between the US president and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, the former raised several issues where he wanted Netanyahu to adjust his approach, starting with allowing the second phase of the agreement intended to end the war in Gaza. During the call, Trump asked Netanyahu: “Why they were being killed rather than allowed to surrender,” referring to Hamas fighters reportedly killed in Rafah. Netanyahu reportedly replied that they were “armed and dangerous”, so they are being eliminated. Negotiations Meanwhile, negotiations on the next stage of the Gaza ceasefire continue without significant progress at a moment when the truce appears particularly fragile, AFP reported on Thursday. The first phase included a withdrawal of Israeli forces on October 10 to a line that still gave them military control of over half of Gaza, the release of all prisoners, living or dead, held by Hamas or its allies, and an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza. Though all living prisoners were released on October 13, one body is still said to be in Gaza. For now, the Israeli government demands that the last hostage’s remains are returned before any talks begin on the second phase via mediating countries: United States, Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye. Egypt will also host a conference on Gaza’s reconstruction that will focus on the territory’s humanitarian needs but no date has yet been set. The process seems to be stuck mainly due to the Trump plan’s grey areas. “Israel doesn’t really seem to be putting any serious thought into what the post-war phase is supposed to look like,” said Michael Milshtein, a researcher at Tel Aviv University.

      "summary_orig": "On November 13, just two days after a suicide blast outside Islamabad’s district and sessions court killed 12 people and injured 36, the federal government announced a sweeping new security scheme for the capital. The plan hinged on a “ secure neighbourhood ” registration drive, called the ICT (Islamabad Capital Territory) Household Survey. It was designed to collect information about who was occupying every house, shop or office across the city. Officials framed it as a necessary response to a fast-changing city. Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon, during a press briefing, said residents could fill the digital form themselves by downloading an app. However, survey teams, along with police, would still visit door-to-door. He added that the system would flag households with incomplete information, which the administration would retrieve, whether by “ force or other means ”. Memon’s warning was not rhetorical. On November 23, state-owned Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported that survey teams had recorded 5,553 households in person, while 2,592 residents submitted their information via the mobile app. The combined approach ensured coverage for residents with limited internet access or digital literacy, and officials said participation through the app had been steadily rising. In Islamabad’s Sector I-8, Asad Shahid recalled hesitating when surveyors knocked on his door. “I was reluctant to share the details when the team visited my house,” he told Dawn . Yet the dynamic shifted when he saw a policeman accompanying the survey team. “One of my neighbours refused to cooperate with the team, so they called the police. When I saw this, I shared my information.” Such scenes deepened a longstanding divide in how residents saw these periodic data drives, a practice Islamabad had revived multiple times since 2009 . Residents who supported the survey said it was a long-overdue attempt to understand who lived in the capital, especially after years of unregulated internal migration. Critics, on the other hand, viewed it as a “forced intrusion” lacking a legal framework and no guarantees of data protection. Authorities insisted the purpose was straightforward. Per police and city administration officials, the survey was meant to provide comprehensive security for Islamabad’s residents, with one policeman, speaking anonymously, noting that a surge of newcomers from across Pakistan had increased the possibility that “ militants and terrorists were among them and staying in the capital in rented houses”. Officials admitted there was “no law to ask the details from the landlord and the tenants,” which was why the district magistrate was asked to issue compulsory orders. The city had attempted similar surveys in 2009, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2023 and again in April 2024. Each cycle followed a familiar pattern: a security incident, an administrative push, and public resistance. For some residents, the newest version was simply common sense. “At the end of the day, I think it’s a good initiative,” said a resident of Sector F-8, who requested not to be named. “I checked with some of my connections, and it seems legit. It doesn’t seem to cause any harm, other than the fact that I don’t trust people with my private data. But with the app, if I can submit it online safely, I am fine with it. Mostly, I’ve heard the authorities want to kick out illegal residents.” In Barakahu, Rayan Abbasi also welcomed the effort. “The government should know who is residing in a house. There are a large number of natives of the neighbouring country in my area, and no one knows what they do for a living or the number of their family members,” he said. Residents of Shalimar and Mehran apartments said the survey could help curb the use of residential flats as boys’ hostels or for “late-night activities” where “residents never know who is coming”. Faisal Khan, a resident of F-10, said the apartment he purchased in E-11/4 had become “notorious for parties and other illegal activities”. “The resale value had gone down because the apartment building had been maligned. I am glad this initiative has been taken so we find out who is doing illegal stuff,” he added. Arqam Naveed from Sector G-13, told Dawn , “I was hesitant initially when the survey team came, but my neighbour downstairs was giving the information, so I didn’t mind either.” He, however, added that the team “needs to show credentials or an authority letter.” But not everyone was comfortable with the survey. “Those living in posh and semi-posh areas are afraid of sharing their details,” one summary of resident feedback said, a worry repeated across Islamabad’s more affluent neighbourhoods. Adnan from Sector F-7, who chose to be identified by his first name only, opined that the plan was “just for optics.” “The government does not care about our privacy or security. This is just being done to calm the public down.” Civil liberties groups were far more direct. “Such campaigns could normalise extralegal surveillance, setting a precedent for unchecked government intrusion into private lives,” warned Haroon Baloch of Bytes for All, an NGO that advocates for digital rights, privacy, and freedom of expression in Pakistan. He argued that the practice “undermines constitutional protections including Article 14 of Pakistan’s Constitution on dignity and privacy,” risks creating “a chilling effect,” and could easily become “a tool for political control, such as targeting dissenters, journalists, or minorities”. Lawyers, too, saw legal chaos beneath the administrative confidence. “It is a good initiative as far as the safety and security of citizens is concerned … But the biggest issue is the way they are collecting the data,” said Waiza Rafique, a high court lawyer. “As of now, there is no law in Pakistan regarding data protection … no clear privacy protocols … and no defined punishments if those protocols are breached,” she warned. “You can give Rs2,000 or even Rs500 to someone, and they can access all the history, data and everything. Privacy is compromised,” she said. Political voices zeroed in on the same issue. Senator Palwasha Khan, speaking in parliament, asked: “Under which law does the chairman allow harassment by ringing people’s doorbells and forcibly collecting private information? If this data is sold on the dark web for Rs100 … who will stop it?” Even veteran rights advocates viewed the move as part of a wider pattern of intrusive governance. “I think there’s already a lot of intrusion in the private lives of citizens by the state,” Harris Khalique, Secretary General of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), told Dawn . He argued that with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) already possessing extensive citizen data, further household-level probing was unnecessary. “There has to be some kind of a limit. This is not how crime is dealt with in other countries.” The city administration, however, remained firm in its defence. “People’s apprehensions about privacy invasion are baseless because their personal data already exists with Nadra,” DC Memon told Dawn . He insisted the survey is “standard practice worldwide” and added that so far, “our survey teams have been receiving cooperation from the public”. Dawn also reached out to the Minister of State for Interior, Tallal Chaudhry, for a comment, but he did not respond. Others preferred the government take a different route altogether. Tariq Afghan, a high court advocate, said incidents like the court blast “once again exposed the gaps in our national security framework”. Instead of ad-hoc responses, he argued, the state must “fully and transparently implement the National Action Plan in letter and spirit” and craft uniform national security protocols with provinces. As the survey continued, the city remained caught between cooperation and caution, leaving the balance between vigilance and intrusion unsettled. Additional reporting by Nadir Guramani.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Forty-four Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have written to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, demanding immediate sanctions on senior Pakistani officials over what they described as an “escalating campaign of transnational repression and worsening human rights crisis in Pakistan”. The effort is led by Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Congressman Greg Casar, and includes signatures from Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, two Muslim members of the House known for their advocacy on Palestinian and other Muslim issues. In the letter, made public on Wednesday, the lawmakers called for targeted measures, including visa bans and asset freezes on officials responsible for threatening US citizens and residents who criticise Pakistan’s military establishment, as well as their family members in Pakistan. There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, or the embassy in Washington. More than 40 lawmakers write to Marco Rubio, ask for sanctions against officials involved in ‘transnational repression’ The letter emphasises the need for Washington to act against those who “weaponise state power to jail political opponents, intimidate citizens abroad, and crush democratic freedoms”, said First Pakistan Global, a rights group sympathetic to the PTI, which distributed the letter. “In recent years, US citizens and residents who have spoken out against authoritarian abuses in Pakistan have faced threats, intimidation, and harassment — often extending to their families in Pakistan. These tactics include arbitrary detentions, coercion, and retaliatory violence, targeting diaspora individuals and their relatives,” the letter stated. The lawmakers warned that Pakistan was experiencing a deepening authoritarian crisis: opposition leaders have been detained without charge, journalists intimidated or forced into exile, and ordinary citizens arrested for social media activity. Women, religious minorities, and ethnic communities — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate repression, they claimed. “This authoritarian system in Pakistan is sustained through relentless repression. Opposition leaders are held without charge, denied fair trial, and kept in indefinite pretrial detention. Independent journalists are harassed, abducted, or forced into exile. Ordinary citizens are arrested for social media posts, while women, religious minorities, and marginalised ethnic groups — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate violence and surveillance,” the letter read. The lawmakers cited specific cases, including that of Virginia-based investigative journalist Ahmad Noorani, whose brothers were allegedly abducted and held for over a month after his reporting on military corruption. They also raised concerns about the 2024 elections , noting irregularities documented by independent observation reports. The US State Department had previously expressed concern over these irregularities and called for a full investigation. The letter urged the US administration to impose measures such as Global Magnitsky sanctions, visa bans, and asset freezes against officials credibly perpetrating systematic and transnational repression. It also called for the release of former prime minister Imran Khan and other political prisoners. “Such steps would reinforce US commitment to human rights, protect American citizens from transnational repression, and promote regional stability,” the lawmakers wrote. To strengthen congressional oversight, the lawmakers submitted five detailed questions to the State Department regarding sanctions, conditions for targeted measures, and steps to protect US residents from threats directed at their families abroad. The lawmakers have requested a response from Secretary Rubio by Dec 17, 2025. Earlier this year, more than 50 lawmakers submitted another resolution in the House, named the “ Pakistan Freedom and Accountability Act ”. It sought legal sanctions against those responsible for “undermining democracy in Pakistan”. That resolution, HR 5271, is in queue for voting at the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

      "summary_orig": "• Syedal Khan Nasir lists Nawaz Sharif among them; threatens to suspend members who violate ruling • ‘Flouts rules himself’ by prohibiting lawmaker from participating in session for pointing out quorum ISLAMABAD: In a strange ruling that left many red-faced, Senate Deputy Chairman Syedal Khan Nasir on Thursday barred criticism of ‘national heroes’ and political leadership in the House. “You cannot speak against political heroes who suffered martyrdom, went into exile, worked for the nation and the country, conducted nuclear tests, and made [the] nuclear bomb,” he remarked just after finishing the day’s agenda of Senate amid voices of dissent from the opposition benches. The Senate deputy chairman asserted that he could place such a bar declaring that the House would now run under the law. “Nobody can speak against institutions, national heroes and leaders of political parties,” he added. When Awami National Party (ANP) chief Aimal Wali Khan asked as to who these “national heroes” were, Mr Nasir replied that they included former premiers Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto, and Nawaz Sharif; nuclear scientist Dr A. Q. Khan; and all those who signed the 1973 Constitution. “A handful of elements cannot hold the House hostage,” he said before abruptly adjourning the House to meet again on Friday (today). Minutes earlier, Mr Nasir said he needed a minute to say something crucial and had assured a senator, who wanted to speak on a point of public importance, that he would be given time. The Senate deputy chairman said maintaining dignity of the House was a shared responsibility and it was the chair’s job to run it in accordance with the rules. He added that the chair had the power to issue a strict order for the sake of decorum of the House. “This also includes the power under Rule 246 to suspend a member obstructing proceedings of the House,” he continued. Mr Nasir recalled that he had given a ruling to this effect on Feb 18 as well but regretted that certain members from the opposition benches were continuously disrupting proceedings of the House. He warned that he would not refrain from taking extreme steps to smoothly run the proceedings, if the unruly conduct continued. Without naming the PTI, the deputy chairman said he would write a letter to the parliamentary leader of the party, seeking instructions for their members to act as per law and the rules. He expressed alarm over the practice of members gathering around the chair’s podium. Mr Nasir stressed that the chair and its rulings must be respected. The Senate deputy chairman, who stressed the need for running the proceedings as per the law and the rules, surprised many during the Question Hour, by punishing an opposition lawmaker for pointing out the quorum. Prohibiting the opposition senator who had pointed out the quorum from participating in the session, Mr Nasir said: “This is my ruling”. However, the ruling was seen by many as something against the rules provide and an established parliamentary practice. Govt negligence Earlier, during the Question Hour, PPP Senator Shahadat Awan regretted the delay in disbursement of postal life insurance claims to around 34,000 individuals including widows and orphans, terming it a failure on the part of the government his party was allied with. Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan candidly conceded that it was indeed the government’s incompetence and “negligence” that disbursement under the Postal Life Insurance Company Limited (PLICL) could not be delivered to the people on time. The minister also agreed with Mr Awan that as per the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, the PLICL was liable to pay liquidated damages for delays beyond 90 days, calculated at monthly base with a 5 per cent additional rate over the prevailing base rate. “This escalating financial exposure underscores the immediate need for additional budgetary allocation,” the minister noted, holding the finance ministry responsible for it.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan rubbished claims published in an Amnesty International report on Thursday that a spyware, manufactured by an Israeli company, was actively being used in the country. According to a senior intelligence officer, who spoke to Dawn on condition of anonymity, the report was an “an attempt to malign Pakistan”. “There is not an iota of truth in it,” he stressed. The official was referring to a claim made in the Amnesty International investigation, titled “Intellexa Leaks”, which described the story of a human rights lawyer based in Pakistan. The lawyer, according to the report, had approached Amnesty International in the summer of 2025 after receiving a suspicious link on WhatsApp from an unknown number. Amnesty Security Lab investigated the link and identified it as a Predator attack attempt based on the technical behaviour of the infection server. Predator is a highly invasive spyware manufactured by the Israeli company Intellexa. According to Amnesty International, the investigation was based on a combination of highly sensitive documents and other material leaked from the company, including internal company documents, sales and marketing materials, and training videos. The months-long investigation was published in collaboration with Inside Story in Greece, Haaretz in Israel, and WAV Research Collective in Switzerland. In 2023, Intellexa was fined by the Greek Data Protection Authority for failing to comply with its investigations into the company. Google started sending spyware threat notifications to several hundred of its users across various countries, including Pakistan. The accounts were identified as Predator spyware targets. How Predator works Intellexa’s Predator relies on “1-click” attacks to infect a device, which require a malicious link to be opened in the target’s phone. The malicious link then loads a browser exploit for Chrome or Safari to gain initial access to the device and download the full spyware payload. Once the spyware is installed, it can access encrypted instant messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, audio recordings, emails, device locations, screenshots and camera photos, stored passwords, contacts, and call logs. It also activates the device’s microphone. The spyware then communicates with, and uploads surveillance data to, a Predator backend server physically located in the customer’s country. All data from the spyware is first relayed through a chain of anonymization servers, termed the “CNC Anonymization Network” to prevent the risk of exposure for the operator with the 1-click attack link. The surveillance company overcame the limitation of exposure by using different approaches to trigger the opening of an infection link on the target’s phone, without requiring the target to manually click the link. Intellexa also developed a strategic infection vector, ‘Aladdin,’ which could enable silent zero-click infections of target devices anywhere in the world. The vector exploits the commercial mobile advertising ecosystem to carry out these infections. Intellexa is a surveillance company that develops spyware, with Predator as its signature product, and sells it for use by governments. According to the investigation, the company’s internal operations remained largely unknown to researchers.",

Once the spyware is installed, it can access encrypted instant messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, audio recordings, emails, device locations, screenshots and camera photos, stored passwords, contacts, and call logs. It also activates the device’s microphone. The spyware then communicates with, and uploads surveillance data to, a Predator backend server physically located in the customer’s country. All data from the spyware is first relayed through a chain of anonymization servers, termed the “CNC Anonymization Network” to prevent the risk of exposure for the operator with the 1-click attack link. The surveillance company overcame the limitation of exposure by using different approaches to trigger the opening of an infection link on the target’s phone, without requiring the target to manually click the link. Intellexa also developed a strategic infection vector, ‘Aladdin,’ which could enable silent zero-click infections of target devices anywhere in the world. The vector exploits the commercial mobile advertising ecosystem to carry out these infections. Intellexa is a surveillance company that develops spyware, with Predator as its signature product, and sells it for use by governments. According to the investigation, the company’s internal operations remained largely unknown to researchers.",
      "title": "Pakistan rubbishes claims of Israeli spyware being used in country",
      "summary": "Pakistan rubbished claims published in an Amnesty International report on Thursday that a spyware, manufactured by an Israeli company, was actively being used in the country. According to a senior intelligence officer, who spoke to Dawn on condition of anonymity, the report was an “an attempt to malign Pakistan”. “There is not an iota of truth in it,” he stressed. The official was referring to a claim made in the Amnesty International investigation, titled “Intellexa Leaks”, which described the story of a human rights lawyer based in Pakistan. The lawyer, according to the report, had approached Amnesty International in the summer of 2025 after receiving a suspicious link on WhatsApp from an unknown number. Amnesty Security Lab investigated the link and identified it as a Predator attack attempt based on the technical behaviour of the infection server. Predator is a highly invasive spyware manufactured by the Israeli company Intellexa. According to Amnesty International, the investigation was based on a combination of highly sensitive documents and other material leaked from the company, including internal company documents, sales and marketing materials, and training videos. The months-long investigation was published in collaboration with Inside Story in Greece, Haaretz in Israel, and WAV Research Collective in Switzerland. In 2023, Intellexa was fined by the Greek Data Protection Authority for failing to comply with its investigations into the company. Google started sending spyware threat notifications to several hundred of its users across various countries, including Pakistan. The accounts were identified as Predator spyware targets. How Predator works Intellexa’s Predator relies on “1-click” attacks to infect a device, which require a malicious link to be opened in the target’s phone.

      "title_orig": "Police block routes to Karachi Press Club, detain activist ahead of Aurat March press conference",
      "summary_orig": "Police on Thursday blocked routes leading to the Karachi Press Club ahead of a press conference by Aurat March over the alleged “abduction” of two Baloch girls and briefly detained an activist, with organisers claiming that other members were also manhandled. Aurat March, a women’s rights group, was set to hold a press conference at 3pm over the alleged “abduction” of two Baloch girls — 15-year-old Nasreen Baloch and 24-year-old Mahjabeen Baloch. Authorities closed off roads leading to KPC ahead of the press conference, which eventually began with a delay of approximately 20 minutes as the organisers said they were “stopped by the police” at the gate of the press club. Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) member Qazi Khizar said an activist named Sara was taken by the police from outside the KPC. Within a few hours, Aurat March confirmed to Dawn that she had been released. Dawn has reached out to the police for a comment on the detention. Senior journalist Dodal Chandio said in a post on Facebook that “police stopped the Aurat March women who were to hold a press conference” outside the KPC. The police “misbehaved” with activist Sheema Kirmani, he added. In the video he shared, Kirmani could be heard saying, “You have no right to touch me. How dare you touch me?” The video also showed policewomen grabbing another woman’s hand to detain her, as Kirmani told the cops that the woman was a reporter. As the tussle between them and the police continued, the woman said, “Let go of my hand. This is not a legal process.” In other videos that surfaced on social media, the woman identified herself as Shakeela and a member of “JMDC, Joint Minority Development”. She showed a “slip” issued to her for the press conference, which was being attended by “10 people” from her group. Journalist Zofeen Ebrahim, who was barred from attending the press conference, recalled to Dawn : “Police stationed outside KPC stopped me and asked me where I was going. “I told them I am here for the press conference, to which they said that it is not going to happen,” she continued. Ebrahim said that when she tried to make her way towards the KPC and was stopped by the police, she called the organisers to ask whether the press conference had been cancelled. “They also did not know what was going on,” she said. “Some other women who were trying to enter were stopped at the gate as well,” the journalist added. She also shared a video on X, asking, “What’s happening to my city, my country?” Prior to the press conference, the Karachi police also heightened security outside the KPC, with a considerable number of women personnel present, a Dawn correspondent reported. The nearby roads that had been shut to traffic were reopened by about 5pm. In a press release issued yesterday, Aurat March had said their press conference would “address the escalating pattern of enforced disappearances in Balochistan — particularly the alarming rise in the abduction of Baloch women and girls”. “The 4th Schedule has become a tool of coercion in Balochistan, with women — many of them entirely unaffiliated with activism — being placed on the list and denied freedom of movement,” the statement read. On November 27, police had detained 24 PTI leaders and workers following a protest at KPC to voice their concerns over former prime minister Imran Khan’s well-being. A week before that, the police had detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the venue of a scheduled protest by the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) against the 27th Constitutional Amendment. In March, Karachi police had arrested six people at Fawara Chowk as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) attempted to reach the KPC for a protest against the arrests of its leadership. Civil society seeks recovery of Mahjabeen Baloch, teenage Nasreen Baloch Aurat March’s press conference highlighted two cases — one of Nasreen who the group said was “abducted from Hub” in Balochistan in November, and another of Mahjabeen who was “taken from Quetta” earlier this year. Mahjabeen, the daughter of Ghulam Mustafa and a student of the University of Balochistan, was picked up from Quetta’s Civil Hospital in May, as per the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) Chairman Nasrullah Baloch. Activist and artist Sheema Kirmani addresses a press conference at Karachi Press Club on Dec 4, 2025. — via Imtiaz Ali At the outset of the press conference, Kirmani said she was “grabbed and pushed around” by police outside and questioned why the state was stopping them from holding a press conference. “What right did the state have to stop them from demanding the recovery of young Baloch girls?” she asked. “Are you a fascist government or a democratic government? What are you scared of?” Kirmani said furiously, adding that by meting out such treatment, the state was creating an atmosphere of hatred. Aurat March organiser Moneeza Ahmed asked, “Why are the families of Nasreena and Mahjabeen not even being allowed to ask the state about the whereabouts of their daughters?” She alleged that the state was attempting to intimidate activists and families of the missing young girls. “To what extent is the state willing to go?” Ahmed wondered. Kirmani claimed that police had also attempted to arrest BYC activist Sammi Deen Baloch as she made her way to the press conference. “The Baloch women have repeatedly stated that they have no relation to BLA, yet the state continues to harass them,” she lamented, referring to the banned so-called Baloch Liberation Army. Addressing the press conference, Khizer noted that “at the moment, KPC is surrounded by police from every corner”. “This is fear,” the vice chairman of the HRCP’s Sindh chapter added. He stressed that the “young Baloch girls fighting for their rights and those [militants] in remote mountains were not the same”. “The state has now resorted to picking up young girls,” he alleged, expressing his disappointment. Kirmani called on the government to “negotiate”, asking, “Why should they not know where their daughters are?” “Seven months have gone by ever since she has been gone, and we don’t know anything,” she said, referring to Mahjabeen. “Why are we not allowed to ask about their whereabouts?” she questioned. The activists demanded the “immediate recovery and safe return of both the girls, an end to enforced disappearances, protection for families of missing persons, and transparency from state institutions”.",

Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) member Qazi Khizar said an activist named Sara was taken by the police from outside the KPC. Within a few hours, Aurat March confirmed to Dawn that she had been released. Dawn has reached out to the police for a comment on the detention. Senior journalist Dodal Chandio said in a post on Facebook that “police stopped the Aurat March women who were to hold a press conference” outside the KPC. The police “misbehaved” with activist Sheema Kirmani, he added. In the video he shared, Kirmani could be heard saying, “You have no right to touch me. How dare you touch me?” The video also showed policewomen grabbing another woman’s hand to detain her, as Kirmani told the cops that the woman was a reporter. As the tussle between them and the police continued, the woman said, “Let go of my hand. This is not a legal process.” In other videos that surfaced on social media, the woman identified herself as Shakeela and a member of “JMDC, Joint Minority Development”. She showed a “slip” issued to her for the press conference, which was being attended by “10 people” from her group. Journalist Zofeen Ebrahim, who was barred from attending the press conference, recalled to Dawn : “Police stationed outside KPC stopped me and asked me where I was going. “I told them I am here for the press conference, to which they said that it is not going to happen,” she continued. Ebrahim said that when she tried to make her way towards the KPC and was stopped by the police, she called the organisers to ask whether the press conference had been cancelled. “They also did not know what was going on,” she said. “Some other women who were trying to enter were stopped at the gate as well,” the journalist added. She also shared a video on X, asking, “What’s happening to my city, my country?” Prior to the press conference, the Karachi police also heightened security outside the KPC, with a considerable number of women personnel present, a Dawn correspondent reported. The nearby roads that had been shut to traffic were reopened by about 5pm. In a press release issued yesterday, Aurat March had said their press conference would “address the escalating pattern of enforced disappearances in Balochistan — particularly the alarming rise in the abduction of Baloch women and girls”. “The 4th Schedule has become a tool of coercion in Balochistan, with women — many of them entirely unaffiliated with activism — being placed on the list and denied freedom of movement,” the statement read. On November 27, police had detained 24 PTI leaders and workers following a protest at KPC to voice their concerns over former prime minister Imran Khan’s well-being. A week before that, the police had detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the venue of a scheduled protest by the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) against the 27th Constitutional Amendment. In March, Karachi police had arrested six people at Fawara Chowk as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) attempted to reach the KPC for a protest against the arrests of its leadership. Civil society seeks recovery of Mahjabeen Baloch, teenage Nasreen Baloch Aurat March’s press conference highlighted two cases — one of Nasreen who the group said was “abducted from Hub” in Balochistan in November, and another of Mahjabeen who was “taken from Quetta” earlier this year. Mahjabeen, the daughter of Ghulam Mustafa and a student of the University of Balochistan, was picked up from Quetta’s Civil Hospital in May, as per the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) Chairman Nasrullah Baloch. Activist and artist Sheema Kirmani addresses a press conference at Karachi Press Club on Dec 4, 2025. — via Imtiaz Ali At the outset of the press conference, Kirmani said she was “grabbed and pushed around” by police outside and questioned why the state was stopping them from holding a press conference. “What right did the state have to stop them from demanding the recovery of young Baloch girls?” she asked. “Are you a fascist government or a democratic government? What are you scared of?” Kirmani said furiously, adding that by meting out such treatment, the state was creating an atmosphere of hatred. Aurat March organiser Moneeza Ahmed asked, “Why are the families of Nasreena and Mahjabeen not even being allowed to ask the state about the whereabouts of their daughters?” She alleged that the state was attempting to intimidate activists and families of the missing young girls. “To what extent is the state willing to go?” Ahmed wondered. Kirmani claimed that police had also attempted to arrest BYC activist Sammi Deen Baloch as she made her way to the press conference. “The Baloch women have repeatedly stated that they have no relation to BLA, yet the state continues to harass them,” she lamented, referring to the banned so-called Baloch Liberation Army. Addressing the press conference, Khizer noted that “at the moment, KPC is surrounded by police from every corner”. “This is fear,” the vice chairman of the HRCP’s Sindh chapter added. He stressed that the “young Baloch girls fighting for their rights and those [militants] in remote mountains were not the same”. “The state has now resorted to picking up young girls,” he alleged, expressing his disappointment. Kirmani called on the government to “negotiate”, asking, “Why should they not know where their daughters are?” “Seven months have gone by ever since she has been gone, and we don’t know anything,” she said, referring to Mahjabeen. “Why are we not allowed to ask about their whereabouts?” she questioned. The activists demanded the “immediate recovery and safe return of both the girls, an end to enforced disappearances, protection for families of missing persons, and transparency from state institutions”.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was prevented for the ninth time by prison authorities from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Thursday. Imran’s sister Uzma Khan met the party founder in prison on Tuesday after weeks of effort, with CM Afridi and other party leaders scheduled to meet him today. The meeting took place as rumours regarding Imran’s health began circulating in local and foreign media, despite claims by the government and PTI leaders that the former prime minister was in good health. These speculations, however, gained traction due to the government’s reluctance to let visitors, including his family members and legal team, meet Imran over the past few weeks. According to a post on X by the PTI, CM Afridi went to Adiala jail to visit Imran, but access was not granted. Afridi addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access. He said he would update the media on the immediate course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not. The PTI also shared a video of the KP CM and his delegation in a waiting room, saying that today was the ninth instance of Afridi not being allowed to meet Imran. In a talk with the media after exiting the room, CM Afridi said: “I think the meeting is not being allowed.

He also lashed out at the government for not being able to tolerate and bear a chief minister from the tribal areas for the first time. Afridi said removing him would cause anger and frustration among the people from the tribal belt. “The people of KP and Pakistan see their future in me,” Afridi claimed, adding that the governor’s rule would be a “win-win” situation for him since he would be able to operate freely.

      "summary_en": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was prevented for the ninth time by prison authorities from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Thursday. Imran’s sister Uzma Khan met the party founder in prison on Tuesday after weeks of effort, with CM Afridi and other party leaders scheduled to meet him today. The meeting took place as rumours regarding Imran’s health began circulating in local and foreign media, despite claims by the government and PTI leaders that the former prime minister was in good health. These speculations, however, gained traction due to the government’s reluctance to let visitors, including his family members and legal team, meet Imran over the past few weeks. According to a post on X by the PTI, CM Afridi went to Adiala jail to visit Imran, but access was not granted. Afridi addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access. He said he would update the media on the immediate course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not. The PTI also shared a video of the KP CM and his delegation in a waiting room, saying that today was the ninth instance of Afridi not being allowed to meet Imran. In a talk with the media after exiting the room, CM Afridi said: “I think the meeting is not being allowed. Today is the ninth time I have come; a chief minister of a province is repeatedly coming, but even a five-minute meeting is not being allowed. The whole world is witnessing this discriminatory treatment, and their actions are being noted and will be remembered.” “This government won’t remain forever and then no one will get a chance to complain.” When asked if he planned to spend another night outside the prison in protest, he said that Imran’s good physical health had been confirmed in the meeting with Uzma.
