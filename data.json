      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Wednesday extended the airspace restrictions on Indian aircraft till January 23. The extension was notified a week before the previous one was set to expire on December 24. “Pakistan airspace will remain closed to Indian-registered aircraft, including all aircraft owned, operated, or leased by Indian airlines, as well as Indian military flights,” the authority said, “According to the NOTAM, the restriction, which has already been in force, will continue until January 23, 2026, as per the specified timings,” it said. Notam issued by the Pakistan Airports Authority. Pakistan’s airspace is divided into two flight information regions (FIRs) — Karachi and Lahore, according to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) document from 2022. The Notam applies to both the Karachi (OPKR) and Lahore (OPLR) FIRs. India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines since tensions between them escalated in late April in the wake of an attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people. New Delhi, without evidence, had alleged that Islamabad backed the attack. Pakistan strongly denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe . Then, in early May, the nuclear-armed nations fought their fiercest military conflict in decades. Pakistan says it downed seven Indian jets during the conflict. Amid a financial toll from a ban on Indian carriers flying over Pakistan, it was reported in November that Air India was lobbying the Indian government to convince China to let it use a sensitive military airspace zone in Xinjiang to shorten routes.",

      "summary_orig": "A man who allegedly opened fire on a Jewish Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach has been charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, police said on Wednesday. The alleged father-and-son perpetrators opened fire on the celebration at Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing 15 in an attack that shook the nation and intensified fears of rising anti-Semitism and violent extremism. Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son Naveed Akram emerged from a coma on Tuesday afternoon after also being shot by police. On Tuesday, it emerged that Sajid was originally from the Indian city of Hyderabad, with police saying his family did not know about his “radical mindset”. New South Wales Police said on Wednesday that a man had been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of wounding with attempt to murder, as well as a terror offence and other charges. “Police will allege in court the man engaged in conduct that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community,” it said in a statement. “Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia”. A court filing on Wednesday named Naveed, who remains in a Sydney hospital under heavy police guard, as the man charged. Funerals begin Funerals of the Jewish victims of Sunday’s attack began on Wednesday, amid anger over how the gunmen — one of whom was briefly investigated for links to extremists — were allowed access to powerful firearms. Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state where the attack took place, told a news conference on Wednesday that parliament would return on December 22 to hear “urgent” reforms, including capping the number of firearms allowed by a single person and making certain types of shotguns harder to access. The state government will also look at reforms making it harder to hold large street protests after terror events, in order to prevent further tensions. “We’ve got a monumental task in front of us. It’s huge,” he said. “It’s a huge responsibility to pull the community together. I think we need a summer of calm and togetherness, not division.” Naveed remains in a Sydney hospital under heavy police guard. The men accused of carrying out Sunday’s attack had travelled to the southern Philippines, weeks before the shooting that Australian police said appeared to be inspired by Islamic State. US President Donald Trump told a Hanukkah event at the White House late on Tuesday that he was thinking of the victims of the “horrific and antisemitic terrorist attack”. “We join in mourning all of those who were killed, and we’re praying for the swift recovery of the wounded,” he said. Funerals for jewish victim begin A funeral for Rabbi Eli Schlanger, an assistant rabbi at Chabad Bondi Synagogue and a father of five, was held on Wednesday. He was known for his work for Sydney’s Jewish community through Chabad, a global organisation fostering Jewish identity and connection. Schlanger would travel to prisons and meet with Jewish people living in Sydney’s public housing communities, Jewish leader Alex Ryvchin said on Monday. Albanese is facing criticism that his centre-left government did not do enough to prevent the spread of antisemitism in Australia during the two-year Israel-Gaza war. “We will work with the Jewish community, we want to stamp out and eradicate antisemitism from our society,” Albanese told reporters. The government and intelligence services are also under pressure to explain why Sajid was allowed to legally acquire the high-powered rifles and shotguns used in the attack. The government has already promised sweeping reforms to gun laws. His son, meanwhile, was briefly investigated by Australia’s domestic intelligence agency in 2019 over alleged links to Islamic State, but there was no evidence at the time he posed a threat, Albanese said. Man praised as hero to undergo surgery Albanese said Ahmed al-Ahmed, 43, the man who tackled one of the shooters to disarm his rifle and suffered gunshot wounds, was due to undergo surgery on Wednesday. Al-Ahmed’s uncle, Mohammed al-Ahmed in Syria, said his nephew left his hometown in Syria’s northwest province of Idlib nearly 20 years ago to seek work in Australia. “We learned through social media. I called his father and he told me that it was Ahmed. Ahmed is a hero, we’re proud of him. Syria in general is proud of him,” the uncle told Reuters . The family of 22-year-old police officer Jack Hibbert, who was shot twice on Sunday and had been on the force for just four months, said in a statement on Wednesday that he had lost vision in one eye and faced a “long and challenging recovery” ahead. “In the face of a violent and tragic incident, he responded with courage, instinct, and selflessness, continuing to protect and help others whilst injured, until he was physically no longer able to,” the family said. Health authorities said 22 people were still in several Sydney hospitals. Holocaust survivor among victims Other shooting victims included a Holocaust survivor, a husband and wife who first approached the gunmen before they started firing, and a 10-year-old girl named Matilda, according to interviews, officials and media reports. Matilda’s father told a Bondi vigil on Tuesday night he did not want his daughter’s legacy to be forgotten. “We came here from Ukraine and I thought that Matilda is the most Australian name that can ever exist. So just remember the name, remember her,” local media reported him as saying. In Bondi on Wednesday, swimmers gathered on Sydney’s most popular beach and held a minute’s silence. “This week has obviously been very profound, and this morning, I definitely feel a sense of the community getting together, and a sense of everyone sitting together,” Archie Kalaf, a 24-year-old Bondi man, told Reuters . “Everyone’s grieving, everyone’s understanding and processing it in their own way.”",

      "summary_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan has said he and his brother Suleiman have applied for their visas and are planning a trip to Pakistan in January, while also commenting on the conditions in which the ex-premier was kept and saying that he was being held in a “death cell”. The remarks were made during an interview to Yalda Hakim for Sky News, which came as another sit-in held outside Adiala jail by Imran’s sisters over being denied a meeting with him was dispersed using water cannons; the party alleged that authorities used “chemical-laced” water. As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. During their interview with Hakim, released early on Wednesday, Kasim and Suleiman, who live in London, were asked whether they had tried to engage with the Pakistani government to get permission to visit Imran. Hakim also noted that they had previously talked about “being warned not to come” even though Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said they “were welcome to come and can visit him [Imran]”. At that, Kasim replied: “We are now planning to because they said it openly. So — unless they go against their word — we should be hopefully going in January. We have applied for our visas. […] It hasn’t come through yet. We are expecting it to come through, so we are planning a trip in January.” Hakim then asked them what they would say to Imran upon seeing him, and whether they would ask him to consider “cutting a deal”. But Kasim explained that “what you have to understand is it’s his life. It’s literally his passion and his goal. He calls it his life’s purpose to help rid Pakistan of corruption”. “And so if he just took a deal and came over to us and lived in England, I know there would be this burning desire and this aching that he has left his country for dead. And he would be depressed, to be honest. I know he would. “This is his goal, and as much as we’d love to have our father watching all of our cricket matches or football matches over here, he has a purpose which is far greater. So, you can only respect it,” he said. Asked what else they would want to say to Imran or what message they would like to send to him, Kasim said, “I want to know how we can get him out, how we can help because the main point is we feel so helpless at this point. I mean, there’s so much to catch up on.” He also shared that during their interactions, Imran would always refuse to talk about his jail conditions. “He’s like, ‘Oh, you know, don’t worry about me. How’s everything?’” Kasim said, adding that he would also enquire about their grandmother Lady Annabel Goldsmith, who died in October. “We haven’t spoken to him since she died only a couple of months ago, and I would love to speak to him about that. He called her his mother after his own mother had passed, and their relationship was so close. So, I’d love to speak to him about that,” he added. When Hakim asked them whether they think Imran “will ever get out”, their reply was not too optimistic. “The conditions are getting worse. The people in power are becoming more entrenched. So, it’s very hard to see a way out and a lot of the people we speak to […] are seeming less and less confident every time we speak to them. “So, we’re now worried we might never see him again,” Kasim said. He added that while the defence minister had said that they were welcome to visit Imran, he had his doubts. Suleiman also pointed out that Imran was “not the sort of person who’s going to make any compromises or cut a deal. So yeah, at the moment, that looks like the only easy route out, but I think international pressure is always an effective way of forcing change in these situations”. ‘Awful conditions’ Hakim also asked the two about the condition of Imran’s jail cell, to which Kasim said, “The conditions are awful. Like, they are not bad, they are awful.” Suleiman said the cell in which Imran was kept had been described as a “death cell”. “There are barely any lights, sometimes the electricity is cut off, there’s dirty water […] completely substandard conditions that don’t meet international laws for any sort of prisoner,” he claimed. They were also asked about “what went through their minds” when they came across rumours about Imran’s possible death on social media. Suleiman described that experience as “incredibly stressful”. “I went straight to my family group chat because that’s the only reliable source that we have on the ground in Pakistan,” he added. For his part, Kasim said coming across the rumours on social media was “jarring”. It “obviously pulls you out of whatever you are trying to do in your normal life. Especially, [given] how helpless we are over here, not able to do much at all,” he said. Hakim also brought up the subject of one of Imran’s sisters, Uzma, being allowed to meet him in jail in early December after weeks of restricted access. Following the meeting, a post on Imran’s X account against the military leadership, dubbed his message from jail, had led to a hard-hitting press briefing by Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry. Asked what Uzma shared with Kasim and Suleiman after the meeting, the latter replied that she had assured them that Imran was well but furious about the conditions he had been kept in. “And he put out — he dictated a tweet (post on social media platform X) I think through her, or maybe potentially through her. And I think that tweet has partly led to this reaction from the establishment to completely try and isolate him,” Suleiman said. When Hakim asked them what would be their message to the international community, Suleiman said, “At minimum, just to make sure that the standards of international human rights are being upheld, and right now they’re clearly being violated. “We just want to ensure that basic human rights for our father are being respected,” he said. He also highlighted the need for “independent monitoring” of Imran’s conditions “because we have no idea what it’s like until someone goes to see him and speaks to him”. For his part, Kasim stressed the need for implementing court orders for Imran’s visitation rights, respecting the rule of law and allowing the PTI founder to see his personal physician. Hakim also asked the brothers about what Imran’s opinion would be on recent constitutional amendments in Pakistan, especially the immunity given to the army chief under the tweaks. To that, Kasim said he believed Imran would not be surprised. “Because I think it’s quite clear that it was heading towards basically what it is now, which is a military dictatorship in everything but name. I think he probably knows about this already. And part of the reason he’s being silenced, isolated is because they know that he’s inevitably not going to stand for this,” he added. ‘Afraid of his popularity’ The duo also shared that they were looking to do more advocacy and visit Brussels or Geneva in January to speak to politicians and officials about Imran’s situation. Hakim then asked them whether they ever thought that one day they would be lobbying for their father’s release. “Yes, probably, realistically, because we spent, he especially, my brother spent a lot of time asking him not to go into politics when there were kind of these dangerous characters killing people consistently,” Kasim replied. Adding that several other Pakistani politicians had also been imprisoned, Kasim said: “This is just completely different. They’re not all tortured in solitary confinement cells and staying there for upwards of two years.” Without naming anyone, Hakim then asked them, “What do you think they’re afraid of?” “Popularity,” the two replied in unison. “He’s the most popular person in the country by a landslide. So the moment he’s out, there’s no chance they’ll hold on to power. So they’re desperately clinging on to it however they can,” Kasim said. ‘Doesn’t sound like solitary confinement’ Meanwhile, Mosharraf Zaidi, who is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s spokesperson for foreign media, also appeared on Hakim’s show and said that Imran had been incarcerated for around 860 days. “How many unique visits — interviews is what we call them in our system — do you think he’s had in those 860 days? … He’s supposed to get, as you said, one every week, and it’s been about 112 weeks. He’s had 870,” he said. He further said that Imran had held 137 meetings with his sisters, 45 with Aleema, 45 with Uzma and 43 with Noreen, noting that Aleema had held two more meetings since the numbers were tabulated. “This doesn’t sound like solitary confinement to me,” Zaidi said, adding that Imran had held 451 interviews with his lawyers. He insisted that Imran’s personal physician was allowed to see him. “There was a gap of about three and a half weeks in which the meetings were suspended. Now, those meetings were suspended because in every instance, there was a huge security issue that was being created. Every interaction that the former prime minister has had with his lawyers, with his family, becomes a political meeting,” Zaidi said. When Hakim pointed out that his sons had not spoken to him for five months, Zaidi said, “His last phone call was in September. I’m not sure whether one of the boys was on it or not.” He further said that neither he nor anyone in the government wanted to “get into an argument with two young men who have not seen their father in a long time but against whom there is no sanction to not see or not speak to their father”. At this point, Hakim pointed out that Zaidi had not answered any of her questions, to which he said he could not respond if she did not let him. “Your questions are coming from a place of genuinely seeking the truth and seeking justice … I think that these are honest people who are dealing with bad information. And so what I’m trying to do is provide you information but you don’t let me get all of it out,” he said. He also read out rule 265 of the Prison Rules, which states, “The discussion of political matters shall not be allowed at these interviews.” He said that since Imran had been jailed, there had been 575 posts from his X account. At this point, Hakim pulled up an old X post by Zaidi from 2023 when Imran had been arrested, in which he had called the move “disgraceful”. She also read out a similar post from 2024. She then asked whether he stood by his posts. “At the time, I [posted] them, absolutely,” he said, adding that more developments had taken place since then. He pointed to the May conflict with India, the 2024 attacks by Iran and constant attacks emanating from Afghanistan, saying that the way Pakistan had to respond to security and governance challenges had changed. “Are you saying Imran Khan is a threat?” Hakim asked, to which Zaidi replied, “Absolutely.” At one point, Hakim pointed to the report by the UN special rapporteur, asking Zaidi whether he thought she was lying. “I don’t think anybody is lying. I think people are consuming bad information,” he said, then pointing out that Hakim had not visited Pakistan in a decade. “If you give me a visa, I would happily [visit]. Would you give me an interview with Imran Khan?” she asked. Zaidi responded by saying she could interview Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “I’m not sure that, given the prison rules that I just cited, we’ll be allowed to afford Sky News the chance to break Pakistan’s laws,” he said. “I think people want rule of law, but they want it very specifically in circumstances that allow Imran Khan to enjoy total freedom at a time of incarceration. The whole purpose of being a convicted criminal is that you’re in jail and you lose your freedom,” he said. He further said that concerns raised by the UN had come from those who “had not visited Pakistan”.",

Zaidi responded by saying she could interview Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “I’m not sure that, given the prison rules that I just cited, we’ll be allowed to afford Sky News the chance to break Pakistan’s laws,” he said. “I think people want rule of law, but they want it very specifically in circumstances that allow Imran Khan to enjoy total freedom at a time of incarceration. The whole purpose of being a convicted criminal is that you’re in jail and you lose your freedom,” he said. He further said that concerns raised by the UN had come from those who “had not visited Pakistan”.",

      "title_orig": "Is international law truly ‘law’?",
      "summary_orig": "In recent years, the legitimacy of international law as a licit system has become a matter of profound scholarly interrogation and diplomatic preoccupation. This inquiry transcends the merely semantic or pedantic; instead, it excavates the very architecture of global order, shaping how nations comport themselves, how disputes are adjudicated, and how justice, stability, and predictability may be sustained across an ever-interdependent planet. This is underscored by contemporary crises such as the genocide in Gaza and the Indus Water Treaty , both cases illustrating how international law functions as a stabilising framework and normative guidance even in contexts characterised by stark power asymmetries and conflict. The fact is rather straightforward: international law is not contingent upon flawless compliance, but rather emerges from the interplay of institutional coherence, collective recognition, and structured mechanisms of accountability. Law or wistful aspiration? Critics, particularly those beholden to English legal theorist John Austin’s Command Theory of Law , argue that international law cannot properly be considered law. Their charge is beguilingly simple: states flout their obligations with disconcerting regularity, and enforcement mechanisms appear weak, inconsistent, or entirely spectral. In Austin’s schema, law is nothing more than a sovereign’s command buttressed by tangible sanctions. Remove coercive force, and law dissolves into wistful aspiration. Viewed through this tapered prism, international law becomes a mere compendium of norms, perennially hostage to the oscillations of national self-interest, geopolitical realpolitik, and the caprices of power. Such critiques, though intellectually stimulating, crumble under more rigorous scrutiny. Two rebuttals prove decisive. First, the illusion of perfect compliance is a profoundly flawed metric for assessing legal validity because even the most sophisticated domestic legal systems are replete with breaches, infractions, and unresolved disputes that do not, for a moment, impugn the legitimacy of the law itself. If obedience were the lodestar of legal existence, few, if any, legal orders would endure. Second, Austinian critics import criteria appropriate to hierarchical, coercive domestic structures into the unique, horizontal, and consensual realm of international relations. International law operates among sovereign equals who recognise no global Leviathan. To judge it by domestic parameters is to commit a categorical error. The legitimacy of any legal system inheres not in immaculate obedience but in the presence of an internally coherent constellation of norms, institutions, and authoritative procedures. British legal professional and philosopher H. L. A. Hart, in his seminal work The Concept of Law , provides the most illuminating framework for apprehending this legitimacy. He repudiated the reduction of law to crude coercion and conceived law as an intricate tapestry woven from primary and secondary rules. Primary rules impose duties and confer powers, guiding conduct and maintaining social order. They exhibit three characteristics: engender an insistent demand for conformity, be indispensable to the maintenance of societal life, and require individuals or states to subordinate parochial preferences to collective imperatives. Secondary rules imbue a legal system with coherence, adaptability, and authority. The Rule of Recognition furnishes the criteria of legal validity. The Rule of Change offers mechanisms for amendment and evolution. The Rule of Adjudication provides authoritative procedures for dispute resolution. Together, these rules comprise a functioning legal order founded not upon brute force but upon structural sophistication and institutional legitimacy. Absent these secondary rules, law is a formless nebula, incapable of guiding conduct or resolving disputes. ‘Systematic ordering of social life’ Through this Hartian lens, international law unmistakably presents the hallmarks of a mature legal system. Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice functions as an international rule of recognition, identifying treaties, customary norms, general principles, and subsidiary jurisprudence as authoritative sources. Treaty-making procedures, customary formation, and UN Security Council deliberations operate as rules of change, facilitating the perpetual evolution of international norms. The International Court of Justice, regional courts, and arbitral bodies furnish reliable mechanisms of adjudication. These institutions exercise authority not through coercive diktat but through the persuasive force of reason, legitimacy, and collective expectation. Primary sources of international law readily satisfy Hart’s criteria of obligation. Consider the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , which codifies a finely calibrated system of privileges, immunities, and behavioural standards for diplomats, reinforced not by coercion but by reciprocity. No state wishes to endanger the safety of its own emissaries abroad. Thus, compliance flows from enlightened self-interest and the recognition that diplomatic intercourse is the lifeblood of international comity. Crucially, these obligations often compel states to restrain short-term impulses. The immunity provisions in Article 31 oblige states to place the dignity of a legal order above the allure of expedient retribution. Customary international law provides further illustration. Norms such as the prohibition of torture, elevated to jus cogens — a body of peremptory norms in international law from which no derogation is permitted — bind all states. In Prosecutor v. Furundžija , the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia affirmed this status. Such norms generate moral suasion, institutional authority, and global opprobrium against breaches. They embody a universal conscience that no state can legitimately contravene. General principles recognised by civilised nations serve as stabilising forces when treaties fall silent or custom proves ambiguous. Principles such as estoppel, equity, and good faith preserve coherence, integrity, and reason. The Argentina-Chile Frontier Arbitration vividly demonstrates estoppel’s ability to anchor states to their prior undertakings, forestalling chaotic inconsistency. Judicial decisions and scholarly interpretations, though subsidiary under Article 59, wield immense interpretative influence. They refine the law’s contours, crystallise its principles, and guide state behaviour. Their authority is derived not from coercion but from erudition, logic, and the institutional legitimacy of international courts and tribunals. When apprehended holistically, international law emerges as a sophisticated union of primary and secondary rules. Austinian critiques, fixated on coercion, overlook this deeper structural and normative architecture. Hart teaches that the essence of law resides not in the immediacy of its sanctions but in the systematic ordering of social life, the predictability it engenders, and the institutional mechanisms it employs to resolve disputes. Procedural and moral anchor Case in point: the Indus Waters Treaty. Operational for over six decades, it demonstrates the endurance of legal norms despite intermittent political turbulence. India’s unilateral suspension of the treaty in April 2025 challenged the immediate authority of the legal order but did not annul its binding force . From a Hartian perspective, the treaty’s legitimacy derives not from immediate obedience but from the robustness of its primary and secondary rules: the institutional architecture underpinning dispute resolution, the sustained collective recognition by the parties, and the adjudicative mechanisms, including recourse to the Permanent Court of Arbitration . These structural features ensure that the treaty continues to exert normative influence, compelling compliance through reasoned expectation and procedural authority rather than through coercion. Similarly, the catastrophe in Gaza illustrates the resilience of international law under extreme conditions.* Peremptory norms: prohibiting genocide, torture, and crimes against humanity operate as primary rules, binding states. The legitimacy of these norms is reinforced by secondary rules embodied in tribunals, fact-finding commissions, and the International Court of Justice, which provide structured avenues for recognition, adjudication, and accountability. Even where direct enforcement is limited, these mechanisms sustain the authority of the legal order, asserting claims to justice and normative compliance. In November last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the first leader of a “western-style” democracy to have an arrest warrant issued in his name by the International Criminal Court. The three-judge panel said it had found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu “bears criminal responsibility for … the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts”. Bibi, of course, was not arrested because Israel is not a member of the ICC. However, the order did, in theory, limit his movement, as any of the court’s 124 national members could arrest him on their territory. This explains why the Israeli premier chose to skip an event marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, or why his plane avoided the French airspace on the way to the 80th United Nations General Assembly session in September. But more than that, what the warrant did was establish that there was someone out there seeing, noting and keeping a record of the grave crimes Netanyahu’s government committed. And that there was someone who would try, at least, to hold him accountable for it, even if on paper. In both instances — the Indus Water Treaty and Israeli assault on Gaza — international law serves as a procedural and moral anchor, maintaining authority through institutional integrity, collective commitment, and the internal logic of the legal system, rather than relying solely on coercive power. The enduring challenge lies in the continuous engagement of states; the effectiveness and legitimacy of international law remain contingent on their sustained recognition, highlighting that its authority is fundamentally procedural, consensual, and structurally grounded rather than purely coercive. This understanding gives rise to urgent and arresting questions. If law is something more than the shadow of force, what then is the true source of legitimate authority in an otherwise anarchic world? If justice aspires beyond coercion, can a global community genuinely exist without recognising the binding nature of shared norms? And if states willingly partake in the benefits of legal order, can they, with any honesty, disclaim the obligations that sustain it? These questions, echoing through the long arc of international jurisprudence, challenge states to acknowledge that legitimacy does not originate from compulsion alone but from procedural integrity, collective consent, and a shared commitment to the governance of reason. To deny this legitimacy is to imperil justice itself, to unravel the threads of accountability, and to erode the fragile architecture upon which the international system rests. To affirm it is to accept that humanity, despite its frailties, is capable of rising above the tyranny of unrestrained power through the ennobling discipline of law. The choice between law and might The question has never been whether international law is flawless. Perfection is an illusion to which no human institution can credibly aspire. The real question is whether we are prepared to embrace international law as indispensable: the essential foundation of global justice, shared responsibility, and a world in which reasoned norms constrain unfettered force. Even with all its imperfections, the international legal order we possess today offers something infinitely more valuable than the void. It provides a platform on which accountability can be demanded, a vocabulary through which injustice can be named, and a structure through which the powerful can, at least in principle, be held to account. In moments of profound crisis, such a framework becomes not an academic abstraction but a lifeline. Without it, we would stand before atrocity with empty hands and no legal ground on which to challenge those who perpetrate grave violations. With it, imperfect though it may be, humanity retains a foothold: a means to contest impunity, to invoke norms against barbarity, and to insist that even in the darkest hours there exists a higher standard to which the world must answer. The choice is stark yet simple. We can reject the system for its inadequacies and be left with nothing, or we can uphold it as the best and indeed the only civilisational instrument we possess to express our collective yearning for order, dignity, and justice. The future of global society depends on recognising that in the contest between law and might, it is only through the persistent affirmation of law’s legitimacy that humanity can hope to transcend the brutal logic of force.

      "summary_en": "In recent years, the legitimacy of international law as a licit system has become a matter of profound scholarly interrogation and diplomatic preoccupation. This inquiry transcends the merely semantic or pedantic; instead, it excavates the very architecture of global order, shaping how nations comport themselves, how disputes are adjudicated, and how justice, stability, and predictability may be sustained across an ever-interdependent planet. This is underscored by contemporary crises such as the genocide in Gaza and the Indus Water Treaty , both cases illustrating how international law functions as a stabilising framework and normative guidance even in contexts characterised by stark power asymmetries and conflict. The fact is rather straightforward: international law is not contingent upon flawless compliance, but rather emerges from the interplay of institutional coherence, collective recognition, and structured mechanisms of accountability. Law or wistful aspiration? Critics, particularly those beholden to English legal theorist John Austin’s Command Theory of Law , argue that international law cannot properly be considered law. Their charge is beguilingly simple: states flout their obligations with disconcerting regularity, and enforcement mechanisms appear weak, inconsistent, or entirely spectral. In Austin’s schema, law is nothing more than a sovereign’s command buttressed by tangible sanctions. Remove coercive force, and law dissolves into wistful aspiration. Viewed through this tapered prism, international law becomes a mere compendium of norms, perennially hostage to the oscillations of national self-interest, geopolitical realpolitik, and the caprices of power. Such critiques, though intellectually stimulating, crumble under more rigorous scrutiny. Two rebuttals prove decisive. First, the illusion of perfect compliance is a profoundly flawed metric for assessing legal validity because even the most sophisticated domestic legal systems are replete with breaches, infractions, and unresolved disputes that do not, for a moment, impugn the legitimacy of the law itself. If obedience were the lodestar of legal existence, few, if any, legal orders would endure. Second, Austinian critics import criteria appropriate to hierarchical, coercive domestic structures into the unique, horizontal, and consensual realm of international relations. International law operates among sovereign equals who recognise no global Leviathan. To judge it by domestic parameters is to commit a categorical error. The legitimacy of any legal system inheres not in immaculate obedience but in the presence of an internally coherent constellation of norms, institutions, and authoritative procedures. British legal professional and philosopher H. L. A. Hart, in his seminal work The Concept of Law , provides the most illuminating framework for apprehending this legitimacy. He repudiated the reduction of law to crude coercion and conceived law as an intricate tapestry woven from primary and secondary rules. Primary rules impose duties and confer powers, guiding conduct and maintaining social order. They exhibit three characteristics: engender an insistent demand for conformity, be indispensable to the maintenance of societal life, and require individuals or states to subordinate parochial preferences to collective imperatives. Secondary rules imbue a legal system with coherence, adaptability, and authority. The Rule of Recognition furnishes the criteria of legal validity. The Rule of Change offers mechanisms for amendment and evolution. The Rule of Adjudication provides authoritative procedures for dispute resolution. Together, these rules comprise a functioning legal order founded not upon brute force but upon structural sophistication and institutional legitimacy. Absent these secondary rules, law is a formless nebula, incapable of guiding conduct or resolving disputes. ‘Systematic ordering of social life’ Through this Hartian lens, international law unmistakably presents the hallmarks of a mature legal system. Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice functions as an international rule of recognition, identifying treaties, customary norms, general principles, and subsidiary jurisprudence as authoritative sources. Treaty-making procedures, customary formation, and UN Security Council deliberations operate as rules of change, facilitating the perpetual evolution of international norms. The International Court of Justice, regional courts, and arbitral bodies furnish reliable mechanisms of adjudication. These institutions exercise authority not through coercive diktat but through the persuasive force of reason, legitimacy, and collective expectation. Primary sources of international law readily satisfy Hart’s criteria of obligation. Consider the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , which codifies a finely calibrated system of privileges, immunities, and behavioural standards for diplomats, reinforced not by coercion but by reciprocity. No state wishes to endanger the safety of its own emissaries abroad. Thus, compliance flows from enlightened self-interest and the recognition that diplomatic intercourse is the lifeblood of international comity. Crucially, these obligations often compel states to restrain short-term impulses. The immunity provisions in Article 31 oblige states to place the dignity of a legal order above the allure of expedient retribution. Customary international law provides further illustration. Norms such as the prohibition of torture, elevated to jus cogens — a body of peremptory norms in international law from which no derogation is permitted — bind all states. In Prosecutor v. Furundžija , the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia affirmed this status. Such norms generate moral suasion, institutional authority, and global opprobrium against breaches. They embody a universal conscience that no state can legitimately contravene. General principles recognised by civilised nations serve as stabilising forces when treaties fall silent or custom proves ambiguous. Principles such as estoppel, equity, and good faith preserve coherence, integrity, and reason. The Argentina-Chile Frontier Arbitration vividly demonstrates estoppel’s ability to anchor states to their prior undertakings, forestalling chaotic inconsistency. Judicial decisions and scholarly interpretations, though subsidiary under Article 59, wield immense interpretative influence. They refine the law’s contours, crystallise its principles, and guide state behaviour. Their authority is derived not from coercion but from erudition, logic, and the institutional legitimacy of international courts and tribunals. When apprehended holistically, international law emerges as a sophisticated union of primary and secondary rules. Austinian critiques, fixated on coercion, overlook this deeper structural and normative architecture. Hart teaches that the essence of law resides not in the immediacy of its sanctions but in the systematic ordering of social life, the predictability it engenders, and the institutional mechanisms it employs to resolve disputes. Procedural and moral anchor Case in point: the Indus Waters Treaty. Operational for over six decades, it demonstrates the endurance of legal norms despite intermittent political turbulence. India’s unilateral suspension of the treaty in April 2025 challenged the immediate authority of the legal order but did not annul its binding force . From a Hartian perspective, the treaty’s legitimacy derives not from immediate obedience but from the robustness of its primary and secondary rules: the institutional architecture underpinning dispute resolution, the sustained collective recognition by the parties, and the adjudicative mechanisms, including recourse to the Permanent Court of Arbitration . These structural features ensure that the treaty continues to exert normative influence, compelling compliance through reasoned expectation and procedural authority rather than through coercion. Similarly, the catastrophe in Gaza illustrates the resilience of international law under extreme conditions.* Peremptory norms: prohibiting genocide, torture, and crimes against humanity operate as primary rules, binding states. The legitimacy of these norms is reinforced by secondary rules embodied in tribunals, fact-finding commissions, and the International Court of Justice, which provide structured avenues for recognition, adjudication, and accountability. Even where direct enforcement is limited, these mechanisms sustain the authority of the legal order, asserting claims to justice and normative compliance. In November last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the first leader of a “western-style” democracy to have an arrest warrant issued in his name by the International Criminal Court. The three-judge panel said it had found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu “bears criminal responsibility for … the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts”. Bibi, of course, was not arrested because Israel is not a member of the ICC. However, the order did, in theory, limit his movement, as any of the court’s 124 national members could arrest him on their territory. This explains why the Israeli premier chose to skip an event marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, or why his plane avoided the French airspace on the way to the 80th United Nations General Assembly session in September. But more than that, what the warrant did was establish that there was someone out there seeing, noting and keeping a record of the grave crimes Netanyahu’s government committed. And that there was someone who would try, at least, to hold him accountable for it, even if on paper. In both instances — the Indus Water Treaty and Israeli assault on Gaza — international law serves as a procedural and moral anchor, maintaining authority through institutional integrity, collective commitment, and the internal logic of the legal system, rather than relying solely on coercive power. The enduring challenge lies in the continuous engagement of states; the effectiveness and legitimacy of international law remain contingent on their sustained recognition, highlighting that its authority is fundamentally procedural, consensual, and structurally grounded rather than purely coercive. This understanding gives rise to urgent and arresting questions. If law is something more than the shadow of force, what then is the true source of legitimate authority in an otherwise anarchic world? If justice aspires beyond coercion, can a global community genuinely exist without recognising the binding nature of shared norms? And if states willingly partake in the benefits of legal order, can they, with any honesty, disclaim the obligations that sustain it? These questions, echoing through the long arc of international jurisprudence, challenge states to acknowledge that legitimacy does not originate from compulsion alone but from procedural integrity, collective consent, and a shared commitment to the governance of reason. To deny this legitimacy is to imperil justice itself, to unravel the threads of accountability, and to erode the fragile architecture upon which the international system rests.

      "summary_orig": "RECENTLY, Afghanistan’s neighbours held con­­sultations in the Iranian capital on security and its impact on regional stability, under the Teh­ran Format. Special representatives on Afghanis­tan from Pakistan, China, Russia, Tajikistan, Uz­­b­ekis­tan, and Turkmenistan participated in the me­­eting. But the Afghan Taliban declined to attend. The Tehran Format is not the only regional process which has been initiated for regional consensus building on Afghanistan’s security situation. Since 2014, 10 multilateral platforms have been introduced on various occasions by several regional and extra-regional countries to facilitate coordination and avoid regional and international confrontation on Afghanistan’s security affairs. The most notable among them is the Moscow Format, and keeping in view the Russia-Iran strategic partnership, the Tehran Format is an extended version of the Moscow process. Pakistan has been an active member of almost all of these regional processes including the two aforementioned, the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan, the Istanbul Process, the Extended ‘Troika’, etc. For Islamabad, participation in these regional forums has become a central pillar of its Afghan strategy. Pakistan’s decision to participate in regional dialogue forums on Afghanistan, particularly in the Tehran Format, is primarily based on three strategic objectives. First, Islamabad considers itself the most important stakeholder in Afghanistan’s security and strategic affairs due to the depth, duration, and intensity of its exposure to Afghan instability. Apart from sharing a longest porous border with Afghanistan and hosting millions of Afghan refugees for decades, Pakistan has suffered the most in terms of cross-border infiltration and terror incidents emanating from Afghan soil. Therefore, Islamabad seeks to remain actively engaged in any regional engagement on Afghanistan. Second, Islamabad uses these regional forums for its global awareness campaign and diplomatic signalling as well as for highlighting its security concerns. This was also evident at the Tehran For­mat, where Islamabad highlighted how cross-border infiltration and the presence of terrorist gro­ups such as the TTP and BLA on Afghan soil have been creating a security challenge for Pakistan. Primarily, Islamabad wants to prevent its security challenges from being viewed in isolation or being dismissed as unilateral claims. In fact, Islamabad seeks regional and global legitimation of its threat perceptions related to Afghanistan. Despite human rights violations at home, the Taliban have managed to establish a diplomatic presence in 39 capitals. Third, Islamabad desires to ‘strategically contain’ the Afghan Taliban in an effort to maximise pressure on the regime for favourable results. For the past two years, the Afghan Taliban have significantly increased their outreach to regional and extra-regional states. Despite well-documented human rights violations, systemic ill treatment of women, and the continued ban on girls’ education, the Taliban regime has succeeded in establishing a diplomatic presence in 39 capitals worldwide. While Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the regime, China, the UAE, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and India have accepted the Taliban’s ambassadors in their capitals. Islamabad believes that regional outreach has not helped in tearing down the Afghan Taliban’s ties with various terrorist groups. Rather, the measured engagement and sustained humanitarian assistance given by the regional and international community have emboldened the regime to continue its support for its ideological partners. Islamabad wants to form a consensus among Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries to devise a tough strategy, i.e., joint coordinated actions against terrorist safe havens. However, the Tehran Format failed to forge a joint action plan, as evident in its inability to issue a joint communiqué. This was mainly due to several structural challenges that continue to hinder a cohesive regional approach. First, regional countries are welcoming Tehran Format-style regional forums, but practically, they are comfortable with engaging the Taliban regime bilaterally to secure their strategic objectives. Al­­though Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours ag­­r­ee that they stand to gain from its stability and lose from its instability, they remain divided on a collective approach to leverage their individual influence for broader regional peace and stability. Second, the member countries of the Tehran Format can be broadly divided into two camps based on their approaches towards compelling the Taliban to prevent the misuse of Afghan soil. The first camp believes that limited and pragmatic engagement can preserve leverage, facilitate intelligence access, and reduce unmanaged security spillovers. The second camp holds that normalisation without demonstrable compliance erodes leverage and risks legitimising Taliban rule in the absence of meaningful and verifiable concessions. These varied approaches significantly impede the formation of a unified approach, as disputes about engagement versus coercion make achieving an agreement more difficult. Third, these regional forums, including the Teh­ran Format, are generally consultative and lack bi­nding legal or institutional mechanisms to en­­force decisions. Even when consensus is reached on counterterrorism expectations, there are no cre­­­­­dible tools to compel compliance by Afgha­nis­tan’s de facto authorities. This has happened when consensus on counterterrorism and the non-use of Afghan territory as a launching pad for attacks was reached among regional states at various multilateral forums, but the Afghan regime either refused to participate, disengaged, or selectively ignored commitments. The Taliban regime seems comfortable building bilateral engagements with regional and extra-regional countries, while it avoids commitments at multilateral forums. Despite these obstacles, Islamabad is determined to continue advancing its security concerns and influencing regional discourse through forums like the Tehran Format. In this context, Pakistan needs to advocate for more regular and organised Tehran-style meetings by using its strong ties with Iran. The Tehran Format has the potential to become a venue that produces tangible outcomes, such as coordinated actions against terrorist safe havens and improved monitoring of terrorist movement inside Afghanistan. In order to establish a more coordinated regional strategy, Pakistan should simultaneously advocate for the revival of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group and connect its efforts with the Tehran Format. Islamabad must understand that building regional consensus may be a lengthy process, but it is far more effective and sustainable than relying on quick fixes.

Islamabad believes that regional outreach has not helped in tearing down the Afghan Taliban’s ties with various terrorist groups. Rather, the measured engagement and sustained humanitarian assistance given by the regional and international community have emboldened the regime to continue its support for its ideological partners. Islamabad wants to form a consensus among Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries to devise a tough strategy, i.e., joint coordinated actions against terrorist safe havens. However, the Tehran Format failed to forge a joint action plan, as evident in its inability to issue a joint communiqué. This was mainly due to several structural challenges that continue to hinder a cohesive regional approach. First, regional countries are welcoming Tehran Format-style regional forums, but practically, they are comfortable with engaging the Taliban regime bilaterally to secure their strategic objectives. Al­­though Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours ag­­r­ee that they stand to gain from its stability and lose from its instability, they remain divided on a collective approach to leverage their individual influence for broader regional peace and stability. Second, the member countries of the Tehran Format can be broadly divided into two camps based on their approaches towards compelling the Taliban to prevent the misuse of Afghan soil. The first camp believes that limited and pragmatic engagement can preserve leverage, facilitate intelligence access, and reduce unmanaged security spillovers. The second camp holds that normalisation without demonstrable compliance erodes leverage and risks legitimising Taliban rule in the absence of meaningful and verifiable concessions. These varied approaches significantly impede the formation of a unified approach, as disputes about engagement versus coercion make achieving an agreement more difficult. Third, these regional forums, including the Teh­ran Format, are generally consultative and lack bi­nding legal or institutional mechanisms to en­­force decisions. Even when consensus is reached on counterterrorism expectations, there are no cre­­­­­dible tools to compel compliance by Afgha­nis­tan’s de facto authorities. This has happened when consensus on counterterrorism and the non-use of Afghan territory as a launching pad for attacks was reached among regional states at various multilateral forums, but the Afghan regime either refused to participate, disengaged, or selectively ignored commitments. The Taliban regime seems comfortable building bilateral engagements with regional and extra-regional countries, while it avoids commitments at multilateral forums. Despite these obstacles, Islamabad is determined to continue advancing its security concerns and influencing regional discourse through forums like the Tehran Format. In this context, Pakistan needs to advocate for more regular and organised Tehran-style meetings by using its strong ties with Iran. The Tehran Format has the potential to become a venue that produces tangible outcomes, such as coordinated actions against terrorist safe havens and improved monitoring of terrorist movement inside Afghanistan. In order to establish a more coordinated regional strategy, Pakistan should simultaneously advocate for the revival of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group and connect its efforts with the Tehran Format. Islamabad must understand that building regional consensus may be a lengthy process, but it is far more effective and sustainable than relying on quick fixes.

      "title": "Afghanistan & regional paradox",
      "summary": "RECENTLY, Afghanistan’s neighbours held con­­sultations in the Iranian capital on security and its impact on regional stability, under the Teh­ran Format. Special representatives on Afghanis­tan from Pakistan, China, Russia, Tajikistan, Uz­­b­ekis­tan, and Turkmenistan participated in the me­­eting. But the Afghan Taliban declined to attend. The Tehran Format is not the only regional process which has been initiated for regional consensus building on Afghanistan’s security situation. Since 2014, 10 multilateral platforms have been introduced on various occasions by several regional and extra-regional countries to facilitate coordination and avoid regional and international confrontation on Afghanistan’s security affairs. The most notable among them is the Moscow Format, and keeping in view the Russia-Iran strategic partnership, the Tehran Format is an extended version of the Moscow process. Pakistan has been an active member of almost all of these regional processes including the two aforementioned, the SCO Contact Group on Afghanistan, the Istanbul Process, the Extended ‘Troika’, etc. For Islamabad, participation in these regional forums has become a central pillar of its Afghan strategy. Pakistan’s decision to participate in regional dialogue forums on Afghanistan, particularly in the Tehran Format, is primarily based on three strategic objectives. First, Islamabad considers itself the most important stakeholder in Afghanistan’s security and strategic affairs due to the depth, duration, and intensity of its exposure to Afghan instability. Apart from sharing a longest porous border with Afghanistan and hosting millions of Afghan refugees for decades, Pakistan has suffered the most in terms of cross-border infiltration and terror incidents emanating from Afghan soil. Therefore, Islamabad seeks to remain actively engaged in any regional engagement on Afghanistan. Second, Islamabad uses these regional forums for its global awareness campaign and diplomatic signalling as well as for highlighting its security concerns. This was also evident at the Tehran For­mat, where Islamabad highlighted how cross-border infiltration and the presence of terrorist gro­ups such as the TTP and BLA on Afghan soil have been creating a security challenge for Pakistan. Primarily, Islamabad wants to prevent its security challenges from being viewed in isolation or being dismissed as unilateral claims. In fact, Islamabad seeks regional and global legitimation of its threat perceptions related to Afghanistan. Despite human rights violations at home, the Taliban have managed to establish a diplomatic presence in 39 capitals. Third, Islamabad desires to ‘strategically contain’ the Afghan Taliban in an effort to maximise pressure on the regime for favourable results. For the past two years, the Afghan Taliban have significantly increased their outreach to regional and extra-regional states. Despite well-documented human rights violations, systemic ill treatment of women, and the continued ban on girls’ education, the Taliban regime has succeeded in establishing a diplomatic presence in 39 capitals worldwide. While Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the regime, China, the UAE, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and India have accepted the Taliban’s ambassadors in their capitals.

      "title_orig": "Trump adds 7 countries, including Syria, to full travel ban list",
      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday expanded a list of countries subject to a full travel ban, prohibiting citizens from an additional seven countries, including Syria, from entering the country. The White House said in a statement that Trump signed a proclamation “expanding and strengthening entry restrictions on nationals from countries with demonstrated, persistent, and severe deficiencies in screening, vetting, and information-sharing to protect the Nation from national security and public safety threats”. Tuesday’s move banned citizens from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, Syria and those holding Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents. The action also imposes a full ban on Laos and Sierra Leone, which had previously only been subject to partial restrictions. The White House said the expanded ban goes into effect on January 1. The action comes despite Trump’s vow to do everything he could to make Syria successful after landmark talks in November with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who until recently was sanctioned by Washington as a foreign terrorist. Trump has backed Sharaa, whose visit capped a stunning year for the rebel-turned-ruler who toppled longtime autocratic leader Bashar al-Assad and has since traveled the world trying to depict himself as a moderate leader who wants to unify his war-ravaged nation and end its decades of international isolation. But in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump vowed “very serious retaliation” after the US military said two US Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed in Syria by a suspected Islamic State attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead. He described the incident in remarks to reporters as a “terrible” attack. The White House cited visa overstay rates for Syria in its justification for the ban. “Syria is emerging from a protracted period of civil unrest and internal strife. While the country is working to address its security challenges in close coordination with the United States, Syria still lacks an adequate central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures,” the White House said. US adds more nations to partial restrictions list Trump signed a proclamation in June banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats. The bans apply to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travelers. The travel ban remains on those twelve countries, the White House said. Trump also added partial restrictions and entry limitations on an additional 15 countries, including Nigeria, which is under scrutiny from Trump, who in early November threatened military action over the treatment of Christians in the country. Nigeria says claims that Christians face persecution misrepresent a complex security situation and do not take into account efforts to safeguard religious freedom. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. The expansion of the countries subject to entry restrictions marks a further escalation of immigration measures the administration has taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last month. Investigators say the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define the term.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: White House chief of staff Susie Wiles revealed internal tensions in the Trump administration over issues from immigration enforcement to government downsizing in comments published by Vanity Fair on Tuesday that paint an unflattering picture of the role played by some of President Donald Trump’s close aides. In a series of 11 interviews with author Chris Whipple conducted over Trump’s first year back in office, Wiles, the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff, described the teetotaling president as having “an alcoholic’s personality” and an eye for vengeance against perceived enemies. She also said Vice President J D Vance has “been a conspiracy theorist for a decade” and described his shift from Trump critic to supporter as “sort of political”, motivated by his Senate campaign rather than principle. In a post on X, Wiles called the Vanity Fair story “a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest president, White House staff, and cabinet in history”, saying it omitted important context and selectively quoted her to create a negative narrative. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also responded on X, saying Wiles is a loyal and trusted adviser to Trump, and the administration fully supports her. Vance defended Wiles, telling reporters in Pennsylvania that he admires her consistency and authenticity both in and out of the president’s presence. “I’ve never seen her be disloyal to the president of the United States and that makes her the best White House chief of staff the president could ask for,” he said. According to Susie Wiles, the magazine omitted context and quoted her selectively to create a ‘negative narrative’ In the interviews, Susie Wiles took aim at the way billionaire Elon Musk dismantled the US Agency for International Development and how Attorney General Pam Bondi initially responded to the planned release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Wiles said she warned Trump against pardoning the most violent participants in the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and pressed him to delay his decision on sweeping trade tariffs, but was unable to change his mind in either case. She said the administration should have applied greater scrutiny to the deportation of immigrants in the country illegally to avoid errors. “He has an alcoholic’s personality,” Wiles said of Trump, explaining that her upbringing with an alcoholic father prepared her for managing “big personalities”. Trump does not drink, she noted, but operates with “a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing”. In the interviews, Wiles said Bondi “completely whiffed” her early handling of the Epstein files, an issue that upset Trump’s right-wing base. Bondi had initially suggested she was going to release incriminating information about Epstein’s alleged network of acquaintances but then backed off. Bondi said on X that Wiles works tirelessly to advance Trump’s agenda with loyalty, adding that any effort to sow division within the administration would not succeed and that the team remains united. Susie Wiles said in the interviews that she had read the Epstein documents and acknowledged that Trump’s name is in them, but that “he’s not in the file doing anything awful”. Trump’s push to have New York Attorney General Letitia James prosecuted on allegations of mortgage fraud was perhaps motivated by feelings of vengeance against the Democratic official, Wiles said. The case against James, a Trump critic, “was maybe the one retribution”, Wiles said. She added that while Trump may not wake up thinking about retribution, “when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it”. Published in Dawn, December 17th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "PARIS: Amnesty Inter­national on Tuesday called on countries to stop forcibly returning people to Afghanistan, saying they are being “unlawfully” deported by Pakistan and Iran as well as some European countries. So far this year around 2.5 million Afghans have returned to the country, the UN’s special representative Georgette Gagnon told a Security Council briefing in New York last week. That represents “a six per cent population increase, compounding the deep-rooted economic, climate and humanitarian crises the country already faces”, she said. Citing Afghanistan’s “deepening humanitarian crisis”, Amnesty said there is an increased “real risk of serious harm for returnees”. The organisation said that nations must comply with international law that “prohibits the forcible return of anyone to a place where they face a real risk of grave human rights violations”. Generations of Afghans have fled to Pakistan and Iran over decades of successive wars, meaning that many young people have never lived in the country. But Pakistan and Iran began forcing them to leave in recent years, with Islamabad alleging the population includes “terrorists and criminals”. Amnesty also cited media reports that “Germany, Austria, and the European Union are in negotiations with the de facto Taliban authorities to facilitate forced returns”. Many of the newcomers to Afghanistan are shunned and unable to find jobs, while women and girls face severe restrictions under the Taliban. “This rush to forcibly return people to Afghanistan ignores why they fled in the first place and the serious dangers they face if sent back,” said Smriti Singh, Amnesty’s South Asia director.

So far this year around 2.5 million Afghans have returned to the country, the UN’s special representative Georgette Gagnon told a Security Council briefing in New York last week.

      "summary_orig": "Water cannons were again used early on Wednesday to disperse PTI protesters staging a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, after his family was denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Imran’s sisters, party workers and supporters had staged a sit-in at Factory Naka, demanding their court-mandated meeting with the PTI founder. A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in , which was later dispersed with water cannons. Early on Wednesday, water cannons were again used to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2am. Initially, water cannon vehicles were used to disperse the protesters, with police later baton-charging those who remained. Some of the party workers were arrested but the number could not be confirmed. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir, who remained at the protest until late Tuesday night, condemned the inhuman treatment meted out to the protesters. Meanwhile, in a post on social media platform X at 4am on Wednesday, the party’s central information department said that it condemned “in the harshest possible terms” the disregard of the IHC order and the “extreme state brutality” witnessed outside Adiala jail. “These actions are not merely administrative failures; they constitute a direct assault on the Constitution, the rule of law, and the authority of the judiciary,” the party said, adding that the “willful defiance of judicial orders has effectively become official government policy”. “At the behest of the government, the Punjab police crossed all limits of oppression by launching an assault using chemical-laced water cannons against Imran Khan’s sisters, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, other party leaders, PTI workers, and peaceful sit-in participants,” the party said. “There was no emergency situation, no legal justification, and no provocation whatsoever. Despite this, women, elderly individuals, and peaceful protesters were subjected to chemical-infused water, physical violence, and the forcible arrest of multiple workers. This represents a textbook case of fascism, police brutality, and political victimisation at its worst,” it added. The PTI said that such actions “clearly reflect the panic, insecurity, and moral bankruptcy of a deeply frightened government”. It further said that such “oppression, repression, and fascism cannot last forever”. “History bears witness that no matter how powerful tyranny may appear, it ultimately meets its end. The day will surely come when those responsible for these unconstitutional, illegal, and inhumane actions will be held fully accountable,” it added. A video posted by the party on X showed a water cannon being used to disperse what appeared to be protesters as a large contingent of police stood on the side. Another video posted by a party showed what appeared to be a drenched protester, saying that his “chest was burning” and his eyes were also affected. In a separate video, Aleema, whose clothes were also drenched, looked at her hands and said, “They used a chemical, it is [burning] so much.” “Poisonous, chemical-laced water was used,” party lawyer Naeem Panjutha said on X. He said that the water cannon was unleashed on the protesters, including Imran’s sisters and others. “I myself fell; many workers fell; several were also arrested,” he said. During the sit-in, some of the demonstrators had scrawled pro-PTI messaging on the walls of petrol pumps and other structures near the protest site. Some of the messages included the number “804”, which is reportedly Imran’s prisoner number. Pro-PTI messaging is written on walls near Factory Naka in Rawalpindi on December 16. — Screengrab via author. ‘Have no other option left besides protesting’ On Tuesday, Imran’s sisters had marched toward the prison before being stopped. Speaking to a reporter as she marched, Aleema said, “We will sit wherever we are stopped”. When asked if she had prepared for the deployment of water cannons or a prolonged sit-in, she replied that she had brought warm clothes and a blanket, showing the latter on camera. Speaking to reporters, Aleema stated that this occurred every Tuesday at the same location, maintaining that the protesters were not engaging in any illegal or unconstitutional activities. “We have no other option left besides protesting,” she said. “Our founder’s demand is the restoration of the Constitution, democracy and the rule of law.” She claimed that the judiciary had been stripped of independence, unemployment was rising due to the stoppage of trade with Afghanistan and that the security situation was deteriorating. Referring to her sister Uzma’s brief meeting with Imran on December 2 and the government’s claim of “political conversations” that violated jail rules, Aleema urged the government to inform the family what was discussed. “Tell me what political matters my sister discussed in the last meeting. Political topics should be discussed with the people of the party,” she said. Asked about a recent AI (artificial intelligence)-generated image of Imran in prison, which went viral, Aleema acknowledged she was not aware of artificial intelligence, but maintained that he looked the same as the person in the photograph as recently as October. “Until two months ago, when we used to go visit the jail, the founder used to look exactly like this,” she said. “It may be AI, but it is the right AI. “I don’t know what the prison looks like from the inside, but I can say that Imran Khan looked like this on October 16, the last time we met,” Aleema added. She said that Imran told Uzma during their meeting that “the mental torture is far worse than the physical torture” and that he is being kept in solitary confinement. “They think he will break, but Imran Khan is a man with faith in God. He will not break,” Aleema emphasised. “Imran Khan has said he is ready to accept death, but he will not be subdued by cruelty and injustice.” She added that the government wants Imran to cut a deal with them, but insisted that he is not imprisoned for himself, but for the supremacy of the Constitution and rule of law. Naeem Haider Panjhuta, Imran’s spokesperson on legal affairs, filmed a video from the site of the sit-in, showing crowds of PTI workers staging the demonstration into this evening. “We are waiting for a meeting with Khan sahib . Today is the designated day for family and lawyers to meet him,” he said. “They are not letting us meet him, despite the IHC court order and visits being permitted in the jail manual.” PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who was also present at the sit-in, urged everyone to come and join the demonstration and express solidarity with the sisters of the party founder. “This is not only the job of the assembly members,” he said. “How can these people (the government) tell someone what they can and cannot discuss in a meeting?” However, the party’s secretary general gave a fiery response to a question, asking, “Do you think 20-30,000 people can overthrow a system that has been in place for the past 78 years? “We are calling out to the entire nation. We do not want to carry on this drama for another day, after which people will die,” Raja said. “We will make a conscious effort and will not submit to pressure.” He added that people’s consciences need to be shaken to ensure Imran’s release and said that the moment would come when hundreds of thousands of people would take to the streets. Meanwhile, Noreen Niazi told reporters that the PTI is a peaceful political party and claimed that they had been “injured” by the water cannons deployed last week. She added that they would “do whatever is necessary to free Imran Khan” and maintained that he was unlawfully imprisoned. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes. Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards. Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Amid negotiations between goods transporters and government departments to resolve a nationwide strike that has entered its 10th day, industrialists warned on Tuesday that each passing day was adding billions of rupees in trade and export losses . Transporters said talks were underway with representatives of the federal and Punjab governments and relevant departments, including the ministries of ports and shipping and communications, the motorway pol­i­ce, the National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) and senior officials of the Fede­ral Board of Revenue (FBR) and Customs. They claimed the federal and Punjab governments had ackno­wledged that their demands were justified. The negotiations were continuing late into the night and were ongoing at the time of going to press, officials said. Earlier, transporters said the strike would continue until their dema­nds were accepted. The Transp­orters’ Goods Association (TGA) also told a Sindh government committee at the Commissioner’s Office in Karachi that the shutdown would remain in place until issues raised in its charter of demands were addressed. The demands include designated parking for goods carriers near Karachi Port Trust (KPT), and matters related to licensing and the plying of 25- to 30-year-old vehicles. Industrialists urge PM to end goods transport shutdown as containers pile up Patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMEA) Muhammad Jawed Bilwani described the halt in port activity as “economic sabotage” and said the strike had disrupted the national supply chain, pushing exports and imports towards a standstill. He warned that exporters were being forced to consider costly and risky air consignments to meet delivery schedules and insisted that continued inaction could cause “heavy and irreparable” damage to the economy. Mr Bilwani said port operations had come to a halt, leaving thousands of export and import containers stranded, while several hundred containers already loaded on vessels remained at sea, awaiting berthing space. He cited Pakistan’s average daily exports at $92 million and monthly exports at $2.849 billion, adding that the textile sector alone accounted for $52m in daily exports and around $1.617bn per month. He urged the prime minister to take notice and intervene to end the strike, saying it was necessary to protect exports and domestic commerce from further damage. Atif Ikram Sheikh, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the transport strike was having serious negative consequences and freight forwarding at ports had been severely affected. He said imported goods were stuck at ports and exporters were unable to dispatch orders on time. Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Muhammad Ikram Rajput said the delay in resolving issues between transporters and authorities had become unbearable for the industry. He said businesses were already grappling with high energy costs, elevated interest rates and weak demand, and the collapse of transport services had added further pressure. Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PLGMEA) Chairman Nadeem Bukhari said that while efforts to improve road safety and regulatory compliance were welcome, the sudden disruption in freight movement had created significant operational challenges for export-oriented industries. Medicine supplies disrupted The strike has also begun disrupting the supply of essential medicines across the country, with shortages reported in several cities and towns as pharmaceutical products from major manufacturing hubs fail to reach pharmacies, medical stores and healthcare facilities, industry and market representatives said. They said medicines produced in Karachi and Lahore were not being transported to other parts of the country, warning that a prolonged disruption could create serious difficulties for patients, particularly those suffering from chronic illnesses. Tauqeerul Haq of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said pharmaceutical companies had received reports of shortages from different regions as manufacturers were unable to dispatch products from industrial centres. He said stocks of medicines used for diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and mental health conditions were running low, while demand had risen due to a flu outbreak. He added that many manufacturers had slowed or stopped production as warehouses reached capacity and finished goods could not be moved, while raw materials required for production were also failing to reach factories. Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, also stressed that transporters were not delivering medicines to different parts of the country and pharmacists were receiving complaints from patients unable to find essential drugs. Balochistan has been the worst-affected province, according to Malik Roohullah Kakar, president of the Medicines Traders Association of Balochistan. He said that around 80 per cent of medicines used in the province are supplied from Karachi, and the transporters’ strike had led to shortages in Quetta and other towns across Balochistan.

      "title_orig": "Police confirm Bondi gunman was from India’s Hyderabad; family claims no knowledge of his radicalisation",
      "summary_orig": "Indian police said on Tuesday that one of the gunmen in Australia’s Bondi Beach shooting , Sajid Akram, was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad but had limited contact with his family in India. The death toll in one of Australia’s worst mass shootings stands at 16, including 50-year-old Akram, who was shot by police. The man’s 24-year-old son and alleged accomplice, identified by local media as Naveed Akram, was in critical condition in hospital after also being shot. Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state. Australian police said both men had travelled to the Philippines last month, the father on an Indian passport and the son on an Australian one. “The family members have expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalisation,” Telangana state police said in a statement. The purpose of the trip is under investigation, officials said, adding it was not conclusive whether they were linked to any terrorist group or whether they received training in that country. Telangana police said the factors that led to the radicalisation of the two gunmen “appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana”. In its statement on Tuesday, Telangana police said Sajid Akram visited India on six occasions, mainly for family-related reasons, since he migrated to Australia in 1998. There was no “adverse record” on him before he left India, the statement added. This screen grab made from UGC handout video footage courtesy of Timothy Brant-Coles shows two gunmen dressed in black firing multiple shots on a bridge at Bondi Beach in Sydney on December 14, 2025. — AFP Police added that Sajid Akram had got a degree in commerce in Hyderabad, the large and bustling tech and pharma hub that is the state capital. Akram then moved to Australia in November 1998 to find work and married a woman described as of European origin, with whom he had a son and a daughter. Sajid and his son Naveed, who allegedly killed 15 people and wounded dozens of others at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, arrived on November 1 with the southern Philippine province of Davao listed as their final destination. The father and son spent nearly the entire month of November in the Philippines, Manila’s immigration department confirmed on Tuesday, with the father entering the country as an Indian national. “Sajid Akram, 50, Indian national, and Naveed Akram, 24, Australian national, arrived in the Philippines together last November 1, 2025 from Sydney, Australia,” immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told AFP , adding they departed on November 28. Australian police said on Tuesday both men had travelled to the Philippines last month and the purpose of the trip is under investigation. Philippines police have said they are investigating the matter. Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. They have been reduced to weakened cells operating in the southern Mindanao island in recent years, far from the scale of influence they wielded during the 2017 Marawi siege. “Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State, allegedly committed by a father and son,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said at a news conference. “These are the alleged actions of those who have aligned themselves with a terrorist organisation, not a religion.” Police also said the vehicle which is registered to the younger male contained improvised explosive devices and two homemade flags associated with ISIS, or Islamic State, a militant group designated by Australia and many other countries as a terrorist organisation. The father and son allegedly fired upon hundreds of people at the festival during a roughly 10-minute killing spree at one of Australia’s top tourist destinations, forcing people to flee and take shelter before both were shot by police. Some 25 survivors are receiving care in several Sydney hospitals, officials said. Australian PM says ‘Islamic State ideology’ drove Bondi Beach gunmen The father and son were driven by “Islamic State ideology” when they fired on crowds at Bondi Beach, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday. “It would appear that this was motivated by Islamic State ideology,” Albanese told national broadcaster ABC . “With the rise of ISIS more than a decade ago now, the world has been grappling with extremism and this hateful ideology,” he said in a separate interview. Albanese said Naveed, reportedly an unemployed bricklayer, had come to the attention of Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019 but was not considered an imminent threat at the time. “They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” Albanese said. “He was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.” Memorial of flowers Israeli Ambassador Amir Maimon visited Bondi on Tuesday and urged the Australian government to take all required steps to secure the lives of Jews in Australia. “Only Australians of Jewish faith are forced to worship their gods behind closed doors, CCTV, guards,” Maimon told reporters in Bondi, after laying flowers at the temporary memorial and paying his respects to the victims. “My heart is torn apart … it is insane.” A string of anti-Semitic incidents in Australia has unfolded in the past 16 months, prompting the head of the nation’s main intelligence agency to declare that anti-Semitism was his top priority in terms of threat to life. At Bondi, the beach was open on Tuesday but was largely empty under overcast skies, as a growing memorial of flowers was established at the Bondi Pavilion, metres from the location of the shootings. Mourners gather at a tribute at the Bondi Pavilion in memory of the victims of a shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on December 16. — AFP Bondi is Sydney’s best-known beach, located about 8.2km (5 miles) from the city centre, and draws hundreds of thousands of international tourists each year. Olivia Robertson, 25, visited the memorial before work. “This is the country that our grandparents have come to for us to feel safe and to have opportunity,” she said. “And now this has happened right here in our backyard. It’s pretty shocking.” Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old Muslim father-of-two who charged at one of the gunmen and seized his rifle, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds. He has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump. A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.9 million ($1.26 million). Tougher gun laws Australia’s gun laws are now being examined by the federal government, after police said Sajid Akram was a licenced gun owner and had six registered weapons. Akram received his gun licence in 2023, not 2015 as had been earlier stated, police said on Tuesday. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said gun laws introduced by the previous conservative Liberal-National coalition government following the Port Arthur massacre needed to be re-examined. Former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the gun restrictions in 1996, said on Tuesday he didn’t want to see gun law reform become a “diversion” from the need to tackle anti-Semitism. Albanese had let the Jewish community down, Howard told reporters. “He should have done more to fight anti-Semitism, a lot more,” he said. The 15 victims ranged from a rabbi who was a father of five, to a Holocaust survivor, to a 10-year-old girl named Matilda Britvan, according to interviews, officials and media reports. Two police officers remained in critical but stable condition in hospital, New South Wales police said. Matilda’s aunt has spoken publicly of her family’s heartbreak, saying they were devastated by her death. “I am beyond belief that this happened. I look on the phone and I am hoping it’s like a little big joke, not real,” Lina Chernykh told 7NEWS Australia.",

      "title_orig": "Lawmakers grill Trump officials on US alleged drug boat strikes",
      "summary_orig": "Donald Trump’s top national security officials faced a grilling from lawmakers Tuesday on US strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific — operations that have raised alarms about escalating military force near Venezuela. The House and Senate briefings, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, came amid mounting unease in Congress over the president’s widening campaign in waters off Latin America, and as lawmakers weigh measures to curb Trump’s authority to act without their approval. US officials say the operations target narcotics bound for American shores. Critics counter that the campaign — which has destroyed at least 26 boats and killed at least 95 people, according to US military figures — is legally ambiguous and strategically unclear. The classified sessions preceded a possible Senate vote on resolutions aimed at restricting Trump from launching military action against Venezuela without congressional consent. But Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters as he left the room that the officials had offered nothing new. “The administration came to this briefing empty handed… and if they can’t be transparent on this, how can you trust their transparency on all the other issues swirling about in the Caribbean?” Schumer said. The boat strikes have drawn particular scrutiny over a September 2 operation in which US forces carried out a follow-up attack on a disabled boat, killing two survivors of the initial strike. Lawmakers from both parties have demanded answers on the legal basis for that attack and why Congress has been denied full access to video footage, which so far has been shown only to a handful of senior lawmakers. Schumer has warned that secrecy – combined with the presence of US troops and a carrier group in the region — risked dragging the country into another open-ended conflict. He told reporters he reiterated the demand for every senator to be given access to the complete, unedited tape of the September 2 strike but was rebuffed. ‘Highly successful mission’ Rubio and Hegseth defended the “highly successful mission” as they left the briefing, and said the Pentagon would allow the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to view the video alongside the commander who ordered them, Admiral Frank Bradley. “But, in keeping with longstanding… Department of Defense policy, we’re not going to release a top secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,” Hegseth added. Beyond the boat strikes, the administration has ratcheted up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro — deepening sanctions, deploying warships and aircraft near his coastline and seizing an oil tanker linked to Caracas. Trump has declared that Maduro’s “days are numbered” and pointedly refused to rule out a US ground invasion. Legal experts say the case highlights a central tension in Trump’s approach — that treating drug trafficking as an act of war may violate international law. This week, Trump signed an executive order classifying fentanyl — which is stocked and administered by hospitals — as a “weapon of mass destruction,” an escalation supporters say reflects the gravity of the opioid crisis. Specialists note, however, that most of the intercepted boats were believed to be carrying cocaine, not fentanyl. Despite mounting scrutiny, the campaign shows no sign of slowing. On Monday, the Pentagon said it had carried out fresh strikes against alleged drug boats in the Pacific, killing eight people described as “narco-terrorists.” The Senate briefing also follows last week’s dramatic US seizure of an oil tanker accused of transporting sanctioned Venezuelan fuel in a network linked to Iran. Republican senator and staunch Trump ally Lindsey Graham said as he emerged from his briefing that the video was the least of his concerns, asserting that the September 2 strike was lawful. “Most Americans want to know what’s going to happen next. I want to know what’s going to happen next. Is it the policy to take Maduro down? It should be, if it’s not. And if he goes, what’s going to happen next?”",

      "summary_orig": "Afghanistan’s Minister for Public Health Noor Jalal Jalali on Tuesday reached the Indian capital of New Delhi on an official visit, the country’s health ministry said. The visit marks the third by an Afghan official in the last three months, after Afghanistan’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Industry Minister Nooruddin Azizi visited New Delhi. “The multi-day visit aims to strengthen bilateral health cooperation, promote the exchange of experience, and coordinate joint efforts,” said the Afghan health ministry. According to the statement, Jalali is to hold separate meetings with Indian officials, particularly health authorities, and take part in several organised programmes. “Discussions will also focus on capacity-building opportunities for Afghan health workers, the import of quality medicines into Afghanistan, medical equipment, and other related issues,” it said. The visit comes after the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan barred the traders from importing pharmaceutical goods from Pakistan. Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, confirmed the visit and extended a warm welcome to the Afghan delegation. “The visit reflects India’s enduring support for Afghanistan’s healthcare system, and we look forward to productive discussions,” he said. As Kabul’s relations with Islamabad deteriorated, the Taliban regime has sought closer ties with New Delhi. The main issue between Islamabad and Kabul remains cross-border terrorism, with numerous attacks originating from Afghanistan and targeting security forces in Pakistan. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism and stop providing sanctuary to the TTP, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.",

The main issue between Islamabad and Kabul remains cross-border terrorism, with numerous attacks originating from Afghanistan and targeting security forces in Pakistan. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism and stop providing sanctuary to the TTP, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.",

      "summary": "Afghanistan’s Minister for Public Health Noor Jalal Jalali on Tuesday reached the Indian capital of New Delhi on an official visit, the country’s health ministry said. The visit marks the third by an Afghan official in the last three months, after Afghanistan’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Industry Minister Nooruddin Azizi visited New Delhi. “The multi-day visit aims to strengthen bilateral health cooperation, promote the exchange of experience, and coordinate joint efforts,” said the Afghan health ministry. According to the statement, Jalali is to hold separate meetings with Indian officials, particularly health authorities, and take part in several organised programmes. “Discussions will also focus on capacity-building opportunities for Afghan health workers, the import of quality medicines into Afghanistan, medical equipment, and other related issues,” it said. The visit comes after the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan barred the traders from importing pharmaceutical goods from Pakistan. Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, confirmed the visit and extended a warm welcome to the Afghan delegation. “The visit reflects India’s enduring support for Afghanistan’s healthcare system, and we look forward to productive discussions,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "All 20 passengers abducted from a bus by Katcha area dacoits near Ubauro in Sindh’s Ghotki district have been recovered unharmed, the Sukkur Range Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) said later on Tuesday. Around 25 dacoits had attacked the bus in Sadiqabad on Monday night and kidnapped several passengers after injuring the driver. DIG Sukkur Range, Captain (retired) Faisal Abdullah Chachar, told Dawn that he reached Ghotki and led a large contingent of police personnel from different stations in Ghotki, Sukkur, Khairpur and Kashmore, along with Rangers officials. DIG Chachar led the joint operation with other senior officers, including Ghotki Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Muhammad Anwar Khetran, Sukkur SSP Azhar Khan Mughal and Khairpur SSP Samiullah Soomro. “We rescued all hostages unharmed from the clutches of the dacoits, with whom we engaged in a gunfight,” the DIG said. All routes leading to the Katcha area were blocked in time by police, preventing the dacoits from taking the hostages deeper into the riverine area. Meanwhile, the rescued hostages informed the police that two dacoits were injured during the operation. When the police engaged the dacoits, a police constable sustained injuries to his hand. Police moved the wounded personnel to Rahim Yar Khan Hospital for treatment. A police spokesperson confirmed to Dawn that a search operation against the dacoits is still ongoing. When contacted by Dawn , the Rahim Yar Khan district police officer, said that the passengers were not kidnapped in his jurisdiction but from a section of the link road going through Guddu in Sindh. “Sindh police have recovered all the hostages from the clutches of the armed dacoits,” he said. Mirpur Mathelo Deputy Superintendent of Police Abdul Qadir Soomro told Dawn that earlier today, 14 passengers were initially recovered by the police; however, one of them died of a heart attack in a sugarcane field. “The body of the deceased hostage was moved to Ubauro Hospital, while and two injured hostages were moved to the hospital for medical treatment,” he said. An earlier statement from DIG Chachar said that 10 of the kidnapped passengers had been rescued in an initial overnight operation under his command. The attack According to some videos shared on social media after 9:30pm on Monday, a passenger said a Sadabahar Company coach departed for Quetta from Sadiqabad at 8pm. When it reached near the Murid Shaikh area near M-5 Motorway, it took a turn towards Guddu at the Punjab-Sindh border. Some 65kms from the area, the dacoits intercepted the coach and started firing. They entered the bus after smashing the windows and asked the passengers to leave the coach, but did not harm the female passengers. Katcha is the area of land running along the Indus River, which is divided between Punjab and Sindh. The region is notorious for banditry. For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur frequently. PTI leader’s condemnation PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, in a statement, condemned Monday night’s incident and called into question the efficiency of Sindh and Punjab police. “More than twenty citizens were kidnapped; now their bids will be put up,” he said, stressing that the rulers were “failing” to protect their citizens. He noted that Katcha areas had been declared “no-go” areas. Sheikh called for the immediate release of all the hostages.",
