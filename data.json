      "summary_orig": "A FEW days ago, I made the mistake of posting a simple question on X . I had just seen the Indian film Dhurandhar , which attempts to connect Karachi’s Lyari gang wars of the 1990s to the Mumbai terrorist attack many years later. My question was simple and legitimate: “Why are Indians so obsessed with Pakistan?” I posed the question out of genuine bafflement. Pakistan has been attacked by India numerous times, yet one would have to look incredibly hard to find Pakistani television or film media focus on proving Indian villainy. India, and Dhurandar is evidence of this, is utterly obsessed with presenting mono-dimensional characters of Pakistanis and of Muslims, all of whom seem to be intent on attacking India. Unsurprisingly, the second I posed the question, the troll farms set about hurling insults of the worst kind at me. The level of vitriol in these comments was further evidence of nationalist anger. No Pakistani wakes up thinking about insulting random Indian columnists who write for Indian papers — the converse sadly is not true. I had also posed the question for a second reason: as those who have watched the film will notice, the film is well made. Bollywood filmmakers have made advances in cinematography, scriptwriting, the musical score, action sequences and production in general. How then can they be so retrogressive and backward in producing well-rounded characters if they are Muslim? This time it is not Pakistanis alone who are fed up with such long productions of what is essentially Islamophobia. While the film is doing well in India — understandable given the kind of vitriolic anti-Pakistan narrative that is fed by the state to an entire generation — it has already been blocked in a number of Gulf countries. Given that millions of South Asians live in that region, this means that the film’s earnings have now been majorly hit. It appears that the state-driven narrative of animosity in India against Muslims might be getting in the way of the eagerness of many of its citizens to work in the Muslim countries of the Gulf. It is also likely that such actions will be repeated in the future as Pakistan increases its security presence in the Gulf. How did India, once a secular and admired democracy, fall into such a deep pit of propaganda and historical mistruths? Some clues can be found in a dataset and article released by one of the few remaining esteemed and independent news sources in India. CERI-SciencesPo and The Caravan magazine — whose staff has faced harassment at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s supporters — released an incredible initiative titled ‘ Seeing the Sangh: The RSS Project ’. The initiative, which features an eye-opening map reveals how the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which Modi has deceptively called “the largest NGO in the world” is actually “the largest far right network in history”. How did India, once a secular and admired democracy, fall into such a deep pit of propaganda and historical mistruths? The RSS along with its nasty propaganda against Muslims and minorities and its constant whetting of religious hatred has managed to become huge. The “RSS formally acknowledges only about three dozen affiliates, even though it is widely understood to coordinate a sprawling network,” ‘Seeing the Sangh’ explains. As is evident from the map, there are in fact a vast number of organisations in India that apparently do what the RSS wants — from organising mobs to lynch Muslims to developing campaigns to destroy mosques, to changing the names of cities and streets, to harassing ordinary Muslims to all manner of other hate-filled actions. In the words of Christophe Jaffrelot, the research director at Sciences-Po in Paris and an esteemed scholar of South Asian history, “Hindutva is often equated with BJP, the Hindu nationalist party, but this ethno-religious movement has also developed deep roots in civil society since the creation of RSS in 1925. This dataset [on which the project is based], by revealing connections between the RSS, the mother organisation, and a myriad of more or less acknowledged subsidiaries which go much beyond what is known as the ‘Sangh Parivar’ (the RSS family), makes it very clear: extreme Hindu nationalist activists have reached out to almost every social and professional milieu. This network is not confined to India but is expanding globally thanks to the support of the diaspora, something this database captures also in great detail.” Bollywood films are no exception to the rule. Nothing, it seems, happens in India today without the blessings and accommodation of the Hindutva mindset. It follows that even talented filmmakers who may have wished to make a more evolved film focused on story rather than propaganda have to produce slick and smartly produced garbage. If Dhurandhar did not have to fit into that box it could have competed with the best Hollywood film. But this is the story of India under Modi. Such is the toxic grip of Hindutva that potential and talent are being destroyed. Unfortunately, a large section of the Indian diaspora appears to have embraced Hindutva. This has led major US academic institutions like Rutgers and Stanford to focus on the poison being spread through this far right ideology. The cost of hatred is that it eats a country whole from the inside. The ‘Seeing the Sangh’ map reveals just how this has happened in India. Even as a large section of Indians may be oblivious to the cost that the Modi regime has incurred, the rest of the world can see the tragedy clearly. Ironically, despite their general eagerness to underscore how awful all Pakistanis are — the Indian audience watching Dhurandar appears to have fallen in love not with the Indian spy character who roams Karachi for RAW but the character of Rehman Dakait. Whether they admit it consciously or not everyone knows a lie when they encounter one.

      "summary_orig": "A United Nations’ (UN) special rapporteur warned on Friday that PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani aithorities to comply with international norms and standards. In September, his legal team approached the rapporteur to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple. Prime Minister’s Aide Rana Ihsan Afzal, however, dismissed the concerns of the UN rapporteur and said Imran was being kept “according to prison rules and the jail manual”. “His children have access and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide. He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner. “He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available and ample space is also available.” The UN official, Alice Jill Edwards, urged Pakistan to take immediate and effective action to address reports of the 73-year-old’s inhumane and undignified detention conditions . “I call on Pakistani authorities to ensure that Khan’s conditions of detention fully comply with international norms and standards,” Edwards said in a statement . “Since his transfer to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on September 26, 2023, Imran Khan has reportedly been held for excessive periods in solitary confinement, confined for 23 hours a day in his cell, and with highly restricted access to the outside world,” she said. “His cell is reportedly under constant camera surveillance.” “Khan’s solitary confinement should be lifted without delay,” she said. UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself. Imran’s supporters allege that he is being denied prison visits from lawyers and family, prompting multiple protests and sit-ins outside or near the prison. Jemima says X’s AI confirms content linked to Imran is being throttled Imran’s ex-wife, Jemimah Goldsmith, took to X and directly addressed platform CEO Elon Musk, informing him that the platform’s algorithm was limiting posts about the PTI founder, including those from her account. “According to Grok — your own AI — ‘Every time you post anything about Imran’s jail conditions, solitary confinement or your son’s access to their father, the algorithm limits the post … the Pakistani authorities have made criticism from Imran Khan’s immediate circle one of their top online enforcement priorities, and X is quietly complying just enough to keep the platform alive in the country’,” she wrote, quoting the AI tool. “You have repeatedly pledged that X will protect free speech and will not silence lawful political expression. Yet Grok has examined my X analytics … and concluded my account is subjected to what Grok calls ‘secret throttling’ — the algorithm deliberately hides my posts from almost everyone, even though the account is not suspended.” Citing Grok, Jemima attached statistics with her post, stating that between 2023 and early 2024, she averaged 400–900 million impressions per month in engagement on her account, which has 3.5m followers. However, when 2025 came around, impressions plummeted to 28.6m in total — a drop of over 97 per cent to only 3pc of her expected reach. “The turning point was May 2025: one post spiked to 4m impressions the day Pakistan’s X ban ended — proving my audience was still engaged. Thereafter, impressions were instantly crushed to near zero and stayed there,” she wrote, requesting that Musk remove secret throttling from the platform. Jemima also wrote that Imran has been imprisoned for 22 months and their sons, Kasim and Suleman, have been unable to meet him, speak with him, or even send letters. “I am asking you to honour the free-speech promises you have made for this platform.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.",

In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.",

      "summary": "A United Nations’ (UN) special rapporteur warned on Friday that PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment, calling on Pakistani aithorities to comply with international norms and standards. In September, his legal team approached the rapporteur to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple. Prime Minister’s Aide Rana Ihsan Afzal, however, dismissed the concerns of the UN rapporteur and said Imran was being kept “according to prison rules and the jail manual”. “His children have access and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide. He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner. “He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available and ample space is also available.” The UN official, Alice Jill Edwards, urged Pakistan to take immediate and effective action to address reports of the 73-year-old’s inhumane and undignified detention conditions . “I call on Pakistani authorities to ensure that Khan’s conditions of detention fully comply with international norms and standards,” Edwards said in a statement . “Since his transfer to Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi on September 26, 2023, Imran Khan has reportedly been held for excessive periods in solitary confinement, confined for 23 hours a day in his cell, and with highly restricted access to the outside world,” she said. “His cell is reportedly under constant camera surveillance.” “Khan’s solitary confinement should be lifted without delay,” she said. UN special rapporteurs are independent experts mandated by the Human Rights Council. They do not, therefore, speak for the United Nations itself. Imran’s supporters allege that he is being denied prison visits from lawyers and family, prompting multiple protests and sit-ins outside or near the prison. Jemima says X’s AI confirms content linked to Imran is being throttled Imran’s ex-wife, Jemimah Goldsmith, took to X and directly addressed platform CEO Elon Musk, informing him that the platform’s algorithm was limiting posts about the PTI founder, including those from her account. “According to Grok — your own AI — ‘Every time you post anything about Imran’s jail conditions, solitary confinement or your son’s access to their father, the algorithm limits the post … the Pakistani authorities have made criticism from Imran Khan’s immediate circle one of their top online enforcement priorities, and X is quietly complying just enough to keep the platform alive in the country’,” she wrote, quoting the AI tool. “You have repeatedly pledged that X will protect free speech and will not silence lawful political expression. Yet Grok has examined my X analytics … and concluded my account is subjected to what Grok calls ‘secret throttling’ — the algorithm deliberately hides my posts from almost everyone, even though the account is not suspended.” Citing Grok, Jemima attached statistics with her post, stating that between 2023 and early 2024, she averaged 400–900 million impressions per month in engagement on her account, which has 3.5m followers. However, when 2025 came around, impressions plummeted to 28.6m in total — a drop of over 97 per cent to only 3pc of her expected reach. “The turning point was May 2025: one post spiked to 4m impressions the day Pakistan’s X ban ended — proving my audience was still engaged. Thereafter, impressions were instantly crushed to near zero and stayed there,” she wrote, requesting that Musk remove secret throttling from the platform. Jemima also wrote that Imran has been imprisoned for 22 months and their sons, Kasim and Suleman, have been unable to meet him, speak with him, or even send letters. “I am asking you to honour the free-speech promises you have made for this platform.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine.

      "summary_orig": "• Calls for lasting ceasefire, humanitarian access and reconstruction in Gaza • Meets Iranian president; cites mutual support during external aggression • Holds informal interactions with Putin and Erdogan, Tajik and Kyrgyz presidents ISLAMABAD: Turkish Pre­sident Recep Tayyip Erdogan has expressed Ankara’s readiness to contribute to a mechanism established to maintain stability amid ‘extended ceasefire’ between Pakistan and Afghanistan, after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at an international forum on Friday urged the global community to press the Afghan Taliban to honour their international obligations and curb terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil. President Erdogan made the offer during a meeting with PM Shehbaz on the sidelines of the international forum held in Turkmenistan, where the premier also held meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon and Kyrgyzstan Pres­ident Sadyr Japarov. Addressing the event dedicated to the International Year of Peace and Trust 2025, the International Day of Neutrality and the anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality, PM Shehbaz said peaceful dispute resolution was “a cornerstone” of Pakistan’s foreign policy. In this regard, he also cited Pakistan’s support for the Gaza Peace Plan and its subsequent endorsement by the UN Security Council. Pakistan began the year by taking its seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Cou­ncil, where it was working to uphold global peace and security, he said. “While we persevere in this quest for peace, the scourge of terrorism is, however, raising its head yet again, and this time, unfortunately, from Afghan soil,” he said, urging the international community to press the Taliban government to fulfil its commitments and rein in terrorist elements operating from its territory. PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude to Qatar, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates for their efforts in brokering a ceasefire between Isla­mabad and Kabul. He noted that the ceasefire still stood though it remained ‘fragile’. He also underscored Pakistan’s commitment to ‘peaceful dispute resolution’. He also referred to the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2788 earlier this year as an endorsement of Pakistan’s approach to the peaceful settlement of disputes. The premier said he hoped ongoing peace efforts in the Middle East would help protect Palestinian lives, ensure a lasting ceasefire, enable the flow of humanitarian assistance and support reconstruction in Gaza. He reiterated Pakistan’s support for the right to self-determination of the people of Palestine and Kashmir. Stressing that lasting peace was intrinsically linked to sustainable development, PM Shehbaz said the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provided a blueprint for a more peaceful world and described socio-economic development as a key government priority. He said Pakistan had made progress in areas including financial inclusion and greater economic participation for women and marginalised groups. He said Pakistan’s pursuit of sustainable development faced headwinds from climate-induced disasters and inequities in international economic relations, adding that access to advanced technologies, particularly digital technologies, must be equitable and non-discriminatory. He urged global leaders to treat the forum as a call for urgent action and a new paradigm in international relations, calling for investment in connectivity as “bridges for people, ideas and prosperity”. Earlier, the prime minister congratulated Turkmenistan on the 30th anniversary of its permanent neutrality and on the UN’s designation of 2025 as the International Year of Peace and Trust. The premier also joined other leaders at the Neutrality Monument, where they attended a wreath-laying ceremony before addressing the forum. PM meets Iran president PM Shehbaz later held a bilateral meeting with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian on the sidelines of the forum, the Prime Minister’s Office said. Both leaders appreciated the support the neighbouring countries provided to each other when they faced external aggression earlier this year, according to the statement. Referring to the 22nd meeting of the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission, PM Shehbaz emphasised the need to strengthen bilateral cooperation to expand trade, operationalise border markets, enhance border security and improve connectivity, including through the Isla­mabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail network. He also reiterated the need to urge the Afghan Taliban to take meaningful action to address Pakistan’s security concerns related to terrorism. The two leaders discussed Gaza as well, the PM Office said. President Pezeshkian expressed a desire to further strengthen ties with Pakistan, and both sides agreed to maintain regular high-level engagement. Mr Sharif conveyed his regards to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In his interaction with President Erdogan, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the significance of bilateral ties and discussed cooperation in areas including energy, the economy, defence and investment. He welcomed Turkish interest and investment in petroleum, energy and minerals and underscored the importance of regional connectivity including the revival of the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul rail link. President Erdogan thanked the prime minister and expressed a desire to work together to strengthen relations. Published in Dawn, December 13th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has held that a husband cannot be prosecuted for rape of his wife unless the pronouncement of divorce takes legal effect in accordance with the mandatory requirements of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance (MFLO) 1961. Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh issued the ruling on a petition filed by Jameel Ahmad seeking the quashing of an FIR registered at Police Station City Liaqatpur under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code, which prescribes punishment for rape. The complainant had alleged that the petitioner lured her into cohabitation and later married her on April 22, 2024. She claimed she later discovered he was already married and, upon her protest, he divorced her on Oct 14, 2024. According to the FIR, three days later — on Oct 17 — the petitioner and a co-suspect allegedly entered her home at night, where the petitioner raped her at gunpoint. The petitioner, however, denied the allegation of a live-in relationship and contended that the FIR was fabricated as retaliation for the divorce. He admitted issuing a written Talaq deed but argued that he had revoked the divorce on Dec 23, 2024, within the 90-day statutory reconciliation period. Court quashes FIR registered against petitioner He further submitted that he had filed a suit for restitution of conjugal rights, which remained pending. In his judgement, announced at the court’s Bahawalpur bench, Justice Sheikh noted that the central question before the court was whether Talaq had legally taken effect by Oct 17, 2024 — the date of the alleged offence. The judge undertook a survey of Islamic jurisprudence as well as statutory requirements under Section 7 of the MFLO, observing that although Islamic law recognises multiple forms of Talaq, Pakistani law mandates a specific legal mechanism. Section 7 requires a notice of Talaq to be provided to the chairman of the relevant union council, and mandates a 90-day reconciliation period. Talaq does not become effective unless this period expires without revocation. The judge noted that the petitioner had dispatched notice of Talaq to the union council but had subsequently revoked it before the expiry of the statutory period. Citing Supreme Court precedents, Justice Sheikh reiterated that failure to comply with statutory requirements renders the divorce legally ineffective, even where a Talaqnama exists under Islamic law. The judge observed that under Section 7(3) of MFLO, the parties remain husband and wife until either the 90-day period expires or the husband explicitly revokes Talaq, whichever comes first. He concluded that on Oct 17, 2024, the date of the alleged incident, the marriage had not dissolved in the eyes of the law. Under Shariah, the judge noted, a crime is an act prohibited by divine injunction and punishable by Hadd or Ta’zir penalties. In the present case, Justice Sheikh maintained, the marital bond between the parties continued to exist legally at the time of the alleged occurrence. He said the petitioner’s conduct may be considered immoral or inappropriate under religious or social norms, but prosecution under Section 376 of PPC could not be sustained as the essential ingredients of the offence were not made out on the FIR’s own assertions. With these observations, the judge allowed the petition and quashed the FIR registered against the petitioner. Published in Dawn, December 13th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "THE crisp December air was festive at the KHA Hockey Complex as blue skies played canvas to clouds clouds imitating no less than an artist’s work. The view above contrasted smoothly with the expanse of the deep blue of the astroturf of the venue, located in the midst of the sprawling Gulshan-e-Iqbal. As buses honked relentlessly at the ever-bustling Nipa after having swished dust off the perpetually under-construction University Road, hockey took centre stage on the other side of the wall. It was the day when the gold medal winners for the national sport at the National Games were to be decided. View this post on Instagram There were no surprises; it were heavyweights Wapda and Army who added to their already stacked medals table to take the honours in the women’s and men’s finals respectively. Each achievement was celebrated with maximum zeal, as the announcer shouted his heart out even for the silver medal winners Punjab and Navy. The screams got louder as Wapda and Army received their gold medals. It was a second gold for Wapda’s talisman Sidra Mateen, who scored both their goals in their 2-1 victory over Punjab. Army and Navy players in action during the National Games men’s hockey final at the KHA Complex in Karachi on December 12, 2025. She had already won a gold medal as a basketball player earlier. “I started with cricket as most girls do but then stayed where my financial needs were met,” Sidra told Dawn after the final. The 28-year-old lost the hockey final of the previous edition of the National Games in 2023, as a Punjab player was roped in by Wapda later on. “As a young athlete, you just want to play anything you can, it’s all about passion,” she said. “But when you grow up, survival is the focus and a job with the department really helps.” After the women’s final ended and the prizes distributed, the announcer requested the players on the field to “hurry up” off it. “We have to conduct another match,” he would say, and the Navy and Army players would take on to the turf to warm up. In no time, the whistle was blown, and the big match got underway. As a sparse crowd of spectators and dignitaries looked on, both sides stayed compact and took a counterattacking approach when the chances arrived. Wapda players celebrate winning the women’s hockey gold medal. It was hectic for three of the four quarters in both dugouts as coaches shouted instructions in thick Punjabi accents. The drought was finally broken when Army scored via their third penalty corner through Mohammad Owais. Navy equalised minutes later from open play, thanks to Samad Habib but their dream for gold was shattered when Owais scored the winner in the dying minutes of the game. As the Army players chanted, sang and danced, the Navy faces were flat and hanging down with disappointment and sadness. The announcer was back in action, and the medals were distributed. As the sun set, it left behind stunning hues of blue and orange in the sky. The turf below, was now empty. But it had witnessed being part of the coming together of 11,000 athletes from all over the country in this city — the hustle of which continued as buses still honked and dust still rose at the Nipa stop.

The proposal was formally initiated when NFC talks started under then-prime minister Imran Khan, while current Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had also suggested the same in the past to reduce the financial burden on the Centre. “Funds should be given to Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan under the NFC award. I will speak to PM Shehbaz Sharif in this regard,“ the PML-N supremo said while talking to party leaders in Lahore. “A certain amount every year must be given to both provinces — Azad Kashmir and GB. This is very important,” he said, adding that these two provinces must have the capacity to spend this money. He recalled how both provinces could not properly utilise the funding they received from the federal government in the past. “They need to know how to spend that money. The way I want such funds utilised did not happen,” he stated. Nawaz also sought applications for elections in both provinces by December 31. “We decide who will be awarded the tickets on merit in both provinces, as we do in other provinces,” he announced. “We will not tolerate infighting on tickets. Anyone involved in this will be excluded from the process.” He added that when the PML-N received applications, he would visit both provinces and meet candidates to listen to their perspectives and reach a better understanding in awarding tickets. The PML-N supremo also praised his daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, for her performance as the province’s chief executive. He specifically praised initiatives such as building cancer hospitals, model villages and introducing the metro bus system. During the NFC meeting last week, the federal government proposed mobilising additional consolidated revenues amounting to more than 5 per cent of GDP over the next three years (roughly Rs6.5 trillion per annum at the current exchange rate). The suggestion came during the much-delayed inaugural meeting , which also sought legal opinion on whether federal expenditure priorities bind provinces. Participants told journalists outside the Ministry of Finance that there was no demand for reducing the provincial share in the divisible pool from the existing 57.5pc as being speculated, nor any discussion about more or less responsibilities, as they were subjects of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and the National Economic Council (NEC). Fiscal requirements of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan would also be deliberated at a working-group level. However, AJK went through a period of political instability between September and November, with the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee’s (JKJAAC) calling a strike over the issue of its unfulfilled charter of demands, including the abolition of 12 seats allocated for refugees in the territory’s legislative assembly. The strikes turned violent after the administration imposed a communications blackout and rival groups marred the largely peaceful demonstrations with violence, leaving at least 10 dead . Two rounds of talks were held with the federal government — one in September and another in October , where an agreement was reached. The terms included additional funding for the province, a reduction in the cabinet size and a probe into those killed during the protests. Later, then-prime minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq faced a no-confidence vote in November, with PPP leader Faisal Rathore nominated as his successor. Haq was voted out on November 17, with Rathore being sworn in the next day.",

      "summary_orig": "Setting aside their political differences, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz have exchanged greetings on social media platform X, with the former thanking the latter for the “positive gesture”. On Thursday, Maryam, in a post on X, had extended a “warm welcome” to Bilawal, who is currently visiting the province. “Punjab is your home, and you will always find a place of respect here,” she said. “Thank you for your gracious remarks. You have my heartfelt good wishes and prayers,” she added. Although Maryam did not specifically mention which comments she was referring to, Bilawal, during a media talk in Lahore this week, had said he would be very happy if the Punjab chief minister chose to contest polls from Sindh. In response, Bilawal on Friday said, “Thank you, madam chief minister for the warm welcome and positive gesture.” The PPP and PML-N, who are allies in the Centre, engaged in a war of words in September and October. The bad blood had escalated to the point that leaders from both sides were holding daily press conferences to take potshots at the other side until tensions defused . More recently, another instance of a rift between the two parties was witnessed on Wednesday when the PPP accused the PML-N of “colluding” with the PTI during National Assembly proceedings after presiding officer for the day, Ali Zahid, ended the session early.

      "summary_orig": "Five cops were injured after terrorists launched a late-night attack on a police checkpost in Shaikh Landak area located within the Havaid police jurisdiction in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu, it emerged on Friday. A statement released by the spokesperson for the regional police officer, Kashif Nawaz, said Fitna al Khawarij terrorists attacked the post late on Thursday night. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The statement said that police personnel showed courage, bravery and acted in a timely manner, managing to repel the attack. “As a result of the effective and vigorous retaliatory fire by the police, the terrorists suffered heavy casualties,” the statement said. It said that the exchange of fire continued for three hours, adding that reports suggested that several terrorists had been killed and injured. It added that armed tribesmen and members of the peace committee backed police personnel in the gunfight with the terrorists. It added that during this process, five cops sustained “minor injuries” and were taken to the hospital for medical treatment. The statement said that on the instructions of Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan, additional personnel reached the scene and surrounded the area. It said that the Bannu DIG and District Police Office (DPO) Yasir Afridi praised the efforts of the police, and the courage and bravery of the people in the area. The statement went on to say that the Bannu DPO later visited the injured cops at the hospital. “Bannu police have once again proven that it stands as a strong wall in front of the enemies of peace. The war against terrorism will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated,” the statement quoted him as saying. The development came as the situation remained tense in the area on Thursday after at least seven people, including minors, were injured in a quadcopter attack carried out by terrorists on a playground during a football match. Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents follow the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. In October, Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the country over three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.",

      "summary_orig": "A US congressional hearing this week noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly described Pakistan as a “key regional partner” even as his administration seeks to further strengthen ties with India. The hearing — held by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia — also exposed sharp disagreements among lawmakers and analysts over the direction of Washington’s India policy. Witnesses warned during the hearing that tariff battles , visa restrictions and political mistrust had pushed the relationship into what several described as a “political standstill”. Jeff Smith of conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, long considered sympathetic to New Delhi, acknowledged that the partnership had entered “choppy waters”, attributing the downturn to Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between India and Pakistan. The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles , artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people , before agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire . Smith noted that the Trump administration’s messaging during the ceasefire between India and Pakistan had placed Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a “difficult position at home”, with critics accusing him of “bending to the will of the US”. Republican scepticism Republican scepticism — usually muted when it comes to India — was unusually sharp. Congressman Mike Baumgartner of Washington state questioned whether India was genuinely committed to deepening defence cooperation with the United States. He recounted browsing a book on the Indian Army during a recent visit to India and finding a full-page photograph of Indian troops training with Russians while US-India exercises appeared only as a small boxed image. “The next time I go to India,” he said, “I’d like to see those pages reversed.” His comments reflected a wider concern in Washington that despite two decades of US outreach, India continues to hedge strategically — maintaining close ties with Russia and participating actively in China-led forums such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. Committee Chairman Bill Huizenga opened the session by calling India a “defining partner for the 21st century”, praising its expanding naval posture in the Indo-Pacific, its role in the Quad, and cooperation in technology, counter-terrorism and energy. Yet he also acknowledged “understandable concerns” over Russian President Vladimir Putin’s recent visit to New Delhi and India’s involvement in multilateral platforms shaped by China. Huizenga accused Beijing of pursuing a “string of pearls” strategy to militarise ports across the Indian Ocean. ‘Frozen high-level engagement’ Democratic Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove issued the strongest warning, cautioning that Trump risked becoming “the president who lost India” because of escalating disputes over trade and immigration. She revealed that a US-India trade agreement had been on track for signature in July but was abruptly withdrawn by the White House. Instead, India was hit with 50pc tariffs — among the steepest applied to any US partner — and a 25pc tariff on India-linked Russian oil imports. She criticised the newly announced $100,000 H-1B visa fee, noting that Indians hold nearly 70pc of such visas and form a crucial segment of the US technology and medical workforce. The combined effect of these decisions, she said, had frozen high-level engagement and forced the postponement of the Quad Leaders Summit. Yet the hearing also underscored a growing divergence between congressional rhetoric and Trump’s own public posture. While several lawmakers focused sharply on allegations of militancy in occupied Kashmir and criticised Pakistan, others noted that Trump had maintained a strikingly different tone throughout the year. He has issued more than 30 public statements praising Pakistan for its cooperation, calling Islamabad a “key regional partner”, and emphasising the need for balanced engagement with both South Asian nuclear powers. Following the India-Pakistan May conflict, Trump declined to assign blame and instead praised Pakistan’s role in helping defuse tensions. Analysts at the hearing indirectly acknowledged that such statements had complicated New Delhi’s domestic political narrative. In multiple statements, Trump has reaffirmed that eight jets were downed during the military escalation. For its part, Pakistan initially said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale , and later increased the count to seven. Initially, New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Later in October, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh claimed without evidence that his country had “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class”. ‘Second-most significant challenge’ Dhruva Jaishankar of the Observer Research Foundation America told lawmakers that India viewed recent US engagement with Pakistan’s military leadership as “unsettling”, particularly after India’s air strikes inside Pakistan in May. Repeating India’s longstanding allegation of Pakistani support for terrorism — a claim Pakistan rejects — he warned that unresolved tariffs would increasingly be perceived in India as “acts of political hostility”. Jaishankar, who is son of the Indian external affairs minister, described Washington’s growing relationship with Pakistan as the “second-most significant challenge” to India-US ties, after trade and tariff disputes. Responding to Trump’s assertion that he personally negotiated the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Jaishankar said: “India’s experience is that third-party mediation has often contributed to Pakistan’s adventurism.” He argued that the United States had long pursued a policy of “de-hyphenation”, engaging both India and Pakistan while avoiding involvement in their disputes, and urged Washington to maintain that approach. He noted that “considerable progress” in the relationship remained possible if disagreements over trade and Pakistan were managed. At the same time, he acknowledged that defence cooperation continues to expand — including through a new 10-year Defence Framework Agreement , joint production initiatives, the impending launch of the NISAR satellite, and ongoing US support for India’s human spaceflight programme. Sameer Lalwani of the German Marshall Fund said India remained “poised to become a pole in the international system”, but stressed that New Delhi seeks autonomy, not alignment — a reminder that US expectations often exceed India’s willingness to commit. Jeff Smith also noted that Washington’s outreach to Pakistan’s military leadership — particularly meetings with Chief of Defence Forces and Cheif of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir — had generated political unease in India, contributing to the perception that the United States was recalibrating its regional priorities. The overarching message from the hearing was clear: political trust — the element that has long held the US-India partnership together — is now under visible strain. And as Washington reassesses its strategic options in South Asia, Pakistan’s role as a stabilising partner is once again part of the conversation, even if not always acknowledged openly.",

      "summary_en": "A US congressional hearing this week noted that President Donald Trump has repeatedly described Pakistan as a “key regional partner” even as his administration seeks to further strengthen ties with India. The hearing — held by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on South and Central Asia — also exposed sharp disagreements among lawmakers and analysts over the direction of Washington’s India policy. Witnesses warned during the hearing that tariff battles , visa restrictions and political mistrust had pushed the relationship into what several described as a “political standstill”. Jeff Smith of conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, long considered sympathetic to New Delhi, acknowledged that the partnership had entered “choppy waters”, attributing the downturn to Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between India and Pakistan. The conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles , artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people , before agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire .
