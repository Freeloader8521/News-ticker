      "summary_orig": "Talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan stalled Friday without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism, officials and sources said. “The talks in Istanbul are deadlocked,” a senior security source told reporters, confirming that discussions had hit an impasse. The third round of Pakistan–Afghanistan talks began on Thursday in Istanbul and was planned to continue for two days. Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt. Gen. Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office (FO) officials. The Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani, and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib. The dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Following those clashes, Turkiye and Qatar stepped in to mediate. The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks. The latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism. Despite the stalemate, a source in Istanbul said the talks have not been called off. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day. For most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s FO spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner.” “The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified, and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism,” Andrabi said. “They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.” Afghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islamabad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive,” suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications. According to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation”. A source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive.” Information Minister Ata Tarar, who had declared a similar deadlock at the previous round before mediators salvaged a statement, said the “onus lies on Afghanistan to fulfill its long-standing international, regional, and bilateral pledges regarding control of terrorism — in which so far they have failed.” “Pakistan shall continue to exercise all options necessary to safeguard the security of its people and its sovereignty,” Tarar said, echoing the FO spokesman’s earlier warning about Islamabad’s response in case of failure of the talks. “All I can say is that, in any eventuality, we will protect the lives of our people and make sure that our civilians, our military forces, and our law enforcement agencies on the border are not killed by attacks emanating from Afghanistan,” Andrabi said. Border clashes and talks Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban follow weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021 . The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. Since the skirmishes between October 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul on Wednesday. The talks began yesterday , surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested the shaky ceasefire. Two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Friday condemned remarks by the province’s Chief Minister, Sohail Afridi, “disparaging the security forces and assailing counter-terrorism operations in KP.” Speaking to reporters outside Adiala Jail a day prior, the CM alleged that security forces in KP would bring dogs into mosques and tie them down there, thereby violating the sanctity of holy places. “When we would go and tell them that they are violating the sanctity of the mosque, they would tell us ‘you and these dogs are no different’,” CM Afridi said. “Despite this, we still support them … but do they know the pain of my people?” Taking to X and posting a video of the CM’s remarks, Kundi wrote that he condemned any rhetoric that undermined the “honour and sacrifice” of the armed forces. “The brave sons of our soil lay down their lives to protect our province — questioning their intent in sensational terms only damages morale and public safety,” he wrote. Kundi affirmed the importance of intelligence-based operations, stating that they were necessary to protect the public and were conducted solely to safeguard the population. “Political debate must not cross into actions or words that weaken our security institutions,” he wrote. “[KP CM Afridi] should exercise restraint and place the safety and unity of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa above partisan posturing.” The governor maintained that KP’s security demands that all political forces stand with the armed forces to ensure peace in the province. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. “Ultimately, it is the people who will deliver accountability in the coming elections,” Kundi wrote. Meanwhile, the Khyber Union of Journalists (KUJ) took strong notice of the CM’s remarks and issued a statement expressing “deep concern and regret”. “Dragging mosques and madrassas into political disputes in any way is a condemnable and irresponsible behaviour,” the statement read, quoting KUJ President Kashifuddin Syed. “He (Syed) clarified that the sanctity of places of worship, respect for worshippers there and respect for the sacrifices of martyrs are obligatory on all of us,” the statement added. “Such statements cause chaos in society, hurt religious sentiments and increase suspicion against state institutions.” Syed also paid tribute to the sacrifices of the armed forces for their role in fighting terrorism and emphasised that “any attempt to make this important role controversial is tantamount to strengthening the enemy’s narrative,” according to the KUJ. “The president of the Khyber Union of Journalists demanded that the chief minister should show responsibility and prudence in choosing words, not use religious places for politics, and issue statements keeping in mind the requirements of national unity,” the statement added. Pakistan Ulema Council chairman condemns KP CM Meanwhile, the chairman of the Pakistan Ulema Council also condemned CM Afridi in a statement, calling it “misleading”. “The speech made by KP CM regarding mosques is regrettable,” Maulana Tahir Ashrafi was quoted as saying. “The statement made by the KP CM is also an attempt to tarnish the image of Pakistan,” Maulana Ashrafi said. “The Pakistan Army is the protector of mosques and madrasas, which will never be unsafe.” The chairman added that the foundation of the Pakistan Army is “faith, piety, and jihad in the way of Allah” and that the army has fought a major war against terrorism and succeeded. “The Pakistan Army is once again fighting the war imposed on Pakistan,” Maulana Ashrafi stated. “Terrorists have also come and committed terrorism in the mosques of the Pakistan Army.”",

      "title_orig": "Explainer: Why are aircraft engineers protesting against PIA?",
      "summary_orig": "For nearly a year, engineers working at Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), represented by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP), have been raising their voices over what they describe as unfair treatment and safety concerns within the airline. Recently, however, the matter has escalated, turning into a protest, resulting in the delay of flights and leading to the suspension of a few SAEP officials. On Monday night, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, because of which hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia. Why are engineers protesting? According to SAEP representatives, the protest was carried out over two primary issues: salary disparities as well as safety and the unavailability of spare parts. SAEP members claim that while pilots receive salary hikes, engineers’ pay remains stagnant. Moreover, the engineers claim they are often told to reuse old aircraft parts instead of being provided with new ones, a practice they say could compromise passenger safety. For the past two months, engineers have been fastening black ribbons around their arms to state a protest against low salaries.

In June, it received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm.

Recently, an incident involving PIA flight PK859 highlighted SAEP’s concerns, where an aircraft on its way to Jeddah from Lahore had its windshield broken mid-air, forcing the pilot to reroute back to Lahore. According to engineers, they had previously cautioned that the aircraft was unfit to fly, but PIA allegedly disregarded those concerns. The captain (pilot) of the flight said the aircraft could not fly any further.",

      "summary_en": "For nearly a year, engineers working at Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), represented by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP), have been raising their voices over what they describe as unfair treatment and safety concerns within the airline. Recently, however, the matter has escalated, turning into a protest, resulting in the delay of flights and leading to the suspension of a few SAEP officials. On Monday night, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, because of which hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia. Why are engineers protesting? According to SAEP representatives, the protest was carried out over two primary issues: salary disparities as well as safety and the unavailability of spare parts.

      "summary_orig": "Explosions at a mosque in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta that injured dozens of people during Friday prayers could have been an attack, officials indicated, with a 17-year-old identified as the suspected perpetrator. Police said 55 people were in hospitals with a range of minor to serious injuries, including burns, after the blasts at the mosque inside a school complex in the Kelapa Gading area. “The explosion was loud, so loud that I could not breathe because I was shocked,” said Luciana, 43, who was working at the school canteen at the time.

      "summary_orig": "A Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) sent Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) chief Sahibzada Mohammad Hamid Raza to jail on Friday, directing that he serve his 10-year jail term in a case pertaining to violent protests in the country on May 9, 2023. Hamid was convicted in the case along with several PTI leaders on July 31. According to his brother, he was detained by Islamabad police earlier today while he was on his way to Faisalabad to court arrest. He was later presented before the court, which issued an order, noting that Hamid had been convicted in the case registered at Civil Lines police station in Faisalabad by then-ATC Judge Javed Iqbal Sheikh. He was produced before the court today by Inspector Mujahid Iqbal of Civil Lines police station, it added. According to the order, a copy of which is available with Dawn , Hamid was sentenced in the case on multiple counts, with the maximum term being 10 years. It said that the Faisalabad Central Jail superintendent was required and authorised to receive the convict in his custody for the completion of his sentences in accordance with the law. “The sentences of imprisonment awarded to the convict for all the offences shall run concurrently,” the order read, adding that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been extended in favour of the convict. The detention Earlier today, Hamid’s brother, Sahibzada Hassan Raza, had said the SIC chief had been detained by Islamabad police while he was travelling to Faisalabad with the intention of surrendering himself before the court. Police arrested him near a picket on Islamabad bypass road, Hassan said while speaking to the media outside the Faisalabad ATC, where Hamid was produced. A separate post on Hamid’s X account also cited Hassan as saying that Hamid\nwas detained by Islamabad police as he was en route to Faisalabad. “He was travelling from Peshawar to Faisalabad to surrender. Islamabad police arrested him,” the early morning post stated. PTI leader Omar Ayub also posted about the development, saying that Raza was “abducted” from Islamabad late last night. “Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib , my dear friend and colleague, has been abducted from Islamabad late last night whilst en route to surrender in the conviction awarded by an anti-terrorism court [in] Faisalabad,” Ayub said, adding that he “strongly” condemned the move. “Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib is a brave and very loyal ally of PM Imran Khan ( sic ). He must be produced immediately in the relevant court,” the PTI leader added. The development comes just two days after the Peshawar High Court rejected Raza’s plea seeking transit bail in the May 9 riots case. Violent demonstrations had broken out in the country on May 9, 2023 following the arrest of ex-premier and PTI founder Imran Khan. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested. Later, the ECP had also deprived the PTI of its bat symbol, compelling party members to contest the 2024 elections as independent candidates. Subsequently, the PTI had allied with the SIC in a bid to get reserved seats, which are allocated on a party basis. Raza’s conviction also led to his disqualification as a member of the National Assembly by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). After today’s court order, Hassan said while speaking to the media in Faisalabad that they would move the court for a stay order against election for the seat vacated after Hamid’s disqualification.",

      "summary_orig": "The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday ordered the Punjab government to launch a rigorous campaign against smoke-emitting vehicles in the province in an effort to curb smog and air pollution. “Whenever you go out, you see dozens of smoke-emitting vehicles on the roads,” Justice Shahid Karim said while hearing a set of petitions against smog and environmental pollution. Justice Karim instructed authorities to run the campaign for at least two to three weeks and urged strict implementation. He also observed that vehicles travelling from Lahore to Karachi, in particular, were causing pollution. Officials from the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the Parks and Horticultural Authority (PHA) and other departments also appeared before the court at today’s hearing. However, the judge expressed his displeasure over the absence of a director-level officer from the EPA, as instructed at the previous hearing. Taking exception to pollution caused by vehicles, Justice Karim directed the EPA to display banners across Lahore which warned commuters that smoke-emitting vehicles would be impounded. The EPA official informed the court that such banners had indeed been placed around the city. At this, the judge ordered the agency to depute its officers alongside police personnel at inter-city bus terminals. He also enquired if vehicles travelling through the motorway toll plazas were being inspected and ordered officials to ensure strict checking of vehicles plying GT Road from Lahore to Multan. If the court’s previous orders had been implemented in letter and spirit, Lahore’s condition would have been different, he regretted, directing authorities to “take action against anyone responsible for spreading pollution.” The judge also instructed the Punjab government’s law officer to arrange a joint meeting of the environment department, the chief traffic officer and the transport department. Earlier, the EPA officer informed the court that at least 60 tons of old tyres had been seized from plants in South Punjab and other cities. Over the past few weeks, Lahore has continued to remain high on the list of cities with the most polluted air. Today, it ranked as the fifth worst in the world in terms of poor air quality, according to global monitor IQAir. The city registered an air quality index (AQI) reading of 177, which the monitor considers unhealthy. On Monday, the LHC had expressed its displeasure at the city administration’s lack of action to counter smog and pollution, questioning the use of anti-smog guns and tree cutting in the metropolis. Justice Karim had clarified that the proceedings were not against anyone but meant to guide and assist the government.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan has denounced India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT), saying that such acts set a precedent for “resource-based coercion”. Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative, made the remarks while addressing the UN Security Council (UNSC). According to a press release issued by the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the United Nations (UN), the envoy sounded alarm over the “deliberate weaponisation of shared natural resources”, citing the suspension of the IWT as an example. In his remarks, he warned that the move “should be of grave concern for every member of this council and for the international community as a whole”. “For more than six decades, this treaty has stood as a model of cooperation, ensuring equitable and predictable sharing of the Indus basin’s waters between Pakistan and India even in times of war,” he said. “India’s unlawful unilateral decision to suspend this framework undermines the letter and spirit of this treaty, threatens ecosystems, disrupts data sharing and endangers the lives of millions who depend on the Indus water system for food and energy security for their very survival,” he said. View this post on Instagram The ambassador emphasised that “such acts do not just harm one country … they weaken confidence in international water law and set a precedent for resource-based and driven coercion elsewhere.” The envoy asserted that “Pakistan has consistently maintained that no provision of the IWT permits unilateral suspension or modification”. Reiterating Pakistan’s position on the matter, the ambassador called for “full respect for the treaty and an early return to compliance and normal functioning through the established channels.” According to the press release, Ambassador Asim also highlighted the structural nexus between environment and security and advocated a paradigm shift toward preventive and sustainable peacebuilding. He also urged “concerted international measures to integrate environmental considerations into conflict prevention, peacekeeping, and post-conflict recovery”. He called on the UNSC to “fulfil its charter responsibility to address threats to international peace and security at their very inception”. Ahmad further cautioned that “environmental degradation in conflict is not just collateral damage but also a catalyst for instability.” He reaffirmed Pakistan’s “determination to advance collective action for ecological restoration, strengthen compliance with international law, and transform shared natural resources into instruments of cooperation rather than vectors of division”. Under the 1960 IWT, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty. In April, India held the IWT in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war” . In June, the PCA issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. The court, in its August ruling in the case, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said, adding that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”. Earlier this week, President Asif Ali Zardari said that the violation of the IWT by India could not and would not succeed, and warned against the weaponisation of water.",

      "summary_orig": "BAJAUR: People from various areas in Khar tehsil here on Thursday took to the streets and said their houses shouldn’t be targeted in the ongoing operation against terrorists. The demonstration held in the Kosar area along Bajaur-Peshawar Highway was attended by residents of Lra Banda, Shagi, Kosar, Delhi, Janat Shah, Galo Kass, Gooro and surrounding areas in large numbers. The gathering was joined by several political and social activists, including a delegation of Bajaur Aman Jirga led by its chief Sahibzada Haroon Rashid. The participants, who blocked the highway to vehicular movement by sitting on the road, claimed that a number of civilian houses and mosques in Kosar and its adjacent areas were targeted with heavy weapons last night. The angered protesters asserted that the targeting of civilian houses had not only created fear and panic among the local communities but had also put the lives of their families, mainly children, women and elderly people, in grave danger, as they were living in their houses at the time of the firing. Bajaur Aman Jirga head Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, Nawagai tehsil council chairman and PTI senior leader Dr Khalilur Rehman, ANP general secretary Shah Naseer Khan, party deputy general secretary Sayed Sadiq Akbar Jan, Hazar Hayat and Irshad Khan addressed the demonstration and expressed concerns over the alleged targeting of civilian houses. Calling the attacks on the houses of residents intolerable, the speakers said such an act was not only against the civilians but also a violation of the agreement made by authorities to refrain from targeting the local population in the anti-terrorist operation in the region. “The targeting of the residents’ houses in Kosar and its adjacent areas last night was a clear violation of the agreement made by authorities with them on August 14 before an operation was launched in Mamund tehsil that the civilian population wouldn’t be targeted,” Mr Rashid said. He and other speakers asked authorities to ensure protection of public life and property during the ongoing operation. They said that people across the district wanted an early end to the ongoing unrest and uncertainty in the region. The speakers observed that the prolonged unrest and uncertainty had badly affected the lives of the residents. The demonstration lasted several hours, forcing transporters to use a difficult alternative route. Protesters dispersed peacefully after Sahibzada Rashid informed them that authorities, through the deputy commissioner, had assured the Bajaur Aman Jirga that the civilian population won’t be targeted in the operation.

The “final draft” of this Amendment has hitherto been kept under wraps, but its contours were recently shared by PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari when he said a prime minister-led delegation had sought the PPP’s support for its passage. In a statement, he said the proposal included setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, matters related to the transfer of judges, ending the protection of provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, and amending Article 243, which pertains to the command of the armed forces. While some see it as a continuation of the 26th Amendment, a senior counsel questioned the reason behind such a move at a time when the government had not lost even a single constitutional case in the superior court. “Not a single case pertaining to constitutional interpretations, be it the reserved seat case, judges transfer matter, military courts case, or matters relating to taxes, has ever been lost by the federal government after the passage of the 26th Amen­dment,” remarked the cou­nsel on condition of ano­nymity. Then what is the rationale behind stirring up the controversy at this juncture, he wondered. Except for enhancing the retirement age limit from the existing 65 years, that too of ‘a few friends’, what the proposed constitutional court will be doing when the federal government has not lost a single major case from the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court. The need to establish the Federal Constitutional Court is understandable, had Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah or Justice Munib Akhtar also been included in the CB. But when these judges are not part of the bench, then what is the purpose of establishing this court, he asked. About speculations that the executive magistracy may be restored through the proposed Amendment, the counsel conceded that the judicial magistracy had failed to meet the expectations since it was common knowledge that they never resisted the remand of an accused in important cases. The reverting back to the executive magistracy will effectively be used to control the streets, he said. Regarding the transfer of judges, he said that when the CB through a majority judgement has already empowered the government to transfer any high court to another high court, what more does the government intend to achieve? Inevitable continuation Meanwhile, former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar was of the view that the proposed 27th Amendment was the inevitable continuation of the 26th Amendment. The executive wants to tighten its grip on the judiciary: granting unfettered power to transfer high court judges, a federal constitutional court as the ultimate guardian of the Constitution with its head chairing the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), thus playing a pivotal role in the appointment and ouster of judges and reducing the present Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) to an ineffectual position, he said. The nation must brace itself for a long struggle against praetorian judges, the rollback of the independent judiciary, and the weight of the executive on the scales of justice, he feared. According to former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Muhammad Akram Sheikh, the result of the general election on Feb 8, 2024, stunned the electors, monitoring agencies and the media beyond reproach. The ruling elite then impose ‘PCO’ by giving an oath to willing judges while relieving others and thus nailing down the entire superior court. The regime inflicted unprecedented harm on the most paramount state organ of an independent judiciary, Akram Sheikh regretted, adding that the ruling elite decided to punish the Supreme Court in a manner not ever thought about by the respective military regimes. Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, considered to be one of the architects of the 18th Amendment, feared that in the brittle political situation prevalent in the country, the proposed tweaks would cast a shadow over the federation that may also help regain an extra nationalist narrative. The proposed Amendment that deals with the question of bringing changes to the removal of protection for the share of provinces in the divisible pool through the National Finance Commission (NFC), as well as restoring the devolved ministries back to the federal government, amounts to the rollback of the 18th Amendment. In Jan 2015, Mr Rabbani regretted after a vote on the 21st Amendment, which provided for military courts to try terrorists, stating he was ashamed of voting for the bill, although he did so in line with his party’s discipline.

      "summary_orig": "• Islamabad says demands ‘non-negotiable’ as third round opens in Istanbul • Taliban leader asks Afghan team to only make ‘realistic’ commitments • Flare-up at Chaman-Spin Boldak looms over talks; at least two killed ISLAMABAD: The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks opened in Istanbul on Thursday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested a shaky ceasefire . Mediated by Turkiye and Qatar and held at the Conrad Hotel with restricted media access, the two-day round is focused on finalising a framework for a “monitoring and verification mechanism” agreed in principle last week, and on addressing long-standing disputes linked to militant sanctuaries inside Afghanistan. Pakistan’s delegation is led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik and includes senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials. The Afghan Taliban side is headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and includes senior figures such as Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib. The current dialogue process began after deadly clashes along the border last month — the worst since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul. Pakistan accused the Taliban of harbouring militants from Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), responsible for a series of cross-border attacks. The Taliban denied the accusations and accused Islamabad of airstrikes inside Afghan territory. A ceasefire was brokered in Doha on Oct 19 through Qatari mediation, followed by two rounds of talks in Istanbul. Before formal discussions resumed in Istanbul for the third round, Turkish and Qatari intelligence officials held separate consultations with both sides. The talks later continued in both direct and indirect formats. A Pakistani official familiar with the delegation’s position said Islamabad’s demands remain “non-negotiable”. “Pakistan’s position is clear,” the official said. “Our position is based on ground realities and solid information. We are seeking a verification mechanism to ensure that commitments made by Taliban representatives are kept. This includes the handover of all TTP leadership currently sheltered in Afghanistan.” He added that the Pakistani delegation had proposed neutral, third-party observers to look into the presence of “terrorist groups” in Afghanistan and the action that is taken against them to prevent them from carrying out attacks in Pakistan. “We have credible information that the (Afghan) Taliban regime is relocating TTP fighters within urban civilian populations,” he said. “This is a tactic designed to falsely portray any necessary action by Pakistan against TTP terrorists as an attack on civilians.” According to Afghan sources, the Taliban delegation came to Istanbul with specific instructions from their leader, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada. The Taliban chief reportedly told his negotiators to make only those commitments that could be realistically fulfilled and warned them against yielding to Pakistani demands. Exchange of fire Expectations for the Istanbul round were already modest, given the deep mistrust between the two sides and the little progress made in the previous two rounds. The situation worsened briefly on Thursday afternoon after two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing, threatening to derail the fragile dialogue. Both sides accused the other of initiating the gunfire, though no casualties were reported. The incident, which lasted for a short time, came just hours after the opening session of talks in Istanbul. “Afghan forces opened fire at Tasadaq and Iqbal Posts located along the Chaman border around 5pm, and Pakistani troops immediately retaliated and returned fire,” an official told Dawn . He said the mortars landed in the Vesh Mandi area. However, he said it was a brief exchange of fire and no loss of life or property was reported. An Afghan official in Spin Boldak told Chaman-based journalists that the incident was a result of a misunderstanding arising from celebratory fire at a marriage ceremony. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, however, disputed the account, accusing Pakistani forces of violating the truce. “While the third round of negotiations with the Pakistani side had begun in Istanbul, unfortunately, this afternoon Pakistani forces once again opened fire on Spin Boldak, causing concern among the local population,” he said in a statement. “The Islamic emirate’s forces, out of respect for the negotiation team and to prevent civilian casualties, have so far shown no reaction.” However, Pakistan rejected Mr Mujahid’s claim as “baseless”. “We strongly reject claims circulated by the Afghan side regarding today’s incident at the Pak-Afghan border at Chaman,” the Information Ministry said. “Firing was initiated from the Afghan side, to which our security forces responded immediately in a measured and responsible manner.” It added that the situation was brought under control, and the ceasefire remains intact.
