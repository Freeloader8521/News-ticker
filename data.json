In late July, it began allowing a small trickle of aid to resume , following warnings of a wave of starvation . But the aid was too little and too late to reverse the damage already done; the UN officially declared a famine in Gaza City in August. As today marks another year of the world witnessing piled up bodies in shrouds, spilt blood, shredded body parts, hungry cries for food and buildings reduced to rubble in Gaza, we take a look at some pictures that are an incriminating statement of Israel’s multiple war crimes in the enclave.

This is a clear announcement from our end, if there is any such plan and action is taken on it, then our response will be that of an honourable people.” A day ago, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum had aired similar misgivings, saying there were plans to shift him from Adiala Jail to another facility and keep him in complete isolation. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady.

      "summary_orig": "Still searching for a sense of direction in the ICC Women’s World Cup, Pakistan will take on a rampant Australian side at the R. Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday, hoping to spark a turnaround against the tournament’s most complete outfit. Fatima Sana’s charges have endured a tough start to their campaign, slumping to heavy defeats against Bangladesh and India . Their batting has wavered, their bowling has lacked consistency, and their fielding has been short of international standard — a combination that has left them bottom of the eight-team table with little margin for error. But ahead of their clash with the defending champions, Pakistan’s senior batter Sidra Amin struck a note of quiet defiance. “I think tomorrow is a big game for us as a team,” she said at the pre-match press conference on Tuesday. “We are a good batting side, but as batters, we have to spend more time on the wicket so that we can execute our plans and assess the conditions really well.” Sidra, one of the few bright spots in Pakistan’s otherwise bleak campaign, scored a fighting half-century against India and has been a steadying presence at the top of the order. She admitted that the team’s batting collapses have often been self-inflicted. “If we look at the bigger picture, we’ve been leaving around five to seven overs — that’s about 42 balls,” she pointed out. “If we tackle things this way, the number of dot balls and the pressure will reduce. As batters, we need to take more responsibility, stay longer on the wicket, and play the maximum number of overs.” Pakistan’s inability to post a competitive total has been their undoing in both matches so far. They mustered only 160 against Bangladesh and folded for 180 against India, failing to bat their full quota of overs on both occasions. With middle-order batters struggling for fluency and the lower order offering little resistance, the team’s overreliance on Sidra, Fatima, and Muneeba Ali has become glaring. Even their bowling, traditionally Pakistan’s strength, has been inconsistent. The new-ball pairing of Fatima and Diana Baig has lacked rhythm, and the spinners have struggled for control in conditions that should ideally suit them. Pakistan conceded 18 extras against Bangladesh — a reflection of their discipline woes — though Diana’s four-wicket haul against India hinted at some improvement. “The discussions are ongoing,” Sidra said when asked about the team’s approach. “Our coach has guided us individually. He can tell us what to do, but as players, how we tackle things is what matters. Everyone knows our team is strong in bowling, and our spinners and attacking bowlers could cause problems for two or three of their batters — that might help us in this game.” However, even familiarity with the conditions — with Pakistan playing all their matches in Colombo — may not suffice against an Australian side that has looked a cut above. “Yes, we have an edge in that sense,” Sidra admitted. “But how the team uses that edge is very important. They’re a very well-prepared side. I heard that when they’re training for Asian conditions, they even set up indoor facilities at 35–40 degrees to simulate the heat. That’s the kind of preparation they do.” Australia, led by Alyssa Healy, enter the contest as firm favourites. Their campaign so far has been near-flawless, marked by powerful batting displays and disciplined bowling. They remain the only team to have posted a 300-plus total in the tournament — a feat they achieved in their commanding 89-run win over New Zealand in Indore, where Ashleigh Gardner’s century proved decisive. While some of their big names, including Healy and Beth Mooney, have yet to hit full stride, Australia’s depth has made them nearly invincible. The pace of Annabel Sutherland and the guile of Sophie Molineux have been particularly effective on subcontinental surfaces, while the side’s balance allows them to dominate in all phases of the game. Their only setback came off the field when their previous match against Sri Lanka was washed out, denying them the chance to go top of the standings. Yet, if anything, the break has left them fresher and more focused. All-rounder Ellyse Perry, speaking to reporters on the eve of the match, acknowledged both the challenge and respect her side have for their opponents. “Oh, yeah, [Fatima Sana] is an amazing player,” Perry said. “A real talisman, I think, for the Pakistan team. She plays with so much passion and energy — she’s incredibly talented, too. It’s always nice when we get a chance to play against her.” On the conditions, Perry added: “We obviously got to have a bit of a look at the conditions the other night with the India-Pakistan match. Probably hasn’t changed too much to how we were thinking the other day when we were hoping to play. But we’ve had a chance to prepare pretty well.”",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Tuesday sought regional countries’ cooperation to counter threats emerging from Afghanistan during the Moscow Format Consultations held in the Russian capital on Tuesday. Pakistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq addressed the moot, which was also attended by Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. The consultations, held at the level of special representatives and senior officials of Afghanistan, were attended by India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. For the first time, the Afghan delegation participated in the meeting as a member. Russia became the first country to recognise the Taliban government in July this year. A delegation from Belarus also attended the meeting as guests. “I spoke about the urgent need for collective regional efforts to effectively counter terrorism and dismantle all terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil,” Ambassador Sadiq told the 7th meeting of the Moscow Format. Sadiq said he also highlighted the importance of strengthening regional cooperation in political and economic fields, along with enhanced counter-terrorism and anti-drug collaboration. Pakistan has long been pressing the Taliban rulers to take action against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other Pakistani militant groups in view of the increase in violence after the [Taliban’s takeover][2] of Afghanistan in 2021. The Taliban government insists it does not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against Pakistan. “Continued dialogue, cooperation, and coordinated actions remain essential to address these challenges and support lasting peace in the region,” he said. The special representative also reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to a peaceful, stable, and secure Afghanistan.” In a joint statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting, the participants emphasised that Afghanistan should be supported to undertake comprehensive measures aimed at the elimination of terrorism and its eradication so that the country’s soil is not used as a threat to the security of neighboring countries and beyond. “The parties underscored that terrorism constitutes a serious threat to the security of Afghanistan, the region and the wider world,” according to the statement, also issued by the Russian embassy in Islamabad. The parties, in a veiled reference to the US and its NATO allies, also urged the countries mainly responsible for the current predicament in Afghanistan to earnestly fulfill commitments on the economic recovery and future development of the country. The parties called for strengthening counter-terrorism cooperation at both bilateral and multilateral levels. Attempts by other countries to deploy their military infrastructure in the landlocked nation were called unacceptable as this does not serve the interests of regional peace and stability. The statement did not name any country, but the statement came in the wake of repeated statements by President Donald Trump regarding Bagram air base, which was central to the US military operations in Afghanistan for 20 years. The Taliban have rejected Trump’s calls for handing over the strategic airbase. The parties reaffirmed their unwavering support for the establishment of Afghanistan as an independent, united and peaceful state. The parties further noted the need for the development of economic and trade exchanges, investment cooperation of Afghanistan with regional countries and the international community. They expressed their interest in developing regional economic projects with Afghan participation and promoting steady progress in fields such as healthcare, poverty alleviation, agriculture and disaster prevention. The participants also supported the active integration of Afghanistan into the system of regional connectivity. The parties reiterated their commitment to continue humanitarian support to the Afghan people, and called on the international community to intensify the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, while simultaneously reaffirming opposition to the attempts of politicising it. Sadiq meets Muttaqi on sidelines On the sidelines of the moot, the Pakistani envoy met his Afghan counterpart. The 90-minute long meeting focused on advancing bilateral cooperation in key areas of mutual interest, including economic cooperation, trade, transit, and regional security. Sadiq, in a post on X, said Islamabad and Kabul “reaffirmed the importance of enhancing regional connectivity and agreed to explore practical measures to facilitate trade and transit, particularly through streamlined customs procedures and improved infrastructure links”. He elaborated that emphasis was also placed on unlocking the potential of trade corridors in the region to further benefit the region’s development and economy. Earlier, in a post on X, Sadiq Khan detailed the discussions that took place during the Quadrilateral Meeting of Special Representatives for Afghanistan, saying, “The participating states unanimously reaffirmed their steadfast commitment to a stable, sovereign, and peaceful Afghanistan, underscoring the necessity of a country free from the scourge of terrorism and external intervention.” Voicing their concerns over the terrorist groups present in Afghanistan, the envoy went on to say that the participating countries agreed on “enhanced coordination and collaborative action” to fight against terrorism in the region. Separately, Khan, in different meetings with his Chinese and Iranian counterparts, discussed regional security, counterterrorism cooperation, as well as humanitarian concerns in Afghanistan. With his Iranian counterpart Muhammad Reza Bahrami, Khan held “ in-depth discussions on the latest developments in Afghanistan“, particularly terrorism, as per a statement posted on his X. “Both sides emphasised the importance of continued dialogue and coordination to address common challenges,” he added. Meanwhile, in a meeting with China’s Yue Xiaoyong, both countries underscored the “importance of a coordinated approach to promote lasting peace and stability in the region,” as per a statement posted on his X. “The meeting underscored the strong partnership between Pakistan and China in addressing shared challenges and advancing regional development,” he added. The envoy also held discussions with his Russian counterpart, Zamir Kabulov, focusing on measures to promote regional cooperation in Afghanistan. Russian FM receives Muttaqi Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and discussed the further strengthening of political relations between the two countries, the development of economic cooperation, and regional issues in a comprehensive manner, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said. The Afghan Foreign Minister thanked the Russian Federation for its decision to officially recognise the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, describing it as a significant and historic development in the trajectory of bilateral relations. He stated that the announcement of recognition has not only opened new doors for political and economic cooperation. He said the decision is also considered an important step towards Afghanistan’s active role in the international community. The statement said the minister also emphasised the importance of mutual cooperation in the areas of combating narcotics, regional economic projects, and transportation corridors. On his part, the Russian Foreign Minister stated that the recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has created unprecedented opportunities in political, economic and international cooperation between the two countries, and “we will witness its positive results in the near future,” the Afghan statement said. Mr Lavrov also discussed the prevention of drug trafficking, strengthening security and other areas and praised the efforts of the Islamic Emirate in this regard and emphasised that besides strengthening bilateral relations, effective use should also be made of regional mechanisms like the Moscow Format. He commended the achievements and independent stance of the Islamic Emirate, considering them beneficial for the region, according to the statement.",

Attempts by other countries to deploy their military infrastructure in the landlocked nation were called unacceptable as this does not serve the interests of regional peace and stability. The statement did not name any country, but the statement came in the wake of repeated statements by President Donald Trump regarding Bagram air base, which was central to the US military operations in Afghanistan for 20 years. The Taliban have rejected Trump’s calls for handing over the strategic airbase. The parties reaffirmed their unwavering support for the establishment of Afghanistan as an independent, united and peaceful state. The parties further noted the need for the development of economic and trade exchanges, investment cooperation of Afghanistan with regional countries and the international community. They expressed their interest in developing regional economic projects with Afghan participation and promoting steady progress in fields such as healthcare, poverty alleviation, agriculture and disaster prevention. The participants also supported the active integration of Afghanistan into the system of regional connectivity. The parties reiterated their commitment to continue humanitarian support to the Afghan people, and called on the international community to intensify the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, while simultaneously reaffirming opposition to the attempts of politicising it. Sadiq meets Muttaqi on sidelines On the sidelines of the moot, the Pakistani envoy met his Afghan counterpart. The 90-minute long meeting focused on advancing bilateral cooperation in key areas of mutual interest, including economic cooperation, trade, transit, and regional security. Sadiq, in a post on X, said Islamabad and Kabul “reaffirmed the importance of enhancing regional connectivity and agreed to explore practical measures to facilitate trade and transit, particularly through streamlined customs procedures and improved infrastructure links”. He elaborated that emphasis was also placed on unlocking the potential of trade corridors in the region to further benefit the region’s development and economy. Earlier, in a post on X, Sadiq Khan detailed the discussions that took place during the Quadrilateral Meeting of Special Representatives for Afghanistan, saying, “The participating states unanimously reaffirmed their steadfast commitment to a stable, sovereign, and peaceful Afghanistan, underscoring the necessity of a country free from the scourge of terrorism and external intervention.” Voicing their concerns over the terrorist groups present in Afghanistan, the envoy went on to say that the participating countries agreed on “enhanced coordination and collaborative action” to fight against terrorism in the region. Separately, Khan, in different meetings with his Chinese and Iranian counterparts, discussed regional security, counterterrorism cooperation, as well as humanitarian concerns in Afghanistan. With his Iranian counterpart Muhammad Reza Bahrami, Khan held “ in-depth discussions on the latest developments in Afghanistan“, particularly terrorism, as per a statement posted on his X. “Both sides emphasised the importance of continued dialogue and coordination to address common challenges,” he added. Meanwhile, in a meeting with China’s Yue Xiaoyong, both countries underscored the “importance of a coordinated approach to promote lasting peace and stability in the region,” as per a statement posted on his X. “The meeting underscored the strong partnership between Pakistan and China in addressing shared challenges and advancing regional development,” he added. The envoy also held discussions with his Russian counterpart, Zamir Kabulov, focusing on measures to promote regional cooperation in Afghanistan. Russian FM receives Muttaqi Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and discussed the further strengthening of political relations between the two countries, the development of economic cooperation, and regional issues in a comprehensive manner, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said. The Afghan Foreign Minister thanked the Russian Federation for its decision to officially recognise the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, describing it as a significant and historic development in the trajectory of bilateral relations. He stated that the announcement of recognition has not only opened new doors for political and economic cooperation. He said the decision is also considered an important step towards Afghanistan’s active role in the international community. The statement said the minister also emphasised the importance of mutual cooperation in the areas of combating narcotics, regional economic projects, and transportation corridors. On his part, the Russian Foreign Minister stated that the recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has created unprecedented opportunities in political, economic and international cooperation between the two countries, and “we will witness its positive results in the near future,” the Afghan statement said. Mr Lavrov also discussed the prevention of drug trafficking, strengthening security and other areas and praised the efforts of the Islamic Emirate in this regard and emphasised that besides strengthening bilateral relations, effective use should also be made of regional mechanisms like the Moscow Format. He commended the achievements and independent stance of the Islamic Emirate, considering them beneficial for the region, according to the statement.",

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Tuesday that former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had arrived at the Pakistan embassy in Amman, Jordan and was in “good health and high spirits”, adding that he would return on October 9. Ahmad led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. In a post on social media platform X, Dar said, “I am pleased to confirm that former senator Mushtaq has been released and is now safely with [the] Pakistan embassy in Amman. He is in good health and high spirits.” He said that the embassy stood ready to facilitate his return to Pakistan at his wish. “[I] am pleased to extend our gratitude to all our friendly countries who actively engaged and assisted in this behalf,” he said. In a post later in the day, Dar said he spoke to Ahmad on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan Embassy. “Arrangement has been by the Pakistan Foreign Office for return of senator Mushtaq to Pakistan on October 9.” Meanwhile, Ahmad also posted a video on his X account in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted. He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention. On Sunday, the Foreign Office (FO) said it was actively engaged with international partners to ensure the “safety and prompt repatriation“ of Pakistanis detained by Israel. With regards to Ahmad, it had stated: “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.” On Monday, FO reiterated that it was making efforts for the safe return of the former senator. “With the invaluable assistance of the Jordanian government, we are hopeful that the process can be successfully concluded within the next couple of days,” the FO had said. It had also expressed deep gratitude to the “brotherly” government of Jordan for “their exemplary cooperation and generous support”. Pakistan and several other countries had condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the GSF. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also called for the release of those detained by Israel. On Oct 3, he had assured JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman during a telephone conversation that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including Ahmad.",

However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. In a post on social media platform X, Dar said, “I am pleased to confirm that former senator Mushtaq has been released and is now safely with [the] Pakistan embassy in Amman. He is in good health and high spirits.” He said that the embassy stood ready to facilitate his return to Pakistan at his wish. “[I] am pleased to extend our gratitude to all our friendly countries who actively engaged and assisted in this behalf,” he said. In a post later in the day, Dar said he spoke to Ahmad on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan Embassy. “Arrangement has been by the Pakistan Foreign Office for return of senator Mushtaq to Pakistan on October 9.” Meanwhile, Ahmad also posted a video on his X account in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted. He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention. On Sunday, the Foreign Office (FO) said it was actively engaged with international partners to ensure the “safety and prompt repatriation“ of Pakistanis detained by Israel. With regards to Ahmad, it had stated: “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.” On Monday, FO reiterated that it was making efforts for the safe return of the former senator. “With the invaluable assistance of the Jordanian government, we are hopeful that the process can be successfully concluded within the next couple of days,” the FO had said. It had also expressed deep gratitude to the “brotherly” government of Jordan for “their exemplary cooperation and generous support”. Pakistan and several other countries had condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the GSF. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also called for the release of those detained by Israel. On Oct 3, he had assured JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman during a telephone conversation that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including Ahmad.",

Per the police, the teachers were “abducted” from GHS Zindi Musa Khan in Bannu’s Mandati Naika Zyarat area, which falls within the limits of Hoid police station. “The first incident occurred within the limits of Hoid police station, which is under threat of militants,” District Police Officer (DPO) of Bannu Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com . “In the past few months, the police station in Hoid has been attacked several times by militants.” DPO Kulachi added that unknown armed men had taken the school teachers to unidentified locations. Among the abductees were the headmaster of the school, who was a resident of Nekam Kaki, as well as a senior school teacher, who was a resident of Bannu, Bannu police spokesperson Kashif Nawaz told Dawn.com . Nawaz added that both teachers were abducted by the militants when they were returning from the school. “A search operation is being conducted in the area to get the abductees released from the terrorists,” he added.

      "title_orig": "Sherry Rehman warns PML-N of trouble in Senate without PPP’s ‘clear support’",
      "summary_orig": "The continuing row between the PPP and PML-N escalated on Tuesday as PPP’s Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman warned the coalition ally of difficulties in the Senate without the former’s “clear support”. The PPP and the PML-N’s Punjab leadership have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues ranging from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government. Talking about the matter in an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’, the PPP senior vice president said: “If you want to tear apart the whole coalition then I’ve already said in the National Assembly that don’t take our inclusion on the treasury benches for granted and don’t think that we will keep you stable no matter what you do.” “If you don’t need [us] then that’s your choice, but let me remind you we are the biggest party in the Senate and it will become very difficult for you without the PPP’s clear support.” “Forgiveness and apology are one thing, but won’t my feelings and those of every supporter be hurt when you make the top leadership, our chairman and his sister, the targets of unreasonable criticism,” she said further. “What coalition is this and where do you want to take it? What are the aims? Such questions will arise then.” The senior PPP leader added that the issue was not one between Sindh and Punjab but of the federation and the people, saying that 6.5 million people were affected by the recent floods. Rehman criticised how the PPP’s suggestion of providing aid to flood victims through the Benazir Income Support Programme was turned into an issue of a conflict between Sindh and Punjab. “How is it an issue of Sindh and Punjab? Are the rest of the people not Pakistani? We are a federal party and have voters in Punjab, so what do you mean?” She also lashed out at the criticism and allegations launched at PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for his performance as foreign minister, saying that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif himself had recognised and lauded his work from beginning to end. “The question then arises, who are you actually weakening?” Rehman also pointed out Bilawal’s recent appointment as the head of the delegation presenting Pakistan’s stance before the world in the aftermath of the May conflict with India. Questioned about the PPP sitting on the opposition benches, Rehman said the issue would be decided by the central executive committee since it was not a small decision to take and the party did not want to destabilise the government. When asked whether the party would no longer be part of any legislative process, the PPP leader maintained that the coalition partner should not “expect of us to come and manage your houses and promote your business”. ‘You will need Bilawal, Zardari again’ PPP Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan, addressing the media earlier, warned PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz that her party will need “Bilawal and Asif Zardari again” in the future. “Remember that you will again need Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, you will again need Asif Ali Zardari, and that time is not far off.” Taking another dig at Punjab’s chief minister, the PPP senator said people’s hearts are not won by “putting up posters or banners, or doing publicity on TikTok”. She added that performance matters, and not publicity. Palwasha said that to win the hearts of the people, pictures are not required; performance is. She further said the PPP will continue to offer suggestions for better governance and will continue asking questions as the coalition partner. “Punjab is for the whole of Pakistan, and Punjab has not been conquered. Do not try to become a martial-law dictator there.” added that PPP leader. Maryam defends her focus on Punjab Separately, addressing a ceremony in Lahore, Maryam deflected PPP’s criticism and said she would continue to talk about Punjab as she was the chief minister of the province. “If Maryam Nawaz Sharif does not speak about Punjab, then who else will speak for Punjab?” She further said that she wants other provinces to be as “clean and developed as Punjab”, making a veiled reference to PPP’s governance in Sindh. The chief minister added that progress and prosperity were the right of every citizen and “one should not have to beg for it”. ‘Will support no-confidence’ PTI leader and former speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser clarified that he mentioned a no-confidence motion to the PPP “if they are serious”. “The Pakistan Peoples Party walked out of the National Assembly session to express their reservations,“ said Qaiser, adding that the situation would become clear if the PPP can actually initiate the no-confidence move or if it was merely “friendly fire”. “If a no-confidence motion is brought, PTI will support it,” he said. “We want to rid the people of this illegitimate government, which is a product of Form-47,“ maintained the former speaker. Qaiser further said that the PTI believes that as long as the incumbent government remains in power, “neither human rights, nor the law, nor the judiciary in Pakistan will be safe”. He said, therefore, it is necessary to establish a strong democratic system in the country “so that democracy can flourish, the rule of law can prevail, and the supremacy of the Constitution can be maintained”. ‘PPP should not lecture PML-N on democracy’ Punjab Information and Culture Minister Azma Bokhari , reacting to statements from PPP leaders, said earlier today that “on one hand, they talk about a ceasefire, and on the other hand, they come out every hour for aerial firing”. She added that such dual signaling from the PPP does not send a serious message of reconciliation and further stated that the coalition partner’s current behaviour does not display political maturity. Bokhari stressed that PPP leaders should not lecture the PML-N on democracy. “They have never carried the burden of democracy on their fragile shoulders; this burden has been carried by our leadership and workers for years.” “It is the magnanimity of our party and our leadership that, despite personal attacks, we continue to show patience and restraint.” “It is the high character of our party and our leadership that, despite personal attacks, we continue to show silence and patience,“ she added. The provincial minister maintained that the PML-N does not want to turn political differences into a confrontation, but “continued silence in the face of one-sided attacks is not possible”.",

      "summary_orig": "The National Press Club on Tuesday submitted its charter of demands to the interior ministry following the recent police operation in which uniformed personnel forcibly entered the club premises. The incident occurred during a protest by journalists and demonstrators from Azad Jammu and Kashmir, some of whom were reportedly fleeing from police action when officers stormed into the club. A joint action committee (JAC) was subsequently formed with all key media associations and various factions of the NPC. A press release issued today from the NPC said the JAC held a meeting a day earlier in which the charter was finalised and the same was submitted today in a meeting with Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudry, who was also briefed on the demands. “Strict legal action should be taken against those responsible for the attack on the NPC and they should be punished accordingly. A high-level inquiry committee should be immediately established to determine those responsible for the attack, consisting of journalists nominated by the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Information and the NPC. “The inquiry committee should determine the losses of reporters, video journalists and photographers who were victims of the violence by Islamabad police personnel and ensure redress. After receiving the Charter of Demand from the NPC JAC, the Ministry of Interior should issue a notification of the inquiry committee within 24 hours and submit a report within four days,” the press release said. It added that press clubs and journalistic organisations were the main centres of freedom of expression and it had become imperative to ensure their security and sanctity after last week’s incident. The NPC said it was necessary to establish a committee under the interior minister’s chairmanship, comprising the information ministers and secretaries of all four provinces, AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan, the presidents of the press clubs of the federal capital and provincial capitals, to address such incidents. It added that the interior ministry should issue a formal notification for the above committee to ensure the safety, sanctity and security of press clubs, relevant unions and their members instead of verbal assurances. The JAC also pointed out that the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act included several provisions for the safety and security of those in the industry, but a commission for the said purpose could still not be established after four years, because of which no journalist or media worker could secure any relief. It called for the act to be reactivated, for the commission to be completed within two weeks and for the protection of all press clubs to be ensured as per the act’s terms of reference. “Due to which no journalist or media worker has been able to get relief yet, therefore, the said Act should be activated within 2 weeks by taking a positive action. The TORs of this act should also ensure the protection of all press clubs.” The press release said Chaudhry assured the JAC of securing approval for the demands after contacting the Senate chairman, National Assembly speaker, the federal interior and information ministers and the provincial home and information ministers. It added that Chaudhry said the security of press clubs across the country would be ensured in light of the charter. The state minister further stated that the prime minister and interior and information ministers also expressed serious concern over the incident, ordered a full investigation and issued instructions that immediate steps should be taken to avoid any such condemnable incident in the future. Chaudhry said that steps would be taken so that the police would seek formal permission from the administration before entering any press club.",

Since DawnRelief’s inception in 2005, we have provided support and rehabilitation to communities impacted the most by such crises. For two decades, this has remained our unwavering manifesto. 2005 - 2021 — Earthquake in Azad Kashmir DawnRelief was established by DawnMedia in October 2005 as a direct response to the devastating earthquake that struck Azad Kashmir and other parts of northern Pakistan. We established four tent villages in Hattian Bala Tehsil, District Muzaffarabad, where we supported over 8,500 men, women and children for nearly a year. After that, we constructed 166 homes and eight schools. In 2021, we constructed the Haji Sir Abdullah Haroon Government High School Auditorium, which can accommodate over 200 people and also serves as a community hall. 2008 — Earthquake in Balochistan Provided tents, bedding, blankets, food and jackets to affected people in Ziarat District. 2009 — The humanitarian crisis in Swat Set up a camp in Mardan and provided 3,953 internally displaced people with shelter, food and basic living amenities for four months. 2010 and 2011 — Flood in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh Established relief camps in Badin, Hyderabad, Nowshera, Sehwan and Thatta and supported over 34,000 people. We then constructed nearly 1,000 homes and two schools. 2015 — Earthquake in Chitral Supported 800 people in Churan Oveer for nearly a year; later constructed 90 homes and a 1,000-metre water pipeline. 2020 — Covid-19 lockdown in Karachi Provided food rations to nearly 4,000 families living in Baldia-Orangi Township for three months, a population identified as Karachi’s poorest one per cent. We then extended our efforts to people living in Gharibabad who were made homeless due to the Karachi Circular Railway project, as well as to people living in Afghan Khaima Basti. 2022-2024 — Devastating floods across Pakistan Initially distributed relief goods to flood survivors in Balochistan, the Kaghan Valley (where we also constructed a cable trolley system), and southern Sindh. In 2023, we built 150 homes in Bajara, Sehwan, with the help of our donor partners, and another 50 homes in Jhankara with funds from DawnRelief. In 2024, we built a girls’ school in Abdur Rehman Mallah Goth. Projects completed this year: Provided portable solar charging kits to flood survivors in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . With support from HIVE Pakistan, we distributed 300 solar kits that enabled survivors in Buner and Swat to charge devices such as torches and mobile phones. Revived the Sadpara powerhouse in Skardu . Assisted in restoring a defunct powerhouse that now supplies sustainable energy to three villages. We are expanding the scope of our efforts across Pakistan. But we cannot do this alone.

This fresh integration is now live in English across 145 countries on ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro accounts, on both web and mobile (iOS and Android), allowing free and premium Spotify users to discover and enjoy music through conversation, a press release from the company said. “Spotify users can now connect their accounts to ChatGPT and get tailored recommendations, request playlists by mood, genre, or artist, and tap to listen directly in the Spotify app,” the release added. “Already available across more than 2,000 devices, including cars, TVs, and smart home systems, Spotify has always aimed to be everywhere you listen and watch.” The company said the integration will make music discovery part of everyday conversations, helping users find new songs or revisit old favourites through simple prompts. It added that the feature also offers artists another way to reach listeners. “Spotify’s vision has always been to be everywhere you are,” noted Sten Garmark, SVP, Global Head of Consumer Experience. “By bringing Spotify into ChatGPT, we’re creating a powerful new way for fans to connect with the artists and creators they love conversationally, whenever inspiration strikes,” he added. According to the release, artists’ and creators’ work will remain protected throughout the experience. “Spotify will not share any music, podcasts, or other audio or video content from its platform with OpenAI for training purposes.” Spotify officially launched in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka on February 23, 2021.",

Hunter McGovern from Doctors Without Borders left when the NGO was forced to abandon its work due to the encroaching Israeli forces. He says there was an \"absolute breakdown\" as they pulled out, and that for the people who live there, no 10 minutes went by without the noise of either the destruction of buildings or drone strikes.

      "summary_orig": "Russia said on Tuesday it was waiting for clarity from the United States about the possible supply of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying such weapons could theoretically carry nuclear warheads. US President Donald Trump said on Monday he would want to know what Ukraine planned to do with Tomahawks before agreeing to provide them because he did not want to escalate the war between Russia and Ukraine. He said, however, that he had “sort of made a decision” on the matter. Asked about the comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “We understand that we need to wait, probably, for clearer statements, if any come.” Peskov said that under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, US practice had been to announce supplies of new weapons only once they had been delivered to Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in comments published on Sunday that if Washington supplied Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for long-range strikes deep into Russia, it would lead to the destruction of Moscow’s relationship with the US. Peskov said it was important to realise that “if we abstract from various nuances, we’re talking about missiles that could also be nuclear-capable. Therefore, this is truly a serious round of escalation.” Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 kilometres, so Ukraine would be able to use them to strike targets anywhere in European Russia, including Moscow, if Trump gave the go-ahead to supply them.",

      "title": "Russia says it awaits clarity on possible US supply of Tomahawks to Ukraine",
      "summary": "Russia said on Tuesday it was waiting for clarity from the United States about the possible supply of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying such weapons could theoretically carry nuclear warheads. US President Donald Trump said on Monday he would want to know what Ukraine planned to do with Tomahawks before agreeing to provide them because he did not want to escalate the war between Russia and Ukraine. He said, however, that he had “sort of made a decision” on the matter. Asked about the comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “We understand that we need to wait, probably, for clearer statements, if any come.” Peskov said that under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, US practice had been to announce supplies of new weapons only once they had been delivered to Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in comments published on Sunday that if Washington supplied Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for long-range strikes deep into Russia, it would lead to the destruction of Moscow’s relationship with the US. Peskov said it was important to realise that “if we abstract from various nuances, we’re talking about missiles that could also be nuclear-capable. Therefore, this is truly a serious round of escalation.” Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 kilometres, so Ukraine would be able to use them to strike targets anywhere in European Russia, including Moscow, if Trump gave the go-ahead to supply them.",

      "summary_orig": "Britain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), said on Tuesday some factories would restart manufacturing on Wednesday after an almost six-week shutdown following a cyberattack, one of the country’s most disruptive hacks. To try to help smaller parts suppliers who have been pushed to the brink after weeks without business, JLR also announced it would be providing some companies with up-front cash for parts during the production restart phase. The luxury carmaker, owned by India’s Tata Motors TAMO.NS, has three factories in Britain, which together produce about 1,000 cars per day, and economists had warned of the impact of a prolonged shutdown on the country’s manufacturing output. High-profile hacks JLR was the latest high-profile cyberattack target in Britain this year, and comes after one of the country’s major retailers, Marks & Spencer (MKS.L), lost about 300 million pounds (about $400 million) after a breach forced it to shut down its online shop for two months. The incidents highlight the vulnerability of global business to increasingly sophisticated and more frequent attacks. Last month, a ransomware attack on check-in services left passengers stranded across major European airports. JLR, which analysts estimated was losing around 50 million pounds per week from the shutdown, was provided with a 1.5 billion pound loan guarantee by the British government in late September to help it support its suppliers. Business minister Peter Kyle said in a statement on Tuesday that his focus was on helping JLR resolve the incident and supporting the long-term health of the auto supply chain, which supports over 180,000 manufacturing jobs. “This is very welcome news for workers and suppliers, but I know many are still under pressure, particularly further down the supply chain,” he said. Phased restart JLR said in a separate statement on Tuesday that for the three months to September 30, wholesale and retail volumes dropped 24.2% and 17.1%, respectively, reflecting the impact of the production stoppage, plus the planned wind-down of legacy Jaguar models and the effect of U.S. tariffs. “It has been a challenging quarter for JLR,” JLR CEO Adrian Mardell said in a statement. JLR said its engines and battery units would restart work on Wednesday, as well as parts of its vehicle production plant, including its body and paint shops, meaning the return of some of its 33,000 staff to work. Production lines for the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport vehicles at its main factory in Solihull will start later this week, the company added. Qualifying suppliers of parts used in the company’s just-in-time production lines will now be paid shortly after the point of order, JLR said, compared to a previous 60-day post-invoice arrangement, helping to allay fears that some smaller businesses could go bust.",

      "summary_orig": "“This is not just a sea journey, it’s not an adventure, but rather it is a task that is extremely dangerous,” said former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan in an interview with Dawn.com just before he embarked on the Global Sumud Flotilla mission to Gaza. The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), with around 500 participants from over 44 countries, including Pakistan, attempted to break Israel’s siege on Gaza and distribute humanitarian aid to the malnourished and injured civilians suffering from two years of genocide in the enclave at the hands of Israel. Former senator Khan’s words rang true from the very beginning of the mission, when two GSF aid boats were struck by incendiary devices in Tunisian waters. The ‘Family’ and ‘Alma’ boats, which held the steering committee of the aid convoy, were attacked on September 8 and 9. The aid boats were attacked once again on September 23 near Crete; this time, there was international condemnation, with Italy, Spain and Turkiye dispatching warships to aid the boats. The attack damaged the ‘Family’ boat, and some participants had to leave the mission as they could not be accommodated on the other boats. It is important to note that two days before the third attack, Israel’s official social media accounts had stamped the Hamas label on the aid boats. Tel Aviv had also demanded that the convoy unload its aid at the Ashkelon Marina port, while a post by the Israeli foreign ministry — in a taunting tone — asked if the mission was about “aid or provocation”. Italy also urged the flotilla to drop its aid off at Cyprus, which would then be handed to the Catholic Church’s Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which would transport it to Gaza. Reacting to their country’s recommendation, Italian volunteers on the GSF categorically rejected the notion of dropping aid in Cyprus. In a statement, they said that their mission stays “true to its original goal of breaking [Israel’s] illegal siege and delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged population of Gaza”. It all culminated on October 1, when the boats were about 100 nautical miles from Gaza. Israeli navy intercepted and stormed the vessels, pointing guns and smashing cameras capturing the raid on a livestream. A screengrab from a live stream video shows the crew raising their hands after Israeli navy forces board the Gaza-bound vessel Florida, part of the Global Sumud Flotilla, in international waters on October 2. — Reuters “Hands up, every last one of you”, and “phones in the water” were some of the orders shouted at the volunteers by Israeli force members. The participants were smeared as “terrorists” by a state which has terrorised not only the people of Gaza, but civilians in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Iran and Qatar. Journalists, parliamentarians, human rights activists, doctors and other unarmed civilians made up the volunteers on the convoy. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile and French Member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan were some of the more notable figures who took part in the humanitarian effort to reach Gaza. Before Israeli forces intercepted the boats, the military’s drones were hovering over the aid vessels, and navy ships were conducting intimidating manoeuvres near the aid ships. The volunteers were subjected to water cannons, communication blackouts and threats over the radio in the late hours of Wednesday. A screengrab from a live stream video shows Israeli navy forces aboard the Gaza-bound vessel ‘Oxygono’, part of the Global Sumud Flotilla, which was intercepted in international waters on October 2. — Reuters “You are instructed to change your course; any further attempts to sail towards Gaza endanger your safety and place you in an active warzone. If you proceed on your route, we will stop your boat and act to confiscate it through legal proceedings in court,” commanded an Israeli armed forces member with a prominent American accent, addressing Thiago Avila — an organiser on the flotilla — just moments before his vessel was intercepted. The participants were in international waters when Israel took them captive. Photographs and videos emerged moments after the initial interception of about 13 of the boats, showing Greta Thunberg captured and sitting next to an Israeli soldier. The soldier very performatively gave Thunberg water and a flimsy coat. A screengrab from a video shows Swedish activist Greta Thunberg sitting next to a person wearing tactical gear, as vessels of the Global Sumud Flotilla are being intercepted by Israeli security forces in international waters on October 1. — Reuters Over the following days, all of the 42 aid boats were intercepted. However, one boat, the Mikeno, managed to come very close to Gaza and was about 9.3 miles away from the besieged enclave when Israeli forces intercepted it. According to a statement issued by the GSF, the volunteers were taken to Ashdod Port, where they were “initially processed without legal counsel”. The statement also described the mistreatment suffered by the participants who were “zip-tied and forced to kneel for hours”. The coalition said that the volunteers were shifted to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev desert, “where tribunal hearings began without notifying or allowing their lawyers to attend”. Screenshot from Google Earth showing the location of Ktzi’ot Prison Footage also surfaced of Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir pointing at the captured flotilla participants as they sat on the floor with their passports in front of them. Ben-Gvir accused the volunteers —who carried baby formula for the malnourished infants of Gaza— of terrorism. “They did not come for help; they came for Gaza, for the terrorists. These are terrorists.” The minister also stormed one of the seized boats and claimed not to have found any aid. View this post on Instagram On October 5, Lebanese online magazine The Cradle published a post on X quoting Ben-Gvir as saying that he was “proud” of the maltreatment of the flotilla activists. “I am proud that the flotilla activists are being treated as terrorists. This is my policy,“ the far-right minister was quoted as saying. “I am proud of the prison staff acting in accordance with the policy set by Commissioner Kobi Yaakobi and myself. I was on their ships; I saw neither aid nor humanity.” Ben-Gvir added that he visited Ktzi’ot Prison and was “proud” of how the flotilla activists were treated as “supporters of terrorism”. “Anyone who supports terrorism is a terrorist and deserves the same conditions applied to terrorists.” Protests erupted worldwide with demonstrators demanding their governments take action to ensure the safe return of their captured civilians. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack on the Global Sumud Flotilla in a post on X. “We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release. Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he wrote. In another post, the premier lauded the efforts of Pakistani volunteers onboard the flotilla, including ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan. PM Shehbaz had faced backlash earlier for welcoming Trump’s 20-point peace plan. Subsequently, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, in a press conference, backtracked from the initial support for Trump’s plan and stated that the plan that was made public was not the same as the one discussed with Arab and Muslim leaders. Dar announced in a post on X that the Pakistan government has been “actively engaged in diplomatic outreach, including through friendly countries, to ensure the safety and early return of all our nationals.” Jamaat-e-Islami central emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman revealed that in a telephone conversation with PM Shehbaz, he urged “to accelerate efforts for the release and recovery of Mushtaq Ahmad Khan”. “We made it clear that this is not only a matter concerning Jamaat-e-Islami, but it carries importance for the whole of Pakistan. The Israeli attack on the Global Sumud Flotilla and the arrests are strongly condemnable,” he stated. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the detention of former senator Mushtaq and his fellow participants. “Food and medicine are not threats. Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla, detaining doctors, activists and Pakistan’s Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, is a flagrant assault on international law and conscience.” Israel has released and transported around 170 of the detained participants to Turkiye and Spain. As of October 6, 171 more detainees, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, were deported and have arrived in Greece. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was part of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detained by Israel, gestures as she is greeted by supporters upon her arrival at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, in Athens, Greece, on October 6. — Reuters Upon arrival, the released volunteers detailed the torture they were subjected to. While speaking to Anadolu Agency , Italian journalist Lorenzo Agostino said that Israeli forces acted like a “terrorist group.” “People were kicked. We were left without fresh water for over two days. Overall, they took every opportunity to humiliate any of us.” Agostino also stated that Thunberg was humiliated and “wrapped in an Israeli flag and exhibited like a trophy”. Other reports which emerged at the time of writing said he had also been beaten and dragged along the ground by her hair. French activist, Yasin Benjelloyn, who was also interviewed by Anadolu , described how Israeli forces would wake them up every two hours by storming their cells with dogs and snipers. According to Reuters , Malaysian citizen Hazwani Helmi said that Thunberg was used as a propaganda tool and was mistreated. Helmi added that the Israelis had treated them “like animals”. Turkish activist Ersin Celik also recounted that the Israelis “dragged Greta by her hair, beat her and forced her to kiss the Israeli flag.” British-Palestinian activist Keiran Andrieu said flotilla members were denied crucial medicine, and appeals for medical help fell on deaf ears. “Israel treated us terribly. It denied people essential medicine. We were shouting that someone was possibly having a heart attack, they didn’t come, they didn’t care.” View this post on Instagram Meanwhile, there are reports that Thiago — who was also released after being detained by Israel —  has been on a hunger and water strike in protest against the denial of essential medicine to fellow activists. As former senator Mushtaq put it in earlier interviews with Dawn.com , “We are not an army or a military force; we are civilians looking to confront and break the siege. “In case the Israeli forces attack, we have been told to embody peaceful resistance, stand against oppression and break the blockade peacefully. To put our lives in danger while establishing a humanitarian corridor.” The Foreign Office [FO] had announced on the eve of October 7 that it was working with Jordan to ensure Khan’s release from Israeli detention and safe return to Pakistan. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, through its embassy in Amman, is working tirelessly to secure the safe evacuation of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan,” the FO stated. This image shows former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla. — Screenshot courtesy Mushtaq Ahmed Khan/X After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that Khan has been released in a post on X and that “he is safely with the Pakistan embassy in Amman. He is in good health and high spirits.” Dressed in the same white clothes that other released flotilla activists were seen in, the ex-senator, in a video statement on his X platform, announced his release. “We were shackled, with our hands tied behind our backs. They blindfolded us, dogs were released on us, and guns were pointed at us,” Khan said, backing the recounts of other released activists. He added that the treatment of flotilla activists in prison at the hands of Israeli forces was tantamount to torture. “No access to air, no access to drinking water, no access to medication,” he stated, detailing some of the maltreatment the GSF participants endured. Khan vowed to continue the fight for Palestinian freedom. “We will try and save Gaza and will ensure the culprits [for the Gaza genocide] are held accountable. From Adiala Jail to Israeli jails, the efforts for Palestinian liberation will continue.” While all of this has been happening, Hamas has accepted Trump’s plan on a conditional basis and has agreed to release all the hostages, dead or alive, in exchange for Palestinian captives held in Israeli jails. The US president has ordered Israel to stop striking Gaza and even claimed that the bombings have stopped in a post on Truth Social. In the same breath, he threatened, “Hamas must move quickly or all bets will be off,” adding that he would not accept any outcome in which “Gaza poses a threat again”. Israel has not stopped the bombings in Gaza, and as of the writing of this article, Israel has killed 24 more people in the enclave. At least 67,139 lives have been snuffed out by Israeli bombardment since October 2023, the true toll likely much higher as Tel Aviv has levelled the small Palestinian territory, home to 2 million people. Israel may feel that it was successful in intercepting all aid boats headed to Gaza; however, they have just motivated more people to take a stand against the oppression being meted out on the Palestinians. With its ill-treatment of foreign nationals, Tel Aviv has exposed the true nature of its forces, if the two years of genocide were not already proof enough of the moral compass of the “most moral army in the world”. The Global Sumud Flotilla has led to more aid vessels being dispatched, carrying medics and aid workers. At least 11 aid boats are sailing to Gaza to break the siege. Civilians have taken it upon themselves to do what their governments cannot: challenge Israel.

Dar announced in a post on X that the Pakistan government has been “actively engaged in diplomatic outreach, including through friendly countries, to ensure the safety and early return of all our nationals.” Jamaat-e-Islami central emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman revealed that in a telephone conversation with PM Shehbaz, he urged “to accelerate efforts for the release and recovery of Mushtaq Ahmad Khan”. “We made it clear that this is not only a matter concerning Jamaat-e-Islami, but it carries importance for the whole of Pakistan. The Israeli attack on the Global Sumud Flotilla and the arrests are strongly condemnable,” he stated. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the detention of former senator Mushtaq and his fellow participants. “Food and medicine are not threats. Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla, detaining doctors, activists and Pakistan’s Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, is a flagrant assault on international law and conscience.” Israel has released and transported around 170 of the detained participants to Turkiye and Spain. As of October 6, 171 more detainees, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, were deported and have arrived in Greece. Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was part of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detained by Israel, gestures as she is greeted by supporters upon her arrival at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport, in Athens, Greece, on October 6. — Reuters Upon arrival, the released volunteers detailed the torture they were subjected to. While speaking to Anadolu Agency , Italian journalist Lorenzo Agostino said that Israeli forces acted like a “terrorist group.” “People were kicked. We were left without fresh water for over two days. Overall, they took every opportunity to humiliate any of us.” Agostino also stated that Thunberg was humiliated and “wrapped in an Israeli flag and exhibited like a trophy”. Other reports which emerged at the time of writing said he had also been beaten and dragged along the ground by her hair. French activist, Yasin Benjelloyn, who was also interviewed by Anadolu , described how Israeli forces would wake them up every two hours by storming their cells with dogs and snipers. According to Reuters , Malaysian citizen Hazwani Helmi said that Thunberg was used as a propaganda tool and was mistreated. Helmi added that the Israelis had treated them “like animals”. Turkish activist Ersin Celik also recounted that the Israelis “dragged Greta by her hair, beat her and forced her to kiss the Israeli flag.” British-Palestinian activist Keiran Andrieu said flotilla members were denied crucial medicine, and appeals for medical help fell on deaf ears. “Israel treated us terribly. It denied people essential medicine. We were shouting that someone was possibly having a heart attack, they didn’t come, they didn’t care.” View this post on Instagram Meanwhile, there are reports that Thiago — who was also released after being detained by Israel —  has been on a hunger and water strike in protest against the denial of essential medicine to fellow activists. As former senator Mushtaq put it in earlier interviews with Dawn.com , “We are not an army or a military force; we are civilians looking to confront and break the siege. “In case the Israeli forces attack, we have been told to embody peaceful resistance, stand against oppression and break the blockade peacefully. To put our lives in danger while establishing a humanitarian corridor.” The Foreign Office [FO] had announced on the eve of October 7 that it was working with Jordan to ensure Khan’s release from Israeli detention and safe return to Pakistan. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan, through its embassy in Amman, is working tirelessly to secure the safe evacuation of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan,” the FO stated. This image shows former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla. — Screenshot courtesy Mushtaq Ahmed Khan/X After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar announced that Khan has been released in a post on X and that “he is safely with the Pakistan embassy in Amman. He is in good health and high spirits.” Dressed in the same white clothes that other released flotilla activists were seen in, the ex-senator, in a video statement on his X platform, announced his release. “We were shackled, with our hands tied behind our backs. They blindfolded us, dogs were released on us, and guns were pointed at us,” Khan said, backing the recounts of other released activists. He added that the treatment of flotilla activists in prison at the hands of Israeli forces was tantamount to torture. “No access to air, no access to drinking water, no access to medication,” he stated, detailing some of the maltreatment the GSF participants endured. Khan vowed to continue the fight for Palestinian freedom. “We will try and save Gaza and will ensure the culprits [for the Gaza genocide] are held accountable. From Adiala Jail to Israeli jails, the efforts for Palestinian liberation will continue.” While all of this has been happening, Hamas has accepted Trump’s plan on a conditional basis and has agreed to release all the hostages, dead or alive, in exchange for Palestinian captives held in Israeli jails. The US president has ordered Israel to stop striking Gaza and even claimed that the bombings have stopped in a post on Truth Social. In the same breath, he threatened, “Hamas must move quickly or all bets will be off,” adding that he would not accept any outcome in which “Gaza poses a threat again”. Israel has not stopped the bombings in Gaza, and as of the writing of this article, Israel has killed 24 more people in the enclave. At least 67,139 lives have been snuffed out by Israeli bombardment since October 2023, the true toll likely much higher as Tel Aviv has levelled the small Palestinian territory, home to 2 million people. Israel may feel that it was successful in intercepting all aid boats headed to Gaza; however, they have just motivated more people to take a stand against the oppression being meted out on the Palestinians. With its ill-treatment of foreign nationals, Tel Aviv has exposed the true nature of its forces, if the two years of genocide were not already proof enough of the moral compass of the “most moral army in the world”. The Global Sumud Flotilla has led to more aid vessels being dispatched, carrying medics and aid workers. At least 11 aid boats are sailing to Gaza to break the siege. Civilians have taken it upon themselves to do what their governments cannot: challenge Israel.

      "title_orig": "26th Amendment case: SC Constitutional Bench approves live streaming of proceedings",
      "summary_orig": "An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) approved on Tuesday a set of requests seeking the live streaming of proceedings on pleas challenging the 26th Amendment. The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy. It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered the prime minister to appoint the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that led to its establishment. It has been challenged by various high court bar associations, the PTI and others. A CB headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprises Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan resumed hearing the set of pleas today, which were last taken up on January 27 . Today’s hearing During today’s hearing, three matters were primarily discussed — the constitution of a full court to hear the pleas against the 26th Amendment, objections to the CB and live streaming of the proceedings. At the outset of the hearing, Justice Aminuddin Khan said the bench would first hear arguments on requests for a full court hearing on the pleas and objections to CB. “We will decide on the matter of live streaming (of court proceedings) later,” he added. At that, lawyer Khawaja Ahmad Hassan argued that arguments on pleas seeking a full court hearing should be live-streamed so that the public was also made aware of the grounds on which the request was being made. He then urged the court to first hear arguments on requests for streaming the proceedings live. Justice Aminuddin Khan remarked that matters of the bench were of relevance to the court, not the public. He asserted that the court would first take up the matter regarding the constitution of a full court. At one point during the hearing, he said, “Things have to be managed. All of us are serving the public, we are all fulfilling our responsibilities.” The counsel for Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan Vice Chairperson Mustafa Khokhar, Shahid Jameel, informed the court that the SC registrar had raised objections over his client’s plea for a full court hearing. “We filed an appeal against the objections,” he said, requesting the court to first decide Khokhar’s appeal. He further said that his client had also raised objections over the CB and urged the court to hear it along with the other petitions. After consultation among the judges, Khokhar’s petition was allotted a number. The lawyer representing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government also presented arguments for a full court hearing of pleas. He clarified that they did not have any objection regarding any of the members of the existing eight-judge CB but wanted a full court to hear the pleas. During his arguments, Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed contended that every citizen had the right to information. However, neither was the draft of the 26th Amendment made public nor was there a public debate on it, he argued. He then argued that at least proceedings should be live-streamed for public viewing. He recalled that the 26th Amendment was approved by parliament “in the darkness of the night”, adding that previously court proceedings had also been streamed live, including those in Zulfikar Bhutto case and the case pertaining to the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act. He said senior advocate of the SC Makhdoom Ali Khan had declared the 26th Amendment case the “constitutional case of the century”, arguing that a full court or a full CB should hear the case. Following his arguments, Justice Afghan enquired, “So you want that apart from the proceedings taking place in broad daylight, they should also be live-streamed?” To that, Barrister Ahmed said, “The Amendment was passed in the darkness of the night. That is why facts must be revealed to the public.” Following that, the bench reserved its decision on requests seeking live streaming of the proceedings. During the hearing, Justice Malik also asked Additional Attorney General Amir Rehman about the government’s stance on the live streaming of court proceedings. To that, Rehman said the matter was administrative. “So you will agree with whatever the bench decides?” asked Justice Mazhar. At one point, Justice Mandokhail remarked, “This is a big case, we will proceed on this in an orderly manner.” Eventually, the court approved the requests for live streaming the case’s proceedings and adjourned the hearing till 11.30am tomorrow (Wednesday). The petitions The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary which is a salient feature of the Constitution: namely the provisions for annual performance evaluation of judges of the high court by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the chief justice of Pakistan being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches of the apex court and high courts. As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued. The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an unconstitutional amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs. The petitioners also requested the SC for a full court hearing of the pleas instead of a hearing by the CB, which was established under the 26th Amendment. ‘Opportunity lost’ Between January and now, there have been multiple calls for a full court hearing of these pleas. On August 14, two responses from Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi were uploaded on the court’s website, explaining why he had disregarded a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full SC. The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024, under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing. The CJP had argued that such a move would undermine the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges and expose the apex court to public comment, which, he noted, had regrettably been the case in the recent past. On Aug 20, Justices Shah and Akhtar wrote a joint letter to the CJP, following the SC decision to make public the Oct 31 committee’s minutes. In their joint letter, Justice Shah and Justice Akhtar observed: “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e. the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.”",

      "title_orig": "How Gaza exposed the myth of ‘objective’ journalism in the face of genocide",
      "summary_orig": "“By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest — something I haven’t known in the past eighteen months.” Final message of Gaza journalist Hossam Shabbat, 23, killed in March by an Israeli airstrike A journalist is never supposed to be the story. In Gaza, however, the killing of at least 223 media personnel by Israel — from October 7, 2023, to Oct 1 this year — turned them into headlines. Social media shared their names and faces, and mourned the last messages they wrote in anticipation of imminent death, while mainstream media documented the numbers and converted them into bite-sized news for the ease of readers. In the newsroom, their deaths seemed personal; these were members of our fraternity whom we had never met but relied on their lens and words. Wafa Aludaini was one of them; she wrote for this publication in 2022, titled ‘ Killing the truth: Shireen Abu Akleh’s murder is a reminder that Israel will go to any length to silence its critics ’. Aludaini herself was silenced along with her husband, their five-year-old daughter and seven-month-old son on September 29, 2024, when an Israeli airstrike hit their home in Gaza’s Deir Al Balah. My colleague spotted her name in a news report, after which we added her name to the growing list of journalists killed in Israel’s latest and most brutal campaign — one that had all the makings of a genocide from the time it began, but wasn’t referred to as one. What’s in a genocide Soon after Hamas’ attack on Oct 7, 2023 , and Israel’s immediate onslaught, I remember having discussions with different editors as to when the term “genocide” would apply. As one year passed, we ran the headline: 365 days of genocide on Oct 7, 2024. On Sep 16 this year, a UN commission officially declared Israel’s actions as genocide. Journalists are not juries or judges; we’re not supposed to hand out sentences or write verdicts. Editorially, we’re supposed to show restraint in using labels or terminologies, and leave these matters to authorities that are tasked to make such deliberations. Our job is to gather information, as accurately as possible, report on it and offer analysis with the help of experts and people on the ground for consumers of news to make sense of what’s happening. But Gaza challenged our profession: every action by Israel, such as bombing hospitals and shelters or orchestrating a man-made famine, made us question when journalists are meant to pick a side and when merely reporting is no longer enough. As the death toll rose and Israel’s intentions became more and more transparent, Gaza also challenged the legitimacy of the word genocide itself. Polish lawyer Raphäel Lemkin, who coined the word in 1944, made the argument that “the Genocide Convention has a specially great appeal to small nations because each of them can disappear completely under the first genocidal attack”. The Genocide Convention was the first human rights treaty adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1948, and signified the international community’s commitment to ‘never again’ after the atrocities committed during the Second World War. But all the while the media debated on the timing of using the word, it concurrently broke the news of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, only to follow that up with Hungary withdrawing from the ICC hours after the Israeli leader arrived in Hungary for a state visit. It reported the United States’ declaration on January 7, 2025, that Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) had committed genocide during the country’s civil war, and exactly a month later, on February 7, ran the headline ‘ US approves $7.4bn sale of more weapons to Israel used to ravage Gaza ’. For nearly two years, if we don’t count Israel’s action pre-October 7, the law failed the people of Gaza over and over again, and the media documented the world’s helplessness in preventing a genocide from happening — the very first principle of the UN’s ‘Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide’. In all this time, Palestine’s continued plight has begged the question: what value does a word hold in the face of such hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of international law? Or, more crucially, what good is international law when none of the glaring headlines deterred Israel from carrying out a genocide? Did journalism fail Gaza? October 17, 2023, was the first clear signalling of Israel’s intent to wage a deadly war without any concern for civilian casualties: it targeted a UNRWA refugee camp and a hospital. Only 10 days into the war waged by Tel Aviv, the media tried to piece together information coming from both sides, and without actual press vests of their own on the ground. The New York Times was among the publications that retracted their initial coverage on the Al Ahli Arab Hospital explosion that killed scores of Palestinians. “The Times’ initial accounts attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast,” read the Times’ editors’ note published on Oct 23 following criticism, adding that the early coverage “relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified”. Subsequent investigations into the incident by multiple organisations didn’t offer a conclusion as to whether a failed rocket launch by Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was responsible for the explosion or if it was an Israeli airstrike. I’m not going to go into the details of the investigations (this Forensic Architecture investigation is worth a read), but want to highlight this incident because at the time, I defended the media organisations’ actions since immediate versions of either side cannot be taken at face value in reporting. But the due diligence proved to be limited to this one incident, prompted by the backlash from Israel’s sympathisers. The overall Western media coverage remained lopsided for the large part, with headlines, including the NYT’s , often declaring that Palestinian civilians were killed but stopping short of saying by whom; news stories using emotive language for Israeli deaths but not for Palestinians’; editors putting ‘Hamas-run’ before all versions of the Palestinian Health Ministry but failing to provide context to Israeli officials’ repeated claims on incidents of civilian deaths; and media organisations silencing journalists who advocated the rights of Palestinians. Among the journalists silenced was Mehdi Hasan, whose show was cancelled by American cable news channel MSNBC . While Hasan chose not to speak candidly on the matter, the cancellation was linked by media and lawmakers alike to his opinions about the atrocities in Palestine. Perhaps the biggest betrayal of the fraternity was the lack of outrage by these media organisations at the deaths of Palestinian journalists. The due diligence exhibited during the Al Ahli Arab Hospital bombing wasn’t exercised in these instances, such as when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the five Gaza journalists — targeted in a Quds Today van parked outside a hospital, where the wife of one of the journalists was about to give birth — were “Islamic Jihad operatives posing as journalists”. No further investigations took place into these claims despite systematic campaigns by Israel in place to defame and threaten these journalists, as detailed by Reporters Without Borders. “There have been few media campaigns or statements of solidarity with Palestinian journalists — compared with similar efforts around […] other western correspondents targeted by US adversaries,” wrote Mohamad Bazzi for The Guardian , noting that “press freedom and protection from persecution, it seems, are limited to western journalists”. On August 10, 28-year-old Al Jazeera journalist Anas al Sharif was killed alongside four of his colleagues in an Israeli airstrike that targeted a press tent outside a hospital in Gaza. Less than a month before his death, the Committee to Protect Journalists had said it was “gravely worried” about the safety of Sharif, highlighting that he was being “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign, which he believes is a precursor to his assassination”. Yet, the threats to his life and Israel’s pattern got little to no attention in the Western media, despite hundreds of Palestinian journalists already killed by Israel up to that point. Eleven days after his death, the NYT published an opinion piece with an honest, matter-of-fact headline: ‘ He was the face and voice of Gaza. Israel assassinated him .’ Sharif, in the message he prepared for his death, had pleaded “not to let chains silence you”. Perhaps his end was what was needed for the media to start speaking up for him. How Gaza gave new meaning to journalism Despite the often skewed media coverage, Gaza has shifted the tide of public perception. During the course of the onslaught on Gaza, the media also reported on barriers breaking; the barrier to acknowledging that the destruction was not a result of Oct 7 but had been going on for decades, barriers on Gaza being a regional topic and turning into a global protest movement , and barriers of diplomacy which prevented countries from calling out Tel Aviv’s nefarious plans and accepting the Palestinian state. We also witnessed barriers guarding media hegemony break; with organisations such as the BBC , once considered credible and honest, coming under intense scrutiny for its evasive framing and questionable editorial judgments. And when the same organisation pulled a documentary on Gaza, it created space for others to step in. The documentary, titled Gaza: Doctors Under Attack , was subsequently streamed by Zeteo , a news platform launched by Mehdi Hasan after he exited MSNBC , after it was dropped by the BBC . Hasan, along with his team of diverse contributors, from Fatima Bhutto and Bassem Youssef to Cynthia Nixon and Greta Thunberg, positioned Zeteo as a leading platform to talk about Palestine without tiptoeing around Israel’s actions. Meanwhile, Israeli TV continued its propaganda on the IDF’s so-called operations but Haaretz , the country’s left-leaning and oldest newspaper, still managed to publish some pieces critical of the government, repeatedly calling attention to Benjamin Netanyahu’s tactics of keeping the hostages where they were to be able to pursue his rampage. In the Middle East, where the media is highly controlled by the Gulf states’ official policies, The National pushed the envelope in trying to expose the full scale of Israel’s genocidal acts. The main source of information, however, remained the brave men and women of Gaza who recorded videos and accounts of the unfolding horror and shared them with the world in real time through social media. People across the world turned to their accounts, followed their stories and came to trust them in the absence of original — and often fair — reporting across mainstream media. Inside newsrooms, they served as inspiration through their commitment in the face of some of the worst atrocities modern history has witnessed. They made journalists like myself question what our profession stands for and how we can use it to amplify their voices to end a genocide which has made us feel helpless at many junctures. “I have seen my colleagues break down and cry at how we’re covering the war,” a peer in BBC London told me in December 2024. I shared how I’ve seen my colleagues tear up at the sheer horror of the information and photos coming out of Gaza. The genocide has been difficult and challenging to cover, to say the least. Footage of parents first retrieving bodies of their children from underneath rubble only to bury them, people moving to ‘safe zones’ and then being bombed, unarmed citizens being burnt alive in tents or killed while out to collect food, doctors breaking down at their helplessness to save lives or even have the equipment to do so — sifting through these footages and information has been heavy on the heart and mind. But none of this comes even remotely close to the pain and suffering of the people living through a genocide and reporting on it. And so, I won’t end this piece on the toll it has taken on journalists to cover two years of this genocide. Because a journalist is never meant to become the story — unless you are a journalist in Gaza staring at death and writing your final message.",

Yet, the threats to his life and Israel’s pattern got little to no attention in the Western media, despite hundreds of Palestinian journalists already killed by Israel up to that point. Eleven days after his death, the NYT published an opinion piece with an honest, matter-of-fact headline: ‘ He was the face and voice of Gaza. Israel assassinated him .’ Sharif, in the message he prepared for his death, had pleaded “not to let chains silence you”. Perhaps his end was what was needed for the media to start speaking up for him. How Gaza gave new meaning to journalism Despite the often skewed media coverage, Gaza has shifted the tide of public perception. During the course of the onslaught on Gaza, the media also reported on barriers breaking; the barrier to acknowledging that the destruction was not a result of Oct 7 but had been going on for decades, barriers on Gaza being a regional topic and turning into a global protest movement , and barriers of diplomacy which prevented countries from calling out Tel Aviv’s nefarious plans and accepting the Palestinian state. We also witnessed barriers guarding media hegemony break; with organisations such as the BBC , once considered credible and honest, coming under intense scrutiny for its evasive framing and questionable editorial judgments. And when the same organisation pulled a documentary on Gaza, it created space for others to step in. The documentary, titled Gaza: Doctors Under Attack , was subsequently streamed by Zeteo , a news platform launched by Mehdi Hasan after he exited MSNBC , after it was dropped by the BBC . Hasan, along with his team of diverse contributors, from Fatima Bhutto and Bassem Youssef to Cynthia Nixon and Greta Thunberg, positioned Zeteo as a leading platform to talk about Palestine without tiptoeing around Israel’s actions. Meanwhile, Israeli TV continued its propaganda on the IDF’s so-called operations but Haaretz , the country’s left-leaning and oldest newspaper, still managed to publish some pieces critical of the government, repeatedly calling attention to Benjamin Netanyahu’s tactics of keeping the hostages where they were to be able to pursue his rampage. In the Middle East, where the media is highly controlled by the Gulf states’ official policies, The National pushed the envelope in trying to expose the full scale of Israel’s genocidal acts. The main source of information, however, remained the brave men and women of Gaza who recorded videos and accounts of the unfolding horror and shared them with the world in real time through social media. People across the world turned to their accounts, followed their stories and came to trust them in the absence of original — and often fair — reporting across mainstream media. Inside newsrooms, they served as inspiration through their commitment in the face of some of the worst atrocities modern history has witnessed. They made journalists like myself question what our profession stands for and how we can use it to amplify their voices to end a genocide which has made us feel helpless at many junctures. “I have seen my colleagues break down and cry at how we’re covering the war,” a peer in BBC London told me in December 2024. I shared how I’ve seen my colleagues tear up at the sheer horror of the information and photos coming out of Gaza. The genocide has been difficult and challenging to cover, to say the least. Footage of parents first retrieving bodies of their children from underneath rubble only to bury them, people moving to ‘safe zones’ and then being bombed, unarmed citizens being burnt alive in tents or killed while out to collect food, doctors breaking down at their helplessness to save lives or even have the equipment to do so — sifting through these footages and information has been heavy on the heart and mind. But none of this comes even remotely close to the pain and suffering of the people living through a genocide and reporting on it. And so, I won’t end this piece on the toll it has taken on journalists to cover two years of this genocide. Because a journalist is never meant to become the story — unless you are a journalist in Gaza staring at death and writing your final message.",

      "summary": "“By God, I fulfilled my duty as a journalist. I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest — something I haven’t known in the past eighteen months.” Final message of Gaza journalist Hossam Shabbat, 23, killed in March by an Israeli airstrike A journalist is never supposed to be the story. In Gaza, however, the killing of at least 223 media personnel by Israel — from October 7, 2023, to Oct 1 this year — turned them into headlines. Social media shared their names and faces, and mourned the last messages they wrote in anticipation of imminent death, while mainstream media documented the numbers and converted them into bite-sized news for the ease of readers. In the newsroom, their deaths seemed personal; these were members of our fraternity whom we had never met but relied on their lens and words. Wafa Aludaini was one of them; she wrote for this publication in 2022, titled ‘ Killing the truth: Shireen Abu Akleh’s murder is a reminder that Israel will go to any length to silence its critics ’. Aludaini herself was silenced along with her husband, their five-year-old daughter and seven-month-old son on September 29, 2024, when an Israeli airstrike hit their home in Gaza’s Deir Al Balah. My colleague spotted her name in a news report, after which we added her name to the growing list of journalists killed in Israel’s latest and most brutal campaign — one that had all the makings of a genocide from the time it began, but wasn’t referred to as one. What’s in a genocide Soon after Hamas’ attack on Oct 7, 2023 , and Israel’s immediate onslaught, I remember having discussions with different editors as to when the term “genocide” would apply. As one year passed, we ran the headline: 365 days of genocide on Oct 7, 2024. On Sep 16 this year, a UN commission officially declared Israel’s actions as genocide. Journalists are not juries or judges; we’re not supposed to hand out sentences or write verdicts. Editorially, we’re supposed to show restraint in using labels or terminologies, and leave these matters to authorities that are tasked to make such deliberations. Our job is to gather information, as accurately as possible, report on it and offer analysis with the help of experts and people on the ground for consumers of news to make sense of what’s happening. But Gaza challenged our profession: every action by Israel, such as bombing hospitals and shelters or orchestrating a man-made famine, made us question when journalists are meant to pick a side and when merely reporting is no longer enough. As the death toll rose and Israel’s intentions became more and more transparent, Gaza also challenged the legitimacy of the word genocide itself. Polish lawyer Raphäel Lemkin, who coined the word in 1944, made the argument that “the Genocide Convention has a specially great appeal to small nations because each of them can disappear completely under the first genocidal attack”. The Genocide Convention was the first human rights treaty adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 9, 1948, and signified the international community’s commitment to ‘never again’ after the atrocities committed during the Second World War. But all the while the media debated on the timing of using the word, it concurrently broke the news of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, only to follow that up with Hungary withdrawing from the ICC hours after the Israeli leader arrived in Hungary for a state visit. It reported the United States’ declaration on January 7, 2025, that Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) had committed genocide during the country’s civil war, and exactly a month later, on February 7, ran the headline ‘ US approves $7.4bn sale of more weapons to Israel used to ravage Gaza ’. For nearly two years, if we don’t count Israel’s action pre-October 7, the law failed the people of Gaza over and over again, and the media documented the world’s helplessness in preventing a genocide from happening — the very first principle of the UN’s ‘Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide’. In all this time, Palestine’s continued plight has begged the question: what value does a word hold in the face of such hypocrisy and ineffectiveness of international law? Or, more crucially, what good is international law when none of the glaring headlines deterred Israel from carrying out a genocide? Did journalism fail Gaza? October 17, 2023, was the first clear signalling of Israel’s intent to wage a deadly war without any concern for civilian casualties: it targeted a UNRWA refugee camp and a hospital. Only 10 days into the war waged by Tel Aviv, the media tried to piece together information coming from both sides, and without actual press vests of their own on the ground. The New York Times was among the publications that retracted their initial coverage on the Al Ahli Arab Hospital explosion that killed scores of Palestinians. “The Times’ initial accounts attributed the claim of Israeli responsibility to Palestinian officials, and noted that the Israeli military said it was investigating the blast,” read the Times’ editors’ note published on Oct 23 following criticism, adding that the early coverage “relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified”. Subsequent investigations into the incident by multiple organisations didn’t offer a conclusion as to whether a failed rocket launch by Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was responsible for the explosion or if it was an Israeli airstrike. I’m not going to go into the details of the investigations (this Forensic Architecture investigation is worth a read), but want to highlight this incident because at the time, I defended the media organisations’ actions since immediate versions of either side cannot be taken at face value in reporting. But the due diligence proved to be limited to this one incident, prompted by the backlash from Israel’s sympathisers. The overall Western media coverage remained lopsided for the large part, with headlines, including the NYT’s , often declaring that Palestinian civilians were killed but stopping short of saying by whom; news stories using emotive language for Israeli deaths but not for Palestinians’; editors putting ‘Hamas-run’ before all versions of the Palestinian Health Ministry but failing to provide context to Israeli officials’ repeated claims on incidents of civilian deaths; and media organisations silencing journalists who advocated the rights of Palestinians. Among the journalists silenced was Mehdi Hasan, whose show was cancelled by American cable news channel MSNBC . While Hasan chose not to speak candidly on the matter, the cancellation was linked by media and lawmakers alike to his opinions about the atrocities in Palestine. Perhaps the biggest betrayal of the fraternity was the lack of outrage by these media organisations at the deaths of Palestinian journalists. The due diligence exhibited during the Al Ahli Arab Hospital bombing wasn’t exercised in these instances, such as when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the five Gaza journalists — targeted in a Quds Today van parked outside a hospital, where the wife of one of the journalists was about to give birth — were “Islamic Jihad operatives posing as journalists”. No further investigations took place into these claims despite systematic campaigns by Israel in place to defame and threaten these journalists, as detailed by Reporters Without Borders. “There have been few media campaigns or statements of solidarity with Palestinian journalists — compared with similar efforts around […] other western correspondents targeted by US adversaries,” wrote Mohamad Bazzi for The Guardian , noting that “press freedom and protection from persecution, it seems, are limited to western journalists”. On August 10, 28-year-old Al Jazeera journalist Anas al Sharif was killed alongside four of his colleagues in an Israeli airstrike that targeted a press tent outside a hospital in Gaza. Less than a month before his death, the Committee to Protect Journalists had said it was “gravely worried” about the safety of Sharif, highlighting that he was being “targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign, which he believes is a precursor to his assassination”. Yet, the threats to his life and Israel’s pattern got little to no attention in the Western media, despite hundreds of Palestinian journalists already killed by Israel up to that point.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister She­hbaz Sharif has received an honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy during his visit to Malaysia in recognition of his “outstanding leadership and contributions to nation-building”. The premier arrived in Malaysia on October 5 for a three-day official visit, during which he snapped up six accords and several trade and bilateral agreements. According to Malaysian state news agency Bernama , the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) conferred the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Leadership and Governance during a special ceremony held yesterday at its Kuala Lumpur campus. Dressed in a blue gown on the occasion, PM Shehbaz termed it a “great privilege and honour” to be part of the event and receive the degree from this “great institute of learning”. He appreciated Queen of Pahang Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah, who is also the IIUM Constitutional Head, for gracing the event. The premier said: “For over four decades, I devoted my humble services to serve the cause of [and] the people of Punjab, the largest province of Pakistan, as their public servant. And now, as the prime minister of Pakistan, and in the line of duty, despite my human failings, I tried my best to serve the people with sincerity of purpose and unwavering commitment. “I am truly delighted to be associated through this degree of philosophy with one of the most revered seats of learning in the Muslim world and an institution that has championed the integration of knowledge, faith and ethics, and pursuit of excellence,” he added. The premier expressed the hope that his visit to the varsity would further strengthen the bonds of academic partnership and collaboration between the IIUM and Pakistan’s leading institutions of higher learning. The prime minister emphasised that leadership was not a privilege but a “sacred trust, amanah, which must be exercised with honesty of purpose, sincerity, justice and transparent accountability before Allah”. “History bears testimony that whenever Muslims held firmly to these glorious principles, they not only flourished themselves but also became a source of guidance for humanity around the globe,” PM Shehbaz said. Highlighting that the Muslim ummah today confronts “formidable challenges [of] conflict, poverty and disunity, he stressed that it was “in these testing times that we need to hold on together to our values and ethics guided by our religion to be able to reclaim our lost place in the comity of nations”. Addressing the Pahang queen, the premier said Malaysia was blessed with a very young population and noted that “our responsibility as servants and as leaders is to provide them the right platforms to serve the cause of suffering humanity with compassion and with great commitment”. The prime minister read out a few verses of Dr Allama Iqbal and their English version as well. He expressed his wishes for IIUM’s continued success and for a “future of greater unity, brotherhood and very close coordination” for both Pakistan and Malaysia. In her remarks, the Pahang queen noted that Shehbaz had “served with vision, discipline and compassion” for four decades. “From your leadership in Punjab to your role as prime minister, you have shown true leadership is not about power but about purpose, about building lives and uplifting communities through education, healthcare and opportunities.” She highlighted that the Punjab Education Endowment Fund “opened the doors of higher learning to thousands who might never have dreamt of university education”. “That is leadership that touches hearts and transforms futures,” Iskandariah noted. Recalling that Pakistan was a founding partner of the IIUM, she said Pakistani students and alumni continue to “enrich the university and uphold our shared mission of serving the ummah”. The Pahang queen also mentioned the Palestine issue, saying “peace on earth and harmony among all mankind” was what “we truly need today with what is happening in Palestine”. In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said it was a “truly humbling experience” to be recognised with the honorary degree. “With great humility, I accepted this honour on behalf of the people of Pakistan as a symbol of the deep-rooted intellectual and cultural connection as well as people-to-people ties between Pakistan and Malaysia,” he added. In the afternoon, a post on the Pakistani government’s X account said PM Shehbaz had departed for Pakistan after concluding his visit to Malaysia. A day ago, PM Shehbaz and his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim held several meetings during which they resolved to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc. On the economic side, the premier termed PM Ibrahim’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”. Gobi Partners shows ‘keen interest’ in Pakistan’s e-commerce sector Separately, PM Shehbaz held a meeting with a delegation of Malaysian business group Gobi Partners, which “showed keen interest in collaboration in e-commerce and financial technologies in Pakistan”, according to state-run Radio Pakistan . Addressing the delegation, led by Gobi Partners’ co-founder and chair Thomas G. Tsao, the premier highlighted “immense potential” for enhancing cooperation in various economic sectors between the two countries. He welcomed Gobi Partners’ confidence in Pakistan’s startup ecosystem, assuring the delegation that the government was implementing “focused reforms to support startups and early-stage investors” via facilitating investments and providing better access to infrastructure, the report added. “Mobilising both domestic and international capital is our priority to develop a sustainable startup ecosystem,” he said. PM Shehbaz highlighted that the fintech, e-commerce, and IT services sectors form “the backbone of Pakistan’s national development strategy”. The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening economic and trade relations with Malaysia, saying: “The government is fully committed to creating a business-friendly environment and improving the ease of doing business in Pakistan.” Referring to the Pakistan-Malaysia Business and Investment Conference held yesterday, PM Shehbaz said such initiatives were a “welcome step towards promoting business-to-business linkages” between the two countries, Radio Pakistan added. The prime minister noted that the Special Investment Facilitation Council was providing all possible support and facilities to foreign investors. He highlighted the importance of the digital economy and expressed Pakistan’s readiness to welcome international business groups and investors with an interest in the country’s growing IT, technology, and artificial intelligence sectors. Malaysia to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan The premier’s official visit to Malaysia this week, at the invitation of PM Ibrahim, marks his first since he assumed office in 2024. This was highlighted in a joint statement issued by Pakistan and Malaysia today, posted by the High Commission of Pakistan in Malaysia on X. “Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1957, Malaysia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan have built a partnership premised on mutual respect and shared values,” the statement said. It further highlighted the commitments of both leaders to strengthening this partnership via bilateral trade and investment, including Malaysia’s decision to import halal meat from Pakistan that was hailed by the prime minister. In turn, Malaysia expressed its intention to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan in line with increasing demand, according to the statement. “Both sides also agreed to further deepen the bilateral defence cooperation , particularly in the field of defence science, technology, and industry, through knowledge and technology transfer,” the statement read. Besides deciding to explore collaboration in healthcare , pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, the two premiers also agreed to enhance tourism promotion and cultural exchanges from both sides. The leaders acknowledged the importance of sustainable agricultural practices, energy security and healthcare, agreeing to explore joint research and innovation initiatives as well as partnerships in these sectors. Furthermore, the two sides noted the cooperation on issues within the framework of international organisations, particularly the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. ’ Both countries reiterated their shared commitment to “strengthening the solidarity of the Muslim Ummah and upholding the true values of Islam”, calling on the international community to combat “all forms of intolerance”, including Islamophobia and xenophobia. The leaders also discussed threats to peace and security in the region. In this regard, they both reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan, as well as condemning the ongoing genocide in Gaza and reiterating their support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of a Palestinian state.",

Dressed in a blue gown on the occasion, PM Shehbaz termed it a “great privilege and honour” to be part of the event and receive the degree from this “great institute of learning”. He appreciated Queen of Pahang Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah, who is also the IIUM Constitutional Head, for gracing the event. The premier said: “For over four decades, I devoted my humble services to serve the cause of [and] the people of Punjab, the largest province of Pakistan, as their public servant. And now, as the prime minister of Pakistan, and in the line of duty, despite my human failings, I tried my best to serve the people with sincerity of purpose and unwavering commitment. “I am truly delighted to be associated through this degree of philosophy with one of the most revered seats of learning in the Muslim world and an institution that has championed the integration of knowledge, faith and ethics, and pursuit of excellence,” he added. The premier expressed the hope that his visit to the varsity would further strengthen the bonds of academic partnership and collaboration between the IIUM and Pakistan’s leading institutions of higher learning. The prime minister emphasised that leadership was not a privilege but a “sacred trust, amanah, which must be exercised with honesty of purpose, sincerity, justice and transparent accountability before Allah”. “History bears testimony that whenever Muslims held firmly to these glorious principles, they not only flourished themselves but also became a source of guidance for humanity around the globe,” PM Shehbaz said. Highlighting that the Muslim ummah today confronts “formidable challenges [of] conflict, poverty and disunity, he stressed that it was “in these testing times that we need to hold on together to our values and ethics guided by our religion to be able to reclaim our lost place in the comity of nations”. Addressing the Pahang queen, the premier said Malaysia was blessed with a very young population and noted that “our responsibility as servants and as leaders is to provide them the right platforms to serve the cause of suffering humanity with compassion and with great commitment”. The prime minister read out a few verses of Dr Allama Iqbal and their English version as well. He expressed his wishes for IIUM’s continued success and for a “future of greater unity, brotherhood and very close coordination” for both Pakistan and Malaysia. In her remarks, the Pahang queen noted that Shehbaz had “served with vision, discipline and compassion” for four decades. “From your leadership in Punjab to your role as prime minister, you have shown true leadership is not about power but about purpose, about building lives and uplifting communities through education, healthcare and opportunities.” She highlighted that the Punjab Education Endowment Fund “opened the doors of higher learning to thousands who might never have dreamt of university education”. “That is leadership that touches hearts and transforms futures,” Iskandariah noted. Recalling that Pakistan was a founding partner of the IIUM, she said Pakistani students and alumni continue to “enrich the university and uphold our shared mission of serving the ummah”. The Pahang queen also mentioned the Palestine issue, saying “peace on earth and harmony among all mankind” was what “we truly need today with what is happening in Palestine”. In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said it was a “truly humbling experience” to be recognised with the honorary degree. “With great humility, I accepted this honour on behalf of the people of Pakistan as a symbol of the deep-rooted intellectual and cultural connection as well as people-to-people ties between Pakistan and Malaysia,” he added. In the afternoon, a post on the Pakistani government’s X account said PM Shehbaz had departed for Pakistan after concluding his visit to Malaysia. A day ago, PM Shehbaz and his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim held several meetings during which they resolved to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc. On the economic side, the premier termed PM Ibrahim’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”. Gobi Partners shows ‘keen interest’ in Pakistan’s e-commerce sector Separately, PM Shehbaz held a meeting with a delegation of Malaysian business group Gobi Partners, which “showed keen interest in collaboration in e-commerce and financial technologies in Pakistan”, according to state-run Radio Pakistan . Addressing the delegation, led by Gobi Partners’ co-founder and chair Thomas G. Tsao, the premier highlighted “immense potential” for enhancing cooperation in various economic sectors between the two countries. He welcomed Gobi Partners’ confidence in Pakistan’s startup ecosystem, assuring the delegation that the government was implementing “focused reforms to support startups and early-stage investors” via facilitating investments and providing better access to infrastructure, the report added. “Mobilising both domestic and international capital is our priority to develop a sustainable startup ecosystem,” he said. PM Shehbaz highlighted that the fintech, e-commerce, and IT services sectors form “the backbone of Pakistan’s national development strategy”. The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening economic and trade relations with Malaysia, saying: “The government is fully committed to creating a business-friendly environment and improving the ease of doing business in Pakistan.” Referring to the Pakistan-Malaysia Business and Investment Conference held yesterday, PM Shehbaz said such initiatives were a “welcome step towards promoting business-to-business linkages” between the two countries, Radio Pakistan added. The prime minister noted that the Special Investment Facilitation Council was providing all possible support and facilities to foreign investors. He highlighted the importance of the digital economy and expressed Pakistan’s readiness to welcome international business groups and investors with an interest in the country’s growing IT, technology, and artificial intelligence sectors. Malaysia to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan The premier’s official visit to Malaysia this week, at the invitation of PM Ibrahim, marks his first since he assumed office in 2024. This was highlighted in a joint statement issued by Pakistan and Malaysia today, posted by the High Commission of Pakistan in Malaysia on X. “Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1957, Malaysia and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan have built a partnership premised on mutual respect and shared values,” the statement said. It further highlighted the commitments of both leaders to strengthening this partnership via bilateral trade and investment, including Malaysia’s decision to import halal meat from Pakistan that was hailed by the prime minister. In turn, Malaysia expressed its intention to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan in line with increasing demand, according to the statement. “Both sides also agreed to further deepen the bilateral defence cooperation , particularly in the field of defence science, technology, and industry, through knowledge and technology transfer,” the statement read. Besides deciding to explore collaboration in healthcare , pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, the two premiers also agreed to enhance tourism promotion and cultural exchanges from both sides. The leaders acknowledged the importance of sustainable agricultural practices, energy security and healthcare, agreeing to explore joint research and innovation initiatives as well as partnerships in these sectors. Furthermore, the two sides noted the cooperation on issues within the framework of international organisations, particularly the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. ’ Both countries reiterated their shared commitment to “strengthening the solidarity of the Muslim Ummah and upholding the true values of Islam”, calling on the international community to combat “all forms of intolerance”, including Islamophobia and xenophobia. The leaders also discussed threats to peace and security in the region. In this regard, they both reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful and stable Afghanistan, as well as condemning the ongoing genocide in Gaza and reiterating their support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of a Palestinian state.",

      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Chinese weapon systems deployed during Pakistan’s four-day military conflict with India in May performed “exceptionally well”. During the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar reportedly said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) used Chinese J-10C jets in its response to India’s May 7 attack. A report by The Guardian had noted that Pakistan deploying J-10Cs would “mark the first time the Chinese planes — and the PL-15 missiles they were carrying — have been used in combat anywhere in the world”. In May, China had expressed ignorance about the use of its jets, saying it was “not familiar with the matter”. In July, however, the Chinese air chief commended the PAF’s “exemplary performance” in the May conflict. In an interview with Bloomberg , which was held last week and published yesterday, Lt Gen Chaudhry said: “Of course lately, recent Chinese platforms, they’ve demonstrated exceptionally well.” “We are open to all sorts of technology,” he added. Lt Gen Chaudhry was quoted as saying that Pakistan had recently raised its tally of Indian aircraft shot down to seven — up from a previous count of six. Recently, United States President Donald Trump also described how he confronted both nations during an active war that saw “ seven aircraft shot down ”. The DG ISPR also refuted Indian claims of Pakistan losing any planes. “Pakistan has never tried to play with figures and facts,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.\nPakistan said it downed six Indian jets in retaliation in May, including the French-made Rafale. India’s highest-ranking general has acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft. “The conflict marked the largest battlefield deployment of Chinese weaponry in recent history, with the J-10C as well as the PL-15 air-to-air missile seeing live documented fighting for the first time,” Bloomberg stated. During the escalation, shares of Chinese defence-manufacturing companies rallied as tensions between India and Pakistan boosted the outlook for mainland exporters. After the Indian political and military leadership made aggressive statements last week, repeating its terrorism allegations — which Pakistan has repeatedly refuted — the Pakistani military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “ cataclysmic devastation ”. A day later, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the May escalation, and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”. The May conflict was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation. Pakistan had said it downed six Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire .",

      "summary_orig": "At least seven people were injured on Tuesday after a blast on a railway track derailed four bogies of the Jaf­far Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district, according to officials. With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure. Speaking to Dawn.com , Shikarpur Deputy Commissioner Shakeel Abro said, “A blast had occurred on the train tracks at 8:15am. The incident occurred at a distance of 1km from the Sultan Kot railway station.” He said that the blast had caused the derailment of four bogies. Abro said that seven people had been injured, out of which four had been taken to the Combined Military Hospital, while the remaining three had been taken to the Civil Hospital in Shikarpur. He said that the Jaffar Express train was bound for Quetta via Jacobabad. Sukkur Deputy Divisional Superintendent Syed Moalim said that the blast occurred while the train was moving on the track. He said that a crane was being brought by railway officials to put the derailed bogies back on the track. Sukkur Divisional Transport Officer (DTO) Mohsin Ali Sial told Dawn.com that “passengers were being taken to nearby stations so that work could commence on repairing the track.” Shikarpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Shahzeb Chachar added that the remaining bogies had proceeded toward Jacobabad. He said that the blast had targeted a single track used by trains going to and from Quetta via Jacobabad. He maintained that police in Jacobabad and Shikarpur were trying to trace the culprits responsible for the incident. Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah condemned the incident. According to Radio Pakistan , Shah sought a report of the incident from the Sindh police inspector general. He also directed the Larkana commissioner to provide medical assistance to the injured passengers. In August, no loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express. The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board. The incident came just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.",

They held Judge Muha­mmad Jan and other court staff hostage, ransacking records and damaging office furniture and other items on the premises. “Armed terrorists stor­med into the court and set the courtroom and other sections of the Qazi Court on fire,” Deputy Inspector General of Police for Rak­h­shan region, Abdul Ha­yee Aamir Baloch, told Dawn. The court building was gutted, and the attackers also destroyed the court’s records. While fleeing after torc­hing the courtroom and other offices, the assailants kidnapped the judge at gunpoint. “The terrorists kidnapped the Qazi Court judge and also made off with two vehicles, including the judge’s official vehicle and that of a lawyer,” DIG Baloch said.
