      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Tuesday that Afghans were involved in major “high-impact” terror incidents in Pakistan in 2025. At the outset of the press conference, the military’s spokesperson said that the purpose of the briefing was to give a comprehensive overview of counter-terrorism measures taken in the past year. This “is the only purpose of this press conference, and I would request that we remain focused on counterterrorism as terrorism is the biggest threat that is being faced by the state of Pakistan right now,” he added. The DG ISPR said 2025 was a “landmark and consequential year in our fight against terrorism”, adding there were four reasons behind this conclusion. Saying that the fight against terrorism was the entire nation’s and was being fought for more than two decades, the DG ISPR further stated that the past year witnessed “unprecedented intensity in counter-terrorism efforts”. View this post on Instagram In 2025, he continued, the state of Pakistan, as well as the people, gained “complete clarity on terrorism”. “The state already had this clarity, which permeated slowly and gradually down[ward] that these terrorists are khawarij [and] they have no relation with Islam. They are Fitna-al-Hindustan and have no relation with Pakistan or [the people of] Balochistan,” he elaborated. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and it uses Fitna-al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Lieutenant General Chaudhry further highlighted that in 2025, the world accepted and acknowledged Pakistan’s stance and narrative regarding terrorism, particularly about Afghanistan having become a “base of terrorism” operations. Moreover, he said the last year also saw “how the National Action Plan (NAP) was reinvigorated and how it was being implemented”. In this connection, he also mentioned that the vision for Azm-i-Istehkam — a counter-terrorism operation that was launched by the military in 2024 — had also been drawn from the revised NAP, and that all political parties and segments of society had reached a consensus that the implementation of the NAP was necessary to eliminate terrorism. But “there are still deficiencies, and there is a lot of room for improvement” in the implementation of NAP, he acknowledged. After outlining these four factors as the reasons behind the declaration of 2025 as a “landmark and consequential year” in terms of counter-terrorism, the DG ISPR went on to speak about them in detail. .A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. He began with sharing data, according to which, law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 intelligence-based operations (IBO) in 2025. “Which comes down to 206 IBOs per day,” he said. Giving a breakdown, he said that of these operations, 14,658 were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan and 1,739 in the rest of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan during the last year, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc) and 29 from other areas. Moreover, 2,597 terrorists were killed in Pakistan in 2025, the DG ISPR said. Among them, 1,800 were killed in KP, 784 in Balochistan and 10 in other areas. Last year, he continued, 1,235 law enforcement personnel and civilians were martyred in the fight against terrorism during 2025. Sharing data about incidents of suicide bombing, he said a total of 27 had taken place in 2025. Of them, 16 took place in KP, 10 in Balochistan and one in Islamabad, at the judicial complex. “Out of them, two [involved] female suicide bombers.” In light of these facts and figures, he said, the question that came to mind was why the majority of terror incidents took place in KP. “The primary reason for this is the politically conducive environnment that is being provided [to terrorists] there, and the political-terror nexus that is flourishing there,” he said. The DG ISPR highlighted that data show that terrorism began rising from 2021. And a total of 193 terrorists were killed in comparison to 592 law enforcement personnel being martyred that year, he said, adding that it was a ratio of 1:3. Moving to 2025, he pointed out that 2,597 terrorists were killed during last year and 1,235 law enforcement personnel were martyred. This would reduce to a ratio of 2:1, he added. “But, more importantly, what happened in 2021 that terrorism rose?” he questioned, and went on to elaborate on the reason behind this development. The DG ISPR explained that there was a change in Afghanistan in 2021 following the Doha Agreement. “An armed group, the Afghan Taliban, sat down with the US and international partners and enter an agreement. Under the agreement, they made three commitments — that they will form an inclusive government in Afghanistan, use of Afghan soil for terrorism will not be allowed and women will be given rights [in Afghanistan],” the DG ISPR recalled. But were the commitments fulfilled, the military spokesperson questioned. “They were not. Is there a government there? There is no government there. They [just] call themselves interim Afghan government […] Is there an inclusive government there? No, there is not. “Has terrorism been eradicated [from Afghanistan]? Contrarily, Afghanistan becomes a hub of terrorists and non-state actors. Terrorists of different creeds operate from there. So that is what started happening in 2021.” Naming various terror outfits that the DG ISPR said were operating from Afghanistan, he said it had become a “centre point where terrorists of all kinds are being nurtured”. He said recently, around 2,500 terrorists, who were neither Afghans nor Pakistanis, had reached Afghanistan from Syria. The military spokesperson also said that the Afghan Taliban, “which is now the mother organisation” had started organising the TTP as per its organisational structure. They also trained and gave direction to the terror outfit, the DG ISPR. Moreover, Afghan Taliban built a “fake” narrative, boasting that they forced the US and international coalition forces to flee Afghanistan. “On the basis of that, they start further polluting the minds of youngsters, the youth, religious-minded people. They present themselves as the flag-bearers of Islam and increase their recruitment. “But if you analyse the matter, you will realise that they did not make them [coalition forces and the US] flee. There were other reasons for it.” The DG ISPR also spoke about war economy in this regard. He referred to a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which he said mentioned that around $144 billion were pumped into the reconstruction of Afghanistan. “When the [supply of] that money stopped, in order to continue to run the war economy, they [Afghan Taliban] spread the war in the form of terrorism in the entire region. And they find new patrons, new financial sponsors. And the biggest patron they find for terrorism in Pakistan is India.” The DG ISPR said India was using the Afghan Taliban as proxies and was providing them with financial and other assistance. “So the base of operations is being provided in Afghanistan by Afghan Taliban and India’s money and patronage [is available].” He added that Afghan Taliban were taking the assistance of sponsors from elsewhere too — wherever they were able to find them — to run the war economy. The military spokesperson further said that modern US equipment worth $7.2bn was left behind in Afghanistan. It included night-vision devices, long-range sniper rifles, bulletproof jackets, protection equipment, M-4 and M-16 — “the best of weapons and ammunition”. This equipment was “available to the Afghan Taliban, in the black market, to all these terrorist organisations”. Moreover, the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 began “internally facilitating [terrorists]” and decided to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played there (Afghanistan)“. This seemingly was a reference to talks held between the then-Pakistan government and the TTP. The DG ISPR went on to say that “once you give them (terrorists) so much space and so much wherewithal, you see a [rise] in terror incidents”. “Come 2023, that state starts standing against them.” He referred to a speech by the army chief following a blast in a mosque in Police Lines in Peshawar in 2023, adding that on that occasion, the army chief gave clarity on terrorism. “Entire Pakistan has that clarity now”. Further elaborating on this “clarity”, he used harsh language, stating that terrorists had no religious association, they had to be eliminated and action had to be taken against them. “But it takes time. Because if you have to fight them, you have to equip yourself, you have to train yourself, you have to adopt the right technology, you have to build that narrative, you have to take along the nation. “You saw this last year, which I said was a consequential and landmark year, when the tide started turning.” The military’s spokesperson acknowledged that questions were also raised on the large number of terror incidents — 5,397 in 2025. “Yes, this is a big number. Why? Because we are engaging them everywhere. We are doing 75,000 IBOs, 206 every day, and we are taking them on. “By we, I mean myself, you and everyone in Pakistan. We have absolute clarity that we have to win this fight, not by appeasement, but by force and strength. Because there are a few things in life fighting for which is not just justified but also necessary, and there is no option other than that.” He said when terrorism had reared its head in other countries, it had destroyed states. “But your state, your law enforcement agencies and your army are fighting on a daily basis.” Referring to a chart, he said it could be deduced from the data that after Pakistan defeated India during a four-day conflict in May 2025, a surge was seen in terrorism. After its defeat, “Indians immediately put in efforts into non-state actors”. The base of operations of those incidents was Afghanistan, he said, adding that Pakistan repeatedly urged Kabul to end cross-border terrorism. “And then we carry out strikes on terrorists on Pak-Afghan border in October, not on the Afghan Taliban or their posts. And what did the Afghan Taliban regime do, who is acting as proxies and a base of operations for Indians? They attacked Pakistani posts. They come in direct support of the terrorists. “So the State of Pakistan did what was necessary. Dozens of Afghan posts were obliterated within hours and a hard message was sent.” The DG ISPR said posts were not just obliterated at the border but also inside Afghanistan. The border was closed after that and then you saw terror incidents and facilitation of terrorists going down, he added. “The number of terrorists killed in the last three months after the border was closed in October rose to 276 per month. There are signs here for those who can understand.” He said parallels had been drawn Pakistan‘s actions in October last year and India’s in May 2025. He said those drawing the parallel trying to spin a narrative. In May 2025, India targeted Pakistan citizens but Pakistan did not target Afghans in October. “We targeted our own citizens who were present there and involved in terrorism in Pakistan. They have training centres there. “We knew TTP was present there. Did we target TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan)? No, we did not. “Only the state of Pakistan has the right to punish or reward its citizens in accordance with the law and Constitution of Pakistan. Who is India to cause harm to any Pakistani citizen?” He again asserted that in October strikes, Pakistan’s military targeted the TTP. The DG ISPR said Pakistan had been pressing the Afghan Taliban for the constitution of a verifiable mechanism, adding that Pakistan had evidence of where and to whom the Afghan Taliban had been providing refuge. Stressing the difference between India‘s and Pakistan’s cross-border strikes, he said whoever tried to point out similarities between the two developments was lying. They were trying to deceive the people, spinning a misleading narrative, the DG ISPR said. Listing 10 “major” incidents of terrorism in Pakistan in 2025. “And who are involved in all of these high-impact [terror incidents]? They are all Afghanis.” The DG ISPR said all 78 terrorists involved in the 10 major incidents were killed. “None of them goes back alive, and 60 civilians were martyred in those incidents. So the narrative they create that it is the military’s fight [is false]. This is the fight of the people. […] If we and you would not stand up against them, they will blow themselves in your homes, markets, offices, schools and streets, until you adopt their perverted ideology.” After playing “confessional statements by some terrorists”, he said that 16 of the terrorists killed in 2025 could be clearly identified as high-value targets. They included Amjad Ali, who was the second-in-command in the shura of the TTP. He then asked his audience to rise from their seats, and those in uniform to salute, to pay tribute to the “martyrs”, including the people of Pakistan and personnel of police, armed forces and the Federal Constabulary, who had lost their lives in terror incidents. Following that, the DG ISPR said there were three main pillars of the fight against terrorism. Essentially, it was intelligence-based, he said, but there were three main pillars of its final manifestation on the ground. The first among these pillars was the engagements on the Pak-Afghan border, the second was small-team offensive actions and the third was the technical surveillance and engagements, he explained. “These are the three pillars that are based on intelligence.” Speaking about technical surveillance and engagement, he said a narrative was created that Pakistan’s military was using drones. But in fact, it was the terrorists that began using those armed quadcopters, he said, adding that 405 quadcopters attacks by the terrorists were reported from KP alone. “Their patron — India — provides them with funds, technical inventory and other assistance. So they have now started going into this armed quadcopter business. They also have a special wing for quadcopters in their organisations. “They also use mosques, public places and houses, as human shields.” He explained that law enforcement bodies, including police and armed forces, were using drones only for technical surveillance. The military’s spokesperson mentioned that even the KP government had provided law enforcement bodies with quadcopters as terrorists had been using it. He added that law enforcement bodies did not use quadcopters in any built-up or populated area and ensured that there was no collateral damage. “It is important to brief you on this as a false narrative is being spun regarding this,” he remarked. “We use it with care, and your army does not cause any collateral damage. We hit only terrorists and their facilitators.” He said the army was not only engaged in kinetic action when it came to countering terrorism. It was also taking measures pertaining to “communication, engagement and social maneouvre“, he said. “In our view, this is even more important than killing the terrorists,” he said as videos of the military’s engagement with the public played in the background. “And the narrative they create that there is a law and order situation, there is gap between the public and the state — absolutely not. “I say with great pride that Pakistan’s people and the state are together.” He said the people of Pakistan now had clarity on what were Fitna-al-Khawari j and Fitna-al-Hindustan , on the India-Afghan Taliban terrorism nexus, on the other external sponsors of terrorism, on the international acknowledgement and acceptance of Pakistan’s stance on terrorism and on internal facilitators — most of whom were found in politics — of terrorism. Speaking about the India-Afghan Taliban nexus, he also played varius clips of the Indian media as a portrayal of the “collusion”. In this connection, he also mentioned those who “promoted terrorism under the guise of human rights and democracy”. Here, he specifically gave the example of a professor of the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, who the DG ISPR said had confessed to involvement in terrorism. The military’s spokesperson said the professor was defended by people in Pakistan and abroad, and showed social media posts by various users, including freelance journalist Kiyya Baloch, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Haazir.

He said recently, around 2,500 terrorists, who were neither Afghans nor Pakistanis, had reached Afghanistan from Syria. The military spokesperson also said that the Afghan Taliban, “which is now the mother organisation” had started organising the TTP as per its organisational structure. They also trained and gave direction to the terror outfit, the DG ISPR. Moreover, Afghan Taliban built a “fake” narrative, boasting that they forced the US and international coalition forces to flee Afghanistan. “On the basis of that, they start further polluting the minds of youngsters, the youth, religious-minded people. They present themselves as the flag-bearers of Islam and increase their recruitment. “But if you analyse the matter, you will realise that they did not make them [coalition forces and the US] flee. There were other reasons for it.” The DG ISPR also spoke about war economy in this regard. He referred to a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which he said mentioned that around $144 billion were pumped into the reconstruction of Afghanistan. “When the [supply of] that money stopped, in order to continue to run the war economy, they [Afghan Taliban] spread the war in the form of terrorism in the entire region. And they find new patrons, new financial sponsors. And the biggest patron they find for terrorism in Pakistan is India.” The DG ISPR said India was using the Afghan Taliban as proxies and was providing them with financial and other assistance. “So the base of operations is being provided in Afghanistan by Afghan Taliban and India’s money and patronage [is available].” He added that Afghan Taliban were taking the assistance of sponsors from elsewhere too — wherever they were able to find them — to run the war economy. The military spokesperson further said that modern US equipment worth $7.2bn was left behind in Afghanistan. It included night-vision devices, long-range sniper rifles, bulletproof jackets, protection equipment, M-4 and M-16 — “the best of weapons and ammunition”. This equipment was “available to the Afghan Taliban, in the black market, to all these terrorist organisations”. Moreover, the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 began “internally facilitating [terrorists]” and decided to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played there (Afghanistan)“. This seemingly was a reference to talks held between the then-Pakistan government and the TTP. The DG ISPR went on to say that “once you give them (terrorists) so much space and so much wherewithal, you see a [rise] in terror incidents”. “Come 2023, that state starts standing against them.” He referred to a speech by the army chief following a blast in a mosque in Police Lines in Peshawar in 2023, adding that on that occasion, the army chief gave clarity on terrorism. “Entire Pakistan has that clarity now”. Further elaborating on this “clarity”, he used harsh language, stating that terrorists had no religious association, they had to be eliminated and action had to be taken against them. “But it takes time. Because if you have to fight them, you have to equip yourself, you have to train yourself, you have to adopt the right technology, you have to build that narrative, you have to take along the nation. “You saw this last year, which I said was a consequential and landmark year, when the tide started turning.” The military’s spokesperson acknowledged that questions were also raised on the large number of terror incidents — 5,397 in 2025. “Yes, this is a big number. Why? Because we are engaging them everywhere. We are doing 75,000 IBOs, 206 every day, and we are taking them on. “By we, I mean myself, you and everyone in Pakistan. We have absolute clarity that we have to win this fight, not by appeasement, but by force and strength. Because there are a few things in life fighting for which is not just justified but also necessary, and there is no option other than that.” He said when terrorism had reared its head in other countries, it had destroyed states. “But your state, your law enforcement agencies and your army are fighting on a daily basis.” Referring to a chart, he said it could be deduced from the data that after Pakistan defeated India during a four-day conflict in May 2025, a surge was seen in terrorism. After its defeat, “Indians immediately put in efforts into non-state actors”. The base of operations of those incidents was Afghanistan, he said, adding that Pakistan repeatedly urged Kabul to end cross-border terrorism. “And then we carry out strikes on terrorists on Pak-Afghan border in October, not on the Afghan Taliban or their posts. And what did the Afghan Taliban regime do, who is acting as proxies and a base of operations for Indians? They attacked Pakistani posts. They come in direct support of the terrorists. “So the State of Pakistan did what was necessary. Dozens of Afghan posts were obliterated within hours and a hard message was sent.” The DG ISPR said posts were not just obliterated at the border but also inside Afghanistan. The border was closed after that and then you saw terror incidents and facilitation of terrorists going down, he added. “The number of terrorists killed in the last three months after the border was closed in October rose to 276 per month. There are signs here for those who can understand.” He said parallels had been drawn Pakistan‘s actions in October last year and India’s in May 2025. He said those drawing the parallel trying to spin a narrative. In May 2025, India targeted Pakistan citizens but Pakistan did not target Afghans in October. “We targeted our own citizens who were present there and involved in terrorism in Pakistan. They have training centres there. “We knew TTP was present there. Did we target TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan)? No, we did not. “Only the state of Pakistan has the right to punish or reward its citizens in accordance with the law and Constitution of Pakistan. Who is India to cause harm to any Pakistani citizen?” He again asserted that in October strikes, Pakistan’s military targeted the TTP. The DG ISPR said Pakistan had been pressing the Afghan Taliban for the constitution of a verifiable mechanism, adding that Pakistan had evidence of where and to whom the Afghan Taliban had been providing refuge. Stressing the difference between India‘s and Pakistan’s cross-border strikes, he said whoever tried to point out similarities between the two developments was lying. They were trying to deceive the people, spinning a misleading narrative, the DG ISPR said. Listing 10 “major” incidents of terrorism in Pakistan in 2025. “And who are involved in all of these high-impact [terror incidents]? They are all Afghanis.” The DG ISPR said all 78 terrorists involved in the 10 major incidents were killed. “None of them goes back alive, and 60 civilians were martyred in those incidents. So the narrative they create that it is the military’s fight [is false]. This is the fight of the people. […] If we and you would not stand up against them, they will blow themselves in your homes, markets, offices, schools and streets, until you adopt their perverted ideology.” After playing “confessional statements by some terrorists”, he said that 16 of the terrorists killed in 2025 could be clearly identified as high-value targets. They included Amjad Ali, who was the second-in-command in the shura of the TTP. He then asked his audience to rise from their seats, and those in uniform to salute, to pay tribute to the “martyrs”, including the people of Pakistan and personnel of police, armed forces and the Federal Constabulary, who had lost their lives in terror incidents. Following that, the DG ISPR said there were three main pillars of the fight against terrorism. Essentially, it was intelligence-based, he said, but there were three main pillars of its final manifestation on the ground. The first among these pillars was the engagements on the Pak-Afghan border, the second was small-team offensive actions and the third was the technical surveillance and engagements, he explained. “These are the three pillars that are based on intelligence.” Speaking about technical surveillance and engagement, he said a narrative was created that Pakistan’s military was using drones. But in fact, it was the terrorists that began using those armed quadcopters, he said, adding that 405 quadcopters attacks by the terrorists were reported from KP alone. “Their patron — India — provides them with funds, technical inventory and other assistance. So they have now started going into this armed quadcopter business. They also have a special wing for quadcopters in their organisations. “They also use mosques, public places and houses, as human shields.” He explained that law enforcement bodies, including police and armed forces, were using drones only for technical surveillance. The military’s spokesperson mentioned that even the KP government had provided law enforcement bodies with quadcopters as terrorists had been using it. He added that law enforcement bodies did not use quadcopters in any built-up or populated area and ensured that there was no collateral damage. “It is important to brief you on this as a false narrative is being spun regarding this,” he remarked. “We use it with care, and your army does not cause any collateral damage. We hit only terrorists and their facilitators.” He said the army was not only engaged in kinetic action when it came to countering terrorism. It was also taking measures pertaining to “communication, engagement and social maneouvre“, he said. “In our view, this is even more important than killing the terrorists,” he said as videos of the military’s engagement with the public played in the background. “And the narrative they create that there is a law and order situation, there is gap between the public and the state — absolutely not. “I say with great pride that Pakistan’s people and the state are together.” He said the people of Pakistan now had clarity on what were Fitna-al-Khawari j and Fitna-al-Hindustan , on the India-Afghan Taliban terrorism nexus, on the other external sponsors of terrorism, on the international acknowledgement and acceptance of Pakistan’s stance on terrorism and on internal facilitators — most of whom were found in politics — of terrorism. Speaking about the India-Afghan Taliban nexus, he also played varius clips of the Indian media as a portrayal of the “collusion”. In this connection, he also mentioned those who “promoted terrorism under the guise of human rights and democracy”. Here, he specifically gave the example of a professor of the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, who the DG ISPR said had confessed to involvement in terrorism. The military’s spokesperson said the professor was defended by people in Pakistan and abroad, and showed social media posts by various users, including freelance journalist Kiyya Baloch, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Haazir.

      "title": "DG ISPR says Afghans involved in major terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2025",
      "summary": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Tuesday that Afghans were involved in major “high-impact” terror incidents in Pakistan in 2025. At the outset of the press conference, the military’s spokesperson said that the purpose of the briefing was to give a comprehensive overview of counter-terrorism measures taken in the past year. This “is the only purpose of this press conference, and I would request that we remain focused on counterterrorism as terrorism is the biggest threat that is being faced by the state of Pakistan right now,” he added. The DG ISPR said 2025 was a “landmark and consequential year in our fight against terrorism”, adding there were four reasons behind this conclusion. Saying that the fight against terrorism was the entire nation’s and was being fought for more than two decades, the DG ISPR further stated that the past year witnessed “unprecedented intensity in counter-terrorism efforts”. View this post on Instagram In 2025, he continued, the state of Pakistan, as well as the people, gained “complete clarity on terrorism”. “The state already had this clarity, which permeated slowly and gradually down[ward] that these terrorists are khawarij [and] they have no relation with Islam. They are Fitna-al-Hindustan and have no relation with Pakistan or [the people of] Balochistan,” he elaborated. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and it uses Fitna-al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Lieutenant General Chaudhry further highlighted that in 2025, the world accepted and acknowledged Pakistan’s stance and narrative regarding terrorism, particularly about Afghanistan having become a “base of terrorism” operations. Moreover, he said the last year also saw “how the National Action Plan (NAP) was reinvigorated and how it was being implemented”. In this connection, he also mentioned that the vision for Azm-i-Istehkam — a counter-terrorism operation that was launched by the military in 2024 — had also been drawn from the revised NAP, and that all political parties and segments of society had reached a consensus that the implementation of the NAP was necessary to eliminate terrorism. But “there are still deficiencies, and there is a lot of room for improvement” in the implementation of NAP, he acknowledged. After outlining these four factors as the reasons behind the declaration of 2025 as a “landmark and consequential year” in terms of counter-terrorism, the DG ISPR went on to speak about them in detail. .A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. He began with sharing data, according to which, law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 intelligence-based operations (IBO) in 2025. “Which comes down to 206 IBOs per day,” he said. Giving a breakdown, he said that of these operations, 14,658 were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan and 1,739 in the rest of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan during the last year, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc) and 29 from other areas. Moreover, 2,597 terrorists were killed in Pakistan in 2025, the DG ISPR said. Among them, 1,800 were killed in KP, 784 in Balochistan and 10 in other areas. Last year, he continued, 1,235 law enforcement personnel and civilians were martyred in the fight against terrorism during 2025. Sharing data about incidents of suicide bombing, he said a total of 27 had taken place in 2025. Of them, 16 took place in KP, 10 in Balochistan and one in Islamabad, at the judicial complex. “Out of them, two [involved] female suicide bombers.” In light of these facts and figures, he said, the question that came to mind was why the majority of terror incidents took place in KP. “The primary reason for this is the politically conducive environnment that is being provided [to terrorists] there, and the political-terror nexus that is flourishing there,” he said. The DG ISPR highlighted that data show that terrorism began rising from 2021. And a total of 193 terrorists were killed in comparison to 592 law enforcement personnel being martyred that year, he said, adding that it was a ratio of 1:3. Moving to 2025, he pointed out that 2,597 terrorists were killed during last year and 1,235 law enforcement personnel were martyred. This would reduce to a ratio of 2:1, he added. “But, more importantly, what happened in 2021 that terrorism rose?” he questioned, and went on to elaborate on the reason behind this development. The DG ISPR explained that there was a change in Afghanistan in 2021 following the Doha Agreement. “An armed group, the Afghan Taliban, sat down with the US and international partners and enter an agreement. Under the agreement, they made three commitments — that they will form an inclusive government in Afghanistan, use of Afghan soil for terrorism will not be allowed and women will be given rights [in Afghanistan],” the DG ISPR recalled. But were the commitments fulfilled, the military spokesperson questioned. “They were not. Is there a government there? There is no government there. They [just] call themselves interim Afghan government […] Is there an inclusive government there? No, there is not. “Has terrorism been eradicated [from Afghanistan]? Contrarily, Afghanistan becomes a hub of terrorists and non-state actors. Terrorists of different creeds operate from there. So that is what started happening in 2021.” Naming various terror outfits that the DG ISPR said were operating from Afghanistan, he said it had become a “centre point where terrorists of all kinds are being nurtured”. He said recently, around 2,500 terrorists, who were neither Afghans nor Pakistanis, had reached Afghanistan from Syria.

They present themselves as the flag-bearers of Islam and increase their recruitment. “But if you analyse the matter, you will realise that they did not make them [coalition forces and the US] flee. There were other reasons for it.” The DG ISPR also spoke about war economy in this regard. He referred to a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which he said mentioned that around $144 billion were pumped into the reconstruction of Afghanistan. “When the [supply of] that money stopped, in order to continue to run the war economy, they [Afghan Taliban] spread the war in the form of terrorism in the entire region.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: A local sessions court on Tuesday extended the pre-arrest bail of content creators Rajab Butt and Nadeem Mubarak alias Nani Wala in a case pertaining to the promotion of gambling apps on social media. Strict security arrangements were made by the police when the two reached the court along with their lawyers. Additional District and Sessions Judge Mansoor Ahmed presided over the hearing, during which the counsel for the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) stated that the investigating officer was busy with proceedings before the Lahore High Court (LHC). Therefore, the NCCIA counsel asked the court to allow time for producing the record. Subsequently, Judge Qureshi extended the bail of both TikTokers till January 26 and directed the NCCIA to present the record at the next hearing. The judge had earlier allowed Butt and Mubarak to leave the courtroom after marking their attendance. The content creators are no strangers to legal trouble. In September 2025, Butt was booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting online gambling apps in his YouTube and TikTok videos, as well as on Instagram stories for limited periods of time. Nadeem was also booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting gambling apps on his social media, but he was also arrested in September for displaying a fake registration number – ‘IK-804’ – on his car. On being quizzed, he couldn’t satisfy the police with regard to displaying the fake registration number, which is associated with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan. Punjab Bar Council restores licence of Rajab Butt’s lawyer Separately, earlier in the day, the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) restored the practising licence of Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq, the counsel representing Butt . The decision came a day after LHC’s Justice Malik Awais Khalid heard a petition filed by Advocate Ashfaq challenging the suspension of his licence to practise law. The court had summoned the complete record of the PbBC about the licence suspension and also directed the council’s vice chairman to afford the lawyer an opportunity of a personal hearing and decide the matter by 2pm today. Advocate Ali Ashfaq speaking to the media outside Lahore High Court, Nov 18, 2025. — Social media/Mian Ali Ashfaq The PbBC had suspended Ashfaq’s licence on a complaint from the president and general secretary of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) for representing Butt before a Karachi court despite a strike called by the bar. On Tuesday, PbBC Vice Chairman Muhammad Ashfaq Kahooti said that Ashfaq’s licence had been “restored”. It stated that the same day the complaint against Ashfaq had been received, “a short notice was issued to him and, without affording him a proper opportunity of hearing, his licence to practice as an advocate was suspended” by the bar’s executive committee. However, the order noted that the objection raised by Ashfaq regarding the lack of authority of the PbBC’s executive committee was “turned down as the said contention is misconceived”. The vice chairman referred the matter to the council’s disciplinary committee for further proceedings and directed the office to inform the LHC about the decision. The PbBC order stated that Ashfaq had submitted an application in the shape of an objection petition challenging his licence suspension. His application argued that the December 31 order was a “clear violation” of Article 10-A of the Constitution, as well as the “principles of natural justice, as the order was passed in absentia without providing him an opportunity of hearing”. Ashfaq further contended that he had not “committed any misconduct either towards the legal fraternity or against the dignity of the legal profession”. The lawyer had described the complaint filed by KBA as “biased, mala fide, and motivated by certain members of its cabinet”. The KBA had called the strike in protest against the alleged victimisation of its former librarian, Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro. The PbBC’s December 31 order had noted that while defending his client, Ashfaq made statements against the legal fraternity, which the council described as serious professional impropriety. The PbBC’s executive committee then unanimously decided to suspend Ashfaq’s licence to practice law with immediate effect. It referred the matter to the council’s disciplinary committee for further proceedings regarding the permanent cancellation. Ashfaq has also been appearing as counsel for former spymaster Faiz Hameed in the trial concluded against him before a military court.",

      "summary_orig": "BANNU: The former nazim of Bannu district’s Domel tehsil, Fida Muhammad Khan Wazir, was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on Tuesday. Asif Hassan, the Bannu police spokesperson, confirmed the incident to Dawn , saying that a pre-installed improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated at the office gate in the Domel Bazaar area. Soon after it was reported, a heavy contingent rushed to the scene, cordoned off the area and formally initiated an investigation. Police and local sources said the explosion occurred outside the main gate of the former nazim’s office in Domel Bazaar. At the time of the blast, Wazir was present in his vehicle and sustained minor injuries, they said. As a result of the explosion, his vehicle was completely destroyed, while the office gate and the surrounding area also suffered damage, they added. It is worth mentioning that Wazir has previously played a leading role in peace movements against terrorism and remained at the forefront in forming tribal lashkars to establish peace in the area. On Tuesday, an important gathering of tribal elders was expected to be held at the same office. The former nazim was on his way to attend the meeting when the incident occurred. Meanwhile, tribal elders came out onto the streets and announced a strong protest and harsh response by gathering at the scene of the incident. Further, armed individuals were also spotted along the Bannu Kohat Road. The Bannu police spokesperson said the situation was being closely monitored. The incident comes a day after a man and his son, belonging to the Hathikhel tribe, were allegedly abducted by suspected terrorists in Bannu. Police and locals said on Monday that Ahya Jan and his son were travelling in a car with their family to visit their relatives in the area when unidentified armed men intercepted them near Jhandokhel in Domel, made them disembark from the vehicle and shifted them to an unknown location. On Sunday, a police constable was martyred when armed assailants shot him in Bannu‘s Kashfi Khel area. The same day, three traffic police personnel were martyred in firing by suspected terrorists in Lakki Marwat district’s Serai Naurang area, police said. On December 2, then-Miranshah assistant commissioner Shah Wali and two cops were among four martyred after the official’s vehicle came under attack in Bannu. Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.",

On Sunday, a police constable was martyred when armed assailants shot him in Bannu‘s Kashfi Khel area. The same day, three traffic police personnel were martyred in firing by suspected terrorists in Lakki Marwat district’s Serai Naurang area, police said. On December 2, then-Miranshah assistant commissioner Shah Wali and two cops were among four martyred after the official’s vehicle came under attack in Bannu. Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.",

      "summary": "BANNU: The former nazim of Bannu district’s Domel tehsil, Fida Muhammad Khan Wazir, was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on Tuesday. Asif Hassan, the Bannu police spokesperson, confirmed the incident to Dawn , saying that a pre-installed improvised explosive device (IED) was detonated at the office gate in the Domel Bazaar area. Soon after it was reported, a heavy contingent rushed to the scene, cordoned off the area and formally initiated an investigation. Police and local sources said the explosion occurred outside the main gate of the former nazim’s office in Domel Bazaar. At the time of the blast, Wazir was present in his vehicle and sustained minor injuries, they said. As a result of the explosion, his vehicle was completely destroyed, while the office gate and the surrounding area also suffered damage, they added. It is worth mentioning that Wazir has previously played a leading role in peace movements against terrorism and remained at the forefront in forming tribal lashkars to establish peace in the area. On Tuesday, an important gathering of tribal elders was expected to be held at the same office. The former nazim was on his way to attend the meeting when the incident occurred. Meanwhile, tribal elders came out onto the streets and announced a strong protest and harsh response by gathering at the scene of the incident. Further, armed individuals were also spotted along the Bannu Kohat Road. The Bannu police spokesperson said the situation was being closely monitored. The incident comes a day after a man and his son, belonging to the Hathikhel tribe, were allegedly abducted by suspected terrorists in Bannu.

      "summary_orig": "NEW YORK: Pakistan on Monday expressed “profound concern” over the developments in Venezuela, warning that escalating tensions in the country posed risks to regional and international peace and security. The statement was made at an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) summoned to discuss the recent developments in Venezuela. This is also the first meeting for the year of the UNSC, with Somalia in the chair. The US had launched a shock military operation in Venezuela on Saturday, with special forces capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in a nighttime raid . Pakistan’s Acting Permanent Representative Ambassador Usman Jadoon said in his address that at a time when the world was already facing multiple crises, instability in the region “does not augur well for regional and international peace and security”. He reminded Council members that the UN Charter bound states to refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, and to uphold sovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs and the peaceful settlement of disputes. Ambassador Jadoon added that unilateral military action contravened these “sacrosanct principles” as well as the doctrine of sovereign immunity, warning that such actions set dangerous precedents and risked eroding the foundations of the global legal framework. He cautioned that such actions also fuel instability, which, “as history has shown time and again, can lead to unpredictable and uncontrollable outcomes for years to come“. Calling for de-escalation, the Pakistani envoy said that at this critical juncture, “the path forward must be one of dialogue and diplomacy,” stressing that durable solutions to political differences could only be achieved through peaceful means and with full respect for the will of the Venezuelan people, free from external interference. He expressed hope that Latin America and the Caribbean, recognised as a ‘Zone of Peace’, would remain free from conflict and confrontation and continue moving towards enhanced regional cooperation and improved prosperity. The United Nations Security Council holds an emergency meeting to discuss recent US actions in Venezuela at the UN headquarters in New York City on January 5. — AFP Pakistan urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint, de-escalate tensions, refrain from actions that could exacerbate the situation, and engage in dialogue, including by utilising sincere offers of mediation. Jadoon noted that the offices of the secretary-general remained available for that purpose. Concluding his remarks, he reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to contributing constructively to the Security Council’s primary responsibility for addressing threats to international peace and security by diffusing tensions, promoting pacific settlement and upholding respect for international law and the UN Charter. “Peace and stability of Venezuela and the welfare and prosperity of its people, with full ownership, must be the overriding objective of all efforts,” he said. UN chief concerned about instability in Venezuela, legality of US operation United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres raised concerns about a possible intensification of instability in Venezuela after Maduro’s capture. “I am deeply concerned about the possible intensification of instability in the country, the potential impact on the region, and the precedent it may set for how relations between and among states are conducted,” Guterres said in a statement delivered to the council by UN political affairs chief Rosemary DiCarlo. Guterres called on all Venezuelan actors to engage in an inclusive and democratic dialogue, adding: “I welcome and am ready to support all efforts aimed at assisting Venezuelans in finding a peaceful way forward.” He also expressed concern that the US operation to capture Maduro in Caracas on Saturday did not respect the rules of international law. Pakistan urges restraint, dialogue on Venezuela ‘Surgical law enforcement operation’ As UN officials and several UN diplomats sharply criticised Washington’s intervention in Venezuela, US Ambassador Michael G. Waltz defended the action before the Security Council as a justified “surgical law enforcement operation”. “If the United Nations in this body confers legitimacy on an illegitimate narco-terrorist with the same treatment in this Charter as a democratically elected president or head of state, what kind of organisation is this?” Waltz asked. The US envoy said Washington had acted to apprehend two indicted fugitives, naming President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Celia Flores, and insisted the operation did not constitute a war against Venezuela or its people. He described Maduro as a fugitive and the leader of a “vicious foreign terrorist organisation”, alleging links to international drug trafficking networks that use “illegal narcotics as a weapon”. US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz speaks at a United Nations Security Council meeting at the UN headquarters concerning the situation in Venezuela on January 5. — AFP Waltz compared the action to the 1989 US operation that led to the arrest of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega. Citing broader human rights concerns, the ambassador referred to allegations of extra-judicial killings, torture and arbitrary detentions in Venezuela, and said more than eight million Venezuelans had fled the country. China’s representative said his country was “deeply shocked by, and strongly condemns” what he described as the United States’ “unilateral, illegal and bullying acts” against Venezuela. He accused Washington of “wantonly trampling upon Venezuela’s sovereignty, security and legitimate rights and interests“, placing power above multilateralism and military action above diplomacy. Warning of a grave threat to peace in Latin America and beyond, the Chinese envoy urged the United States to heed what he called the “overwhelming voice” of the international community and return to dialogue. Russian Ambassador Vassily A. Nebenzia condemned the United States for what he called armed aggression against Venezuela in violation of international law, urging Washington to immediately release the “legitimately elected President” and his spouse. Calling on Council members to abandon double standards, Mr Nebenzia warned against justifying “such an egregious act of aggression” out of fear of what he termed the “American global gendarme”. He further accused the United States of seeking control over Venezuela’s natural resources, saying its actions were generating “fresh momentum for neocolonialism and imperialism”. Following Maduro’s capture, US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that Washington would govern Venezuela until a “safe, proper and judicious transition takes place”. “We don‘t want to be involved with having somebody else get in and we have the same situation that we had for the last, long period of years,” the US president said. “So we’re going to run the country, until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition. We’re going to run it, essentially.”",

      "summary_orig": "IT’S useful to know the lay of the land that Donald Trump sought to breach with the kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. Is there a power vacuum after Maduro’s exit? Evidently not. Will the Bolivarian republic crumble before the firepower of America? Unlikely, in view of the fact that too much Russian, Chinese and Iranian investment has gone into buttressing Bolivarian rule for it to be easily scuttled. Remember that Hugo Chávez was also kidnapped in a coup staged by the CIA. But his people rallied and Chávez returned to lead the country until his mysterious early death. Tariq Ali, in his memoirs, You Can’t Please All has a chapter on his meetings with Chávez and Maduro. It’s titled “Was Hugo Chávez murdered?” There’s a distinct possibility his cancer was induced. The story, however, is about Donald Trump’s fear of Brics and his suspicion of the Bolivarian revolution Chávez launched after his electoral victory in Venezuela in 1998. This has irked the West. In this sense, the story hasn’t really moved forward since the Anglo-American Operation Ajax toppled Mohammad Mosaddegh’s elected government in Iran in 1953. That was about oil. Last week’s kidnapping of Maduro is also about oil even if the Trump administration is rowing back from its claim of running Venezuela. What role is Brics playing to worry Trump, so much so that two key Brics members, Iran and Venezuela, are in America’s constant crosshairs? They are both heavily sanctioned countries. With Brics becoming a cohesive financial and economic platform, the hold of sanctions as a tool of US coercion would most likely be rendered ineffective, a key worry for the US. Chávez’s Bolivarian revolution needs to be understood nicely for a good reason. Chávez leaned heavily on Simón Bolívar’s ideals of Latin American unity, sovereignty, and anti-imperialism. Simón Bolívar was the 19th-century liberator who led South America’s independence from Spain. However, dozens of roads and landmarks in the US and other Western countries are named after Bolívar. Chávez plotted something else. We don’t know how many Venezuelans were killed. But there was resistance. Nehru inaugurated a Simón Bolívar Road in Delhi’s diplomatic enclave in 1955. Bolívar inspired Nehru’s Non-aligned Movement and Third World solidarity. To the right-wing Narendra Modi government, the road would be an embarrassment. It was evident in the foreign ministry’s tame response to Trump’s attack on a Brics country. “Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation.” Thus spake the Brics host for later this year. In neighbouring Bangladesh, people took to the streets to protest the heist. Trump has strong reasons to want to oust the Bolivarian republic. Chávez rewrote the constitution that established new rights, strengthened the executive, and allowed for re-election. Funded by oil revenue, he launched vast social programmes targeting poverty. These included free community healthcare, staffed initially by Cuban doctors; a massive literacy campaign; a mission for subsidised food, housing, and university education. A Qadhafi-like irritant but in the Western hemisphere, a challenge to the Monroe Doctrine. In his adventurous attack on Venezuela, Trump looked like a quack dressed as a handyman assigned the task of staunching America’s slide as a Great Power. His bombing raids on seven nations last year defined his view of Pax Americana. His targets were Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Somalia and Venezuela. For all that and more, including the supervision of Israeli genocide of Palestinians, he demanded the Nobel Peace Prize, which went instead to a female Venezuelan dissenter who Trump cheered first but has distanced himself from after last week’s removal of Maduro to New York. Seymour Hersh noted that the bombings were inflicted without significant complaint from the Republican-led Congress. Easily the most significant concern for the US is the Venezuelan state taking control of key sectors of oil, telecommunications, electricity, steel, and cement. The constitution is committed to the redistribution of large, unused estates to peasants. Currency and price controls are implemented to combat capital flight and inflation, though they also contributed to economic distortions. Venezuela under Chávez/Maduro pursued Latin American integration outside US influence, promoting the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and offering subsidised oil for Caribbean nations. The revolution aimed to fundamentally transform Venezuelan society, moving it away from the neoliberal, two-party system that had dominated since 1958 and towards a model of ‘21st century socialism’. As usual, the news about the dangerous military intervention was used to highlight American intelligence and military prowess instead. Stories were circulated about the derring-do of the elite Delta Force commandos who seized Maduro and his wife by bombing their way into his heavily guarded palace. However, Cuba is mourning the death of 32 Cuban guards who were protecting the first family. They were killed in the air and ground mission. We don’t know how many Vene­zuelans were killed. But there was resistance, and that resistance is believed to be the signal for a rehearsed plan to turn a swoop on Venezuelan resources into a nightmare for Trump. Sensing the resistance, Trump threatened Venezuela’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, with the fate of her president. Tapped to take control of the country after Maduro’s removal to the US, Rodríguez has claimed that the operation to arrest him had a “Zionist tinge”. She warned that “the extremists who have promoted armed aggression against our country — history and justice will make them pay”. What role could Israel have played in the assault on a distant country? Not very different from the role that Iran has as a strategic ally of Bolivarian Venezuela. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar was quick to congratulate Trump, saying the US “acted as the leader of the free world”. But Trump’s ties with Israel have split his MAGA base. As he struggles to keep his majority in both Houses of Congress in polls due in November, Trump may have overplayed his hand in using the military to fix runaway domestic challenges.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is set to ignite a fresh wave of political activity in Sindh as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi embarks on a three-day tour of the province from Jan 9 to 11, aimed at energising the party’s newly launched street movement in Karachi and other cities seeking the release of incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan. The announcement was made on Monday by PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh during a press conference at party headquarters, Insaf House, where senior leaders vowed to take Imran Khan’s “clear and unequivocal” message directly to the people. Framing the tour as a turning point, Mr Sheikh said Imran Khan had personally entrusted CM Afridi with the mission of mobilising the masses and challenging what the party described as an assault on the public mandate. “PTI is not a party of one province or one city. From Karachi to Kashmore, from Hyderabad to Thar, Imran Khan’s message will echo through the streets of Sindh,” he added. Haleem Adil says KP chief executive will tour Karachi and other cities from Jan 9 to 11 According to the announced schedule, CM Afridi will depart from Islamabad on Jan 9 and arrive in Karachi at around 11am, where he will be received by party workers and supporters. A rally will then accompany him to Insaf House, followed by a series of meetings with party leaders and delegations. His Karachi engagements include interactions with traders at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a Meet with the Press at the Karachi Press Club, and street movements across districts South, Korangi and Malir. He is also expected to meet incarcerated PTI workers, which the party says underscores its campaign narrative of resistance and sacrifice. The momentum will carry into Jan 10 as CM Afridi travels to Hyderabad. On his route, he will be welcomed in Jamshoro by Sindh United Party President Syed Zain Shah. The Hyderabad leg features street protests in Kotri, addresses to the High Court Bar Association and Press Club, meetings with journalists, intellectuals and farmers, and a gathering at Insaf House Hyderabad. An ISF convention and city-wide street mobilisation are also planned before CM Afridi returns to Karachi later that night. On Jan 11, the focus shifts back to Karachi, with organisational meetings, media talks and street movements planned in District Central, Keamari, West and East. The KP chief minister will also visit Mazar-i-Quaid, where he is expected to address supporters, while the PTI Youth Wing launches a special mobilisation drive. The PTI Sindh chapter president said that a meeting between the chief ministers of KP and Sindh is expected on Jan 12, pending official confirmation. He added that senior PTI leaders, including Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja, ministers, and parliamentary leaders, will accompany CM Afridi throughout the tour. Warning against any obstruction, Mr Sheikh said PTI hoped the Sindh government would avoid “fascist tactics,” stressing that public mobilisation was a constitutional right. Declaring February 8, 2024 a “black day”, he said the party was united and ready to intensify its struggle for judicial independence and Imran Khan’s release. Published in Dawn, January 6th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Judiciary orders no leniency against ‘rioters’ amid unrest • Trump vows Tehran will ‘get hit very hard’ if it kills more citizens • 12 dead as protests expand to 45 cities; intelligence officers seize weapons cache PARIS: Iran refused on Monday to offer “rioters” leniency while defending citizens’ right to demonstrate , a defiant stance taken after US President Donald Trump warned Tehran would “get hit very hard” if authorities killed more demonstrators amid deadly unrest. Judiciary Chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei ordered officials to take a hard line against those causing instability as protests, which erupted over economic stagnation, expanded to include political demands. “I instruct the attorney general and prosecutors across the country to act in accordance with the law and with resolve against the rioters and those who support them… and to show no leniency or indulgence,” Mohseni Ejei said, according to the judiciary’s Mizan news agency. He added that Iran “listens to the protesters and their criticism, and distinguishes between them and rioters”. Demonstrations have taken place in 23 of Iran’s 31 provinces, affecting at least 45 different cities to varying degrees. The unrest has been concentrated in the west and consists mostly of small or medium-sized gatherings, according to an AFP tally based on official statements and media reports. At least 12 people, including members of the security forces, have been killed in localised clashes since Dec 30, officials announced. Since the protests began on Dec 28 — sparked when shopkeepers in the capital of Tehran staged a strike over high prices — officials have struck a conciliatory tone regarding economic demands while vowing to crush destabilisation. Trump threats Trump on Sunday told reporters aboard Air Force One that the US was watching the situation “very closely”. “If they start killing people like they have in the past, I think they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States,” Trump said. Iran’s economy has been hit hard by tough international sanctions. The national currency, the rial, has lost more than a third of its value against the US dollar over the past year, and inflation is in the double digits. To alleviate economic pressure, the government announced Sunday a monthly allowance for every citizen equivalent to roughly 3.5 per cent of the average monthly wage. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country stood “in solidarity with the struggle of the Iranian people and with their aspirations for freedom.” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baqaei, speaking at a press conference, accused Israel of trying “to exploit the slightest opportunity to sow division and undermine our national unity.” Israel fought a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined with limited strikes on Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities. Explosives seized Police intelligence officers in Tehran have identified a suspected hideout used by “rioters,” seizing “weapons, ammunition, and materials for making improvised explosive devices,” according to Mizan . The Fars news agency reported on Monday that “the trend observed on Sun­day night shows a notable decrease in the number of gatherings and their geogra­phic reach compared to previous nights.” While videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify, local media’s accounting is not exhaustive, and state-run outlets have downplayed coverage of the demonstrations. Most shops in Tehran were open Monday and residents went about their business. However, riot police were deployed at major intersections and officers were stationed outside some schools. Several universities have resumed classes, though only online. The reformist newspaper Arman Melli said Monday that authorities had “heard the voices of the protesters”, while the conservative papers Javan and Kayhan accused the United States and Israel of financially supporting rioters. Protests have also taken place among the Iranian diaspora. “With each new protest, Iranian men and women gain ground,” Sahar Aghakhani, a 29-year-old French-Iranian translator, said at a demonstration in Paris on Sunday. “Movement by movement, we’re getting closer to the end of the regime.” Iran has experienced several outbreaks of nationwide protests in recent years, most notably in 2022 over the death in custody of Mahsa Amini for an alleged breach of the country’s strict dress laws for women. The current protests have not yet reached the same scale. Published in Dawn, January 6th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE/GUJRAT: : Two incidents in Lahore and Gujranwala on Sunday night suggest tough days are ahead even for PTI supporters in Punjab. A sessions court on Monday granted pre-arrest bail to the qawwal after he was booked in a case for performing a song associated with ex-premier Imran Khan during a government-sponsored cultural event. In the first information report (FIR), the complainant, Shalimar Gardens in-charge Zameerul Hasan, alleged that qawwal Faraz Amjad Khan gave the event a “political colour” as he sung “ Qaidi No. 804 ” in reference to former prime minister Imran Khan. Additional District and Sessions Judge Shazaib Dar took up the bail application filed by the artist, who appeared before the court along with his lawyer. Faraz’s counsel submitted that the petitioner had no affiliation with any political party and that he performed the song at the request of participants in the cultural programme. Qawwal gets pre-arrest bail for singing a song linked to party leader; 7 wedding guests detained for raising slogans for Imran He requested the court to grant pre-arrest bail to the singer as he wanted to join the investigation to “prove his innocence”. After preliminary arguments, the judge allowed the bail till Jan 13 and sought the case record from the police. Baghbanpura police registered an FIR on Sunday night against Faraz for performing the song ‘ Nak Da Koka 2 Murshid ’ at the “non-political” programme organised by the Walled City of Lahore Authority on Jan 3. According to the complainant, the qawwal and his band members “deliberately sang an inciting political song without permission.” The administration then asked the singer to stop, which sparked public unrest and incitement, posing a risk to law and order. The case invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace), and 505 (1b) (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code. In the other incident, the Gujranwala district administration detained seven supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf after they chanted slogans carrying pictures of jailed party founder Imran Khan at a wedding function near Rahwali Cantonment. Gujranwala Deputy Commissioner Naveed Ahmed, on the basis of a report from the Gujranwala police, issued the detention orders of seven PTI supporters under section 03 of the maintenance of public order (MPO) for the period of 14 days from January 03. Earlier the local police had arrested the PTI supporters including Istikhar Ahmed of Talwandi Khajoor Wali, Tariq Mehmood of Lambawali, Kareem Bhinder of Rahwali, Zahid of Shareefpura, Imran Beig of Salamat Pura, Zeeshan of Kashmirpura and Ayaz of Tarragari. They were later sent to the Gujranwala district jail. These detained people had chanted slogans in favour of Imran Khan while carrying his posters at the stage of a wedding ceremony of Hassan Malik in a banquet hall near Rahwali. The local police reported to the administration that these PTI supporters had planned to stage a protest demonstration by blocking the main GT road in favour of the party leader.

According to the complainant, the qawwal and his band members “deliberately sang an inciting political song without permission.” The administration then asked the singer to stop, which sparked public unrest and incitement, posing a risk to law and order. The case invoked Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace), and 505 (1b) (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Pakistan Penal Code. In the other incident, the Gujranwala district administration detained seven supporters of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf after they chanted slogans carrying pictures of jailed party founder Imran Khan at a wedding function near Rahwali Cantonment. Gujranwala Deputy Commissioner Naveed Ahmed, on the basis of a report from the Gujranwala police, issued the detention orders of seven PTI supporters under section 03 of the maintenance of public order (MPO) for the period of 14 days from January 03. Earlier the local police had arrested the PTI supporters including Istikhar Ahmed of Talwandi Khajoor Wali, Tariq Mehmood of Lambawali, Kareem Bhinder of Rahwali, Zahid of Shareefpura, Imran Beig of Salamat Pura, Zeeshan of Kashmirpura and Ayaz of Tarragari. They were later sent to the Gujranwala district jail. These detained people had chanted slogans in favour of Imran Khan while carrying his posters at the stage of a wedding ceremony of Hassan Malik in a banquet hall near Rahwali. The local police reported to the administration that these PTI supporters had planned to stage a protest demonstration by blocking the main GT road in favour of the party leader.

The rally was organised by All Parties Kech in collaboration with traders, the Doctors Association and civil society. Marchers moved through main roads and streets of the district headquarters of Kech district, starting from Officer Bazaar, passing through various routes, reaching the Press Club and then proceeding to Shaheed Fida Chowk, where the march turned into a protest. “The protection of citizens is the responsibility of the state and its institutions,” National Party President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch said while describing the situation in Kech as “alarming”. Political leaders warn of district-wide strike Demonstrators demanded the recovery of two recently abducted youths, Haseeb Haji Yaseen and Shah Nawaz Gul Jan, and called on state institutions to protect citizens. Mr Malik, while demanding the recovery, warned that attempts were once again being made to push Kech toward instability, but said the people of Kech would resist such efforts. He urged the district administration to provide protection to citizens and said that for the past month, affected families and political leaders had approached relevant institutions, but each continued to shift responsibility to others. All Parties Kech Convener Nawab Khan Shambezai announced that a district-wide strike would be observed on Jan 7 if the two youths did not return. The Kech Bar Association boycotted court proceedings in solidarity with the families of the abducted. Advocate Syed Majeed Shah, the association’s president, condemned the kidnappings. Business activities and daily life have been severely disrupted by the recent wave of crime, according to local leaders. Mir Ghafoor Ahmed Bizenjo, a former minister, said that citizens were “living under a sense of fear” and called on the state to ensure public safety. Human rights defenders and other speakers at the rally said the insecurity affects the entire Makran region, demanding an end to the kidnappings that have particularly targeted the business community.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Overwhel­mingly led by Sindh, the country’s total contingent liabilities arising out of public-private partnership (PPP) projects — both at the Centre and the four provinces — exceeded Rs472 billion by the end of last month, according to the Ministry of Finance. In its first of the kind “ Fiscal Risk Monitoring Framework for Contingent Liabilities of PPP Projects ”, in line with commitments made to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the ministry’s Debt Management Office reported a total of Rs472.3bn in such liabilities as of Dec 2025. More than 71pc (Rs335.6bn) of the total pertained to contingent liabilities of the Sindh government, which has the largest portfolio of 17 PPP projects — almost half of 36 across the country. Total liabilities exceeded Rs472bn by end of last month The federal government’s total contingent liabilities against PPP projects amounted to Rs90.6bn, or 19.3pc of the cumulative amount, followed by Punjab at Rs26.5bn (5.6pc) and Rs19.6bn (4.2pc of the total) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. Balochistan has no such liabilities, although its five projects were among the 36 total PPP project portfolio across the country. In its latest written commitment to the IMF, the government had promised to improve the risk monitoring framework of public-private partnerships, including those at the provincial level. “We will subject PPP-funded projects to the same rigorous selection criteria applied to projects funded through other sources”, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said, adding that Risk Management Unit (RMU) in the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with other stakeholders, was in the process of establishing a monitoring framework for quantifying contingent liabilities related to PPPs for publishing estimates by end-December 2025. Contingent liabilities are those contractual obligations of the state for which public sector entities have assumed risks against these PPP projects and are calculated in nominal values calculated over the life of the contract. Of the total liabilities, Rs368.3bn pertain to contingent fiscal responsibilities that may accrue due to minimum revenue guaranteed by the respective governments against a specific project, cost escalation, interest rate fluctuations or terminal liabilities, while another Rs104bn have been pitched as financial guarantees. Cost escalation The report suggests Sindh’s direct contingent liabilities because of cost escalation, minimum revenue guarantee and terminal liabilities stand at Rs255.5bn, accounting for close to 70pc of the Rs368.3bn consolidated national amount. Sindh’s largest risk exposure for contingent liabilities stems from cost escalation estimated at Rs146.6bn, followed by Rs61bn for minimum revenue guaranteed by the provincial government to private partners. This is in addition to about Rs80bn in financial guarantees. The federal government’s total PPP liabilities of Rs90.6bn include Rs83.7bn on account of termination liabilities and Rs7bn in financial guarantees. Financial guarantees are instruments issued against a financial commitment agreed to be undertaken by the public sector like viability gap financing support. The report highlighted ‘high’ risk of these contingent liabilities becoming actually due on account of Rs150bn each for cost escalation and termination liabilities, Rs104bn on account of financial guarantees and about Rs66bn for minimum revenue guarantees, led by Sindh with Rs61bn. IMF stipulation The framework is required under the IMF programme to establish a consistent system for identifying, quantifying, and reporting contingent liabilities arising from PPP projects at both federal and provincial government levels. This is because the PPP contracts can create fiscal exposures that do not immediately appear in budget or debt statements, but could materialise later through guarantee calls, revenue support mechanisms, indexation adjustments or termination-related payments. The framework provides a uniform methodology to classify and quantify both direct and contingent liabilities and to consolidate these into a single national PPP fiscal exposure dataset managed by the RMU of the Ministry of Finance.

      "summary_orig": "The Sindh Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) said on Monday that a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi. Addressing a press conference alongside CTD Additional Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Ali Larik in Karachi, CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar said that law enforcement agencies and the “premier intelligence agency” received information that terrorists were planning an attack to target the city. Mahesar said that the terrorists were planning to attack specific targets in Karachi to “destabilise” national security. He said that intelligence agencies, the Special Branch, the Intelligence Bureau as well as Sindh and Balochistan CTD designed a strategy to thwart these plans. He said that intelligence officials were deployed in different locations, while focusing on Karachi’s west region. Mahesar said that after several days of robust efforts, officials succeeded in getting information on a terrorist hideout in Raees Goth, Karachi, where terrorists had prepared a large amount of explosive material. He said that upon receiving the information, Sindh CTD and the “premier intelligence agency” conducted a joint raid. “We captured one terrorist, while three or four of them managed to escape the scene,“ he said. Mahesar affirmed that the agencies had initiated a search operation to ensure their capture. “The officials recovered a Mazda truck loaded with explosive materials,” he said. He said 30 drums filled with explosives, five cylinders filled with explosives, 2,000kg of explosives and detonators had been seized. CTD Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Ghulam Azfar Mahesar addresses a press conference in Karachi. — DawnNewsTV He said that raids were conducted on six sites on the information provided by the terrorist who was arrested, after which another two terrorists were captured, who were also in possession of explosive material. He said a total of three terrorists had been arrested. Mahesar said that during the initial interrogation, the terrorists revealed that they were associated with the Bashir Zeb network of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade. Image shows explosive filled gas cylinders. — Photo via CTD The CTD official said that the additional interrogation and investigation was under way, and authorities were conducting raids to make more arrests. He further said that facilitators and handlers of this terrorist network were identified. “All the planning regarding the attack was done from outside the country,“ he said. The CTD official said that the facilitators and the handlers involved had been identified, adding that several teams were working on their arrest. Image shows plastic drums filled with explosives. — Photo via CTD He said that the explosive material that was shifted to the metropolis was “ready to go”, adding that this was a major achievement of all agencies that had prevented a major attack in Karachi.

The CTD official said that more details on this would be shared at a later date.",
