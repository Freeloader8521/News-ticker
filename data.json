      "summary_orig": "In a message on the 11th anniversary of the Army Public School (APS) attack, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said the nation stood firm and united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism. In the deadliest terror attack in the country’s history, at least 144 people ─ mostly schoolchildren ─ were killed when heavily armed militants stormed the army-run public school on Dec 16, 2014. Seven soldiers of the Special Services Group and two officers were among the wounded. In a message posted on his X account, PM Shehbaz said, “Today, we commemorate the martyrs of the APS Peshawar tragedy — the innocent children, teachers and staff whose sacrifice is forever etched in our national conscience. “Their sacrifice remains a constant reminder of our collective responsibility to defeat terrorism,” the premier stressed. “The Pakistani nation will always stand united, firm and unwavering in its resolve to eradicate the scourge of terrorism,” he added, praying for the families of the martyrs. In his message, President Asif Ali Zardari remembered the sacrifices of the children and the staff, vowing to stand with the families of the martyrs. “Today, we remember the innocent children and staff of the Army Public School whose lives were taken in the brutal terrorist attack on December 16, 2014,” he said in a message posted by his spokesperson on X. “Their sacrifice remains a solemn reminder of the heavy price our nation has paid in the fight against terrorism,” the president said. He vowed to stand with the families “who continue to bear this pain with courage”. “The nation will always honour the resilience of the APS families who transformed their grief into strength for Pakistan,” he stressed. He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to eliminating terrorism, stating that the country’s resolve remained “absolute”. “There can be no soft corner for terrorists or those who support, finance, shelter or justify them,” he said, emphasising that “there can be no negotiations with those who raise arms against the state or target our children”. “We strongly condemn Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” he went on to say. The evidence of its involvement in efforts to destabilise our country is well documented. Pakistan will continue to expose these hostile activities and will defend its people with full resolve,” he said. The president warned terrorists’ “apologists, facilitators, and supporters” that the armed forces will not “spare them and will defeat terrorism, no matter what political, ideological or fake religious garb they try to shroud themselves in”. President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence services “whose efforts have prevented many such tragedies.” “We will continue to pursue every terrorist and every facilitator until justice is done,” he added. “The memory of the APS martyrs strengthens our resolve. Pakistan will never allow the enemies of peace to succeed,” the president concluded.",

      "title_orig": "Bondi Beach suspect arrived in Philippines as Indian national, says Manila’s immigration department",
      "summary_orig": "The father and son behind one of Australia’s deadliest mass shootings spent nearly the entire month of November in the Philippines, Manila’s immigration department confirmed on Tuesday, with the father entering the country as an Indian national. Sajid Akram and his son Naveed, who allegedly killed 15 people and wounded dozens of others at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, arrived on November 1 with the southern province of Davao listed as their final destination. “Sajid Akram, 50, Indian national, and Naveed Akram, 24, Australian national, arrived in the Philippines together last November 1, 2025 from Sydney, Australia,” immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told AFP , adding they departed on November 28. Australian police said on Tuesday both men had travelled to the Philippines last month and the purpose of the trip is under investigation. Philippines police have said they are investigating the matter. Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. They have been reduced to weakened cells operating in the southern Mindanao island in recent years, far from the scale of influence they wielded during the 2017 Marawi siege. “Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State, allegedly committed by a father and son,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said at a news conference. “These are the alleged actions of those who have aligned themselves with a terrorist organisation, not a religion.” Police also said the vehicle which is registered to the younger male contained improvised explosive devices and two homemade flags associated with ISIS, or Islamic State, a militant group designated by Australia and many other countries as a terrorist organisation. The father and son allegedly fired upon hundreds of people at the festival during a roughly 10-minute killing spree at one of Australia’s top tourist destinations, forcing people to flee and take shelter before both were shot by police. Some 25 survivors are receiving care in several Sydney hospitals, officials said. Australian PM says ‘Islamic State ideology’ drove Bondi Beach gunmen The father and son were driven by “Islamic State ideology” when they fired on crowds at Bondi Beach, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday. “It would appear that this was motivated by Islamic State ideology,” Albanese told national broadcaster ABC . “With the rise of ISIS more than a decade ago now, the world has been grappling with extremism and this hateful ideology,” he said in a separate interview. Albanese said Naveed, reportedly an unemployed bricklayer, had come to the attention of Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019 but was not considered an imminent threat at the time. “They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” Albanese said. “He was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.” Memorial of flowers Israeli Ambassador Amir Maimon visited Bondi on Tuesday and urged the Australian government to take all required steps to secure the lives of Jews in Australia. “Only Australians of Jewish faith are forced to worship their gods behind closed doors, CCTV, guards,” Maimon told reporters in Bondi, after laying flowers at the temporary memorial and paying his respects to the victims. “My heart is torn apart … it is insane.” A string of anti-Semitic incidents in Australia has unfolded in the past 16 months, prompting the head of the nation’s main intelligence agency to declare that anti-Semitism was his top priority in terms of threat to life. At Bondi, the beach was open on Tuesday but was largely empty under overcast skies, as a growing memorial of flowers was established at the Bondi Pavilion, metres from the location of the shootings. Bondi is Sydney’s best-known beach, located about 8.2km (5 miles) from the city centre, and draws hundreds of thousands of international tourists each year. Olivia Robertson, 25, visited the memorial before work. “This is the country that our grandparents have come to for us to feel safe and to have opportunity,” she said. “And now this has happened right here in our backyard. It’s pretty shocking.” Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old Muslim father-of-two who charged at one of the gunmen and seized his rifle, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds. He has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump. A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.9 million ($1.26 million). Tougher gun laws Australia’s gun laws are now being examined by the federal government, after police said Sajid Akram was a licenced gun owner and had six registered weapons. Akram received his gun licence in 2023, not 2015 as had been earlier stated, police said on Tuesday. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said gun laws introduced by the previous conservative Liberal-National coalition government following the Port Arthur massacre needed to be re-examined. Former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the gun restrictions in 1996, said on Tuesday he didn’t want to see gun law reform become a “diversion” from the need to tackle anti-Semitism. Albanese had let the Jewish community down, Howard told reporters. “He should have done more to fight anti-Semitism, a lot more,” he said. The 15 victims ranged from a rabbi who was a father of five, to a Holocaust survivor, to a 10-year-old girl named Matilda Britvan, according to interviews, officials and media reports. Two police officers remained in critical but stable condition in hospital, New South Wales police said. Matilda’s aunt has spoken publicly of her family’s heartbreak, saying they were devastated by her death. “I am beyond belief that this happened. I look on the phone and I am hoping it’s like a little big joke, not real,” Lina Chernykh told 7NEWS Australia.",

      "title_orig": "False notes in a vexed song",
      "summary_orig": "TWO essential components of any song are its tune and its words. Most Indians can’t sing the lines of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s 19th-century nationalist song Vande Mataram in tune; and an equal number, or possibly even more, would struggle to divine the meaning of its heavily Sanskrit verses. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi still staged a 10-hour debate on the 19th-century song in parliament, wasting time and treasure to the tune of Rs250,000 per minute needed to run a House in session. It can’t be too different with Pakistan’s predominantly Turko-Persian national anthem, which may be beyond the ken of the country’s ordinary Balochi, Sindhi, Punjabi or Pashto-speaking people. It is said that the only purely Urdu word in Pakistan’s anthem is ‘ka’, meaning ‘of’. All other words are of Persian or Turkic origin. A Bangladeshi or a Sri Lankan is less likely to not know what their national songs mean. National songs or anthems are often imposed from above, in which case they tend to exclude the diversity of the masses they purport to represent. On the flip side, the songs can be constructed to celebrate the cornucopia of plurality that faithfully describes a people. South Africa’s post-liberation anthem is composed and sung in five languages to reflect the nation’s alluring cultural mix. For another example, take New Zealand. Its national anthem God Defend New Zealand is sung in both Maori and English, typically with the first verse in native Maori followed by the same verse in English, acknowledging the nation’s bicultural heritage. Rabindranath Tagore first selected Vande Mataram from Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s novel Anandmath and set it to tune in R aag Desh , an evening melody. By the time it travelled to Maharashtra, Vishnupant Pagnis sang it in another alluring composition in Raag Miyan ki Saarang , a late morning melody. The novel’s theme is a biased and divisive depiction of an anti-colonial rebellion by Hindu sanyasis and Muslim fakirs, two ascetic communities in undivided Bengal. Bonding with Bengali peasants, the fakir-sanyasi rebellion was triggered by the Great Bengal Famine of 1770 for which they held the East India Company accountable. When Bankim wrote Anandmath a century later, a totally communalised narrative had crept in. National songs or anthems are often imposed from above, in which case they tend to exclude the diversity of the masses they purport to represent. In historical accounts of the revolt, the main enemy was the East India Company and its economic policies. In the Bankim version, the Muslim nawabs of Bengal, emasculated stooges of British rulers, and British administrators were projected as the dual oppressors. In truer history, the triggers were exploitation, famine and mass displacement. In Bankim’s version, religious nationalism was invoked to a holy motherland. He also airbrushed Muslim ascetics and peasants, portraying the Hindu ‘santaans’, or children of the motherland alone as having revolted. Anandmath thus turned a secular socioeconomic struggle into a proto-nationalist war for a Hindu nation. Moreover, the invectives Bankim reserved for Muslims were no different from the ones in vogue today under Narendra Modi’s watch. Though the novel by the highly regarded literary figure of his time is perplexing in its anti-Muslim vitriol, the poem/song is harmless. For, if the objection is to a song praising Hindu deities, then Mohammed Rafi, Naushad Ali, Shakeel Badayuni and many other Indian musicians would be seen as guilty of abandoning their beliefs to sing Hindu bhajans. Their songs have bequeathed an aura of spirituality to a genre of music that appeals to India’s secular timbre in the same way as Hindu singer Kamla Jharia praises Islam’s leading figures or Lata Mangeshkar renders religiously framed verses of Allama Iqbal. It’s the context of the novel in which the poem is situated that makes the song controversial. Let’s say ‘Jai Shri Ram’ is a fine incantation but it becomes terrifying when it’s arbitrarily imposed or used to attack minority communities, be they Muslim, Christian or Sikh. Bankim initially wrote the first two stanzas to extol the beauty of Bengal, which he saw as his motherland. The poem describes Bengal’s soothing air and clear water streams, both of which have become a rare commodity in Bengal and in much of India. In fact, as Delhi was choking with record high AQIs around the time of the Bankim poem discussion last week, the government released a paper in parliament claiming that no deaths were recorded as linked to the murderous air quality in India’s capital. There’s also an old video clip circulating of Modi misleading schoolchildren about global warming. “As we get old, we begin to feel hot and cold a little more,” he claimed. Instead of discussing similarly urgent issues pla­­guing the country, Modi as is his wont, cynically preferred a meaningless discussion to hurl some more invectives on his bête noire, Jawaharlal Nehru, claiming he excised the religious part of the song to appease Muslims, a claim not supported by history. The song, which is hardly an issue in large swathes of India — for instance in Nagaland, Kerala or Tamil Nadu — was used to test its polarising efficacy ahead of the crucial West Bengal assembly elections due in March 2026. While Indian Muslims scarcely care about the controversy today, the entire corpus of Arya Samaji Hindus also shuns worship of any deity in the traditional way that many Hindus do. Their belief system is based on a monotheistic interpretation of the Vedas, which prohibits the worship of multiple deities. Also, Dalits converted to Buddhism under Bhimrao Ambedkar’s oath that severely forbade them from worshipping Hindu deities, including those eulogised in the Bankim song. The Vande Mataram controversy is being rekindled by right-wing Sanatani Hindus as another arrow in the communal quiver to devise cynical electoral strategies. The question remains though as to how many Indians really care beyond the two igniting words — ‘Vande Mataram’, praise be to the motherland — that had once become a clarion call in India’s freedom struggle but also played a role in its partition.

      "summary_en": "TWO essential components of any song are its tune and its words. Most Indians can’t sing the lines of Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s 19th-century nationalist song Vande Mataram in tune; and an equal number, or possibly even more, would struggle to divine the meaning of its heavily Sanskrit verses. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi still staged a 10-hour debate on the 19th-century song in parliament, wasting time and treasure to the tune of Rs250,000 per minute needed to run a House in session. It can’t be too different with Pakistan’s predominantly Turko-Persian national anthem, which may be beyond the ken of the country’s ordinary Balochi, Sindhi, Punjabi or Pashto-speaking people. It is said that the only purely Urdu word in Pakistan’s anthem is ‘ka’, meaning ‘of’. All other words are of Persian or Turkic origin. A Bangladeshi or a Sri Lankan is less likely to not know what their national songs mean. National songs or anthems are often imposed from above, in which case they tend to exclude the diversity of the masses they purport to represent. On the flip side, the songs can be constructed to celebrate the cornucopia of plurality that faithfully describes a people. South Africa’s post-liberation anthem is composed and sung in five languages to reflect the nation’s alluring cultural mix. For another example, take New Zealand. Its national anthem God Defend New Zealand is sung in both Maori and English, typically with the first verse in native Maori followed by the same verse in English, acknowledging the nation’s bicultural heritage. Rabindranath Tagore first selected Vande Mataram from Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s novel Anandmath and set it to tune in R aag Desh , an evening melody. By the time it travelled to Maharashtra, Vishnupant Pagnis sang it in another alluring composition in Raag Miyan ki Saarang , a late morning melody. The novel’s theme is a biased and divisive depiction of an anti-colonial rebellion by Hindu sanyasis and Muslim fakirs, two ascetic communities in undivided Bengal. Bonding with Bengali peasants, the fakir-sanyasi rebellion was triggered by the Great Bengal Famine of 1770 for which they held the East India Company accountable. When Bankim wrote Anandmath a century later, a totally communalised narrative had crept in. National songs or anthems are often imposed from above, in which case they tend to exclude the diversity of the masses they purport to represent. In historical accounts of the revolt, the main enemy was the East India Company and its economic policies. In the Bankim version, the Muslim nawabs of Bengal, emasculated stooges of British rulers, and British administrators were projected as the dual oppressors. In truer history, the triggers were exploitation, famine and mass displacement. In Bankim’s version, religious nationalism was invoked to a holy motherland. He also airbrushed Muslim ascetics and peasants, portraying the Hindu ‘santaans’, or children of the motherland alone as having revolted. Anandmath thus turned a secular socioeconomic struggle into a proto-nationalist war for a Hindu nation. Moreover, the invectives Bankim reserved for Muslims were no different from the ones in vogue today under Narendra Modi’s watch. Though the novel by the highly regarded literary figure of his time is perplexing in its anti-Muslim vitriol, the poem/song is harmless. For, if the objection is to a song praising Hindu deities, then Mohammed Rafi, Naushad Ali, Shakeel Badayuni and many other Indian musicians would be seen as guilty of abandoning their beliefs to sing Hindu bhajans. Their songs have bequeathed an aura of spirituality to a genre of music that appeals to India’s secular timbre in the same way as Hindu singer Kamla Jharia praises Islam’s leading figures or Lata Mangeshkar renders religiously framed verses of Allama Iqbal.

      "summary_orig": "GWADAR: A large group of armed men looted millions of rupees from three private banks while counter-terrorism department (CTD) personnel along with local police foiled two other bank robberies after heavy gun battle in Panjgur on Monday. A CTD official and a civilian lost their lives and three other police personnel injured in a heavy exchange of fire took place as the armed robbers atte­mpted to loot two other banks, including National Bank of Pakistan, in Chitkan Bazaar. Officials said over 50 heavily armed men arrived in the area in several vehicles and barged into three banks in the main bazaar area and looted millions of rupees after holding the security guards and staff hostage at gun point. After looting three private banks, the armed men then attempted to enter the NBP and another bank. In the meantime, officials said, police and CTD personnel reached the site and challenged them. Police claim to have foiled two more bank heists “Armed men used heavy weapons in the gun battle and lobbed grenades, which continued for at least an hour,” SSP Dost Muhammad Bugti said, adding police and CTD officials returned fire. During the exchange of fire, the CTD official, Dura Baloch, and the civilian, Amanullah, emb­r­aced martyrdom and three other cops suffered injuries, while armed robbers fled, police said. “The armed men belonged to a banned militant organisation,” an official of the local administration said on the condition of anonymity. According to some media reports, armed men looted around Rs190 million from three banks. Security officials said that an operation was launched in the area to trace out the armed gang. However, no arrest was reported till filing of this report on late Monday night. Eyewitness account said the bodies and injured were shifted to Panjgur district hospital. Two CTD and police personnel were shifted to Karachi as they rece­ived serious injuries, they said. While lauding the timely and courageous response of the law enforcement personnel, Baloch­istan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said CTD and police personnel demonstrated exceptional bravery and professionalism in safeguarding the lives and property of citizens. The chief minister paid tribute to martyred CTD constable Dura Baloch, saluting his courage, sense of duty, and supreme sacrifice. He said the sacrifices of brave sons like Dara Khan would never be forgotten and that the nation remains indebted to the blood of its martyrs. Expressing heartfelt condolences to the family of the martyred civilian, the chief minister prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the deceased. He reiterated that there was no place for terrorists and criminal elements in Balochistan and vowed that the state would continue operations against anti-state elements with full force. Mr Bugti emphasised the sacrifices of security forces for the restoration of peace and order would not go in vain and assured that the protection of life and property of the people would be ensured at all costs.

After looting three private banks, the armed men then attempted to enter the NBP and another bank. In the meantime, officials said, police and CTD personnel reached the site and challenged them. Police claim to have foiled two more bank heists “Armed men used heavy weapons in the gun battle and lobbed grenades, which continued for at least an hour,” SSP Dost Muhammad Bugti said, adding police and CTD officials returned fire. During the exchange of fire, the CTD official, Dura Baloch, and the civilian, Amanullah, emb­r­aced martyrdom and three other cops suffered injuries, while armed robbers fled, police said. “The armed men belonged to a banned militant organisation,” an official of the local administration said on the condition of anonymity. According to some media reports, armed men looted around Rs190 million from three banks. Security officials said that an operation was launched in the area to trace out the armed gang. However, no arrest was reported till filing of this report on late Monday night. Eyewitness account said the bodies and injured were shifted to Panjgur district hospital. Two CTD and police personnel were shifted to Karachi as they rece­ived serious injuries, they said. While lauding the timely and courageous response of the law enforcement personnel, Baloch­istan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said CTD and police personnel demonstrated exceptional bravery and professionalism in safeguarding the lives and property of citizens. The chief minister paid tribute to martyred CTD constable Dura Baloch, saluting his courage, sense of duty, and supreme sacrifice. He said the sacrifices of brave sons like Dara Khan would never be forgotten and that the nation remains indebted to the blood of its martyrs. Expressing heartfelt condolences to the family of the martyred civilian, the chief minister prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the deceased. He reiterated that there was no place for terrorists and criminal elements in Balochistan and vowed that the state would continue operations against anti-state elements with full force. Mr Bugti emphasised the sacrifices of security forces for the restoration of peace and order would not go in vain and assured that the protection of life and property of the people would be ensured at all costs. Saleem Shahid from Quetta also contributed to this report. Published in Dawn, December 16th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump sued the BBC on Monday for defamation over edited clips of a speech that made it appear he directed supporters to storm the US Capitol , opening an international front in his fight against media coverage he deems untrue or unfair. Trump accused Britain’s publicly owned broadcaster of defaming him by splicing together parts of a January 6, 2021 speech, including one section where he told supporters to march on the Capitol and another where he said “fight like hell”. It omitted a section in which he called for peaceful protest. Trump’s lawsuit alleges the BBC defamed him and violated a Florida law that bars deceptive and unfair trade practices. He is seeking $5 billion in damages for each of the lawsuit’s two counts. The BBC has apologised to Trump, admitted an error of judgment and acknowledged that the edit gave the mistaken impression that he had made a direct call for violent action. But it has said there is no legal basis to sue. Trump, in his lawsuit filed on Monday in Miami federal court, said the BBC despite its apology “has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses”. The BBC is funded through a mandatory license fee on all TV viewers, which UK lawyers say could make any payout to Trump politically fraught. A spokesman for Trump’s legal team said in a statement the BBC “has a long pattern of deceiving its audience in coverage of President Trump, all in service of its own leftist political agenda”. A BBC spokesperson told Reuters earlier on Monday that it had “no further contact from President Trump’s lawyers at this point. Our position remains the same.” The broadcaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment after the lawsuit was filed. Crisis led to resignations Facing one of the biggest crises in its 103-year history, the BBC has said it has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary on any of its platforms. The dispute over the clip, featured on the BBC’s ‘Panorama’ documentary show shortly before the 2024 presidential election, sparked a public relations crisis for the broadcaster, leading to the resignations of its two most senior officials. Trump’s lawyers say the BBC caused him overwhelming reputational and financial harm. The documentary drew scrutiny after the leak of a BBC memo by an external standards adviser that raised concerns about how it was edited, part of a wider investigation of political bias at the publicly funded broadcaster. The documentary was not broadcast in the United States. Trump may have sued in the US because defamation claims in Britain must be brought within a year of publication, a window that has closed for the ‘Panorama’ episode. To overcome the US constitution’s legal protections for free speech and the press, Trump will need to prove not only that the edit was false and defamatory but also that the BBC knowingly misled viewers or acted recklessly. The broadcaster could argue that the documentary was substantially true and its editing decisions did not create a false impression, legal experts said. It could also claim the program did not damage Trump’s reputation. Other media have settled with Trump, including CBS and ABC when Trump sued them following his comeback win in the November 2024 election. Trump has filed lawsuits against the New York Times , the Wall Street Journal and a newspaper in Iowa, all three of which have denied wrongdoing. The attack on the US Capitol in January 2021 was aimed at blocking Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s presidential win over Trump in the 2020 US election.",

According to the state-run APP , the minister said the government recently provided foreign media with background information on how terrorists and organised networks were exploiting social media platforms to manipulate public opinion in Pakistan. The minister explained that investigations revealed how artificial trends were created and sold through WhatsApp groups and other platforms. He said individuals were paid small amounts ranging from a few rupees to cents per post to repeatedly tweet or forward messages, sometimes hundreds of times a day. Many of these accounts, he said, originate outside Pakistan and are operated by companies using fake identities. He added that account names are frequently changed depending on the campaign being promoted, making it harder to trace their origins. The state minister claimed the same networks had been found promoting content linked to terrorist organisations, as well as ‘unrelated international causes’, demonstrating that the activity was commercial rather than ideological. These trends are not organic or natural, he added. Mr Chaudhry clarified that the evidence shared was gathered directly from the same social media platforms being misused, including details of temporary WhatsApp groups formed to run trends and then deleted to avoid detection. He said social media companies’ own community guidelines were being violated, leading to account closures and further action by the platforms. While emphasising that the government did not want ordinary citizens to face criminal cases, the minister issued a clear warning, saying that if people knowingly became part of paid trends that were against the country, they could face legal consequences. Freedom of expression is not without responsibility, he said, claiming that no one had the right to hurt religious sentiments, target friendly countries, or malign individuals and institutions under the guise of free speech. Responding to questions, Mr Chaudhry stated that most accounts involved were fake and that privacy laws limited access to IP addresses and ownership details, although Pakistan was engaging with platforms and foreign governments to address the issue. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm condemnation of terrorism in all forms, anywhere in the world, noting that the country has long been on the front line in the global fight against terrorism. The press conference, he said, was aimed at dispelling the notion that controversial online narratives reflected genuine public opinion. This is not popularity. This is a money-driven mechanism operated through fake accounts across the world, Mr Chaudhry said, adding that Pakistan would continue to work with international partners to curb such activities. PTI blamed Mr Chaudhry also accused PTI-linked social media accounts of receiving foreign funding to promote the “enemy’s narrative and target institutions by creating anti-state trends”. He said that PTI social media accounts were being operated from abroad, mainly from North America, Europe, and some parts of South Asia, and were used specifically to create trends. He alleged that a malicious campaign was being run against state institutions on social media, vowing that no compromise would be made on national sovereignty. He regretted that the PTI was using social media to promote a ‘specific narrative’ and said coordinated campaigns were allegedly launched to unleash propaganda against national security. He alleged that some companies auction and sell trends and hashtags. He said certain elements were actively working against the country’s sovereignty, reiterating that the government would not compromise on national security.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s Special Representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq on Monday shared “concerns over the large number of terrorists in the neighbourhood, hindering regional economic integration and posing serious security challenges.” In a post on X, Sadiq, who also holds the special assistant to the prime minister portfolio, said he had held separate meetings with his counterparts from China and Uzbekistan on the sidelines of the Afghanistan Neighbours Conference in Tehran. “We agreed that collective efforts needed to address this threat,” he said. Separately, senior diplomats of Afghanistan’s six neighbouring countries and Russia, who met in Tehran on Sunday, supported all efforts to reduce tension between Pakistan and Afghanistan. They expressed their readiness to help strengthen these efforts, an Iranian government statement said on Monday. Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported that the participants also called on Islamabad and Kabul to return to the negotiating table and resolve their problems through diplomatic channels. In October, border clashes between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban resulted in the martyrdom of 23 troops and left over 200 Taliban fighters dead, including a number of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorists. Without referring to any country, the participants opposed any attempt by foreign countries to have a military presence in Afghanistan. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for taking back Bagram Airbase, north of Kabul. The Taliban rulers have rejected President Trump’s call. Expressing security concerns, the special envoys announced and emphasised their readiness to assist Afghanistan in combating terrorism, drug trafficking and human trafficking. They emphasised the responsibility of the international community to lift sanctions and release Afghan assets, according to the statement. The US had frozen around $9 billion of Afghanistan’s state bank after the Taliban takeover in 2021. The diplomats called on international organisations to support the return of Afghan citizens from neighboring countries to their country and to create conditions for their dignified return. The call came at a time when the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan and Iran is underway. They emphasised regional integration and the centrality of the region in resolving existing issues and challenges, including some issues related to Afghanistan. They emphasised strengthening stability in Afghanistan and expressed their readiness to help achieve it if the Afghan side declares a need. Emphasising the importance of continuing economic and trade relations with Afghanistan with the aim of improving the livelihoods of the people of that country, they pointed out the need for the country’s integration into the political and economic processes of the region. They also stressed the responsibility of countries that are responsible for Afghanistan’s current situation to help rebuild and improve its economic and welfare situation without turning it into a political lever. The participants agreed to hold the fifth meeting of foreign ministers of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, as soon as possible. They welcomed Pakistan’s readiness to hold the second round of the meeting of special representatives of Afghanistan’s neighboring countries in Islamabad in March 2026.",

      "summary_orig": "India’s counter-terrorism agency said on Monday that it had filed charges against six people in connection with a deadly attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir. The chargesheet from India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) “charged the banned LeT/TRF as a legal entity for its role in planning, facilitating and executing the Pahalgam attack,” an agency statement alleged. The Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned in 2002 by the Pakistan government during the rule of then-military ruler Pervez Musharraf. The Resistance Front – a little known oragnisation that was blamed by New Delhi for the attack – was recently designated as a terror group by the United States. Three of those named are dead, while two are said to be in Indian custody. The trio were killed by Indian security forces in a forest in held Kashmir weeks after the attack, according to NIA. Two local men, Parvaiz Ahmad and Bashir Ahmad Jothatd, arrested in June on charges of harbouring the attackers, have also been charged. Pahalgam was the site where gunmen killed 26 tourists on April 22. India blamed the attack on Pakistan, without evidence – an allegation that Islamabad had strongly denied while calling for a neutral investigation – triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict in May of this year. After the four-day conflict , Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a diplomatic delegation to important world capitals in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India. He entrusted the PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to lead the delegation. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the attack, Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown . The arrests were carried out across multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam.",

      "summary_orig": "In another attack targeting educational institutions, a government school for girls in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali was destroyed by explosives, spreading fear and anxiety among students. Last week, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in the same district, jeopardising the future of more than 600 school-going children. The latest incident occurred in Eppi village, according to the police. The attackers planted explosive material inside the school building during the night, triggering a powerful blast that completely destroyed the structure. According to government officials, around 250 girls were enrolled at the school. It was the only educational institution for girls in the area, where students used to travel from far-flung localities for education. Police officials said the school was closed at the time of the explosion and no loss of life was reported. However, the blast caused severe damage to government property. Following the incident, panic gripped the area. Police reached the site, collected evidence, and launched an investigation against unknown perpetrators. The targeting of two educational institutions within a week has raised grave concerns among students and parents in the area. Reacting to the incident, a local tribal elder said, “Targeting educational institutions is an attack on the future of the entire nation. The tribal people will not tolerate such elements under any circumstances, and the government must immediately expose and bring the culprits to justice.” Meanwhile, the district administration strongly condemned the attack and stated that security at schools was being further strengthened. “Attacks on educational institutions are intolerable. Strict action will be taken against those involved, and additional security measures are being implemented to protect schools,” said the administration. Local parents and members of civil society have also urged the authorities to ensure continuity of education by swiftly reconstructing the damaged school buildings and establishing lasting peace in the area. In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat district partially damaged the building. Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up . No loss of life was reported in the incidents.",

      "summary_en": "In another attack targeting educational institutions, a government school for girls in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali was destroyed by explosives, spreading fear and anxiety among students. Last week, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in the same district, jeopardising the future of more than 600 school-going children. The latest incident occurred in Eppi village, according to the police. The attackers planted explosive material inside the school building during the night, triggering a powerful blast that completely destroyed the structure. According to government officials, around 250 girls were enrolled at the school. It was the only educational institution for girls in the area, where students used to travel from far-flung localities for education. Police officials said the school was closed at the time of the explosion and no loss of life was reported. However, the blast caused severe damage to government property. Following the incident, panic gripped the area. Police reached the site, collected evidence, and launched an investigation against unknown perpetrators. The targeting of two educational institutions within a week has raised grave concerns among students and parents in the area. Reacting to the incident, a local tribal elder said, “Targeting educational institutions is an attack on the future of the entire nation. The tribal people will not tolerate such elements under any circumstances, and the government must immediately expose and bring the culprits to justice.” Meanwhile, the district administration strongly condemned the attack and stated that security at schools was being further strengthened. “Attacks on educational institutions are intolerable. Strict action will be taken against those involved, and additional security measures are being implemented to protect schools,” said the administration. Local parents and members of civil society have also urged the authorities to ensure continuity of education by swiftly reconstructing the damaged school buildings and establishing lasting peace in the area. In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat district partially damaged the building. Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up . No loss of life was reported in the incidents.",

      "summary_orig": "An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore sentenced on Monday Zaheerul Hassan Shah, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), to 35 years in prison for inciting the public against the then chief justice of Pakistan. At one of the gatherings outside the Lahore Press Club, where TLP chief Saad Rizvi was also in attendance, Shah delivered remarks amounting to incitement of violence against then Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa. Qila Gujjar Singh police had registered the case against the cleric in 2024, pertaining to his speech for inciting violence against the top judge of the Supreme Court for issuing the judgment in the Mubarak Sani case . The FIR, filed on the complaint of Station House Officer Hammad Hussain, was registered under sections 6 (terrorism), 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism), and 11W (printing, publishing, or disseminating any material to incite hatred or giving projection to any person convicted for a terrorist act or any proscribed organisation or an organisation placed under observation) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 . Judge Arshad Javed announced the guilty verdict and handed over the custody of the convict to the superintendent of the central jail Kot Lakhpat. During the trial, the prosecution presented 15 witnesses in support of the charges against the cleric. Deputy Prosecutor Abdul Jabbar Dogar sought punishment for the accused under the law. On behalf of the cleric, Advocate Rana Maqsoodul Haq presented final arguments, urging the court to acquit his client. However, the defence counsel did not fully deny the veracity of the allegations. The judge awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to the accused under section 7(1)(b), five-year imprisonment each under sections 7(g), 21(L) and 11 (w) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997. The judge also awarded the accused separate jail terms of seven years, three years, and six months under Sections 505, 117, and 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code. A collective fine of Rs600,000 was also imposed on the party leader under the provisions of the ATA. Several FIRs were also registered against the TLP leaders and workers in different cities after Shah had issued a call for violence against Chief Justice Isa. Strong condemnation surfaced from political circles and clerics after the incident. Pakistani government officials vowed to take strict action against “those spreading lies,” stating that elements with “vested political interests” were “spreading blood and violence” in the name of religion. The defence minister said that the Supreme Court had issued a judgment in the Mubarak Sani case, but the elements concerned were still spreading propaganda based on lies. “The state will not allow you to issue a fatwa (decree) to kill someone. If we allow this, the writ of the state will crumble,” Asif had said. Information Minister Atta Tarar had asserted that there was “no space in our society” for such inciting remarks, adding that there were “political motives” behind them. He further highlighted that a case under the anti-terrorism laws had been registered. He also called out the religio-political group for issuing “politically motivated false statements” against the top judge and said that there was no room for such rhetoric in Pakistan. “There is no room for such statements in the State of Pakistan, and it will not be tolerated,” Tarar said on the X platform. The federal cabinet banned the religio-political group TLP under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) in October, days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad. The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It had also faced a ban by the Imran Khan-led government in 2021 after violent protests.",

On behalf of the cleric, Advocate Rana Maqsoodul Haq presented final arguments, urging the court to acquit his client. However, the defence counsel did not fully deny the veracity of the allegations. The judge awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to the accused under section 7(1)(b), five-year imprisonment each under sections 7(g), 21(L) and 11 (w) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997. The judge also awarded the accused separate jail terms of seven years, three years, and six months under Sections 505, 117, and 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code. A collective fine of Rs600,000 was also imposed on the party leader under the provisions of the ATA. Several FIRs were also registered against the TLP leaders and workers in different cities after Shah had issued a call for violence against Chief Justice Isa. Strong condemnation surfaced from political circles and clerics after the incident. Pakistani government officials vowed to take strict action against “those spreading lies,” stating that elements with “vested political interests” were “spreading blood and violence” in the name of religion. The defence minister said that the Supreme Court had issued a judgment in the Mubarak Sani case, but the elements concerned were still spreading propaganda based on lies. “The state will not allow you to issue a fatwa (decree) to kill someone. If we allow this, the writ of the state will crumble,” Asif had said. Information Minister Atta Tarar had asserted that there was “no space in our society” for such inciting remarks, adding that there were “political motives” behind them. He further highlighted that a case under the anti-terrorism laws had been registered. He also called out the religio-political group for issuing “politically motivated false statements” against the top judge and said that there was no room for such rhetoric in Pakistan. “There is no room for such statements in the State of Pakistan, and it will not be tolerated,” Tarar said on the X platform. The federal cabinet banned the religio-political group TLP under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) in October, days after nationwide protests over Gaza claimed the lives of several protesters and police officers and paralysed major highways and city roads from Karachi to Islamabad. The group, founded in 2015 as a movement, turned into a political party in 2016. It had also faced a ban by the Imran Khan-led government in 2021 after violent protests.",
      "title": "ATC Lahore hands 35-year imprisonment to banned TLP leader for inciting violence against chief justice",
      "summary": "An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore sentenced on Monday Zaheerul Hassan Shah, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), to 35 years in prison for inciting the public against the then chief justice of Pakistan. At one of the gatherings outside the Lahore Press Club, where TLP chief Saad Rizvi was also in attendance, Shah delivered remarks amounting to incitement of violence against then Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa. Qila Gujjar Singh police had registered the case against the cleric in 2024, pertaining to his speech for inciting violence against the top judge of the Supreme Court for issuing the judgment in the Mubarak Sani case . The FIR, filed on the complaint of Station House Officer Hammad Hussain, was registered under sections 6 (terrorism), 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism), and 11W (printing, publishing, or disseminating any material to incite hatred or giving projection to any person convicted for a terrorist act or any proscribed organisation or an organisation placed under observation) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 . Judge Arshad Javed announced the guilty verdict and handed over the custody of the convict to the superintendent of the central jail Kot Lakhpat.

      "summary_orig": "Donations for a Sydney man who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers during a mass shooting at Bondi Beach have surged past Australian dollars (A$)1.1 million ($744,000), as he recovers in hospital after surgery for bullet wounds. Forty-three-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, a father-of-two, hid behind parked cars before charging at one of the gunmen from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Ahmed’s bravery saved lives. “What we’ve seen in the last 24 hours was the worst of humanity in a terrorist act. But we also saw an example of the best of humanity in Ahmed Al Ahmed running towards danger, putting his own life at risk,” Albanese told state broadcaster ABC News . He was shot twice by a second perpetrator, Albanese said. Ahmed’s family said he was hit in the hand and arm. Australian police on Monday said a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son carried out the attack at a Jewish celebration on Sunday afternoon, killing 15 people in the country’s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years. Hailed a hero for disarming the gunman Ahmed’s father, Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed, told ABC News in an interview that his son was an Australian citizen and sells fruits and vegetables. “My son is a hero. He served in the police; he has the passion to defend people. When he saw people lying on the ground and the blood, quickly his conscience pushed him to attack one of the terrorists and take away his weapon,” Mohamed Fateh said. Jozay Alkanji, Ahmed’s cousin, said he had had initial surgery and may need more. Ahmed pictured in hospital Tributes have poured in from leaders both abroad and at home. Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales where Sydney is located, said in a social media post that he visited Ahmed at St George Hospital and conveyed the gratitude of people across the state. “Ahmed is a real-life hero,” his post said. “Thank you, Ahmed.” A photo showed Minns at his bedside, and Ahmed propped on pillows with his left arm in a cast. US President Donald Trump called Ahmed “a very, very brave person” who saved many lives. A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.1 million within one day. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman was the largest donor, contributing A$99,999 and sharing the fundraiser on his X account. Supporters thank Ahmed for saving lives Outside St George Hospital, strangers came to show their support. Misha and Veronica Pochuev left flowers for Ahmed with their seven-year-old daughter, Miroslava. “My husband is Russian, my father is Jewish, my grandpa is Muslim. This is not only about Bondi, this is about every person,” Veronica said. Yomna Touni, 43, stayed at the hospital for hours to offer assistance on behalf of a Muslim-run charity also raising funds for Ahmed. “The intention is to raise as much money as possible for his speedy recovery,” she said.",

      "title_orig": "Punjab to field new riot control force for ‘unlawful’ protests",
      "summary_orig": "Punjab is set to raise a separate force for handling “unlawful” protests and mobs, as the Punjab Assembly’s Standing Committee on Home Affairs on Monday cleared a sweeping amendment to the Police Order, 2002, to tighten control over riots, violent protests and unlawful assemblies across the province. The proposed Police Order (Second Amendment) Act, 2025, introduces a dedicated Riot Management Unit (RMU), empowered to manage riots across Punjab with modern gear and training specifically for crowd control. The RMU will operate under an additional inspector general of police (AIG), supervised by the provincial police officer. A key feature of the bill is the formal declaration of “riot zones.” Under the new law, the deputy commissioner and district police officer can jointly declare any affected area a riot zone, allowing authorities to cordon off roads, evacuate civilians and appoint an incident commander to coordinate all departments during operations. The bill grants legal protection to police and RMU personnel for actions taken “in good faith” during riot control, shielding them from lawsuits and prosecutions for lawful use of force. To strengthen accountability, the amendment makes organisers, instigators and facilitators of riots financially liable. Courts will be required to order compensation for deaths, injuries, mental trauma and property damage caused during riots or unlawful assemblies. Compensation will be recoverable as arrears of land revenue, with up to three years’ imprisonment for default. A new chapter, ‘Offences in the Riot Zone’, prescribes up to 10 years’ imprisonment and fines up to Rs500,000 for attacks on police, law enforcement personnel or private individuals, as well as for damage to public or private property. Such offences will be cognisable, non-bailable and tried by sessions courts on a day-to-day basis, with a mandatory decision within 30 days. The bill also bars accused persons from transferring property once a case is registered and restricts foreign travel without court permission. The use of modern surveillance technology, including Safe City cameras, is allowed, with video and photographic evidence declared admissible in court. According to the statement of objects, the amendments seek to address rising public unrest, violent protests and attacks on law enforcement, while ensuring compensation for victims and clearer legal cover for police action. The bill will now move to the Punjab Assembly floor for enactment. This development comes several months after the religio-political party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) had begun a protest march in Lahore, which turned violent. The party — which has a history of violent protests — had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy. Ahead of its planned march, roads had been blocked in multiple areas of Punjab and mobile internet services suspended in the federal capital and Rawalpindi. The TLP protesters had camped at Muridke on the night of October 11, the very first day of their march, and later stayed there until an operation by law enforcement personnel on October 13 that resulted in their dispersal. Dawn reported that the marchers were unable to move forward due to large trenches dug by the district administration along the main GT Road. Meanwhile, throughout the duration of the protest, reports of clashes between TLP activists and law enforcement personnel kept emerging. On October 12, law enforcement agencies, including Pakistan Rangers (Punjab) and large contingents of police from five districts, were dispatched to Muridke and were reported to have surrounded the TLP protest camp, in what appeared to be preparations for a large-scale operation. Subsequently, law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Oct 13 to dismantle the party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests. In the wake of the violence, the federal government banned the TLP under the Anti-Terrorism Act on October 24, after receiving a recommendation from the Punjab government to place them on the Fourth Schedule of the ATA — a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism.",

      "summary_orig": "A soldier was martyred during a counter-insurgency operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Monday, in which seven terrorists were killed, the military’s media wing said in a statement. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in DI Khan’s Kulachi area on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read. During the battle, Naik Yasir Khan, 34, a resident of Mardan, embraced martyrdom after “having fought gallantly [and] paid the ultimate sacrifice”, the ISPR said. The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area. “[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded. Earlier, security forces killed 13 terrorists in two IBOs across KP, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday. “On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a statement. It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district, while the other was carried out in Bannu. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025 , published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years. Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.",
