      "summary_orig": "Please read the following announcement before posting or commenting. Violations of these rules may result in a permanent ban. Changes to Rule 2: Rule 2 has been changed to include the use of AI. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of AI in writing comments and posts or generating images. This also includes presenting AI theories or arguments, even if you explicitly state they are generated by AI. AI-generated content regarding aviation is frequently wrong and is incredibly low effort. The use of AI may result in a ban. Introduction of Rule 10: Even though we have been restricting NSFW content and gore before this, we have added it as an official rule and will be strongly enforcing it from now on. Rule 10 bans any gore being posted to this subreddit , even if it is a link to an outside source. This includes as a post or a comment. Violations of this will result in a permanent ban from r/aviation . In addition to this, we are also limiting NSFW content that is not explicitly gore. This content will be decided on a case by case basis. Content involving incidents like the one that was seen at Milan Bergamo Airport will always be marked as NSFW, and we will provide details in pinned comments and the flair to elaborate on how NSFW the content is, so that everyone can make their own choice on what they want to see. Geopolitics: Please remember to keep discussion in this subreddit focused on aviation. While geopolitics will frequently be a part of discussion, please remain respectful and avoid getting in arguments about this. Do not bring geopolitics into posts where they don’t belong. Air India Related Content Before posting Air India related content, please do the following.

Changes to Rule 2: Rule 2 has been changed to include the use of AI. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of AI in writing comments and posts or generating images. This also includes presenting AI theories or arguments, even if you explicitly state they are generated by AI. AI-generated content regarding aviation is frequently wrong and is incredibly low effort. The use of AI may result in a ban. Introduction of Rule 10: Even though we have been restricting NSFW content and gore before this, we have added it as an official rule and will be strongly enforcing it from now on. Rule 10 bans any gore being posted to this subreddit , even if it is a link to an outside source. This includes as a post or a comment. Violations of this will result in a permanent ban from r/aviation . In addition to this, we are also limiting NSFW content that is not explicitly gore. This content will be decided on a case by case basis. Content involving incidents like the one that was seen at Milan Bergamo Airport will always be marked as NSFW, and we will provide details in pinned comments and the flair to elaborate on how NSFW the content is, so that everyone can make their own choice on what they want to see.

      "summary_orig": "Hello users of r/UkrainianConflict , For the past three years, Ukrainian cities have endured relentless attacks from Russian missiles and Iranian-made Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. In 2025 alone, over 12,000 of these drones have struck Ukraine — targeting not military infrastructure, but homes, hospitals, and schools. Thousands of civilians have been killed. Hundreds of them were children. A number of subreddits, including this one, believe this campaign of terror must end. We're proud to join the Sky Sentinel fundraiser in collaboration with United24, the official fundraising platform of Ukraine. The goal: help fund Sky Sentinel, an Al-powered, Ukrainian-made turret system designed to autonomously detect and shoot down these deadly drones. Each turret costs $150,000. United24 supporters have already raised over $1 million, and now we're coming together to raise enough for one more turret - entirely through Reddit. If we should not reach the goal, the donations will still be used for Sky Sentinel. If we don't reach the goal, the donations will still go to United24's general Sky Sentinel Program. If we succeed: • We'll save civilian lives. • A community vote will name the turret. • We'll receive a photo of the deployed turret, showing our contribution in action. Every donation helps, no matter the amount. Click the link below to donate and learn more about Sky Sentinel https://u24.gov.ua/sky-sentinel?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=fundraising&utm_campaign=sky-sentinel Thank you for your support and a shoutout to u/SurvivingSpartan and all the others who made this fundraiser possible! submitted by /u/humanlikecorvus [link] [comments]",
