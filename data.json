      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Thursday ordered an inquiry into a raid carried out by Islamabad police at the National Press Club (NPC), where several journalists were allegedly attacked. Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen armed with batons attacking journalists on the press club premises. Visuals shared on social media also showed police dragging journalists out of what appeared to be the cafeteria. View this post on Instagram Another video shared by a Dawn.com correspondent showed a journalist holding his broken Nikon camera and his shirt ripped across the back. A statement issued by Naqvi stated that he had taken notice of the “unfortunate” incident and demanded a report from the Islamabad inspector general of police. “Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” he was quoted as saying. “Disciplinary action must be taken against officials involved in the incident,” he said. Meanwhile, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) President Afzal Butt held a press conference alongside Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry at the National Press Club. He said that during the police raid, when the press club’s office-bearers tried to intervene and resolve the matter, they were “beaten and tortured”. “They even arrested two people, who were later released,” Butt added. He added that multiple people at the scene pointed out that they had to get the police to release them. “Today’s incident is a matter of now or never for us,” Butt said. He announced that the PFUJ had called an “emergency session”, where “we will consult and chalk out our demands about what the government needs to do to prevent what the police did today. “We will also decide our course of action and announce it after the meeting.” Butt said, “We always avoid confrontation with political parties. Our friends were very angry … but I controlled them … Something like this has never happened before. “That you enter a photographer’s house — the press club is their second home […] that you enter his home without permission, beat him and break his camera and mobile phone. This has never happened before.” Butt alleged that even the members of the press club’s management and its office-bearers were “beaten”. “This is not only Islamabad press club’s issue. Press clubs across Pakistan are of the view that if they will turn a blind eye to this worst of the worst incident, similar incidents could happen in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta. “That is why we will first consult our friends here and then across Pakistan. We will then decide out plan of action and put forward our demands.” For his part, Chaudhry said he condemned the incident and apologised for it. “Please consider this when you hold your meeting,” he said, assuring that he was also ready to meet them again after their meeting. Chaudhry’s office also issued a statement unconditionally apologising for the incident, adding that it happened “suddenly”. “Some people from the [JAAC] were protesting [and] some of their people had manhandled police personnel,” the statement read. “When they tried to arrest these people, the police chased them. The police came to the Press Club to arrest the protesters who misbehaved with [officers].” The statement added that Chaudhry had ordered an internal inquiry into the incident. Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar called the incident “regrettable” in a statement, vowing that a comprehensive investigation would be carried out. “Interior Minister Naqvi did not order police to enter the press club,” he was quoted as saying. “The National Press Club is my home and I stand with it,” he said. Journalist bodies held another press conference at the NPC later, where Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists President Tariq Virk said journalists across the country stood united after the police raid at NPC. He alleged that “Islamabad police personal had not come to the press club on their own accord but were sent here”. “They inflicted violence on journalists inside the press club. They even tortured and arrested an ailing employee of the club,” he alleged, vowing to “adopt such a plan of action” so that nobody would resort to this “rogue behaviour” in future. PFUJ President Butt said today was one of the “darkest day in Pakistan’s history”. “The attack on the National Press Club was an attack on media freedom,” he said, adding that members of journalist bodies had participated in the meeting held after the police raid. “We will prepare a strategy after consulting all journalist bodies.” Butt further stated that journalists in other cities had also protested the raid at NPC and that “if the National Press Club was not safe from police, then no other press club was”. Butt reiterated his allegation that cameras and mobile phones were snatched and broken during the incident. He announced that a “black day” would be observed across the country tomorrow and black flags would be hoisted at press club all across Pakistan. “The journalists are very angry at the moment. It has been suggested that we get first information reports registered in which some bigwigs are nominated,” he said. Journalist’s account of raid Journalist Shiraz Gardezi, who is associated with Geo News and also the senior joint secretary of the NPC, shared an account of the raid with Dawn.com . Gardezi said the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee — which has also been holding demonstrations in Azad Kashmir — had issued a call for a protest at the press club. “As soon as the demonstration began, they surrounded the protesters,” he narrated. Gardezi, who was at the NPC to cover the protest, said police stopped them from doing so. “Because they were torturing, beating and dragging people,” he alleged, adding that they even tried to snatch mobile phones and cameras from some of the journalists. According to him, they even dragged and tried to take away some of the journalists with them but they who were let go after some other journalists intervened. “We then asked the journalists to stay on the backfoot and keep themselves safe,” he said. Later, he continued, “we heard loud bangs on the door while sitting inside the press club. They kicked the doors open and stormed inside”. Shirazi narrated that police broke various things in the cafeteria and “beat and tortured” people. This time, too, they tried to take away some journalists but they were “rescued”. Police raid declared ‘terrorism’ In a joint statement, the PFUJ, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors and Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors declared the police raid at the NPC “terrorism”. They also demanded immediate action against those “involved in the incident”. The statement said journalist organisations saw this incident as a continuation of a series of actions ongoing against journalists. It highlighted that for the past few days, advertisements were being run under the title of ‘Have you ever thought what the state of war is?’ They alleged that “government” was behind these advertisements. “Threatening tone is used in these advertisements and reporters, free lancers and social organisations related to the media are listed as anti-state. Its objective is to tarnish the character of journalists, pressurise them and curb the freedom of expression.” The journalist bodies demanded that the publication of these advertisements should immediately stop. They also expressed the view that the “excessive use” of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act had proved the concerns of multiple journalist true. “The act is being used to employ all tactics for suppressing government critics and curbing the freedom of expression,” they alleged. ‘Shameful and condemnable’ The incident also sparked outrage on social media as journalists decried the assault. In a post on X, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the “assault on journalists by Islamabad police” at the National Press Club. “HRCP strongly condemns the raid on the National Press Club and [the] assault on journalists by the Islamabad police,” the rights group wrote in a post on X. “We demand an immediate inquiry and those responsible brought to book.” Journalist Hamid Mir stated that police were trying to arrest members of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) and that they had “targeted journalists present in the cafeteria”. “This is totally uncalled for and condemnable,” said journalist Syed Talat Hussain. “As if there aren’t enough fronts open. To treat the National Press Club as a criminal hideout and then use violence on its premises is madness without any method,” he said. Journalist Matiullah Jan condemned the incident in a post on X, calling it “extremely shameful and condemnable”. “This incident is [a product] of the incompetence and cowardice of the club administration,” Jan wrote. “The press club is the home of journalists, where it is disgraceful for the police to barge into the cafeteria with batons and attack people,” he said. Journalist Anas Mallick, who works with TV channel Asia One , alleged that police had raided the club to arrest Kashmiri journalists covering a “call to protest” by the JAAC, adding that the police were “acting like thugs”. Journalist Zebunnisa Burki called visuals emerging from the raid “insane” and added that journalists were being attacked by police inside the press club itself. PTI MNA from Malakand Junaid Akbar also condemned the raid. “Islamabad police storming the National Press Club and their violence against Kashmiri protesters and journalists is shameful and condemnable. An attack on the press club is an attack on the freedom of expression,” he said in a post on X.",

      "summary_orig": "At least four law enforcement personnel were injured in a suspected improvised explosive device (IED) attack near Peshawar’s Bani Mara area on Thursday, police said. Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed confirmed these details to Dawn.com , adding that police were targeted in the incident. “Initial investigation shows that the device that caused the blast was planted on the route of a police mobile,” he added. The CCPO added that the condition of one of the injured was serious. Rescue services shifted the injured to a nearby medical facility after the attack. Following the blast, a large contingent of security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area. Separately, the city’s senior superintendent of police investigation told Dawn.com that law enforcers were investigating the incident and evidence from the site of the blast was being collected. Two reports , issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024. According to PICSS, militant violence dropped significantly in Sept 2025, with both the number of attacks and militant capacity showing sharp declines compared to the record levels seen in Aug. The PICSS Militancy Database recorded 69 militant attacks in Sept — a 52 per cent reduction from August’s 143. These attacks resulted in 135 deaths and 173 injuries, whilst militants abducted at least 27 people. The fatalities included 61 security personnel, 20 militants, and 54 civilians. Amongst the injured were 74 security personnel and 99 civilians. Compared with August, the number of martyred security personnel declined by 16pc, militant fatalities by 66pc, and civilian deaths by 17pc, reflecting a notable decrease in lethality. KP remained the most affected province, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. According to CRSS’s report, Pakistan witnessed an over 46pc surge in overall violence in its security landscape for the third quarter of 2025, with at least 901 fatalities and 599 injuries — amongst civilians, security personnel, and outlaws — resulting from 329 incidents of violence. This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.",

      "title_orig": "Israel’s interception of Gaza flotilla draws global ire as Pakistan demands release of detained activists",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and several other countries on Thursday condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) after its forces intercepted the flotilla heading to break Israel’s siege of Gaza and deliver aid. Israeli forces began intercepting the flotilla’s latest bid to reach Gaza late last night, the fleet said. Israel has so far intercepted 39 boats with foreign activists on board to Gaza, leaving only one vessel still sailing towards the Palestinian enclave, the flotilla organisers said today. The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. Former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was also on board. Hours after Tel Aviv’s move drew global condemnation, Israeli foreign ministry posted on X that all on board the flotilla were safe would be “deported to Europe”. The statement said: “The Hamas-Sumud provocation is over. None of the Hamas-Sumud provocation yachts has succeeded in its attempt to enter an active combat zone or breach the lawful naval blockade. “All the passengers are safe and in good health. They are making their way safely to Israel, from where they will be deported to Europe.” It added that one last vessel of “this provocation remains at a distance. If it approaches, its attempt to enter an active combat zone and breach the blockade will also be prevented.” ‘Dastardly attack’ In a post on X during the early hours of Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “Pakistan strongly condemns the dastardly attack by Israeli forces on the 40 vessel Samud Gaza flotilla, carrying over 450 humanitarian workers from 44 countries. We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release.“ “Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he said. “This barbarity must end. Peace must be given a chance, and humanitarian aid must reach those in need,” the premier asserted. In another post later in the day, he commended the presence of Pakistanis, including former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, on the Global Sumud Flotilla. They participated in this “great aid mission in line with the principles of humanity”, he said, adding that their initiative reflected Pakistanis’ “peace-loving aspirations, struggle for justice, spirit of helping those in need”, he said. The PM added that the Pakistan government supported the “principles of respect for human life … and uninterrupted aid. It demands the return of its citizens. It is trying and prays for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the country”. Strong-worded condemnations also poured in from other countries — including the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkiye, Spain, Colombia, Brazil and South Africa — with some voicing concern for their citizens part of the mission and held by Israel. Malaysia’s PM Anwar Ibrahim said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister, as well as the Turkish and Egyptian presidents, to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained“. Turkiye announced that it had opened an investigation concerning “24 Turkish citizens arrested following the attack carried out by elements of the Israeli navy in international waters“. South Africa called on Israel to release all activists, including Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile “Mandla” Mandela. Cameras broadcasting live feeds from the boats, verified by Reuters , showed Israeli soldiers sporting helmets and night vision goggles boarding the ships, while passengers huddled together in life vests with their hands up. A video from the Israeli foreign ministry showed Thunberg, the most prominent of the flotilla’s passengers, sitting on a deck surrounded by soldiers. According to a tracker on the Global Sumud Flotilla’s website, one of its boats, named Mikeno, had entered Gaza’s territorial waters and was still sailing. The Palestinian foreign ministry spokesperson condemned the interception of the flotilla as a violation of international law, asserting that Israel had neither authority nor sovereignty over Palestinian “territorial waters”, including those off the coast of the Gaza Strip. Israel’s interception of the flotilla sparked protests in Italy and Colombia, while protests were also called in Greece, Ireland and Turkiye. Italian unions called a general strike for Friday. At 10:55am PKT, the Israeli foreign ministry said that the detained individuals “were making their way safely and peacefully to Israel, where their deportation procedures to Europe will begin”. “The passengers are safe and in good health,” it insisted. This undated picture released by Israel on Oct 2, 2025 shows Greta Thunberg and other activists part of the GSF onboard a ship after they were intercepted by Israeli forces. — X/IsraelMFA The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military. It said on X that it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”. Israel has blocked similar attempts previously as well. In June, aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces. Deliberate obstruction of humanitarian relief: FO Separately, the Foreign Office (FO) also strongly condemned the attack, stating: “The unlawful detention of international activists onboard the flotilla constitutes yet another flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law by Israel, and endangers the lives of innocent civilians.” Calling it a deliberate attempt to obstruct humanitarian relief in the Palestinian enclave, the FO said: “This reprehensible act is part of Israel’s ongoing pattern of aggression and its illegal blockade of Gaza, which has caused immense human suffering and deprivation for over two million Palestinians.” It demanded the “immediate release of all humanitarian workers and activists on board the flotilla”, urging Israel to respect international law. The FO also called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its “repeated violations of international law”. “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support and solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” it added. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called Israel’s actions against the flotilla “a flagrant violation of international law”, demanding the release of the detained activists. “Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detention of international activists in flagrant violation of international law. We demand an immediate ceasefire, lifting of the blockade, swift release of activists and unhindered aid to Gaza,“ he wrote on X. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also condemned the attack, praying for the “safe return of all those aboard the [Sumud] Gaza Flotilla”. “We strongly condemn the Israeli attack on these peaceful people carrying humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. Israeli barbarity must end,” the minister said in a post on X. Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani called Israel’s move an act of “state terrorism and barbaric savagery”, urging the international community to take notice. In a statement issued by his office, Gilani described the assault as “a blatant violation of international law, humanitarian principles, and the dignity of mankind,” adding that the attack has left a “permanent stain on the conscience of the international community”. “The only ‘crime’ of these innocent and selfless individuals was that they sought to stand by the oppressed Palestinians in the spirit of human compassion,” the Senate chairman said. “Urgent steps must be taken to ensure uninterrupted delivery of food, water, medicines, and other essentials to the people of Gaza, who are enduring immense hardship under siege,” the statement added. Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad detained Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, was also among those taken by Israeli forces, according to advocacy group Pak-Palestine Forum. In a post on X, the group said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.” The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate, Syed Uzair Nizami, was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.” JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman paid tribute to the activists on board the flotilla, announcing a nationwide protest in a show of solidarity with Gaza. Addressing a press conference in Lahore, the JI chief said, “We will observe a nationwide protest tomorrow against the attack on the Sumud Gaza Flotilla.” “We call on our leaders to play their part,” he added. Former PTI senator Faisal Javed Khan took to X to pray for Khan’s safety, saying, “Let us all condemn the aggression by Israel that has been unleashed upon these peaceful humanitarians, who sought only to deliver aid and amplify the cry for justice.” Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir took to X to laud the “courage” of the activists on board the flotilla. “They are carrying nothing but courage in their hearts and aid in their ships,” he said, noting that the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has become “emboldened by the failure and cowardice of the global community.” “Our only hope is ordinary citizens of the world,” he added. Israel faces international backlash Malaysia PM Ibrahim also condemned Israel’s interception of the flotilla, saying that Israeli forces had detained eight Malaysians. “By blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world,” Anwar said in a statement. In a later post on X, the Malaysian premier said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister as well as the presidents of Turkiye and Egypt to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained”. “My team and I have also remained in close contact with other key partners, including the United States Secretary of State [Marco Rubio], to press for urgent intervention without delay. “I reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that the atrocities and acts of aggression committed by the Israeli regime must cease immediately,” Anwar added. He reiterated his demand for the “immediate and unconditional release of all detainees, and for humanitarian aid to be allowed to reach our brothers and sisters in Gaza swiftly and without obstruction”. Turkiye Turkiye’s foreign ministry called Israel’s “attack” on the flotilla “an act of terror” that endangered the lives of innocent civilians. The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said it had launched an investigation into the detention of 24 Turkish citizens on board vessels in the flotilla on charges including deprivation of liberty, seizure of transport vehicles and damage to property, as per Turkiye’s Anadolu Agency. Colombia Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of Israel’s entire diplomatic delegation on Wednesday following the detention of two Colombians in the flotilla. Israel has not had an ambassador in Colombia since last year. Petro called the detentions a potential “new international crime” by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanded the release of the Colombians. He also terminated Colombia’s free trade agreement with Israel. Britain The British government remained “very concerned” about Israel’s interception of the aid flotilla, its foreign office said today, adding that it had made clear to Israel that the situation should be resolved safely. “We are very concerned about the situation with the Sumud flotilla, we are in touch with the families of a number of British nationals involved,” the British foreign office said in a statement. “The aid carried by the flotilla should be turned over to humanitarian organisations on the ground to be delivered safely into Gaza,” it added. Spain Spain summoned Israel’s top representative in Madrid after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying activists and humanitarian aid to the devastated Palestinian territory, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said. “Today I summoned the charge d’affaires here in Madrid,” Albares told public broadcaster TVE , saying 65 Spaniards were travelling with the flotilla. Brazil Brazil also issued a condemnation on the Israeli navy’s interception of the flotilla, with several Brazilian nationals on board, including a lawmaker. The Brazilian foreign ministry said, “[Brazil] deplores the Israeli government’s military action, which violates rights and endangers the physical well-being of peaceful protesters.” “The responsibility for the safety of those detained now rests with Israel,” it added.",

      "summary": "Pakistan and several other countries on Thursday condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) after its forces intercepted the flotilla heading to break Israel’s siege of Gaza and deliver aid. Israeli forces began intercepting the flotilla’s latest bid to reach Gaza late last night, the fleet said. Israel has so far intercepted 39 boats with foreign activists on board to Gaza, leaving only one vessel still sailing towards the Palestinian enclave, the flotilla organisers said today. The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. Former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was also on board. Hours after Tel Aviv’s move drew global condemnation, Israeli foreign ministry posted on X that all on board the flotilla were safe would be “deported to Europe”. The statement said: “The Hamas-Sumud provocation is over. None of the Hamas-Sumud provocation yachts has succeeded in its attempt to enter an active combat zone or breach the lawful naval blockade. “All the passengers are safe and in good health. They are making their way safely to Israel, from where they will be deported to Europe.” It added that one last vessel of “this provocation remains at a distance. If it approaches, its attempt to enter an active combat zone and breach the blockade will also be prevented.” ‘Dastardly attack’ In a post on X during the early hours of Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “Pakistan strongly condemns the dastardly attack by Israeli forces on the 40 vessel Samud Gaza flotilla, carrying over 450 humanitarian workers from 44 countries. We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release.“ “Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he said. “This barbarity must end. Peace must be given a chance, and humanitarian aid must reach those in need,” the premier asserted. In another post later in the day, he commended the presence of Pakistanis, including former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, on the Global Sumud Flotilla. They participated in this “great aid mission in line with the principles of humanity”, he said, adding that their initiative reflected Pakistanis’ “peace-loving aspirations, struggle for justice, spirit of helping those in need”, he said. The PM added that the Pakistan government supported the “principles of respect for human life … and uninterrupted aid. It demands the return of its citizens. It is trying and prays for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the country”. Strong-worded condemnations also poured in from other countries — including the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkiye, Spain, Colombia, Brazil and South Africa — with some voicing concern for their citizens part of the mission and held by Israel. Malaysia’s PM Anwar Ibrahim said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister, as well as the Turkish and Egyptian presidents, to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained“. Turkiye announced that it had opened an investigation concerning “24 Turkish citizens arrested following the attack carried out by elements of the Israeli navy in international waters“. South Africa called on Israel to release all activists, including Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile “Mandla” Mandela. Cameras broadcasting live feeds from the boats, verified by Reuters , showed Israeli soldiers sporting helmets and night vision goggles boarding the ships, while passengers huddled together in life vests with their hands up. A video from the Israeli foreign ministry showed Thunberg, the most prominent of the flotilla’s passengers, sitting on a deck surrounded by soldiers. According to a tracker on the Global Sumud Flotilla’s website, one of its boats, named Mikeno, had entered Gaza’s territorial waters and was still sailing. The Palestinian foreign ministry spokesperson condemned the interception of the flotilla as a violation of international law, asserting that Israel had neither authority nor sovereignty over Palestinian “territorial waters”, including those off the coast of the Gaza Strip. Israel’s interception of the flotilla sparked protests in Italy and Colombia, while protests were also called in Greece, Ireland and Turkiye. Italian unions called a general strike for Friday. At 10:55am PKT, the Israeli foreign ministry said that the detained individuals “were making their way safely and peacefully to Israel, where their deportation procedures to Europe will begin”. “The passengers are safe and in good health,” it insisted. This undated picture released by Israel on Oct 2, 2025 shows Greta Thunberg and other activists part of the GSF onboard a ship after they were intercepted by Israeli forces. — X/IsraelMFA The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military. It said on X that it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”. Israel has blocked similar attempts previously as well. In June, aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces. Deliberate obstruction of humanitarian relief: FO Separately, the Foreign Office (FO) also strongly condemned the attack, stating: “The unlawful detention of international activists onboard the flotilla constitutes yet another flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law by Israel, and endangers the lives of innocent civilians.” Calling it a deliberate attempt to obstruct humanitarian relief in the Palestinian enclave, the FO said: “This reprehensible act is part of Israel’s ongoing pattern of aggression and its illegal blockade of Gaza, which has caused immense human suffering and deprivation for over two million Palestinians.” It demanded the “immediate release of all humanitarian workers and activists on board the flotilla”, urging Israel to respect international law. The FO also called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its “repeated violations of international law”. “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support and solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” it added. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called Israel’s actions against the flotilla “a flagrant violation of international law”, demanding the release of the detained activists. “Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detention of international activists in flagrant violation of international law. We demand an immediate ceasefire, lifting of the blockade, swift release of activists and unhindered aid to Gaza,“ he wrote on X. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also condemned the attack, praying for the “safe return of all those aboard the [Sumud] Gaza Flotilla”. “We strongly condemn the Israeli attack on these peaceful people carrying humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. Israeli barbarity must end,” the minister said in a post on X. Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani called Israel’s move an act of “state terrorism and barbaric savagery”, urging the international community to take notice. In a statement issued by his office, Gilani described the assault as “a blatant violation of international law, humanitarian principles, and the dignity of mankind,” adding that the attack has left a “permanent stain on the conscience of the international community”. “The only ‘crime’ of these innocent and selfless individuals was that they sought to stand by the oppressed Palestinians in the spirit of human compassion,” the Senate chairman said. “Urgent steps must be taken to ensure uninterrupted delivery of food, water, medicines, and other essentials to the people of Gaza, who are enduring immense hardship under siege,” the statement added. Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad detained Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, was also among those taken by Israeli forces, according to advocacy group Pak-Palestine Forum. In a post on X, the group said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.” The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate, Syed Uzair Nizami, was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.” JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman paid tribute to the activists on board the flotilla, announcing a nationwide protest in a show of solidarity with Gaza. Addressing a press conference in Lahore, the JI chief said, “We will observe a nationwide protest tomorrow against the attack on the Sumud Gaza Flotilla.” “We call on our leaders to play their part,” he added. Former PTI senator Faisal Javed Khan took to X to pray for Khan’s safety, saying, “Let us all condemn the aggression by Israel that has been unleashed upon these peaceful humanitarians, who sought only to deliver aid and amplify the cry for justice.” Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir took to X to laud the “courage” of the activists on board the flotilla. “They are carrying nothing but courage in their hearts and aid in their ships,” he said, noting that the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has become “emboldened by the failure and cowardice of the global community.” “Our only hope is ordinary citizens of the world,” he added. Israel faces international backlash Malaysia PM Ibrahim also condemned Israel’s interception of the flotilla, saying that Israeli forces had detained eight Malaysians. “By blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world,” Anwar said in a statement. In a later post on X, the Malaysian premier said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister as well as the presidents of Turkiye and Egypt to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained”. “My team and I have also remained in close contact with other key partners, including the United States Secretary of State [Marco Rubio], to press for urgent intervention without delay. “I reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that the atrocities and acts of aggression committed by the Israeli regime must cease immediately,” Anwar added. He reiterated his demand for the “immediate and unconditional release of all detainees, and for humanitarian aid to be allowed to reach our brothers and sisters in Gaza swiftly and without obstruction”. Turkiye Turkiye’s foreign ministry called Israel’s “attack” on the flotilla “an act of terror” that endangered the lives of innocent civilians. The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said it had launched an investigation into the detention of 24 Turkish citizens on board vessels in the flotilla on charges including deprivation of liberty, seizure of transport vehicles and damage to property, as per Turkiye’s Anadolu Agency. Colombia Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of Israel’s entire diplomatic delegation on Wednesday following the detention of two Colombians in the flotilla. Israel has not had an ambassador in Colombia since last year. Petro called the detentions a potential “new international crime” by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanded the release of the Colombians. He also terminated Colombia’s free trade agreement with Israel. Britain The British government remained “very concerned” about Israel’s interception of the aid flotilla, its foreign office said today, adding that it had made clear to Israel that the situation should be resolved safely. “We are very concerned about the situation with the Sumud flotilla, we are in touch with the families of a number of British nationals involved,” the British foreign office said in a statement. “The aid carried by the flotilla should be turned over to humanitarian organisations on the ground to be delivered safely into Gaza,” it added. Spain Spain summoned Israel’s top representative in Madrid after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying activists and humanitarian aid to the devastated Palestinian territory, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said. “Today I summoned the charge d’affaires here in Madrid,” Albares told public broadcaster TVE , saying 65 Spaniards were travelling with the flotilla. Brazil Brazil also issued a condemnation on the Israeli navy’s interception of the flotilla, with several Brazilian nationals on board, including a lawmaker. The Brazilian foreign ministry said, “[Brazil] deplores the Israeli government’s military action, which violates rights and endangers the physical well-being of peaceful protesters.” “The responsibility for the safety of those detained now rests with Israel,” it added.",

      "summary_orig": "At least two people were killed on Thursday and three badly wounded outside a packed synagogue in Manchester in a car and stabbing attack, with the suspect believed to have been shot dead by UK police. As the Jewish community marked the holiday of Yom Kippur in the northwestern city, police were called to the incident, activating a national terrorism-response protocol. The attack struck days ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked a fierce offensive in Gaza, inflaming passions in Britain. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer swiftly condemned the attack as “horrific”, and announced security was being boosted at UK synagogues. He left a European political summit in Denmark early to chair an emergency security meeting in London. King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla were “deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Manchester, especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community”. Greater Manchester Police declared a “major incident” shortly after 9:30 am (1:30pm PKT) after officers were called to the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the Crumpsall neighbourhood. The force initially said paramedics were treating four people for “injuries caused by both the vehicle and stab wounds” while confirming firearms officers had shot one man “believed to be the offender”. Within hours, it announced two people had died and the suspected offender shot by officers was “also believed to be deceased”. Police said the death could not be confirmed due to “suspicious items on his person”, noting a bomb disposal unit was at the scene.\nThree people were also in a “serious condition”, police added. ‘Appalled’ Starmer said he was appalled and pledged to “do everything to keep our Jewish community safe”. “The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific,” he added. Israel’s embassy in the UK said it was “abhorrent and deeply distressing” that “such an act of violence should be perpetrated on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar”. “The safety and security of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom must be guaranteed,” it added on X. Police said officers first responded to calls from the public about a car driving into people outside the synagogue, as well as reports that a security guard had been attacked with a knife. A witness told BBC Radio he saw police shooting a man after a car crash.\n“They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn’t listen until they opened fire,” he said. “He went down on the floor, and then he started getting back up, and then they shot him again.” Police said “a large number of people worshipping at the synagogue … were held inside while the immediate area was made safe” but then evacuated. Members of the community comfort each other near Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall, north Manchester, on October 2, following a “major incident” at the synagogue. — AFP ‘Holiest Jewish day’ Manchester mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC police had “dealt with it very quickly with some amazing support from members of the public”. He urged people “not to speculate on social media”, while noting the Jewish community “will be very worried by the news”. The city, famous around the world for its two Premier League football clubs and industrial history, is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the UK. It totalled more than 28,000 in 2021, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research. Members of the local Jewish community walk in the street near Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue in Crumpsall, north Manchester, the UK on October 2. — AFP MP Graham Stringer said the area was home to both large Jewish and Muslim communities. “By and large community relations are excellent between all the different ethnic groups and religious groups,” he told BBC Radio Manchester. The Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish charity that records antisemitic incidents, said it was “working with police and the local Jewish community”.\n“This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year,” CST added. The city has witnessed several deadly terror attacks, notably in 2017 when Salman Abedi detonated a homemade suicide bomb outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena. It killed 22 people, some of them children, and injured hundreds more.",

She joined other leading Tories, business groups, scientists and the Church of England in attacking the Conservative leader’s announcement, which would remove the requirement for governments to set “carbon budgets” laying out how far greenhouse gas emissions will be cut every five years, up to 2050.

      "summary_orig": "A high-level delegation of the government held negotiations with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Thursday in a bid to put an end to the ongoing unrest in the territory. “A high-level delegation from Pakistan has started formal dialogue with representatives of the Joint Action Committee of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Muzaffarabad today,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry posted on X as the talks commenced. A strike has paralysed AJK under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JAAC , the AJK government, and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wednesday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq and federal minister Chaudhry invited the JAAC for fresh dialogue. Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK and directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to AJK capital Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues. The committee includes Senator Rana Sanaullah as well as federal ministers Sardar Yusuf and Ahsan Iqbal, former President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Masood Khan, and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira. Photos shared by Chaudhry on X showed him, Kaira, Sanaullah, Iqbal, Kashmir Affairs Federal Minister Amir Muqam, PPP leader Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousuf among those participating in today’s negotiations. Before the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarbad, members of a government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days. Among them, Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role in address the issues in AJK. But, he added, given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”. He said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK but they should also be mindful that no such situation was creating of which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage. AJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks to AJK and expressed the hope that members of the JAAC would also work toward ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We all are saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives. As far as the  Joint Awami Action Committee is concerned, they are very honourable and disrespected people.” He stressed the solution to the ongoing unrest was through talks. “They are a part of our body and their pain is our pain, their difficulties are our difficulties.” Ashraf said that the loss of lives was unfortunate, whether it be because of the “administration or the civilian population”. Rana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace. “We are confident that when we sit with our friend of the Joint Awami Action Committee, all misunderstandings will be resolved.” Amir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end. We hope that [JAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.” Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views. The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad today to consider steps to defuse the situation. PM urges citizens to remain peaceful According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on X earlier today,  PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad. According to the PMO statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as yesterday’s violent protests left three policemen dead. He urged citizens to remain peaceful and instructed law enforcement agencies to show restraint. “The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful. He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.” PM Shehbaz, according to the statement, also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters. “The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers. Expressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter. “The prime minister has directed immediate assistance to the families affected by the demonstrations,” read the statement. “At the government level, to find a peaceful resolution to the issue, the prime minister has decided to expand the negotiation committee.” “The prime minister has appealed to the members and leadership of the JAAC to cooperate with the government’s negotiation committee. “The committee will send its recommendations and proposed solutions to the Prime Minister’s Office without delay so that steps can be taken for the immediate resolution of the issues.”",

We hope that [JAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.” Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views. The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad today to consider steps to defuse the situation. PM urges citizens to remain peaceful According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on X earlier today,  PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad. According to the PMO statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as yesterday’s violent protests left three policemen dead. He urged citizens to remain peaceful and instructed law enforcement agencies to show restraint. “The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful. He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.” PM Shehbaz, according to the statement, also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters. “The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers. Expressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter. “The prime minister has directed immediate assistance to the families affected by the demonstrations,” read the statement. “At the government level, to find a peaceful resolution to the issue, the prime minister has decided to expand the negotiation committee.” “The prime minister has appealed to the members and leadership of the JAAC to cooperate with the government’s negotiation committee. “The committee will send its recommendations and proposed solutions to the Prime Minister’s Office without delay so that steps can be taken for the immediate resolution of the issues.”",

      "summary": "A high-level delegation of the government held negotiations with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Thursday in a bid to put an end to the ongoing unrest in the territory. “A high-level delegation from Pakistan has started formal dialogue with representatives of the Joint Action Committee of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Muzaffarabad today,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry posted on X as the talks commenced. A strike has paralysed AJK under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JAAC , the AJK government, and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wednesday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq and federal minister Chaudhry invited the JAAC for fresh dialogue. Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK and directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to AJK capital Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues. The committee includes Senator Rana Sanaullah as well as federal ministers Sardar Yusuf and Ahsan Iqbal, former President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Masood Khan, and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira. Photos shared by Chaudhry on X showed him, Kaira, Sanaullah, Iqbal, Kashmir Affairs Federal Minister Amir Muqam, PPP leader Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousuf among those participating in today’s negotiations. Before the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarbad, members of a government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days. Among them, Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role in address the issues in AJK. But, he added, given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”. He said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK but they should also be mindful that no such situation was creating of which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage. AJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks to AJK and expressed the hope that members of the JAAC would also work toward ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We all are saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives. As far as the  Joint Awami Action Committee is concerned, they are very honourable and disrespected people.” He stressed the solution to the ongoing unrest was through talks. “They are a part of our body and their pain is our pain, their difficulties are our difficulties.” Ashraf said that the loss of lives was unfortunate, whether it be because of the “administration or the civilian population”. Rana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace. “We are confident that when we sit with our friend of the Joint Awami Action Committee, all misunderstandings will be resolved.” Amir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end.

      "summary_orig": "A Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official has stated that there is “no assurance” that India and Pakistan players will shake hands when the two sides meet during the Women’s World Cup on Sunday, according to the BBC. The development comes days after tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over onto the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Men’s Asia Cup staged in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during all three clashes in the tournament. The tensions had culminated in India not accepting the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief. The tournament had seen the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May after India had launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan had denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention . Against this backdrop, Pakistan is kicking off its Women’s World Cup campaign today by playing Bangladesh in Colombo. Pakistan will face India in the tournament on Sunday. According to a report published by BBC Sport on Wednesday, BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia told BBC Stumped — a weekly cricket show — the following: “I cannot forecast anything, but our relationship with that particular hostile country is the same, there is no change in the last week.” He added, “India will play that match against Pakistan in Colombo, and all cricket protocols will be followed. I can only assure that whatever is in the Marylebone Cricket Club regulations of cricket, that will be done. “Whether there will be handshakes, whether there will be hugging, I cannot assure you of anything at this moment,” he said. Meanwhile, The Indian Express reported while citing BCCI sources that the Indian team had been advised by the board to avoid handshakes with Pakistan’s players before they departed for Sri Lanka. The sources noted, “The team won’t be shaking hands with the Pakistan team during the World Cup. The team has been informed by the BCCI bosses about this. The Indian board will stand by its players.” A day earlier, PCB chief Naqvi had refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the BCCI over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final. The closing ceremony of the Asia Cup had descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup. Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team. Subsequently, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday , Financial Express and Hindustan Times , reported that Naqvi had apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy. Responding to the media reports, Naqvi had stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.” The PCB chairman called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people. He slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”. “As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.”",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: While security forces put militants on the back foot in September, the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024. If this trend continues, the current year may turn out to be one of the deadliest in decades. This is the crux of two reports, issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), about militant violence in the country over the past month. According to PICSS, militant violence dropped significantly in Sept 2025, with both the number of attacks and militant capacity showing sharp declines compared to the record levels seen in Aug. The PICSS Militancy Database recorded 69 militant attacks in Sept — a 52 per cent reduction from August’s 143. These attacks resulted in 135 deaths and 173 injuries, whilst militants abducted at least 27 people. The fatalities included 61 security personnel, 20 militants, and 54 civilians. Amongst the injured were 74 security personnel and 99 civilians. Compared with August, the number of martyred security personnel declined by 16pc, militant fatalities by 66pc, and civilian deaths by 17pc, reflecting a notable decrease in lethality. If current trends continue, think tanks warn 2025 may be the ‘deadliest year’ in decade in terms of militant violence KP remained the most affected province, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. In mainland KP, 25 attacks caused 33 deaths — 20 security personnel, nine militants, and four civilians — whilst 42 people were injured. Militants kidnapped nine individuals, while security forces carried out 22 operations, killing 88 militants, though five personnel lost their lives and five militants were arrested. In the tribal districts (erstwhile Fata), 20 militant attacks claimed 21 lives — six security personnel, three militants, and 12 civilians — and injured seven. Militants also abducted four people, while security forces conducted 18 operations in these districts, killing 83 militants. However, 24 civilians also lost their lives during these actions. In Balochistan, 21 attacks claimed 79 lives — 33 security personnel, eight militants, and 38 civilians — and injured 122 others, including 37 security personnel and 85 civilians. Militants abducted 14 people. Security forces responded with seven major operations, killing 26 militants and arresting 10. Sindh experienced three attacks that killed two security personnel and injured two civilians. According to CRSS’s report, Pakistan witnessed an over 46pc surge in overall violence in its security landscape for the third quarter of 2025, with at least 901 fatalities and 599 injuries — amongst civilians, security personnel, and outlaws — resulting from 329 incidents of violence. “In just three quarters, 2025 has proven nearly as deadly as all of 2024, with 2,414 fatalities recorded compared to the entire tally of 2024 (2,546). With an entire quarter still remaining, this indicates that 2025 is on course to surpass last year’s toll. If the current trend continues, 2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade,” the report stated. Published in Dawn, October 2nd, 2025",

During the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazir, Senator Rana Sanaullah and PPP’s Navid Qamar and Ijaz Jakhrani at the NA speaker’s office, it was agreed that the matter would be taken up with PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam Nawaz. The war of words, which began over flood compensation , expanded to water rights on the Indus River, as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe. Addressing a press conference , PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira urged the CM not to fan ‘narrow nationalism’. “Differences should be kept within limits. You (Maryam Nawaz) are a woman and our sister, and our leader (Benazir Bhutto) too was a woman. Reconsider your tone.  What do you want to achieve by playing narrow nationalism… Do you want the rest to leave Punjab, and their rights to be ended?” Flanked by Usman Malik, Chaudhry Aslam Gill, and Faisal Mir, Mr Kaira said the country could not be run by a “single leader or institution”. “This country does not belong to any one person; it belongs to all of us. You (Maryam Nawaz) are not just a CM, you are also the daughter of Nawaz Sharif and the niece of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. If you say that you will not allow anyone to speak, this approach is not appropriate in any way. Reconsider this attitude,” he said. He further said the floods had caused immense damage, and the entire nation spoke with one voice on this. “Where something is wrong, we will point it out and we will protest. But when we give opinions or criticism, you start threatening. The question concerns flood management, but the response is to target the Sindh government,” he said. The PPP leader said BISP was even endorsed by the IMF. “It…provides immediate relief, and this was done before as well. If you don’t want to use BISP, fine; but in terms of transparency, BISP stands first, which is why the IMF itself directed that Rs200bn be added to it in this year’s budget. Our objections concern the relief mechanism,” he added. In response to the CM’s remarks about the canal project, he said there already existed a formula for water distribution, and the matter must be decided in the Council of Common Interests by the federal and provincial governments together. “The PPP has been unfairly blamed regarding canals.” PPP South Punjab President Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood said if the Punjab government was criticised, it was because of its failed policies that left the Seraiki belt submerged after floods. “Even in the past, there have been worse floods, yet never before were the people abandoned in such a helpless state,” he said, calling out the government for its ‘choreographed’ response. Azma’s presser On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said the PPP leaders were competing to hold press conferences against the Punjab government while claiming they were not politicising the plight of flood victims. Azma Bokhari further said that the PML-N took pride in “its popularity and public service”, and the PPP should focus on building its own support instead of such rhetoric. “Such statements make no difference, and PPP cannot stand on its own feet this way,” she added. She said this was not merely political differences but a deliberate attempt to target Punjab collectively. “Personal attacks will naturally invite a response. “You may use BISP in Sindh; we have no objection,” she said.
