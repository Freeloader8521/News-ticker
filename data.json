      "title_orig": "PTI says Imran’s sisters manhandled, ‘violently detained’ by police while camped outside Adiala jail",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI said late on Tuesday that police manhandled and “violently detained” the sisters of ex-premier Imran Khan from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with the party founder. The PTI had held a protest outside the jail on Tuesday, where Imran is currently incarcerated, but the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. Subsequently, the party held a sit-in outside the jail and criticised the prison administration for violating the court order in this regard. In a post on social media platform X after midnight, the party said Aleema Khan, Noreen Niazi and Dr Uzma Khan were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when the police action happened. It added that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi, MNA Shahid Khattak and other party workers, including several women, were “subjected to violence and picked up by police”. “What should be routine weekly court-mandated family visits, in accordance with Imran Khan’s rights as a prisoner, are being used as a tool of oppression and violence against his family members and supporters,” the party said. Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled. In a later video shared by the party, Noreen said that female police officials grabbed her by her hair and forced her down to the ground. “I didn’t understand it. I still don’t understand what happened,” she said, asserting that PTI workers were sitting peacefully outside the jail. Aleema said that at one point, Noreen was “practically unconscious” as she was dragged on the floor. “Thank goodness we saw and managed to set her free,” she said. She also asserted that the incident would not “scare us”, adding that a press conference would be held later. “The way the women dragged us, ripped away our chaddors … they should be ashamed.” Aleema also alleged that her and her sisters were denied a meeting with Imran as “Asim Munir’s notification has not yet been signed”. In another post, the party condemned the “inhumane, unlawful, and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family members. It said that the PTI founder’s sisters, along with his legal team, had arrived at the jail to meet him on Tuesday but were denied the meeting and forced to wait until night. “By 10pm, despite spending twelve hours under severe distress, the Punjab government ordered an appalling operation that no civilised or democratic society could ever justify,” the PTI said. It alleged that the area where Imran’s sisters were seated was “intentionally flooded with water”. “The lights were switched off to plunge the entire place into darkness, and in the ensuing chaos, police physically assaulted Imran Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan and Uzma Khan,” it added. It further said that one of the sisters was dragged “across the road, manhandled, and violently detained despite her cries and the pleas of those present”. “This level of state oppression and cruelty represents an unprecedented assault on basic human dignity, constitutional freedoms, and moral norms,” it said. Meanwhile, a senior Rawalpindi police official told Dawn that no action was taken against the PTI protesters. He said that they were only removed from the road they were occupying. ‘Our collective humiliation’ KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the police action against Imran’s sisters and a member of his cabinet. “The attempt to arrest MNA Shahid Khattak and other provincial and national assembly members is also condemnable,” he said, adding that things were now progressing to a point of no return. “This is today’s Pakistan — where the sanctity of a woman’s veil is violated. The sisters’ only fault was that they came to meet their brother,” said ex-president Arif Alvi. “With every crime, the usurpers feel more and more immune. Abductions, arrests, raids, military court trials, rigged elections, amendments — all are connected. Every time they get away with no accountability, they feel more immune. Every time the bureaucracy, media, and judiciary, instead of resisting falls in line, they are emboldened,” said activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir. He said that the Iddat case against Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi, the recent discourse on an article published by The Economist about the couple and the manhandling of the PTI founder’s sister all served one purpose: to humiliate. “It is a fallacy to think this is Imran Khan’s or PTI’s humiliation alone. It is our collective humiliation. We are all being shown the price of dissent, the price of seeking justice, demanding democracy, and resisting oppression,” he said. Senior journalist Hamid Mir said that the current regime was not realising that the “inhumane and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family was tarnishing the country’s image globally. “It’s becoming difficult for our diplomats serving in the West to defend at public forums,” he said. Journalist Shahzad Iqbal termed the “dragging and manhandling [of] Imran Khan’s elderly sisters” a “shameless act of oppression”. A day ago, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz “was saying we don’t indulge in politics or revenge and victimisation, and then imagine this happening in her provincial jurisdiction,” Iqbal added. “Which Pakistan is this? What humanity is this?” asked Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. He said that the police action against Imran’s sisters was a “slap in the face of humanity and an example of the worst abuse of state power”. “Those who lay their hands on women are neither worthy of being called Muslims nor Pakistanis,” he said. PTI firebrand leader Sher Afzal Marwat condemned the treatment meted out to Noreen. “Such brutality against a citizen — let alone a woman — is unacceptable. The state has reached a new low, and this abuse of power must end!” he said. PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari said police had demonstrated “highly despicable behaviour” by attacking Imran’s sisters. “We strongly condemn this disgraceful and unjustifiable act by the police,” he said.",

It added that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi, MNA Shahid Khattak and other party workers, including several women, were “subjected to violence and picked up by police”. “What should be routine weekly court-mandated family visits, in accordance with Imran Khan’s rights as a prisoner, are being used as a tool of oppression and violence against his family members and supporters,” the party said. Videos shared by the party on social media platform X showed workers, Aleema and Uzma gathered around Noreen, who appeared visibly shaken. “Those women were dragging [her] on the road,” Aleema said as Noreen’s hands trembled. In a later video shared by the party, Noreen said that female police officials grabbed her by her hair and forced her down to the ground. “I didn’t understand it. I still don’t understand what happened,” she said, asserting that PTI workers were sitting peacefully outside the jail. Aleema said that at one point, Noreen was “practically unconscious” as she was dragged on the floor. “Thank goodness we saw and managed to set her free,” she said. She also asserted that the incident would not “scare us”, adding that a press conference would be held later. “The way the women dragged us, ripped away our chaddors … they should be ashamed.” Aleema also alleged that her and her sisters were denied a meeting with Imran as “Asim Munir’s notification has not yet been signed”. In another post, the party condemned the “inhumane, unlawful, and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family members. It said that the PTI founder’s sisters, along with his legal team, had arrived at the jail to meet him on Tuesday but were denied the meeting and forced to wait until night. “By 10pm, despite spending twelve hours under severe distress, the Punjab government ordered an appalling operation that no civilised or democratic society could ever justify,” the PTI said. It alleged that the area where Imran’s sisters were seated was “intentionally flooded with water”. “The lights were switched off to plunge the entire place into darkness, and in the ensuing chaos, police physically assaulted Imran Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan and Uzma Khan,” it added. It further said that one of the sisters was dragged “across the road, manhandled, and violently detained despite her cries and the pleas of those present”. “This level of state oppression and cruelty represents an unprecedented assault on basic human dignity, constitutional freedoms, and moral norms,” it said. Meanwhile, a senior Rawalpindi police official told Dawn that no action was taken against the PTI protesters. He said that they were only removed from the road they were occupying. ‘Our collective humiliation’ KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the police action against Imran’s sisters and a member of his cabinet. “The attempt to arrest MNA Shahid Khattak and other provincial and national assembly members is also condemnable,” he said, adding that things were now progressing to a point of no return. “This is today’s Pakistan — where the sanctity of a woman’s veil is violated. The sisters’ only fault was that they came to meet their brother,” said ex-president Arif Alvi. “With every crime, the usurpers feel more and more immune. Abductions, arrests, raids, military court trials, rigged elections, amendments — all are connected. Every time they get away with no accountability, they feel more immune. Every time the bureaucracy, media, and judiciary, instead of resisting falls in line, they are emboldened,” said activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir. He said that the Iddat case against Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi, the recent discourse on an article published by The Economist about the couple and the manhandling of the PTI founder’s sister all served one purpose: to humiliate. “It is a fallacy to think this is Imran Khan’s or PTI’s humiliation alone. It is our collective humiliation. We are all being shown the price of dissent, the price of seeking justice, demanding democracy, and resisting oppression,” he said. Senior journalist Hamid Mir said that the current regime was not realising that the “inhumane and disgraceful treatment” of Imran’s family was tarnishing the country’s image globally. “It’s becoming difficult for our diplomats serving in the West to defend at public forums,” he said. Journalist Shahzad Iqbal termed the “dragging and manhandling [of] Imran Khan’s elderly sisters” a “shameless act of oppression”. A day ago, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz “was saying we don’t indulge in politics or revenge and victimisation, and then imagine this happening in her provincial jurisdiction,” Iqbal added. “Which Pakistan is this? What humanity is this?” asked Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. He said that the police action against Imran’s sisters was a “slap in the face of humanity and an example of the worst abuse of state power”. “Those who lay their hands on women are neither worthy of being called Muslims nor Pakistanis,” he said. PTI firebrand leader Sher Afzal Marwat condemned the treatment meted out to Noreen. “Such brutality against a citizen — let alone a woman — is unacceptable. The state has reached a new low, and this abuse of power must end!” he said. PTI leader Sayed Zulfikar Bukhari said police had demonstrated “highly despicable behaviour” by attacking Imran’s sisters. “We strongly condemn this disgraceful and unjustifiable act by the police,” he said.",

      "summary": "The PTI said late on Tuesday that police manhandled and “violently detained” the sisters of ex-premier Imran Khan from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with the party founder. The PTI had held a protest outside the jail on Tuesday, where Imran is currently incarcerated, but the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said Saudi Arabia was being designated as a “major, non-Nato ally”. “Tonight, I’m pleased to announce that we’re taking our military cooperation to even greater heights by formally designating Saudi Arabia as a major non-Nato ally, which is something that is very important to them,” Trump said during a formal black-tie dinner at the White House. “And I’m just telling you now for the first time, because they wanted to keep a little secret for tonight,” Trump said of the designation, which only 19 other countries have previously received. View this post on Instagram According to Politico , the other countries in that category include Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Qatar. The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in June had made Saudi Arabia safer, Trump added. Meanwhile, bin Salman had earlier promised to increase his country’s US investment to $1 trillion from a $600 billion pledge he made when Trump visited Saudi Arabia in May. But offered no details or timetable. In his remarks at the dinner, the Saudi crown prince thanked Trump for the “warm welcome” accorded to him. “This relationship started close to nine decades ago,” he said, adding that the two countries had worked together during this period. “But today is a special day. We think the horizon of economic cooperation between US and Saudi Arabia, it’s bigger and wider,” he said, adding that the two were also signing agreements that would lead to deeper ties. Defence agreement Separately, a White House fact sheet said the two sides signed a Strategic Defence Agreement, which “fortifies deterrence across the Middle East,” makes it easier for US defense firms to operate in the country and secures “new burden-sharing funds from Saudi Arabia to defray US costs”. The agreement appeared to fall short of the congressionally ratified Nato-style treaty Saudi Arabia initially sought. The White House announced Trump had approved future deliveries of F-35 fighter jets and the Saudis had agreed to purchase 300 American tanks. The sale of the stealth fighter jets to the kingdom, which has requested to buy 48 of the advanced aircraft, would mark the first US sale of the advanced fighter jets to Riyadh, a significant policy shift. The deal could alter the military balance in the Middle East and test Washington’s definition of maintaining what the US has termed Israel’s “qualitative military edge”. Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East to have the F-35. The two countries also signed a joint declaration on the completion of negotiations on civil nuclear energy cooperation, which the White House said would build the legal foundation for a long-term nuclear energy partnership. Bin Salman has been seeking a deal to unlock access to US nuclear technology and help Saudi Arabia level up with the UAE and traditional regional foe Iran. But progress on such a nuclear pact has been difficult because the Saudis have resisted a US stipulation that would rule out enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel.",

The deal could alter the military balance in the Middle East and test Washington’s definition of maintaining what the US has termed Israel’s “qualitative military edge”. Until now, Israel has been the only country in the Middle East to have the F-35. The two countries also signed a joint declaration on the completion of negotiations on civil nuclear energy cooperation, which the White House said would build the legal foundation for a long-term nuclear energy partnership. Bin Salman has been seeking a deal to unlock access to US nuclear technology and help Saudi Arabia level up with the UAE and traditional regional foe Iran. But progress on such a nuclear pact has been difficult because the Saudis have resisted a US stipulation that would rule out enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel.",

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab government has formed 12 joint investigation teams (JITs) to probe several cases registered against the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in Lahore and Sheikhupura districts, it emerged on Wednesday. The teams were notified by the provincial home department in similar notifications, of which 11 are dated November 6 and one was issued on October 31. According to the notifications, seen by Dawn , the provincial government ordered the formation of five JITs under the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 for as many cases registered against the TLP in Sheikhupura district. Of these, four cases have been registered in Muridke tehsil and one in Ferozewala tehsil. Another seven JITs have been formed to carry out the investigation in as many cases registered in Lahore. Of these cases, three have been registered in the  Nawankot area, three in Shahdara Town and one in the Ravi Road area. For the cases registered in Sheikhupura, each JIT will comprise six members, including a superintendent of police (SP), sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), station house officer (SHO), investigating officer (IO), a representative from the Counter-terrorism Department (CTD) in the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP), and any co-opted member. For the cases lodged in Lahore, each JIT is to have five members, including SP Investigation, DSP Investigation, IO, a representative from CTD in the rank of DSP and any co-opted member. The notifications further added that the “convener of the JIT shall depute one of the members of the JIT, for the purpose of submission of the report,” as required by Section 19(1) of the ATA 1997. Crackdown on TLP In recent weeks, the Punjab government has intensified action against the TLP following a ban imposed on the party after a violent clash between TLP protesters and law enforcement personnel in Muridke last month. The now-banned group had launched a protest march in support of Gaza and Palestine, planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration outside the US embassy. However, the group’s movement was thwarted as violent clashes erupted, with reports of party workers attacking law enforcement agencies. Subsequently, the federal government imposed a ban on the party at the request of the Punjab government, concluding that TLP was “involved in terrorism and violent acts”. Meanwhile, authorities continue to look for TLP Chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi, whose disappearance has seemingly baffled the Punjab police and other law enforcement agencies. The TLP chief and his brother were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 first information reports lodged against them. On October 29, the duo, including 21 other senior TLP leaders, were placed on the Provisional National Identification List (PNIL) to prevent them from travelling abroad. A senior officer in the Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore told Dawn on Nov 13 that so far, Lahore police have reportedly arrested a total of the group’s 1,250 key members, including their financiers and the workers wanted in over 100 criminal cases. The official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of party. So, the major focus of the police remained on arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore. A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke, where they had encountered the LEAs. The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said, adding that the crackdowns continued daily. As per sources, the sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members have increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes. A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid a police crackdown. On Tuesday, Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari detailed that assets worth Rs23.40 billion belonging to the TLP had been frozen, along with 92 bank accounts linked to the organisation.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States confirmed the sale to Taiwan of an advanced missile system worth almost $700 million, its second weapons package in a week, bringing the total to $1 billion, and reaffirmed support for Taipei . In the Indo-Pacific region, only Australia and Indonesia now operate the system, three of which the US said last year Taiwan would receive as part of a $2-billion weapons sale. The National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) medium-range air defence solutions, as they are called, are made by RTX. They have been battle-tested in Ukraine , but are a new weapon for Taiwan. The Pentagon said the company was given a firm fixed-price contract for procurement of the NASAMS units, with work estimated to be completed in February 2031. “Fiscal 2026 foreign military sales (Taiwan) funds in the amount of $698,948,760 were obligated,” it said in a statement on Monday. RTX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Used in Ukraine to defend against the Russian invasion , the NASAMS system offers a sharp boost in air defence capabilities that the US is exporting to Taiwan as demand for it surges. ‘Rock solid’ US support “It should be clear today and will remain clear into the future that America’s commitments to Taiwan are rock solid,” Raymond Greene, the de facto US ambassador in Taipei, told an event of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan on Tuesday. “We are backing these words with actions, with a focus on supporting Taiwan’s efforts to achieve peace through strength. Nowhere is this more apparent than in our growing defence industrial cooperation.” Thursday’s US approval of the sale of fighter jet and other aircraft parts to Taiwan for $330m was its first such deal since US President Donald Trump took office in January, prompting thanks from Taipei and anger in Beijing. The arms sales news comes amid a worsening diplomatic crisis between Beijing and Tokyo over Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, although Taipei’s government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims. On Sunday, Chinese coast guard ships sailed through waters around a group of East China Sea islands controlled by Japan but claimed by China. Japan said it also scrambled fighter jets on Saturday, after China flew a drone between Taiwan and Japan’s westernmost island of Yonaguni. Asked about the tension on Wednesday, Taiwan Defence Minister Wellington Koo said China should not resort to force to resolve disputes. “China should abandon its thinking of using force to resolve things,” he told reporters. Taiwan’s military is beefing up its armaments to better tackle any attack from China, through efforts such as building its own submarines to defend vital maritime supply lines. China’s military operates around Taiwan on an almost daily basis in what Taipei views as a “grey zone” strategy to test and exhaust Taiwan’s forces. Despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties, the US is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, to the constant anger of Beijing.",

      "summary_orig": "• DIG says speed limits for different roads to be set after completion of road safety, engineering audit • Police say prior to launch of e-challan system, citywide speed limit for cars, motorcycles, etc was 30km/h • In first phase, 60km/h limit set for cars, bikes and LTVs on Sharea Faisal • Many believe top speed on city’s main artery is ‘ok for bikers but too slow for cars’ KARACHI: The newly introduced automated e-ticketing system appears to have been launched in haste as traffic authorities have issued hundreds of challans for speeding, but they are yet to set the speed limit for vehicles on major thoroughfares, it emerged on Tuesday. Last week, authorities had installed speed limit signs on Sharea Faisal, despite the fact that the traffic police had already issued 1,967 tickets for speeding within the first week (from Oct 27 to Nov 3) of the launch of the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (Tracs). The traffic police said they are in the process of fixing speed limits for vehicles on different arteries in the metropolis and in the first phase they set 60 kilometres per hour (km/h) on Sharea Faisal for all cars, motorbikes and light transport vehicles (LTVs) and 30 km/h for heavy transport vehicles (HTVs). DIG Traffic Pir Mohammed Shah conceded that at present “road-specific speed limits” were not notified. “A comprehensive road safety and engineering audit including assessment of road geometry, access points, pedestrian activity, and traffic flow is under way,” he told Dawn. “Once the audit is completed, revised and road-specific speed limits will be notified.” He said that currently a uniform, but interim, speed limit is in place for all roads in the metropolis. “At present, the citywide speed limit for HTVs is 60 km/h, while for cars, motorcycles and LTV it is 30 km/h,” he said. However, he did not know when this speed limit had been fixed or whether it had ever been revised. Asked as to how fines were imposed over speeding violation, the DIG claims: “Limits were displayed from the day 1 through digital boards on all digital streamers across the city.” DIG defends speed limit on signal-free Sharea Faisal People using Sharea Faisal for their daily commute are expressing their surprise over the speed limit of 60 km/h, saying the road is almost signal free from Hotel Metropole traffic intersection to Karachi Airport. Many people are of the view that the speed limit makes sense for motorcyclists, but for cars, 60 km/h is too slow on a signal-free road. A senior official, requesting anonymity, told Dawn that Sharea Faisal is used for VVIP traffic and vehicles part of their motorcade drive at the minimum speed of 100 km/h. “The speed limit should have been 80 km/h for LTVs and cars and 60 km/h for motorbikes,” he said. However, the DIG Traffic told Dawn the speed limit was fixed keeping in view road safety, and not traffic flow alone. He said although Sharea Faisal now functions as a signal-free corridor, “it remains a mixed-traffic urban artery, with multiple entry/exit points, pedestrian activity at certain locations, service lanes, and merging traffic from side roads”. “Higher speed will significantly increase the likelihood and severity of accidents,” he said. He believed that the 60 km/h limit was in line with “international standards for urban expressways where pedestrian and mixed-use interactions still exist”. “Our goal is to maintain smooth traffic movement while prioritising the safety of commuters, motorcyclists and pedestrians,” DIG Shah said. He said that the 30 km/h speed limit for heavy vehicles was due to their “size, braking distance and impact force”, which posed a significantly higher risk at high speeds. “Even at night, Sharea Faisal continues to have private traffic, motorcyclists, and ride-hailing vehicles, and any high-speed accident involving a heavy vehicle can be catastrophic,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "Cloudflare, a content delivery network (CDN) and domain name server (DNS) service, said on Tuesday that it had implemented a fix and that the issue was now resolved following a global outage that affected access to web services worldwide “A fix has been implemented and we believe the incident is now resolved. We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal,” said an update from the CDN, whose network handles around a fifth of web traffic, posted at 7:42pm. It later said that some customers may be still experiencing issues logging into or using the Cloudflare dashboard. “We are working on a fix to resolve this, and continuing to monitor for any further issues,” it added. In a subsequent statement, Cloudfare said services were currently operating normally and it was no longer observing elevated errors or latency across the network. “Our engineering teams continue to closely monitor the platform and perform a deeper investigation into the earlier disruption, but no configuration changes are being made at this time. “At this point, it is considered safe to re-enable any Cloudflare services that were temporarily disabled during the incident. We will provide a final update once our investigation is complete,” it said. “Earlier today, we failed our customers and the broader internet when a problem in Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us,” chief technology officer Dane Knecht wrote on X, adding that the problem had since been resolved. “In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made.” The company said earlier there had been “a spike in unusual traffic” to one of its services. The incident marked the latest hit to major online services. An outage of Amazon’s cloud service last month caused global turmoil as thousands of popular websites and apps, including Snapchat and Reddit, were inaccessible due to the disruption. Cloudflare — whose shares were down about five per cent in premarket trading — runs one of the world’s largest networks that helps websites and apps load faster and stay online by protecting them from traffic surges and cyberattacks. Earlier today, disruptions in internet access were widely reported as Cloudflare reported experiencing issues in its global network. In an update on the situation posted at 6:09pm, it said: “We have made changes that have allowed Cloudflare Access and WARP to recover. Error levels for Access and WARP users have returned to pre-incident rates. We have re-enabled WARP access in London. We are continuing to work towards restoring other services.” It later said it was continuing to work on restoring service for application services customers. Earlier, the service provider said it was “aware of and investigating an issue” that was impacting multiple customers with widespread 500 errors, along with the Cloudflare dashboard and API application programming interface also failing. NetBlocks, a global internet watchdog, also said that a wide range of online services were experiencing disruptions due to a technical issue affecting Cloudflare’s global network. It added that the incident was not related to “country-level internet disruptions or filtering”. Downdetector showed that user reports from Pakistan indicated problems with Cloudflare, with complaints beginning around 4:10 pm. Problems were also reported with OpenAI, Amazon Web Services and Facebook. Social media platform X was also down for thousands of users in the United States and worldwide, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. There were more than 11,500 reports of issues with the social media platform as of 6:41am ET, according to Downdetector, which tracks outages by collating status reports from a number of sources. It was not immediately clear whether the outages were related. X and Cloudflare did not immediately respond to Reuters ’ requests for comment. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority said it was monitoring the global outage and was in contact with global platforms and local operators. It added that it would continue to observe the situation until services were fully restored. Cloudflare had also reported a “ widespread outage ” in June 2022 and several popular websites were unreachable. A DNS server is an address book that matches a website’s name (e.g. http://google.com ) to its real IP (a set of numbers). For nationwide use, you need DNS servers that can handle a lot of traffic and respond fast. Additional reporting by Umaid Ali and input from AFP.",

Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh toppled Sheikh Hasina’s government in August last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.

Addressing a gathering of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam members today at Dhaka’s Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre as the chief guest with several other Bengali political parties in attendance, Fazl said: “Pakistan wants Bangladesh’s prosperity and stability, has forgotten the bitter memories of the past.” He reiterated that the people of Pakistan had “forgotten the old bitter memories”, adding that now “a new future has to be carved”. The JUI-F chief added Pakistan saw Bangladesh as a “brother”. “We were one, and God willing, we will remain one. Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh will be strengthened by the spirit of goodwill,” he added.

      "summary_orig": "The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday that 38 terrorists were killed in four separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted over a period of three days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In a statement, the military’s media affairs said that the operations were carried out between November 15 and 16, adding that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The first IBO was conducted by security forces in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said, adding that troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location. As a result, ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed, it said. In another IBO conducted in Datta Khel in North Waziristan district, troops killed five more terrorists, the ISPR said. In a separate statement later in the day, the ISPR said two IBOs took place between November 16-17 in Bajaur district and Bannu district, killing 11 and 12 terrorists, respectively. It added that terrorist ringleader Sajjad alias Abuzar was also killed in the Bajaur IBO. The ISPR said that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other “Indian-sponsored” terrorists found in the area, asserting that the counter terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operations. In a statement, he said that work would continue on eliminating foreign-backed terrorists with national consensus. He attributed the killing of the terrorist ringleader to the successful strategy of the security forces. He further said that political moves to divert attention from the national consensus on terrorism would not be tolerated. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the security forces. “Under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security forces are achieving great successes against terrorism,” he said in a statement. “We are determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country,” he said. Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.",

      "title_orig": "Karachi woman given 8 years by US court for lying about terrorist acts",
      "summary_orig": "A woman in the Texas town of Frisco has been sentenced to eight years in prison for making false statements about alleged terrorist acts in Karachi, it emerged on Tuesday. In a statement released by the US Justice Department last Friday, Acting US Attorney in the Eastern District of Texas Jay R Combs identified the woman as 34-year-old Kahkashan Haider Khan . The Justice Department stated that Haider pleaded guilty to making false statements in relation to international terrorism and was sentenced to 96 months in federal prison by US District Judge Amos L Mazzant III on October 7, 2025. “We will not allow the United States to be a launching point for terrorist attacks abroad,” said Acting US Attorney Jay R Combs. “Vigilantly protecting the United States and its interests is inherent in everything we do. This includes aggressively prosecuting those who wrongly believe that they can find safe harbour in the United States while plotting crimes elsewhere.” FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge R Joseph Rothrock said, “The FBI will aggressively investigate individuals planning or taking part in acts of violence in support of terrorism. We take these crimes seriously and will work with our international partners to hold perpetrators accountable.” According to information presented in court, on February 23, 2023, Haider was interviewed by special agents from the FBI regarding her involvement in the planned fire-bombing of two gas stations in Karachi. The Justice Department identified Haider, a US citizen and immigrant from Pakistan, as “a member of a separatist movement in Pakistan known as the Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), which claims grievances against the Pakistani government over the treatment of muhajir immigrants in Pakistan”. The statement claimed that Haider “served as a recruiter and facilitator of terrorist actions in Pakistan by collecting funds, sending them to Pakistan, and arranging and paying for violent actions in Pakistan”. The department reported that in January 2023, Haider recruited an individual in Pakistan to conduct fire-bombings on two Punjabi-owned gas stations in Karachi, Pakistan. Haider discussed multiple aspects of the plan with her co-conspirator in Pakistan, including selecting the target locations, discussing which flammable accelerants to use, where to stage before the attacks, how to escape after the attacks, and arranging for the purchase of two firearms to be used by the attackers to ensure their success, the statement added. The department claimed that Haider collected money from MQM sympathisers in the United States and wired the funds to Pakistan to pay for the attacks. The details show that on February 20, 2023, Haider’s co-conspirator in Pakistan sent her photos from news coverage of a fire-bombing of a Karachi gas station caused by attackers throwing something from a vehicle, resulting in six people being burned. Haider “celebrated the news and told her Pakistani co-conspirator that he would be greatly rewarded for his work. Throughout that day, February 20, 2023, Haider scoured the internet for news in Pakistan regarding the fire-bombing but could find none.” After approximately one day of searching, she discovered that the photos her co-conspirator sent were from an event that occurred in October 2022. Haider “was furious and accused her co-conspirator of deceit and being a disgrace to the MQM movement”, the Justice Department noted. On February 23, 2024, FBI special agents interviewed Haider at her home about these events. During the interview, she made multiple false statements about the events and lied about her involvement in the attempted attacks. Haider denied that she wanted a co-conspirator to commit the fire-bombings in Pakistan. She denied that she was involved in an action in Pakistan that would possibly result in someone’s harm or death. During her plea hearing in February 2025, she admitted that these were false statements made knowing that the statements were material to a terrorism investigation.",

      "summary_en": "A woman in the Texas town of Frisco has been sentenced to eight years in prison for making false statements about alleged terrorist acts in Karachi, it emerged on Tuesday. In a statement released by the US Justice Department last Friday, Acting US Attorney in the Eastern District of Texas Jay R Combs identified the woman as 34-year-old Kahkashan Haider Khan . The Justice Department stated that Haider pleaded guilty to making false statements in relation to international terrorism and was sentenced to 96 months in federal prison by US District Judge Amos L Mazzant III on October 7, 2025. “We will not allow the United States to be a launching point for terrorist attacks abroad,” said Acting US Attorney Jay R Combs. “Vigilantly protecting the United States and its interests is inherent in everything we do. This includes aggressively prosecuting those who wrongly believe that they can find safe harbour in the United States while plotting crimes elsewhere.” FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge R Joseph Rothrock said, “The FBI will aggressively investigate individuals planning or taking part in acts of violence in support of terrorism. We take these crimes seriously and will work with our international partners to hold perpetrators accountable.” According to information presented in court, on February 23, 2023, Haider was interviewed by special agents from the FBI regarding her involvement in the planned fire-bombing of two gas stations in Karachi. The Justice Department identified Haider, a US citizen and immigrant from Pakistan, as “a member of a separatist movement in Pakistan known as the Muhajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), which claims grievances against the Pakistani government over the treatment of muhajir immigrants in Pakistan”. The statement claimed that Haider “served as a recruiter and facilitator of terrorist actions in Pakistan by collecting funds, sending them to Pakistan, and arranging and paying for violent actions in Pakistan”. The department reported that in January 2023, Haider recruited an individual in Pakistan to conduct fire-bombings on two Punjabi-owned gas stations in Karachi, Pakistan. Haider discussed multiple aspects of the plan with her co-conspirator in Pakistan, including selecting the target locations, discussing which flammable accelerants to use, where to stage before the attacks, how to escape after the attacks, and arranging for the purchase of two firearms to be used by the attackers to ensure their success, the statement added. The department claimed that Haider collected money from MQM sympathisers in the United States and wired the funds to Pakistan to pay for the attacks.
