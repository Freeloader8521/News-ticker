      "summary_orig": "Four members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have been arrested for their involvement in the suicide blast in Islamabad earlier this week, the government said on Friday. “In a joint operation conducted by the Intelligence Bureau Division and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), four members of the TTP/ Fitna al-Khawarij terrorist cell involved in the suicide attack at the Judicial Complex G-11, Islamabad have been apprehended,” the government said in a post on social media platform X. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP. The government said that during the investigation, the handler of the suicide bomber, identified as Sajidullah alias Sheena, confessed that TTP Commander Saeedur Rehman alias Daadullah contacted him through the Telegram app to carry out a suicide attack in Islamabad to cause maximum casualties of law enforcement agencies. The government said that the TTP commander sent pictures of the suicide bomber, identified as Usman alias Qari, for Sheena to recieve him. It further said that on the directives of the TTP commander, Sheena collected a suicide jacket from a graveyard in Peshawar and brought it to Islamabad. On the day of the blast, the handler “set the suicide jacket” on the suicide bomber, the government added. “The network was handled and guided at every step by the Fitna al-Khawarij /TTP high command based in Afghanistan. The entire cell involved in the incident, including its commander and three other members, has been arrested,” the government said. “Investigations are continuing, and more revelations and arrests are expected,” it added. At least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured as a bomb blast ripped through the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on Tuesday. The blast occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the sixth Margalla Dialogue. Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had said earlier that the bomber was “not a Pakistani national”, while Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the blast was “related to Afghanistan”. The incident in Islamabad had come the same week as an attack on the Cadet College in Wana that was successfully thwarted. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accused Afghanistan and India of being involved in recent terrorist activity, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.",

The post gave no details of what the operation would entail or how it might differ from military actions already being undertaken.

CBS News on Wednesday cited multiple sources as saying senior military officials had presented Trump with updated options for potential operations in Venezuela, including strikes on land. Venezuela announced on Tuesday what it called a major, nationwide military deployment to counter the growing US naval presence off its coast — including a newly arrived US aircraft carrier strike group in the region.

      "summary_orig": "The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) on Thursday issued a statement assailing the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, calling it a “flagrant attack” on judicial independence and the rule of law. Last year, the ICJ similarly derided the 26th Constitutional Amendment being signed into law as a “blow to judicial independence”. ICJ Secretary General Santiago Canton was quoted as saying: “The changes made to the judicial system in the 27th Amendment are alarming …They will significantly impair the judiciary’s ability to hold the executive accountable and protect the fundamental human rights of the people of Pakistan.” The jurists’ body expressed concern over several main points, namely the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), the appointment of judges and chief justices to the Supreme Court and the FCC, the composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the transfer of high court judges and the immunities granted to the president and the military leadership. “The FCC will have exclusive jurisdiction to decide disputes between any of Pakistan’s governments, provincial and federal and to adjudicate matters of public interest involving the enforcement of ‘fundamental rights’,” the statement read, adding that it can call for the record of any case and hear appeals if they deal with interpreting the Constitution. “Before the amendment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan exercised the functions that have now been given to the FCC,” the statement read. “Following the amendment, the Supreme Court will now effectively be an appellate court only in matters that do not involve the interpretation of the Constitution of Pakistan.” The ICJ further noted that the first batch of FCC judges would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, with future judges being appointed on the recommendation of the JCP, while the chief justice would be appointed by a “special parliamentary committee”. “The amendment does not provide any criteria on which the appointments will be made and does not require reasons to [be] given for the appointments, apart from general qualifications necessary to be considered a judge of the FCC,” the statement read. “The appointments are also of concern as the [chief justice] of the FCC and the senior-most judge of the FCC will also be members of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan … and the Supreme Judicial Council,” it highlighted. The ICJ noted that amendments to Article 200 (transfer of high court judges) allow the JCP to recommend that the president transfer a judge from one high court to another, with the judge in question forced to accept the transfer within 30 days, lest they be barred from judicial duties. “Article 200 fails to provide for any basis on which the JCP will decide when judges should be transferred and there is no requirement to establish a mechanism with clearly defined criteria and objectives to guide recommendations for transfer,” the ICJ said. “This arbitrary system makes it impossible to determine whether transfer might actually be intended to be punitive or retaliatory, rather than for the legitimate purpose of better administration of justice and public interest.” With regards to lifetime immunity granted to the president, the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the fleet under Articles 243 and 248, the ICJ said the amendments are “contrary to core rule of law principles, including accountability, access to justice, and equality before the law”. “No public official should ever be entirely unaccountable, as this effectively allows for the possibility of unlawful or arbitrary exercise of power without consequence,” the statement read. Senate’s approval The president signed the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest. Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.” The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”. The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.",

      "summary_orig": "NATION-building takes years, sometimes generations. Environmental rebuilding takes no less. It took us decades to poison our skies with unmanaged dust, unchecked exhaust, adulterated fuels, and unplanned sprawl. However, corrective measures have begun, not with promises, but with systems. This shift has been possible under the political direction of the Punjab chief minister, whose government has placed environment at the centre of the province’s development agenda, and the ad­­m­­inistrative follow-through of chief secretary Pun­­jab who ensured coordination across departments. The first principle of any reform is simple: you cannot manage what you cannot measure. The province, which had just three functional air quality monitoring stations donated in 2007, today operates 75 with 10 mobile units roaming hotspot districts. Twenty-five more will be live by the end of 2025, creating the most extensive environmental monitoring network ever attempted in Pakistan. Measurement has also enabled precision forecasting. An artificial intelligence model, developed with satellite support, now predicts seven-day smog patterns, allowing the authorities to prepare before the crisis peaks. This is complemented by a central monitoring room — the Smog War Room — linking divisional weather rooms, enforcement units, and dashboards that track real-time operations, from fog cannon deployment to vehicle testing and industrial compliance. It is pertinent to mention here that smog is not a single-source problem. Punjab’s source apportionment study, being conducted through Suparco, has indicated fugitive dust as one of the largest contributors to particulate matter during winter. It emanates from unpaved roads, dry construction sites, and neglected public works. To respond, the province has deployed 15 high-capacity mist cannons mounted on trucks with water bowsers. These are not ceremonial gadgets but engineered systems capable of suppressing dust over 120 metres. Furthermore, Pakistan’s first dust-control SOPs now require mist sprinkling and site fencing at all construction sites. An AI model predicts seven-day smog patterns, allowing the authorities to prepare. Parallel to dust suppression runs a quieter but equally significant reform: fuel quality control. In a province of millions of motorcycles and vehicles, there was not a single fuel testing lab until recently. Now, three state-of-the-art labs in Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Multan, along with three mobile units, test samples daily. Punjab’s new emission testing system, with 100 analysers and 22 fixed stations in Lahore alone, has screened more than 260,000 vehicles this year. The Environmental Protection Force — 250 new officers on electric bikes equipped with body cameras — has given enforcement a human face backed by digital proof. Through five newly built divisional offices and four more under construction, this force is operational in hotspot districts and supported by the Smog War Room, 67 quick response centres and AI-linked CCTV feeds. A bilingual helpline, WhatsApp Chatbot, and Green Punjab App have given citizens 24/7 access to file complaints, check case status, and receive health advisories. The system now closes 96 per cent of complaints. Under the supervision of senior minister for environment, these enforcement and digital-governance reforms have evolved into a province-wide Clean Air Framework that links industry, transport, and agriculture into one chain of accountability. She provided the strategic continuity that turned environmental intent into institutional reform. Punjab launched and implemented the Climate Resilient Punjab Vision and Action Plan 2024 — the province’s first-ever climate policy that introduced a whole-of-government approach to tackling air, water, land and waste challenges. The policy did not end at approval; it evolved into coordinated action across governance, enforcement and citizen engagement. The shift from reaction to planning extends to agriculture as well. Stubble burning, long seen as an intractable cultural habit, is being addressed through a combination of technology, incentives, and surveillance. Satellite-based fire anomaly alerts trigger ground responses from the Environment Protection Force and district teams. The government has subsidised 5,000 super seeders and plans another 5,000 under the Punjab Clean Air Programme, while interest-free loans of Rs30 billion have been opened for modern harvesters and balers. Farmers in treated zones report significant reductions in open burning, with over half a million acres now harvested through mechanised, low-emission means. Industrial reform has been equally systemic. More than 13,500 industries have been mapped with drone-assisted verification and given digital IDs. The Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production Programme has disbursed Rs1.18bn in soft loans to small industries to retrofit emission control systems. What once depended on surprise visits now runs on e-compliance, drone monitoring and traceable reopening after verified compliance. A parallel greening drive — 25 million trees, 2.1m along the Green Ring around Lahore alone — has begun to form a living buffer between concrete and air. Financing mechanisms have been modernised to keep the green agenda solvent. The Environment Endowment Fund, backed by $50 million from the World Bank, anchor long-term projects in research, innovation, and industrial adaptation.

      "summary_en": "NATION-building takes years, sometimes generations. Environmental rebuilding takes no less. It took us decades to poison our skies with unmanaged dust, unchecked exhaust, adulterated fuels, and unplanned sprawl. However, corrective measures have begun, not with promises, but with systems. This shift has been possible under the political direction of the Punjab chief minister, whose government has placed environment at the centre of the province’s development agenda, and the ad­­m­­inistrative follow-through of chief secretary Pun­­jab who ensured coordination across departments. The first principle of any reform is simple: you cannot manage what you cannot measure. The province, which had just three functional air quality monitoring stations donated in 2007, today operates 75 with 10 mobile units roaming hotspot districts. Twenty-five more will be live by the end of 2025, creating the most extensive environmental monitoring network ever attempted in Pakistan. Measurement has also enabled precision forecasting. An artificial intelligence model, developed with satellite support, now predicts seven-day smog patterns, allowing the authorities to prepare before the crisis peaks. This is complemented by a central monitoring room — the Smog War Room — linking divisional weather rooms, enforcement units, and dashboards that track real-time operations, from fog cannon deployment to vehicle testing and industrial compliance. It is pertinent to mention here that smog is not a single-source problem. Punjab’s source apportionment study, being conducted through Suparco, has indicated fugitive dust as one of the largest contributors to particulate matter during winter. It emanates from unpaved roads, dry construction sites, and neglected public works. To respond, the province has deployed 15 high-capacity mist cannons mounted on trucks with water bowsers. These are not ceremonial gadgets but engineered systems capable of suppressing dust over 120 metres. Furthermore, Pakistan’s first dust-control SOPs now require mist sprinkling and site fencing at all construction sites. An AI model predicts seven-day smog patterns, allowing the authorities to prepare. Parallel to dust suppression runs a quieter but equally significant reform: fuel quality control. In a province of millions of motorcycles and vehicles, there was not a single fuel testing lab until recently. Now, three state-of-the-art labs in Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Multan, along with three mobile units, test samples daily. Punjab’s new emission testing system, with 100 analysers and 22 fixed stations in Lahore alone, has screened more than 260,000 vehicles this year. The Environmental Protection Force — 250 new officers on electric bikes equipped with body cameras — has given enforcement a human face backed by digital proof. Through five newly built divisional offices and four more under construction, this force is operational in hotspot districts and supported by the Smog War Room, 67 quick response centres and AI-linked CCTV feeds. A bilingual helpline, WhatsApp Chatbot, and Green Punjab App have given citizens 24/7 access to file complaints, check case status, and receive health advisories. The system now closes 96 per cent of complaints. Under the supervision of senior minister for environment, these enforcement and digital-governance reforms have evolved into a province-wide Clean Air Framework that links industry, transport, and agriculture into one chain of accountability. She provided the strategic continuity that turned environmental intent into institutional reform. Punjab launched and implemented the Climate Resilient Punjab Vision and Action Plan 2024 — the province’s first-ever climate policy that introduced a whole-of-government approach to tackling air, water, land and waste challenges. The policy did not end at approval; it evolved into coordinated action across governance, enforcement and citizen engagement. The shift from reaction to planning extends to agriculture as well. Stubble burning, long seen as an intractable cultural habit, is being addressed through a combination of technology, incentives, and surveillance. Satellite-based fire anomaly alerts trigger ground responses from the Environment Protection Force and district teams. The government has subsidised 5,000 super seeders and plans another 5,000 under the Punjab Clean Air Programme, while interest-free loans of Rs30 billion have been opened for modern harvesters and balers. Farmers in treated zones report significant reductions in open burning, with over half a million acres now harvested through mechanised, low-emission means. Industrial reform has been equally systemic. More than 13,500 industries have been mapped with drone-assisted verification and given digital IDs. The Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production Programme has disbursed Rs1.18bn in soft loans to small industries to retrofit emission control systems. What once depended on surprise visits now runs on e-compliance, drone monitoring and traceable reopening after verified compliance. A parallel greening drive — 25 million trees, 2.1m along the Green Ring around Lahore alone — has begun to form a living buffer between concrete and air. Financing mechanisms have been modernised to keep the green agenda solvent. The Environment Endowment Fund, backed by $50 million from the World Bank, anchor long-term projects in research, innovation, and industrial adaptation.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Amid fresh reports that the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief and his brother are still ‘missing’ after the launch of large-scale operation against the party in mid of October in Muridke , the provincial capital police have reportedly arrested a total of its 1,250 key members including the financiers and the workers wanted in over 100 criminal cases so far. “We didn’t know where TLP chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi have gone,” a senior officer in Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore told this reporter on Thursday. According to him, both of them were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 FIRs lodged against them. Quoting the intelligence reports, the police official said the TLP chief and his brother were not using any kind of electronic gadget or device and that was the leading factor that helped them to stay away from the radars/gadgets of the law enforcers. Officials claim arrest of 1,250 key members, financiers; say duo not using gadgets; reject allegations about harassing female family members of ‘wanted’ TLP men “We used many modern gadgets and technologies to trace them but failed to find out their whereabouts in the country,” the official claimed. He said the ‘mysterious disappearance’ of Saad and Anas has baffled the Punjab police and other law-enforcement agencies. “I can only make sure that they are not in Punjab’s territory,” the official said, adding that the provincial police experts, who were assigned tasks to trace and arrest them, could only obtain four possible locations when they managed to flee from Muridke city soon after the operation. Their locations were identified in a remote area of Muridke, then in Lahore and Azad Jammu & Kashmir. As per the later reports, the Punjab police were informed that the TLP chief and his brother may have gone underground in Karachi, he said. About the crackdown in Lahore, the official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of the party. So, the major focus of the police remained arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore. “We have prepared two lists of the TLP members for carrying out violent agitation and attacks on the police,” he said. A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke where they had encountered with the LEAs. The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said adding that in the crackdowns continued on a daily basis, the city police have arrested a total of 1,250 hardcore TLP members and the financiers so far. Sources said sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes. A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid police crackdown. According to the sources, they had no option other than to abandon the educational activities of their children as they were frequently changing locations amid reports that the police teams were vigorously pursuing them to complete the ‘targeted’ arrests. The police officers, however, claimed that they were not harassing or arresting the female members of the TLP members wanted in the cases lodged against them under heinous offences. Talking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity, a station house officer (SHO) posted in Lahore confirmed that they were under immense pressure to complete the task of arresting the ‘wanted’ TLP men. In order to trace them, they had no option other than to take into custody the close relatives of the ‘targets’ including father, brothers, young sons and their immediate cousins. “After taking them into custody, we used to get the call record data of the close male relatives of the wanted TLP men to find out whether they were in contact with them or not,” the SHO said. Though this practice could not be justified, it was employed to reach the ‘targeted’ TLP men and in many cases it worked and helped them to arrest the suspects. He, however, rejected the allegations that they were harassing the female family members of the ‘wanted’ TLP men. Published in Dawn, November 14th, 2025",

Parliamentary Affairs Minis­ter Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry presented the resolution in the NA hours after Law Minister Azam Nazeer presented a similar resolution in the Senate. Through the resolution, the NA expressed gratitude for the personal efforts of the president of Sri Lanka, the country’s defence minister, and the entire government of Sri Lanka for their decision to continue the cricket tour of Pakistan. “The House appreciates the Sri Lanka Cricket Board’s decision to proceed with the tour despite all threats,” the resolution stated. The resolution also acknowledged the zeal and dedication of Interior Minister and PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, for their all-out efforts in ensuring the successful continuation of the tour. Earlier in the day, while speaking in the Senate Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir facilitated talks with Sri Lanka, which led to the visiting team’s decision to stay in Pakistan for the ongoing matches. According to media reports, Sri Lan­kan players on Wednesday wanted to ret­urn to their homeland due to security concerns following a suicide attack at the Islamabad Judicial Complex that clai­med 12 lives and injured many others. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said they were thankful to the Sri Lankan government “which assured us that it stands by Pakistan in the war on terror and did not recall its team.” Mr Tarar read out the resolution, which recognised the historic and brotherly relations be­­tween Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and appreciated the spirit of spo­­rtsmanship and mutual trust that continues to stren­gthen ties between the two nations. Mr Naqvi said Sri Lanka’s cricket board confirmed late last night that its team’s ongoing tour of Pakistan would proceed. “Our field marshal himself spoke to their defence minister and secretary, convincing them and assuring them fully of [providing] security,” Mr Naqvi, who also serves as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, said while speaking on the Senate floor. He recalled that the Sri Lankan team had initially “decided to return after the bomb blast occurred”. “Our interaction with them began, and their board, players, and everyone decided with great bravery to stay here,” the PCB chairman added. “They had many concerns, but we tried to allay all of those,” Mr Naqvi said, highlighting that Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had spoken to his country’s team to convince them. Mr Naqvi revealed that Field Marshal Munir had played a key role in the visiting team’s decision to continue the tour. “Now, the Pakistan Army, Rangers, and Islamabad Police are jointly managing their security, and we are providing them the same kind of protocol and protection as our state guests,” the interior minister said. Naqvi meets SL team Later, Interior Minister Moh­sin Naqvi met Sri Lankan players and termed their act of continuing with series — a victory of peace and defeat of terrorists, as Zimbabwe’s squad also reached in Islamabad to participate in the triangular series. Mr Naqvi, along with State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Sri Lankan High Commissioner retired Rear Admiral Fred Siriweera, visited Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, where hosts Pakistan and Sri Lankan team were practicing ahead of second ODI, which will be played on Friday (today).

However, the suggestions will be discussed in a meeting of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday (today), followed by a press conference. The parliamentary party’s meeting was chaired by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief and TTAP chairman, and attended by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Asad Qaiser and other members of the National Assembly. Former NA speaker Qaiser, while talking to Dawn , said during the meeting, proposals were sought to devise a strategy after the passage of the 27th Amendment. “The participants [of the meeting] unanimously agreed that the incumbent government is not capable to run the country. At the same time there is an economic crisis, miserable law and order situation and the country is at the verge of a civil war,” he said. Mr Qaiser said Mr Achakzai was of the view that the countries, which lac­ked respect for the law and Constitution, were destined to fall apart. “[Mr] Achakzai suggested involving the religious segment of the society and holding a countrywide protest on Fridays.” Replying to a question, the former NA speaker said the resignation of the two judges was a commendable act and marked the first drop of rain against the government. “We urge the judiciary to stand on its feet because the whole nation will stand along with it over the issue,” he continued. He said that a meeting of the TTAP to be held on Friday would chalk out and announce the collective strategy of the joint opposition. KP CM denied meeting again Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was stopped from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan for the sixth time on Thursday. Mr Afridi, along with other leaders of the opposition, including Raja Nasir Abbas and Junaid Akbar, reached Adiala jail, but were not allowed to enter its premises. Later, they returned to their vehicles as the time for the meeting had expired. The KP chief minister, while talking to reporters, said that it was unfortunate that the orders of Islamabad High Court were not being implemented. It is worth mentioning that the apex court has directed to allow the KP chief minister’s meeting with the PTI founder. Mr Afridi wondered as to why there was a fear if he held a meeting with his party’s patron-in-chief. “Am I going to discuss nuclear secrets with him?” he remarked. He urged the security establishment to “focus on the borders of the country” and allow the politicians to address their issues through politics. Published in Dawn, November 14th, 2025",

      "title_orig": "CJP calls full court meeting tomorrow to discuss 27th Constitutional Amendment",
      "summary_orig": "Yielding to several letters from Supreme Court judges, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi called a full court meeting on Friday, after Justice Salahuddin Panhwar became the third judge to request that he convene the judges to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Earlier, senior puisne Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah had written separate letters to the CJP asking for a full court meeting or the convening of the judicial conference. However, the two justices resigned on Thursday evening in protest against the 27th Constitutional Amendment Justice Panwhar, in a two-page letter, requested the CJP to call the full court to examine the amendment clause by clause and study its implications against Articles 175, 175A, 189, 190, 191 and 209 of the Constitution — provisions which deal with the judiciary. Headed by the CJP, the full court meeting will be held at the Supreme Court building before the Friday prayers. Justice Panwhar stated he was writing the letter “not in protest but in … the duty that binds every judge who has sworn to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution”. “There comes a time when silence is not caution but abdication. I believe such a time may now be upon us,” the letter read. “From what has been foreshadowed, this amendment may unsettle the careful balance that the framers intended,” Justice Panwhar wrote, warning that the amendment may “touch upon the security of tenure, the composition of benches, the appointment and removal of judges, or even the financial and administrative autonomy of courts”. “Let us test each provision of the amendment by a single question: does it strengthen the independence of the judiciary, or diminish it?” Justice Panwhar’s letter suggested, stating that if the independence of the judiciary is diminished, then judges must say so, “not in anger but in truth”. Justice Panwhar also suggested commissioning a technical brief through the Pakistan Secretariat’s Law and Justice Commission and, if necessary, engaging the National Judicial Policy Making Committee. He also suggested that the Supreme Court confer with the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and provincial bar councils, since the “bar and the bench are twin guardians of justice”. The SC judge also asked to prepare to preserve their capacity under Article 190 of the Constitution, should litigation ensue, to ensure that the “judicial commands were not rendered hollow”. “Let our response be principled yet temperate and firm in defence of constitutional boundaries, but respectful of the comity due among organs of the State,” the judge wrote. “For Parliament’s power to amend is plenary, but it is not without limit, even if it does not say so,” the letter said, adding that the “Constitution was not clay to be moulded at will, it was a covenant between the state and citizen”. Justice Panwhar wrote that his request was not born of discord, but conscience. He emphasised that the judiciary is a servant of the Constitution, not its master, but it would not stand if its independence is diminished. “History will not remember the ease of our days but the courage of decisions,” Justice Panwhar added. He requested the meeting so that “we may together preserve the trust reposed in this court and ensure that the rule of law remains the law of the land, not in word alone, but in living truth”. “It is the very condition upon which liberty itself depends. If the judiciary is not free; free from fear, free from influence, free from control, then the rule of law becomes but a phrase, hollow and without breath,” the letter cautioned. Even the appearance of interference is enough to erode public confidence and “confidence” is the very soul of justice. Once lost, it cannot be summoned by decree or proclamation, the letter said. Meanwhile, prominent lawyer Asad Rahim Khan also moved a petition before the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that, in the presence of Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, as provided in the original Constitution of 1973, cannot be abridged or abolished through an act of parliament.

      "summary_en": "Yielding to several letters from Supreme Court judges, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi called a full court meeting on Friday, after Justice Salahuddin Panhwar became the third judge to request that he convene the judges to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Earlier, senior puisne Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah had written separate letters to the CJP asking for a full court meeting or the convening of the judicial conference. However, the two justices resigned on Thursday evening in protest against the 27th Constitutional Amendment Justice Panwhar, in a two-page letter, requested the CJP to call the full court to examine the amendment clause by clause and study its implications against Articles 175, 175A, 189, 190, 191 and 209 of the Constitution — provisions which deal with the judiciary. Headed by the CJP, the full court meeting will be held at the Supreme Court building before the Friday prayers. Justice Panwhar stated he was writing the letter “not in protest but in … the duty that binds every judge who has sworn to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution”. “There comes a time when silence is not caution but abdication. I believe such a time may now be upon us,” the letter read. “From what has been foreshadowed, this amendment may unsettle the careful balance that the framers intended,” Justice Panwhar wrote, warning that the amendment may “touch upon the security of tenure, the composition of benches, the appointment and removal of judges, or even the financial and administrative autonomy of courts”. “Let us test each provision of the amendment by a single question: does it strengthen the independence of the judiciary, or diminish it?” Justice Panwhar’s letter suggested, stating that if the independence of the judiciary is diminished, then judges must say so, “not in anger but in truth”. Justice Panwhar also suggested commissioning a technical brief through the Pakistan Secretariat’s Law and Justice Commission and, if necessary, engaging the National Judicial Policy Making Committee. He also suggested that the Supreme Court confer with the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and provincial bar councils, since the “bar and the bench are twin guardians of justice”. The SC judge also asked to prepare to preserve their capacity under Article 190 of the Constitution, should litigation ensue, to ensure that the “judicial commands were not rendered hollow”. “Let our response be principled yet temperate and firm in defence of constitutional boundaries, but respectful of the comity due among organs of the State,” the judge wrote. “For Parliament’s power to amend is plenary, but it is not without limit, even if it does not say so,” the letter said, adding that the “Constitution was not clay to be moulded at will, it was a covenant between the state and citizen”. Justice Panwhar wrote that his request was not born of discord, but conscience. He emphasised that the judiciary is a servant of the Constitution, not its master, but it would not stand if its independence is diminished. “History will not remember the ease of our days but the courage of decisions,” Justice Panwhar added. He requested the meeting so that “we may together preserve the trust reposed in this court and ensure that the rule of law remains the law of the land, not in word alone, but in living truth”. “It is the very condition upon which liberty itself depends. If the judiciary is not free; free from fear, free from influence, free from control, then the rule of law becomes but a phrase, hollow and without breath,” the letter cautioned. Even the appearance of interference is enough to erode public confidence and “confidence” is the very soul of justice. Once lost, it cannot be summoned by decree or proclamation, the letter said. Meanwhile, prominent lawyer Asad Rahim Khan also moved a petition before the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that, in the presence of Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, as provided in the original Constitution of 1973, cannot be abridged or abolished through an act of parliament. The petition also pleaded before the Supreme Court to take measures for securing the independence of the judiciary, and such further or better relief as may be appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case may also be granted.

      "summary_orig": "Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir is set to have his tenure reset upon his appointment as chief of the defence forces (CDF), after the National Assembly approved amendments to laws governing the three branches of the armed forces shortly after the government tabled them. The amendments were tabled soon after President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, enacting it into law. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif introduced the Pakistan Army Act (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill 2025, which were passed with a majority vote. Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar introduced the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2025, which was also passed with a majority vote. Tarar said the four bills, which were passed in nine minutes without any debate, were meant to harmonise the existing laws with the recently signed 27th Constitutional Amendment Act. “These are not new laws. These are amendments to the present laws,” he said. The law minister said the change in the army act was to make the COAS the CDF and to eliminate the post of the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), adding that the CDF’s term would be five years from the date of appointment. The amendment further said that the tenure of the incumbent army chief would recommence from the date of his notification as the CDF. The changes also included replacing the position of the CJCSC with the commander of the National Strategic Command (CNSC). They outlined that the prime minister would appoint the CNSC on the recommendation of the army chief from the generals of the army for a three-year tenure. It added that the prime minister could also reappoint the CNSC or extend his tenure by three years on the army chief’s recommendation. The changes further said that the prime minister could, on the army chief’s recommendation, authorise an officer appointed as the vice or deputy chief of army staff to exercise and perform the powers and functions vested in the army chief. The amendments to the air force and navy laws included the elimination of the post of CJCSC from their documents. Meanwhile, the amendment to the Supreme Court law paved the way for the elimination of the constitutional bench. The president’s assent to the 27th Constitutional Amendment came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest. Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.” The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was underway, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”. The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar again tabled the bill in the upper house of Parliament today. COAS Munir’s extension Field Marshal Munir was appointed the army chief on November 29, 2022. He is the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army. In November 2024, the government passed six bills, including three related to the extension of the terms of armed services chiefs, amid deafening protests by the opposition. The three bills were The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill, 2024, The Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill, 2024 and The Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2024. The salient features of the bills stated that the tenure of all three services chiefs (chief of army staff, chief of air staff and chief of naval staff) will be five years, instead of three. The retirement age bar of 64 years (for generals, air chief marshals and admirals) won’t apply to these three functionaries and extensions, re-appointments for these posts (if any) will also be for five years. However, the tenure of the CJCSC had remained unchanged, at three years. The government promoted the COAS to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India during the war in May this year. In September, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah Khan had said that the tenure of the army chief would end in 2027 and a decision whether to extend it or not would be taken at that time. Earlier this month, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said that there was no need for a notification to specify the army chief’s five-year term, as it was established in Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act. He had said no new notification was required for the COAS’s five-year term and the section was always a part of legislation. Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act outlines the “retirement age and service limits prescribed for a general, under the rules and regulations made under this Act, shall not be applicable to the chief of the army staff, during his tenure of appointment, reappointment or extension, subject to a maximum age of sixty-four (64) years. Throughout such tenure, the chief of the army staff shall continue to serve as general in the Pakistan Army”.",

      "summary_orig": "The information ministry on Thursday said that all terrorists involved in the attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan were Afghan citizens. Security forces confirmed a day ago that they had successfully foiled a terrorist attack on Cadet College Wana, killing all the attackers after an intense clearance operation. The attackers had targeted the main gate of the college on Monday evening and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy. Government ministers had linked the attack to Afghanistan and said it was orchestrated from there. “The attack on Cadet College Wana was planned and controlled from Afghanistan. The attack was planned in Afghanistan by kharji Zahid and the final approval was given by kharji Noorwali Mehsud. All the khwarij who attacked Cadet College Wana were Afghan citizens. The equipment for this attack was provided from Afghanistan, which included American-made weapons,” said the information ministry in a statement today. The ministry further said that the identities of the “Afghan terrorists” killed in the attack “firmly establish the links of terrorists in their bases in Afghanistan”. It added that the responsibility for the attack was accepted by an unknown terrorist group, “Jaishul Hind”, on Mehsud’s orders. Mehsud is the chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorist group. The information ministry added he wanted to shift the responsibility from the TTP, adding that this was why the “Afghan terrorist” kept mentioning ‘Jaishul Hind’ in the video made during the attack. “The Afghan Taliban pressurise Fitna al-Khawarij not to accept responsibility of attacks as that leads to pressure from Pakistan and friendly countries. “The attack on Cadet College Wana was aimed at increasing security concerns in Pakistan, on demand of the Indian agency RAW (Research and Analysis Wing).” ‘Clear Afghan involvement’ Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said on Tuesday that it was “clear” that Afghanistan was directly involved in the attack. Noting that the terrorists had been identified as Afghan, the interior minister said the attackers’ “communication with their people in Afghanistan also continued the entire night”. Referring to multiple visits carried out by top Pakistani leadership to Afghanistan, Naqvi said: “The foreign minister, deputy prime minister, defence minister — we all have gone numerous times and presented them with evidence and details on how they (terrorists) are being trained in Afghanistan, how they plan and then come here to carry out attacks.” “We are very clear in this that Afghanistan must stop them under all circumstances. In case of not stopping them, we will have no other option but to deal with the terrorists who are attacking our country,“ he asserted. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had also said that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",

      "summary_orig": "Justice Aminuddin Khan was on Thursday appointed the inaugural Chief Justice of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). The development comes hours after the 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari and shortly after Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resigned from their offices in protest. A notification from the law ministry said President Zardari made the appointment under clause (3) of Article 175A read with Article 175C of the Constitution, adding that it would come into effect from the date that Justice Khan took his oath. The judge will take the oath at the Presidency tomorrow at 10am. The chief justices and judges of superior courts, high-ranking officials have been invited to participate in the oath-taking ceremony Justice Khan was born in Multan in 1960. A second-generation lawyer, he earned his LL.B from University Law College, Multan, in 1984 and began practice under his father, Khan Sadiq Muhammad Ahsan. He became an advocate of the Lahore High Court (LHC) in 1987 and of the Supreme Court in 2001. He joined Zafar Law Chambers in Multan in 2001 and worked with the legal firm until he was elevated to the position of a judge in 2011, where he decided civil cases on the Multan and Bahawalpur benches. He was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice in 2019, taking his oath of office from then-chief justice Asif Saeed Khosa. He was made the head of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench in November 2024, while ranking fourth in seniority among Supreme Court judges. Justice Khan has decided thousands of cases pertaining to civil matters and most of his judgments have been upheld by the Supreme Court. During his career, he assisted renowned lawyers like Mian Nisar Ahmed and Umar Ata Bandial. Sources had told Dawn the FCC would initially comprise six other judges — four from the Supreme Court and two from the high courts — besides the chief justice. The names being discussed for the inaugural composition incl­uded Just­ice Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Musa­rrat Hilali, Justice Aamer Far­ooq, and Justice Baqar Najafi from the SC, while Justice KK Agha of the Sindh High Court and Justice Rozi Khan Bar­rech, the incumbent Chief Justice of Balochistan Hi­gh Court, were being considered from the high courts. The sources had also said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require approval through an Act of Parliament. Officials at the law ministry confirmed that the President, acting on the advice of the prime minister, would issue the formal appointment orders. They added that under the provisions of the amendment, the President would be constitutionally empowered to make such appointments to the newly-constituted court. The proposal to establish the Federal Constitutional Court was revived as part of the judicial reforms package incorporated in the 27th Constitutional Amendment Act. The amendment aimed to rationalise the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and introduce greater efficiency in the adjudication of constitutional questions. According to government officials, the creation of the FCC is intended to reduce the Supreme Court’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases, and strengthen the independence and credibility of the judicial system. The concept of a separate constitutional court is not new. It was first introduced in the Charter of Democracy (CoD) signed by the PPP and the PML-N in 2006. The CoD envisaged the establishment of a specialised court dedicated solely to constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus primarily on its appellate jurisdiction. The idea resurfaced during discussions on the 26th Const­it­utional Amendment , but was shelved at the time following resistance from the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl and certain other political factions. Under the current proposal, judges serving in the FCC will retire at the age of 68 years — three years higher than the retirement age for Supreme Court judges, who retire at 65. The new court will not be housed within the Supreme Court premises. Officials indicated that it is likely to be established in the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) building in Islamabad. In turn, the FSC is expected to be relocated to the third floor of the Islamabad High Court building. However, sources within the FSC revealed that its judges are unhappy with their abrupt relocation and have raised their concerns before the chief justice of Pakistan.",

      "title_orig": "Newly-enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment challenged in Supreme Court",
      "summary_orig": "Lawyer Asad Rahim Khan filed a petition with the Supreme Court (SC) seeking to challenge the recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment, moving the court to declare the amendments unconstitutional and to “take measures” to ensure judicial independence. The 27th Amendment, signed into law earlier today by President Asif Ali Zardari, was widely criticised by the legal fraternity for abolishing judicial independence through the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). SC Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resigned earlier this evening, in response to the 27th Amendment, which “diminished” the apex court. Khan’s petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn , requested that the Supreme Court declare Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 to 43, 45A and B, 46 and 48 of the Constitution (Twenty-seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 illegal and unlawful, as it violated Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List, read with other provisions of the Constitution. According to the petition, Entry 55 “ensures a horizontal separation between the legislative and judicial branches” by defining the jurisdiction of the apex court. The petition moved the SC to declare that its jurisdiction cannot be abolished by an act of parliament. Additionally, Khan moved the SC to “direct the respondent (the Federation of Pakistan) to take such measures as may be required for securing the independence of the judiciary; and such further or better relief as may be appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case may also be granted”. “The parenthetical clause (“except for the Supreme Court”) makes it abundantly clear that the Apex Court’s jurisdiction — unlike that of the courts below it — cannot be interfered with, let alone abbreviated, through any kind of legislation, even an amendment to the Constitution,” the petition read. Noting that the act was passed in haste and an “unconstitutional and procedurally defective manner”, Khan argued that rushing the bills through parliament violated key principles of parliamentary democracy and was neither public nor transparent. “The act is thus an assault on parliamentary democracy itself, and merits being struck down on this score alone.” He further argued that the amendment is enabling the “influencing and purging [of] independent-minded Judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts” and stated that a judge’s position depending on the whim of the executive is antithetical to judicial independence. The petition also argued that the composition of the FCC — a key component of the 27th Amendment — was “equally alarming”, as the chief justice would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, but without any deliberation or consultation. “This permits the executive to handpick the de facto highest judicial authority in Pakistan, in direct violation of the principle of judicial independence,” Khan argued. “The initial cohort of FCC judges is likewise to be appointed solely on executive advice, again without any role for the judiciary or any consultative mechanism. A court constituted entirely at the will of the executive cannot claim independence.” Senate’s approval The president’s assent to the legislation came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest. Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.” The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”. The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.",

Additionally, Khan moved the SC to “direct the respondent (the Federation of Pakistan) to take such measures as may be required for securing the independence of the judiciary; and such further or better relief as may be appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case may also be granted”. “The parenthetical clause (“except for the Supreme Court”) makes it abundantly clear that the Apex Court’s jurisdiction — unlike that of the courts below it — cannot be interfered with, let alone abbreviated, through any kind of legislation, even an amendment to the Constitution,” the petition read. Noting that the act was passed in haste and an “unconstitutional and procedurally defective manner”, Khan argued that rushing the bills through parliament violated key principles of parliamentary democracy and was neither public nor transparent. “The act is thus an assault on parliamentary democracy itself, and merits being struck down on this score alone.” He further argued that the amendment is enabling the “influencing and purging [of] independent-minded Judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts” and stated that a judge’s position depending on the whim of the executive is antithetical to judicial independence. The petition also argued that the composition of the FCC — a key component of the 27th Amendment — was “equally alarming”, as the chief justice would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, but without any deliberation or consultation. “This permits the executive to handpick the de facto highest judicial authority in Pakistan, in direct violation of the principle of judicial independence,” Khan argued. “The initial cohort of FCC judges is likewise to be appointed solely on executive advice, again without any role for the judiciary or any consultative mechanism. A court constituted entirely at the will of the executive cannot claim independence.” Senate’s approval The president’s assent to the legislation came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest. Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.” The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”. The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.",
      "title": "Newly-enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment challenged in Supreme Court",
      "summary": "Lawyer Asad Rahim Khan filed a petition with the Supreme Court (SC) seeking to challenge the recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment, moving the court to declare the amendments unconstitutional and to “take measures” to ensure judicial independence. The 27th Amendment, signed into law earlier today by President Asif Ali Zardari, was widely criticised by the legal fraternity for abolishing judicial independence through the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). SC Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resigned earlier this evening, in response to the 27th Amendment, which “diminished” the apex court. Khan’s petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn , requested that the Supreme Court declare Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 to 43, 45A and B, 46 and 48 of the Constitution (Twenty-seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 illegal and unlawful, as it violated Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List, read with other provisions of the Constitution. According to the petition, Entry 55 “ensures a horizontal separation between the legislative and judicial branches” by defining the jurisdiction of the apex court. The petition moved the SC to declare that its jurisdiction cannot be abolished by an act of parliament. Additionally, Khan moved the SC to “direct the respondent (the Federation of Pakistan) to take such measures as may be required for securing the independence of the judiciary; and such further or better relief as may be appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case may also be granted”. “The parenthetical clause (“except for the Supreme Court”) makes it abundantly clear that the Apex Court’s jurisdiction — unlike that of the courts below it — cannot be interfered with, let alone abbreviated, through any kind of legislation, even an amendment to the Constitution,” the petition read.

      "title_orig": "‘Constitution no more’: Justices Shah, Minallah resign from ‘diminished’ SC following passage of 27th Amendment",
      "summary_orig": "Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah handed in their resignations, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday. Both judges had called on Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi in separate letters to summon a full court meeting and judicial conference to hold a debate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment. In his letter to the president today, Justice Shah assailed the amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan”, which “dismantles the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugates the judiciary to executive control, and strikes at the very heart of our constitutional democracy”. “By fracturing the unity of the nation’s apex court, it has crippled judicial independence and integrity, pushing the country back by decades,” he wrote. “As history bears witness, such a disfigurement of the constitutional order is unsustainable and will, in time, be reversed - but not before leaving deep institutional scars.” The judge stated that he had a choice between serving as an SC justice, which he said “undermines the very foundation of the institution one has sworn to protect”, or hand in his resignation. “Staying on would not only amount to silent acquiescence in a constitutional wrong, but would also mean continuing to sit in a court whose constitutional voice has been muted,” Justice Shah wrote. “Unlike the 26th Amendment — when the Supreme Court of Pakistan still retained the jurisdiction to examine and answer the constitutional questions — the present amendment has stripped this court of that fundamental and critical jurisdiction and authority. “Serving in such a truncated and diminished court, I cannot protect the Constitution, nor can I even judicially examine the amendment that has disfigured it,” he stated. On the other hand, Justice Minallah stated in his letter that when he took the oath of office 11 years ago, he swore to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”. He wrote: “Prior to the passage of the 27th Amendment, I wrote to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, expressing concern over what its proposed features meant for our constitutional order. “I need not reproduce the detailed contents of that letter, but suffice it to say that, against a canvas of selective silence and inaction, those fears have now come to be,” he added. Justice Minallah regretted that the Constitution he swore to uphold was “no more”, adding that he “can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that, as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave”. “What is left of it is a mere shadow; one that breathes neither its spirit, nor speaks the words of the people to whom it belongs,” the judge wrote. “These robes we wear are more than mere ornaments. They are to serve as a reminder of that most noble trust bestowed upon those fortunate enough to don them,” the letter read. “Instead, throughout our history, they have too often stood as symbols of betrayal through silence and complicity alike.” Justice Minallah is the eldest son of Nasrum Minallah, who was a commissioner during the 1960s and 70s. He is the son-in-law of Justice Safdar Shah, who was part of the bench that convicted and sentenced former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto but wrote a dissenting note against the conviction, for which he faced the wrath of the then-military dictator, General Ziaul Haq. He joined Pakistan Customs and rose to senior positions, but later resigned and started practising law. Following the sacking of former chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, he joined the lawyers’ movement for the restoration of the judiciary. However, after Justice Chaudhry’s restoration, he became a critic of the judiciary because of excessive suo motu cases, which led to the pendency of routine cases. In November 2022, then-CJP Umar Ata Bandial administered the oath to Justice Minallah, Justice Shahid Waheed and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi as the judges of the Supreme Court. Earlier in the evening, sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court — the establishment of which would now be realised after the enactment of the 27th Amendment bill — tomorrow at the Presidency. Former AGP Makhdoom Ali Khan resigns from Law and Justice Commission Separately, former attorney general of Pakistan Makhdoom Ali Khan tendered his resignation from the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan to CJP Afridi. “When you sought my consent to be a member of the commission, I accepted without a second thought. “The Constitution, by then, had been amended for the 26th time. I could see despondence on the once shining faces of promising young lawyers. I continued to believe, however, albeit without cause, that it remained possible to negotiate the bends and avoid a free fall. The realists cautioned that I was out of touch. “The habits of a lifetime take time to die, however. These made me think that with technique, with finesse and with reason, persuasion will find a way. Advocacy will break through. The institution though battered and holed had not keeled over. And while it was afloat so was hope. It would of course require advocacy beyond ability which was possible given the extraordinary motivation. It always is,” he said. However, he said the 27th Constitutional Amendment had “sunk that ship”. He added, “It has scuttled whatever was left of an independent judiciary. That being so, I cannot continue to be a member of an institution erected on the promise to reform the law. No law reform is possible or can be effective without an independent judiciary. To continue in these circumstances would be to perpetuate the worst fraud possible: a fraud on oneself. I can go on but that would serve no purpose … I, therefore, thank you for the opportunity but confess my inability to continue. I resign.” Senate’s approval The president’s assent to the legislation came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.

It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes. The 27th Amendment promised , on paper, to “streamline” governance through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded. At the heart of the amendment is the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters. Clause 23 of the amendment stated that the incumbent CJP — Justice Yahya Afridi — would maintain his office until the end of his tenure. Clause 56 of the amendment stated that once incumbent CJP Afridi’s term comes to an end, the future CJP would be the senior-most judge from the chief justices of the FCC and apex court. Sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the FCC tomorrow at the Presidency.",

In November 2022, then-CJP Umar Ata Bandial administered the oath to Justice Minallah, Justice Shahid Waheed and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi as the judges of the Supreme Court. Earlier in the evening, sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court — the establishment of which would now be realised after the enactment of the 27th Amendment bill — tomorrow at the Presidency. Former AGP Makhdoom Ali Khan resigns from Law and Justice Commission Separately, former attorney general of Pakistan Makhdoom Ali Khan tendered his resignation from the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan to CJP Afridi. “When you sought my consent to be a member of the commission, I accepted without a second thought. “The Constitution, by then, had been amended for the 26th time. I could see despondence on the once shining faces of promising young lawyers. I continued to believe, however, albeit without cause, that it remained possible to negotiate the bends and avoid a free fall. The realists cautioned that I was out of touch. “The habits of a lifetime take time to die, however. These made me think that with technique, with finesse and with reason, persuasion will find a way. Advocacy will break through. The institution though battered and holed had not keeled over. And while it was afloat so was hope. It would of course require advocacy beyond ability which was possible given the extraordinary motivation. It always is,” he said. However, he said the 27th Constitutional Amendment had “sunk that ship”. He added, “It has scuttled whatever was left of an independent judiciary. That being so, I cannot continue to be a member of an institution erected on the promise to reform the law. No law reform is possible or can be effective without an independent judiciary. To continue in these circumstances would be to perpetuate the worst fraud possible: a fraud on oneself. I can go on but that would serve no purpose … I, therefore, thank you for the opportunity but confess my inability to continue. I resign.” Senate’s approval The president’s assent to the legislation came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest. Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.” The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes. The 27th Amendment promised , on paper, to “streamline” governance through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded. At the heart of the amendment is the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters. Clause 23 of the amendment stated that the incumbent CJP — Justice Yahya Afridi — would maintain his office until the end of his tenure. Clause 56 of the amendment stated that once incumbent CJP Afridi’s term comes to an end, the future CJP would be the senior-most judge from the chief justices of the FCC and apex court. Sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the FCC tomorrow at the Presidency.",
