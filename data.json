In particular, residents in the vulnerable area should be taken on board to minimise the chances of collateral damage . Much confusion surrounds the incident, which occurred in the early hours of Monday. At least two dozen residents of Tirah, including women and children, lost their lives in the blasts, which officials claim were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses. Sources quoted in the media say that TTP militants had forcibly occupied the dwellings and used them to store explosives. They said that several militants also perished in the blasts. However, residents of the area and provincial lawmakers dispute these claims, asserting that the valley came under aerial bombardment. A statement attributed to the KP chief minister quotes him as saying that the “martyrdom of civilians” due to “operations against terrorists is unacceptable”. The civilian deaths have resulted in protests in the region, with local tribesmen, as well as the HRCP , calling for an inquiry into the matter. It is the state’s responsibility to clear the confusion and shed light on the facts. Experience has shown that ‘collateral damage’ can result in increased restiveness in the areas affected by terrorism, and when there is radio silence from the state in situations where civilian lives are lost, hostile narratives and conspiracy theories begin to dominate. That is why the facts must be told. Having said that, it is unwise for the PTI-led provincial government to politicise the incident. Such sensitive issues should not be used to get back at political opponents, and both the centre and provincial government need to work together to uncover the facts behind the Tirah deaths, and prevent further loss of innocent lives during CT operations. The unfortunate truth is that KP, particularly its tribal districts, has been in the grip of terrorism for over two decades. That is why along with thorough probes into incidents like the one in Tirah, SOPs need to be developed that can ensure minimum or no collateral damage during CT operations. There can be little argument with the fact that all areas need to be cleared of terrorists. Yet these kinetic actions must be undertaken with the buy-in and support of local tribes. When there is lack of credible information from the state, especially if civilians are caught in the crossfire, anger and resentment in local communities will only grow. Therefore, along with transparency, the residents of the affected areas must be on board in the battle against militancy. With a cooperative approach terrorism can be defeated, and the people of the tribal districts can live in peace. Published in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",

Confirming the development, a senior official was quoted as saying the exercise would focus on evaluating operational readiness against evolving aerial threats. The Cold Start doctrine was developed by the Indian armed forces involving rapid, integrated offensive operations by combined arms units.

Analysts, however, say it carries a significant risk of escalating conflict to the nuclear level given Pakistan’s possession of tactical nuclear weapons. Industry partners, research and development agencies, academia, and other stakeholders, too, will participate in the ‘Cold Start’ exercise. Speaking at a conference on “Counter UAVs & Air Defence Systems — The Future of Modern Warfare” in Delhi, India’s Chief of Integrated Defence Staff Air Marshal Ashutosh Dixit making a pointed reference to Pakistan said, “They too are working to ‘become like India’, so we must always stay a step ahead. “Our counter-drone and GPS jamming systems performed effectively during Operation Sindoor, ensuring no damage from adversary drones. But the adversary has also learned our capabilities. Next time, we have to be ahead and much better,” The Hindu quoted him as saying. He said the vision for the future involves an integrated defence system, inspired by the Sudarshan Chakra concept, to counter drones, UAVs, hypersonic weapons, and other threats. There is a need for systems usable in both peace and wartime, taking into consideration anti-social elements acquiring drone technology, necessitating widespread counter-drone capabilities.

      "summary_orig": "• Eight prosecution witnesses record statements; nine more to appear at next hearing • Imran’s lawyer opposes video link arrangement for PTI chief, will appeal ATC order • Plea in IHC seeks enforcement of conjugal rights for incarcerated ex-PM, spouse RAWALPINDI: The prosecution is likely to conclude its evidence against former prime minister Imran Khan and other PTI leaders next week in the case pertaining to a violent protest outside the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) on May 9, 2023, following the arrest of Mr Khan in a corruption case. During the hearing, ex-PM Imran Khan also marked his attendance from the Adiala jail via video link, but connectivity issues marred the PTI leader’s appearance before the court. On Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi recorded the statements of eight prosecution witnesses, after the defence sought deferment of the proceedings to challenge the order requiring Mr Khan’s appearance through video link. The order was passed in pursuance of a Punjab government notification directing trial proceedings be held via video link, citing security concerns. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah on Sept 19 ruled that the trial would be conducted on the court premises instead of in Adiala jail, with Mr Khan’s attendance to be mar­k­ed through video link. When the hearing resumed on Tuesday, the defence counsel requested an adjo­u­rnment, informing the judge that the legal team intended to file an appeal against the Sept 19 order. The prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum. The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement. The court recorded statements of eight prosecution witnesses, incl­uding three officers of the Fed­eral Investigation Agency’s Cyber Crimes Wing, who testified regarding tweets and other social media posts of the PTI leaders ahead of and during the May 9 protests. Two Islamabad magistrates, Awais Bhatti and Abdullah Khan, also testified that they had recorded statements of PTI local leaders Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Wasiq Qayyum and Omar Tanveer Butt, who affirmed the allegations against Mr Khan and the party leadership. According to Raja Ikram Ame­en Minhas, the head of the prosecution in the GHQ case, the testimony of 41 prosecution witnesses has been completed so far, while the remaining nine witnesses will be produced at the next hearing. He said that the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses would start afterwards. The court adjourned the case till Sept 27. Mr Khan, who has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since 2023, faces multiple cases, including GHQ protest case. He was indicted in December last year and was arrested in this case by the Rawa­lpindi police in January 2024. Conjugal rights Separately, the Islamabad High Court issued notices to the authorities concerned on a petition seeking permission for Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while incarcerated in prison. Justice Arbab Tahir took up the petition filed under Article 199 by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and Imran’s supporter. The court issued a one-page written order, directing the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Punjab government, Punjab’s inspector general of prisons, and the jail superintendent, among others, to submit their replies before the next hearing. During proceedings, the petitioner’s lawyer argued that Section 545A of the Criminal Proc­edure Code supported the protection of family life and provision of facilities for marital relations to prisoners as a basic need. He argued that denial of conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous judicial rulings. It also cites a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh Home Department in compliance with Supreme Court directions, allowing convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. Additionally, the petition relies on a landmark Shariat Court judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement. Published in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",

During the hearing, ex-PM Imran Khan also marked his attendance from the Adiala jail via video link, but connectivity issues marred the PTI leader’s appearance before the court. On Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi recorded the statements of eight prosecution witnesses, after the defence sought deferment of the proceedings to challenge the order requiring Mr Khan’s appearance through video link. The order was passed in pursuance of a Punjab government notification directing trial proceedings be held via video link, citing security concerns. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah on Sept 19 ruled that the trial would be conducted on the court premises instead of in Adiala jail, with Mr Khan’s attendance to be mar­k­ed through video link. When the hearing resumed on Tuesday, the defence counsel requested an adjo­u­rnment, informing the judge that the legal team intended to file an appeal against the Sept 19 order. The prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum. The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement. The court recorded statements of eight prosecution witnesses, incl­uding three officers of the Fed­eral Investigation Agency’s Cyber Crimes Wing, who testified regarding tweets and other social media posts of the PTI leaders ahead of and during the May 9 protests. Two Islamabad magistrates, Awais Bhatti and Abdullah Khan, also testified that they had recorded statements of PTI local leaders Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Wasiq Qayyum and Omar Tanveer Butt, who affirmed the allegations against Mr Khan and the party leadership. According to Raja Ikram Ame­en Minhas, the head of the prosecution in the GHQ case, the testimony of 41 prosecution witnesses has been completed so far, while the remaining nine witnesses will be produced at the next hearing. He said that the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses would start afterwards. The court adjourned the case till Sept 27. Mr Khan, who has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since 2023, faces multiple cases, including GHQ protest case. He was indicted in December last year and was arrested in this case by the Rawa­lpindi police in January 2024.

The meeting , held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA at United Nations Headquarters, brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia. Ahead of the meeting, in a televised interaction with Muslim leaders, Trump said: “We have to get the hostages back… This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world… so it’s an honour to be with you.” “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started,” he said, before the start of formal consultations with world leaders. Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani thanked the president for hosting such an important meeting at such an important time, saying that they were only there to stop the war and bring the prisoners back. “We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” the Qatari leader said. ‘Stop the war immediately’ Earlier, in his speech at the UNGA, Trump said that greater recognition for Palestine would amount to rewarding “horrible atrocities” by Hamas. He called on world powers to focus instead on securing the release of prisoners held in Gaza. Trump said the US wants a ‘ceasefire-for-prisoners’ deal that would see the return of all remaining prisoners, alive and dead. “We have to stop the war in Gaza immediately. We have to immediately negotiate peace,” he said. Reacting to Trump’s address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US leader’s “commitment to establishing peace in the world,” saying it showed he was “indeed a man of peace”. He also recalled that Trump and his team had “played a crucial role in preventing a potentially devastating war between India and Pakistan,” adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.” The remarks came ahead of the multi-lateral meeting with Muslim leaders, where Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also accompanied PM. When asked about the upcoming meeting by reporters, PM Shehbaz refused to comment, saying: “It is not the right time; I will speak about it only after the meeting is over.” The PM Office also released pictures showing PM Shehbaz in a meeting with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. Both the White House and Pakistan’s mission in Washington were expected to hold a briefing after the meeting, but no formal statements were issued until going to press. Plan for peace According to the White House, Trump’s plan envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of regional peacekeeping troops, and an internationally supported transition and reconstruction process for the battered enclave. Quoting diplomatic sources, Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios reported that while the plan had not been drafted by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been made aware of its outlines. It envisages a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), but not for Hamas, which both Washington and Tel Aviv insist must be dismantled. Washington wants Arab and Muslim countries to agree to send military forces to Gaza to enable Israel’s withdrawal and to secure funding for transition and rebuilding programs, Axios reported. Ahead of the multilateral meeting, Sec­retary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News that the only way to a permanent solution to the “challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement”. Describing the possible deal, he said it would be “one in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.” In separate remarks to CBS News , he described the multilateral meeting as “one last shot” at ending the conflict in Gaza, getting all remaining prisoners released, and putting in place a humanitarian relief programme.

      "summary_orig": "At least four people were injured as a blast derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express near Spezand town in the Dasht tehsil of Balochistan’s Mastung district, according to officials. With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure. Balochistan Health Department and Quetta Civil Hospital spokesperson Dr Waseem Baig told Dawn.com : “Three people were injured in the blast and have been shifted to the Civil Hospital Trauma Centre, while an injured child has been taken to Combined Military Hospital.” Muhammad Kashif, Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division public relations officer, told Dawn.com that a railway track was blown up with explosives in the town of Spezand, derailing six bogies. “The train was coming from Peshawar to Quetta and there were 270 passengers on board,” he said, adding that a relief train was dispatched from Quetta after the explosion, while a team of officers, rescue trucks and private cranes was also rushed to the spot for relief operations. He said the work of repairing the railway track and removing the bogies would begin in daylight tomorrow, while an investigation into the incident was launched. Kashif said security forces had cordoned off the area and launched a search operation. A similar incident occurred last month when six bogies were derailed near the same location. That incident had come just three days after a Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed. In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, damaging a bogie of the Bolan Mail. A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a technical fault was the cause. In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to derail in Jacobabad. No one was hurt in the incident. In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was stopped at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons. Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were restored on March 27, after they were suspended due to the unprecedented hijacking of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month. The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.",

      "summary_orig": "Former Test umpire Harold “Dickie” Bird has died at the age of 92, Yorkshire County Cricket Club announced on Tuesday. Bird was one of the best-known and most respected officials in the game, standing in 66 Tests and 69 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals. Yorkshire issued a statement on their website saying Bird, “one of cricket’s most beloved figures”, had died peacefully at home. “Dickie Bird enjoyed an illustrious career as an international umpire, writing his name into history as the most famous and popular official in the game’s history,” the club said . “He is synonymous with Yorkshire Cricket, where he has been one of the most loyal supporters. In 2014, he was named president of The Yorkshire County Cricket Club, a role he held with pride and distinction.” Bird played for English counties Yorkshire and Leicestershire but made his name as an international umpire. “Over a distinguished career, he officiated in 66 Test matches and 69 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals — earning the admiration of players and fans alike for his integrity, humour, and unmistakable style,” Yorkshire’s statement said. He was given a guard of honour at Lord’s by England and India players before his final Test. Geoffrey Boycott, the Yorkshire and England batting great, had an enduring friendship with Bird from their days playing for Barnsley Cricket Club in the 1950s. The 84-year-old summed up Bird’s quirky nature when he recalled how his friend used to insist on calling him Gerald, despite his protestations. “I would say, ‘My name’s not Gerald, it’s Geoffrey’,” Boycott wrote in the Telegraph . “It made no difference telling him because he would then say, ‘OK, put the gloves on for me Gerald’. “Dickie was a character and he was always fun. He was respected, admired and loved. He will be given a fond farewell.” Former England captain David Gower hailed Bird as “one of the best umpires ever to take the field”. “He certainly set himself high standards as an umpire, but that smile on his face at all times, whether he’s giving you out or not out, whatever he was doing out in the middle, you just knew that Dickie was in the place that he loved best,” Gower told the BBC . “He was just a very, very good umpire. He had a sense of humour. He had the ability in his own very quirky and slightly barmy way of being able to get on with everyone.” Graham Gooch, another former England captain, fondly recalled Bird’s habit of becoming embroiled in unusual incidents during matches. “At Headingley once they had a leaking pipe, right where Dickie was standing,” said Gooch. “Coming up like a sprinkler. It could only happen to him.” Colin Graves, chairman of Yorkshire, told TalkSport : “It’s a sad day. “He was a brilliant guy who loved being part of the Yorkshire set-up and everything we do here. He will be sadly missed at Headingley.” ESPNcricinfo also posted about Bird on X. “[Marylebone Cricket Club] is deeply saddened to hear of the death of Harold “Dickie” Bird,” Lord’s Cricket Ground posted on X. “An Honorary Life Member of the Club, Dickie enjoyed an illustrious career as an umpire and was one of the most popular officials in the history of the game.”",

He will be given a fond farewell.” Former England captain David Gower hailed Bird as “one of the best umpires ever to take the field”. “He certainly set himself high standards as an umpire, but that smile on his face at all times, whether he’s giving you out or not out, whatever he was doing out in the middle, you just knew that Dickie was in the place that he loved best,” Gower told the BBC . “He was just a very, very good umpire. He had a sense of humour. He had the ability in his own very quirky and slightly barmy way of being able to get on with everyone.” Graham Gooch, another former England captain, fondly recalled Bird’s habit of becoming embroiled in unusual incidents during matches. “At Headingley once they had a leaking pipe, right where Dickie was standing,” said Gooch. “Coming up like a sprinkler. It could only happen to him.” Colin Graves, chairman of Yorkshire, told TalkSport : “It’s a sad day. “He was a brilliant guy who loved being part of the Yorkshire set-up and everything we do here. He will be sadly missed at Headingley.” ESPNcricinfo also posted about Bird on X. “[Marylebone Cricket Club] is deeply saddened to hear of the death of Harold “Dickie” Bird,” Lord’s Cricket Ground posted on X. “An Honorary Life Member of the Club, Dickie enjoyed an illustrious career as an umpire and was one of the most popular officials in the history of the game.”",

      "summary_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan’s lawyers boycotted the proceedings of a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday after connectivity issues appeared to affect communication with the incarcerated former prime minister, who briefly joined the hearing via a WhatsApp call. An ATC in Rawalpindi was hearing a case against Imran pertaining to an attack on the army’s General Headquarters GHQ) on May 9, 2023, when the PTI founder’s arrest had sparked violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations were torched and vandalised. During today’s hearing, Imran was included via a WhatsApp call, following the court’s dismissal of a plea for his in-person appearance last week. His lawyers, Salman Akram Raja and Faisal Malik, sought Judge Amjad Ali Shah’s permission to talk to the ex-premier. But during the call, Imran’s voice was disrupted and his face appeared blurred on screen, leading his lawyers to boycott the court proceedings. They stated that such a trial was “unfair”. The court, however, recorded the statements of eight witnesses, including the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority additional director, the Federal Investigation Agency’s technical assistant and the Pakistan Information Department deputy director. For their part, the PTI lawyers said they “rejected” the recording of witnesses’ statements in this manner. The court then adjourned the hearing, summoning more witnesses on September 27. Imran was indicted in the case on December 5 last year. The PTI founder, who has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023, was arrested by the Rawalpindi police in the May 9 protest case in January 2024.

On this side, the judge received the call on a phone he had,” he said. He added that during the call Imran could not hear what was being said in the court and those present in the courtroom could not hear him. “Then obviously, Khan sahib is unaware of the testimonies being recorded,” he said. He also shared that they had requested the judge to let them talk to Imran, but they were unable to do so. “The judge said that [we] were unable to talk [to Imran] because the link was very weak.” He also highlighted that they had the right to talk to Imran alone. “But this right, too, was denied,” he added. Raja said they had prepared an application, which Malik would be submitting to the court. “And we have conveyed to the court that it is not possible for us to remain a part of this process … There should be an open trial and the accused should be given the chance to talk to his lawyers,” he continued. Raja said that they had also filed a plea “against this process” with the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi bench.",

      "summary_en": "PTI founder Imran Khan’s lawyers boycotted the proceedings of a Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday after connectivity issues appeared to affect communication with the incarcerated former prime minister, who briefly joined the hearing via a WhatsApp call. An ATC in Rawalpindi was hearing a case against Imran pertaining to an attack on the army’s General Headquarters GHQ) on May 9, 2023, when the PTI founder’s arrest had sparked violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations were torched and vandalised. During today’s hearing, Imran was included via a WhatsApp call, following the court’s dismissal of a plea for his in-person appearance last week. His lawyers, Salman Akram Raja and Faisal Malik, sought Judge Amjad Ali Shah’s permission to talk to the ex-premier. But during the call, Imran’s voice was disrupted and his face appeared blurred on screen, leading his lawyers to boycott the court proceedings. They stated that such a trial was “unfair”. The court, however, recorded the statements of eight witnesses, including the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority additional director, the Federal Investigation Agency’s technical assistant and the Pakistan Information Department deputy director. For their part, the PTI lawyers said they “rejected” the recording of witnesses’ statements in this manner. The court then adjourned the hearing, summoning more witnesses on September 27. Imran was indicted in the case on December 5 last year. The PTI founder, who has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023, was arrested by the Rawalpindi police in the May 9 protest case in January 2024.

      "summary_orig": "The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday granted rights activist Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha transit bail, three days after the couple was booked following a clash with the president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA). The police had registered a case against Mazari, her spouse, Zainab Janjua and several PTI-linked lawyers, including Naeem Panjhuta and Fateullah Barkiunder, under anti-terror laws after the IHCBA alleged that the bar leadership was “assaulted” by the lawyers, the suspects had also raised slogans against state institutions. Mazari and the other booked lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work. The hearing was presided over by PHC judge Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah, who granted a protective bail to the couple and asked them to appear before a relevant court by October 9. Mazari and her spouse appeared in the court today along with their lawyers\nAtaullah Kundi, Jahanzeb Mehsud, and Tariq Afghan. Meanwhile, Additional Attorney General Sanaullah appeared on behalf of the IGCBA. Advocate Ataullah Kundi told Justice Shah that “a case was registered against the two petitioners in Islamabad,” to which he asked whether both of the petitioners were lawyers. Kundi responded: “Yes, both of them are lawyers and would like to appear in the court.” Addressing the petitioners, Justice Shah asked if this was their first time in Peshawar, to which Mazari replied in the affirmative, prompting Justice Shah to remark, “At least you came to Peshawar on the pretext of the FIR.” “You people never come to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa anyway,” he added. Advocate Kundi argued in front of Justice Shah that “Imaan Mazari is the voice of the people of KP and Balochistan,” adding that she was also a social worker in Islamabad. Mazari, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, recently also approached inquiry committees of the IHC and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar. The lawyer announced the development on X, saying that she had filed a complaint against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC. This followed her altercation with Justice Dogar during a hearing earlier this month and his subsequent remarks over the exchange, which she described as “sexist”. Meanwhile, she and husband Hadi also face charges of alleged anti-state activities on social media.",

      "summary_orig": "Airports in Copenhagen and Oslo reopened on Tuesday, police said, hours after unidentified drones in their airspace caused flight diversions and other travel disruption. In the Danish capital Copenhagen, police said several large drones seen over the airport for several hours late on Monday eventually flew away on their own. “The drones have disappeared and the airport is open again,” Deputy Police Inspector Jakob Hansen told reporters. “We didn’t take the drones down,” he added. Hansen said police were cooperating with the Danish military and intelligence service to find out where the drones had come from. He said police were also working with colleagues in Oslo after drone sightings in the Norwegian capital also caused the airport to close for several hours. “We had two different drone sightings,” Oslo airport spokeswoman Monica Fasting told AFP . “We reopened the airport around 3:15 am (6:15 am PKT),” she said. Flights were diverted to nearby destinations during the closures, and officials at both airports said they expected some delays and disruptions to continue on Tuesday. The incidents came after the governments of Poland , Estonia and Romania accused Russia of violating their airspace this month, allegations that Moscow has brushed off. Asked whether the drones above Copenhagen airport could have come from Russia, Hansen, the deputy police inspector, said: “We don’t know at this point.” Danish police also said that drones that shut the country’s main airport appeared to have been flown by “a capable operator” seeking to demonstrate certain abilities, adding that no suspects had been identified. “We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator,” Danish police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told reporters on Tuesday, referring to the drones observed in Copenhagen. “It’s an actor who has the capabilities, the will and the tools to show off in this way,” Jespersen said, adding that it was too early to say if the incidents in Denmark and Norway were linked.",

      "summary_orig": "• Justice Aminuddin Khan issues detailed reasoning, says Oct 23 order by five judges more akin to ‘legislation than interpretation’ • Civilians’ trials in military courts ‘long understood as valid and operative’, says Justice Mazhar ISLAMABAD: Justice Aminuddin Khan has said that though the procedural framework under the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 includes due process protections, the absence of an independent right of appeal to a civilian court has rendered its application to civilians constitutionally incomplete. He made these remarks in a 68-page judgement to justify the May 7 short order on a set of 38 intra-court appeals, which challenged the Oct 23, 2023, order on military trials of the civilians. Justice Khan explained that this deficiency required legislative intervention, urging parliament to do the needful in 45 days. According to Justice Khan, the Constitutional Bench had referred the matter to parliament for the enactment of appropriate amendments, with the expectation that such institutional deference would be accorded due respect. He, however, again sought necessary amendments or suitable legislation within a period of 45 days to provide right of appeal in the high courts against convictions rendered by court martial or military courts under sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (d) of subsection (1) of section 2, read with subsection (4) of Section 59. Justice Khan observed that a fair trial demanded that the forum should be fair, impartial, and governed by transparent rules. The PAA, as currently framed and applied in the present context, meets this constitutional requirement, Justice Khan said, adding it was held that the conduct of trials under PAA, where exercised within the statutory limits and supported by procedural safeguards, did not violate fair trial standards. On May 7, a seven-judge Constitutional Bench restored by a majority of 5-2 key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act under which civilians were convicted for their involvement in the May 9, 2023, arson attacks on military installations. The short order had also set aside the Oct 23 judgement, restoring Section 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) and Section 59 (4) of the PAA. These provisions were struck down by a majority of four to one by a five-judge bench in October 2023. ‘Reading down’ approach The interpretive technique of reading down, as employed in the Oct 23 judgement, was inapposite, Justice Khan said, adding that the doctrine of reading down was a tool of judicial restraint designed to preserve the constitutionality of statutes by construing them narrowly in case of ambiguity. It cannot be deployed to insert qualifications or restrictions into clear constitutional provisions, he observed. The Oct 23 order purported to use reading down to override the unambiguous text of Article 8(3)(a), effectively substituting judicial preference for constitutional command, Justice Khan emphasised, adding this approach crossed the threshold of legitimate interpretation and entered the domain of constitutional amendment. The judicial function is to interpret, not to legislate, he stressed. Article 8(3)(a) is a self-contained constitutional provision. It categorically exempts laws enacted for the Armed Forces, for purposes of discipline and discharge of duties, from the operation of fundamental rights, Justice Khan said, calling it a deliberate legislative choice by the framers. The introduction of Article 8(5) as a qualifying provision in this context is doctrinally and textually unsound. Article 8(5) deals with the suspension of rights under emergency powers and does not, and cannot, override the permanent structural exclusion under Article 8(3)(a), he added. Article 8(3)(a) exempts laws relating to the armed forces from the purview of fundamental rights, explicitly recognising a parallel regime for military discipline. Article 245 further empowers the armed forces to act in defence of Pakistan and in aid of civil authority, indicating that the Constitution contemplates a domain of operations and discipline governed by military command and distinct legal processes, Justice Khan said Justice Khan said the adjudicatory authority exercised by military courts over civilians does not infringe the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Article 175(3) is not offended by the existence or operation of military courts within their legal remit. Additional note Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, though concurring, said in his additional note that the trial of civilians only for specific offences as provided under Section 2 (d) (i) and (ii) was not a new phenomenon. It is a ground reality that the provisions of PAA extending jurisdiction to certain civilians have stood connected appeals for several decades, receiving the tacit approval of successive legislatures and the silent acquiescence of the Supreme Court. The fact that these provisions remained unchallenged or were not declared ultra vires at an earlier stage suggests that they were long understood as valid and operative within the constitutional scheme, Justice Mazhar explained. It was only in the aftermath of the events of May 9, 2023, when prosecutions of civilians under PAA acquired public and political prominence that this question was brought into sharp focus. Against this backdrop, it is necessary to ask whether it is the law itself that is infirm, or whether the sudden urgency of the present moment has led to a judicial reappraisal that stands at odds with decades of settled acceptance, he argued.
