      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said on Monday that the PTI’s “unjustified” criticism of the army had pushed the institution to respond. In remarks aired on the media, he also accused the opposition party of repeatedly criticising the army and its leadership for its own political gains. Referring to arguments by the PTI that the army should not interfere in politics, Chaudhry said, “The army is not intervening in politics. You, in order to further your own politics or to come into power by riding on someone else’s shoulders, repeatedly try to drag the army and its head into politics. “You direct unjustified and unnecessary criticism [at them]. You level allegations without any reason,” he said. He said the army had been serving the country and recalled that it defeated a “big power in the world” recently — an apparent reference to the conflict between Pakistan and India in May. The state minister further said that the army took pride in its martyrs, victories and in protecting Pakistan, “and you criticise it and its head for no reason”. “For how long will the institution remain silent? Eventually, it had to respond. The PTI pushed them to respond,” he added. “The army and its head showed patience and overlooked [the criticism] for a very long time. But every other day, the PTI founder in his tweets and messages, and others in press conferences after meeting Imran, would make unjustified accusations and criticise.” The state minister also alleged that the PTI never criticised India’s aggression or condemned terrorists. “Having a soft spot for those terrorists […] and directing all criticism toward Pakistan’s institutions, Pakistan’s army and its head, warrants an answer,” he asserted.“How long can it be ignored, how long can it be overlooked?” He further stated that the government had invited the PTI to Parliament for talks multiple times. “But we are now embarrassed to have invited these types of people for talks, those who are not worthy of it.” Chaudhry went on to allege that Imran “came into power by riding on someone else’s shoulders”. He further said that after that only a “mentally ill patient” would consider himself a “know-it-all” and “necessary” for the country. He further alleged that Imran had come into power in 2018 with the support of the military establishment. “And since no one is supporting you today, you are levelling criticism in an effort to blackmail the army […] so that you can compel them into supporting your rise to power again,” Chaudhry alleged. The state minister also questioned the PTI’s performance in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the last 13 years. “Why will the people vote for you? Why will they bring you into power again? Those who couldn’t win the by-election in Haripur, how will they succeed in polls in Lahore, Faisalabad or the rest of Pakistan? “It is because of this that you are taking out your anger and criticising one institution and its head. This will not be tolerated now,” Chaudhry added. The state minister warned that those raising their voice against Pakistan, its institutions and their heads would now be silenced. “Come put on a show outside Adiala (jail), and you will be told how the law is implemented,” he said, seemingly referring to PTI’s protests outside the prison for Imran’s visitation rights. “It cannot be that you disturb peace […], speak the language of our enemy after meeting [with Imran at the jail], and it is all tolerated.” He further warned that in case such a scene was created outside Adiala jail, “the prisoners in the jail would have to be shifted to a place where they can stay safe”. The minister also alleged that the KP chief minister was changed in October because the previous one, Ali Amin Gandapur, had refused to obey Imran’s directives. He also alleged that the new CM and the KP government were being used for efforts for a “jailbreak and riots” so that Imran could “escape his punishment”. “This will not happen now. KP’s resources will be used for KP,” he said. He further said that a Peshawar High Court order, as well as the law and Constitution, stated that “you cannot use your resources for your politics”. He ended his talk with a warning that the response to the PTI would now match the party’s actions. “And it is clear now that nothing that will be a source of anarchy in Pakistan will be tolerated. It will not be tolerated that unjustified criticism is directed toward institutions.” The minister’s censure is the latest in a string of admonishments directed toward the PTI from the country’s politicians, who have been rallying behind the armed forces after a fiery press conference by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaurdhry on December 5. The press conference, where the army spokesperson assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, followed the former prime minister’s latest outburst against the military leadership, delivered last week through his sister Uzma Khan during a jail visit after weeks of restricted access.",

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday said it had arrested 12 suspected terrorists allegedly working for the Indian intelligence agency Research Analysis Wing (RAW) in intelligence-based operations conducted in Lahore, Faisalabad, and Bahawalpur. According to a statement issued by the CTD spokesperson, the arrests were made in collaboration with sensitive agencies. He said security personnel recovered photos, videos, weapons, and explosives from the suspects, preventing large-scale terrorism activities in the aforementioned cities. He said the recovered material reportedly also included images and video recordings of sensitive locations, including a religious seminary. He said the terrorists were planning to incite “fear and religious hatred” in the province and had plans to target “places of worship and other important sites”. The CTD spokesperson said suspects identified as Sukhdeep Singh, Azmat, Faizan, Nabil, Abrar, Usman, and Sarfaraz were arrested in Lahore. Another suspect, Danish, was arrested in Faisalabad, while four others — identified as Rajab, Hashim, Saqib, and Arif — were arrested in Bahawalpur. He said that arrests came after the CTD investigated a Facebook account allegedly being operated from India to coordinate terrorist activities. All of these terrorists were being funded by the Indian agency RAW, the CTD spokesperson said. “Seven improvised explosive devices, two detonators, 102 feet of safety fuse wire, explosives, weapons, mobile phones, and cash were recovered from the possession of the terrorists,” he added. “Cases have been registered against the terrorists and further investigation is underway,” he said. The CTD regularly carries out operations across Pakistan to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence. In August, Sindh’s CTD had found the involvement of RAW in the target killing of a man in Badin district and arrested six suspects in the case, who were allegedly funded by RAW. In June, four suspected Indian agents were arrested in a raid carried out in Karachi’s Quaidabad area.",

      "summary_orig": "Thailand has launched air strikes along its disputed border with Cambodia, the Thai military said on Monday, after both countries accused the other of breaching a ceasefire agreement brokered by US President Donald Trump. At least one Thai soldier has been killed and four wounded in the fresh clashes that broke out around two areas in the easternmost province of Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand’s military said in a statement, after its troops came under Cambodian fire. “The Thai side has now begun using aircraft to strike military targets in several areas,” the statement said. Cambodia’s defence ministry said in a statement that the Thai military had launched dawn attacks on its forces at two locations, following days of provocative actions, and added that Cambodian troops had not retaliated. Thailand’s army said Cambodia’s military had fired BM-21 rockets towards Thai civilian areas, adding there were no reports of casualties. Meanwhile, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim urged Thailand and Cambodia to exercise restraint, warning the fighting risked undoing the careful work that went into a ceasefire he helped to broker. “We urge both sides to exercise maximum restraint, maintain open channels of communication and make full use of the mechanisms in place,” Anwar, the chair of the regional bloc ASEAN, said in a post on X. Ceasefire breakdown The border dispute had erupted into a five-day conflict in July , before a ceasefire deal brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Trump, who also witnessed the signing of an expanded peace agreement between the two countries in Kuala Lumpur in October. At least 48 people were killed and an estimated 300,000 temporarily displaced during the July clashes, with the neighbours exchanging rockets and heavy artillery fire. Following a landmine blast last month that maimed one of its soldiers, Thailand said it was halting the implementation of the ceasefire pact with Cambodia. Cambodia’s influential former longtime leader Hun Sen, father of current premier Hun Manet, said Thailand’s military were “aggressors” seeking to provoke a retaliatory response and urged Cambodian forces to exercise restraint. “The red line for responding has already been set. I urge commanders at all levels to educate all officers and soldiers accordingly,” Hun Sen said on Facebook, without elaborating. In Thailand, more than 385,000 civilians across four border districts are being evacuated, with over 35,000 already housed in temporary shelters, the Thai military said. Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817km land border, first mapped in 1907 by France when it ruled Cambodia as a colony. Simmering tension has occasionally exploded into skirmishes, such as a weeklong artillery exchange in 2011, despite attempts to peacefully resolve overlapping claims.",

Here are key moments in the border conflict. May 28, 2025 : Cambodia’s defence ministry says one of its soldiers is killed after a brief exchange of gunfire with Thai soldiers at a disputed border area, the first such deadly clash since 2011. July 23: Thailand recalls its ambassador to Cambodia and says it will expel Cambodia’s ambassador, following a landmine incident that injured a Thai soldier along the disputed border. July 24: Armed clashes erupt along the border. Both sides accuse the other of opening fire first. Thailand deploys F-16 jets , one of which bombs a Cambodian military target. July 25: Fighting intensifies and spreads with heavy artillery fire and rocket attacks across multiple frontlines, marking their worst clashes in more than a decade. Fighting in the days that follow kills at least 48 people — mostly civilians — and an estimated 300,000 residents are displaced. July 26: Trump calls leaders of both countries and says both agreed to meet soon to work out a ceasefire, adding their respective talks with Washington on trade tariffs could resume once a truce is in place. July 28: After efforts by Malaysia, the United States and also China to bring both sides to the table, the two countries’ leaders sign an agreement in Malaysia’s Putrajaya to end hostilities, resume direct communications and create a mechanism to implement the ceasefire. October 26: The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia sign an enhanced ceasefire deal in the presence of Trump, whose intervention in their fierce border conflict earned him a Nobel Peace Prize nomination from Cambodia. The agreement builds on the truce signed three months earlier. November 1: As part of the agreement, both countries say they have begun the phased withdrawal of heavy weapons from the disputed border, starting with rocket systems, and conducting de-mining operations. Cambodia says it expects the withdrawal to be fully completed by end of the year. November 11: Thailand says it is halting implementation of the ceasefire pact with Cambodia a day after a landmine blast maimed a Thai soldier. Cambodia’s defence ministry denies having laid new landmines. November 12: At least one person is killed in Cambodia as the neighbours accused each other of opening fire. December 8: Thailand launches air strikes after it said its troops came under Cambodian fire. Both countries accuse the other of breaching the ceasefire agreement and Thai authorities say hundreds of thousands of civilians are being evacuated.",

      "summary_orig": "A first information report (FIR) has been registered under terrorism charges after one of the many rallies taken out in Karachi to mark Sindh Culture Day on Sunday turned violent , it emerged on Monday. Police on Sunday resorted to tear gas shelling to prevent participants of the rally from moving towards the Red Zone via Sharea Faisal and detained 45 people, 12 of whom were later released. According to the  police, participants of the rally attacked personnel, who then responded with baton-charging and tear gas shelling. According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn , a case has now been registered against 12 named individuals arrested at the scene and “300-400” unidentified individuals. The case has been registered under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 324 (attempted murder), 186 (obstructing public servants), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant), 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). The complainant, Inspector Abdul Majeed Abro, said that he and other police personnel were present near the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover on Sharae Faisal at 2:30pm on Sunday when a rally, consisting of around 300-400 people on motorcycles and cars, appeared from the direction of the airport, heading toward Saddar. “Keeping in view the ban on gatherings due to the imposition of Section 144 in the province, police personnel attempted to stop the participants of the rally,” he said. However, the participants of the rally blocked the main thoroughfare on both sides and began pelting police with stones while also opening fire, he said. He further said that the participants of the rally also damaged cars that were passing by, including a rescue ambulance and a police mobile, adding that they were also shouting “anti-state” slogans. “Subsequently, police personnel, with the help of officers present on the scene, fired tear gas at the participants to prevent them from damaging property,” he said. Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar had taken strict notice of Sunday’s incident and ordered immediate action against those involved. South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn on Sunday that law enforcers had asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”. “They allegedly pelted stones at the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he had said, adding that this prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them. When asked why the law enforcers had blocked the road at the FTC flyover, the DIG had said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the cultural day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intended to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal. He had said that around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached Fawara Chowk/KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants.",

      "summary_orig": "• Think tank says the narrative attempts to justify unilateral strikes • Terms Western belief in India as a counter to China flawed ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad-based think tank on Sunday warned that India’s “ new normal ” military doctrine is a destabilising force in nuclear-armed South Asia, saying New Delhi’s posture risks triggering a serious escalation in any future crisis. The assessment from the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) came during a dialogue with Australian scholars and officials, the research institute said in a media statement. Delegates from CISS argued that India’s narrative of a “New Normal” aims to normalise escalatory actions and justify unilateral military strikes under the guise of counterterrorism. The security doctrine, central to India’s policy since 2019 and reasserted this year, signals a shift toward conventional military responses such as Operation Sindoor to alleged cross-border attacks, the think tank said. The approach indicates India will not be constrained by Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent, a stance that directly challenges the region’s long-standing nuclear balance, according to the CISS assessment. Risk of miscalculation “Institutionalising assured military retaliation in a nuclearised region is inherently destabilising,” the CISS mentioned. The think tank argued that by leveraging its conventional military advantage for limited war strategies, New Delhi raises the risk of miscalculation. Pakistani scholars at the dialogue questioned India’s logic of blaming Pakistan for every violent incident while facing more than two dozen separatist and insurgent movements on its own territory. Using such claims as a pretext for military strikes undermines crisis stability, they maintained. The delegation said Pakistan’s true new normal “Full Spectrum Deterrence” continues to restrain India. They noted that Pakistan wou­ld be prepared to deliver a “Quid Pro Quo Plus” response to any future Indian military action, as it did during a confrontation in May 2025. CISS also contended that Western support for India’s military modernisation is based on a flawed assumption that New Delhi will serve mainly as a counterweight to China. The think tank argued India’s enh­anced capabilities remain largely directed toward Pakistan. Australian experts, in turn, outli­ned their country’s rationale for joi­ning alliances like AUKUS and the Quad. The Australian delegation stressed that AUKUS is a trilateral partnership and there are no plans for expansion. While policy debates occasionally reference possible future members such as Norway, South Korea, Can­ada or India, they said such prospects remain limited. They also emphasised that the alliance adheres to nonproliferation standards fully aligned with IAEA safeguards. Participants included Justin Burke of the Australian National Uni­versity’s National Security Col­lege; Mike Hughes of the Aust­r­alian Strategic Policy Institute; officials from the Australian High Com­m­i­ssion in Islamabad; and CISS Exe­cutive Director Ali Sarwar Naqvi.

      "title_orig": "An unsettled world in 2026",
      "summary_orig": "THE world faces heightened uncertainty in 2026 as geopolitical and geo-economic tensions intensify and conflicts persist. With the world appearing more unsettled than at any time since the end of the Cold War, President Donald Trump’s ‘ America First ’ unilateralism will inject more instability into global affairs. The rules-based order, in precipitous decline, will fragment further. Multilateralism will come under greater stress. Western dominance will decline even though the US-led West will continue to exert significant influence in the international system. China’s global power and role will increase. Volatility will be a pronounced feature of the fractured international landscape. A more multipolar world will see middle powers play a growing role in shaping geopolitics and acting assertively. Six major trends will shape world affairs in the coming year, although this of course is not an exhaustive list. The first is a shifting geopolitical landscape with changing alignments, eroding rules and a high degree of unpredictability. Geopolitical shifts will principally be determined by how the situation evolves in the Middle East and Ukraine , the course of US-China relations and adjustments countries make in response to the trade war unleashed by Trump. With global norms being upended by Trump’s disruptive policies and other powers showing similar disregard, the drift to what some call a ‘no-rules world’ will become more evident. In its assessment of top risks for 2026, Control Risks, a London-based consultancy firm, forecasts a world in which established rules will fade and even break down. This will make international relatio­nships more transactional and situational. Int­e­rests, it argues, will become the “new values”. The second trend continuing into the coming year is greater use of hard power that characterised international politics in 2025. This is apparent in military or economic coercion rather than dialogue and diplomacy becoming the preferred policy choice of powerful countries and regional powers to bend other states to their will. The threat or the use of force in defiance of international law has become more frequent in this new era of conflict. Israel’s war on Gaza , attacks on Iran , Syria , Lebanon and Yemen , the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US bombardment of Iran and India’s military action against Pakistan all testify to the increasing use of force. It means a fraying global order will fragment further. Trends point to heightened geopolitical tensions, persisting conflicts and fragmenting world order. In its annual publication ‘ The World Ahead ’, The Economist poses the question whether the world is headed towards a new Cold War between blocs led by the US and China or will Trump’s deal-driven approach divide the world into American, Chinese and Russian “spheres of influence” where each of them will decide rules of the game in their domain. It notes foreign policy experts are conflicted on this and there is little certainty which of the two will materialise. Three, the course of relations between the US and China will be the most significant strategic dynamic in the year ahead as it has been in recent years. This remains the world’s most consequential relationship with far-reaching global impact. Trump’s tariff offensive against China set relations onto a turbulent course. Nevertheless, Trump has repeatedly said he wants a deal with Beijing and he did reach a trade agreement with President Xi Jinping in their October 2025 meeting. But this only marks a temporary truce in the trade war as the one-year sunset clause indicates difficult negotiations later next year. Other issues of discord that drive tensions also remain unresolved. China’s effective pushback against US tariffs by using its leverage on critical rare-earth minerals, on which it has a near-monopoly, showed two things — that it can also inflict pain on America and is not hesitant to flex its muscles. China is set to emerge as the largest economy in 2026 and is already the largest trading partner of around 70 countries. Its global influence is therefore expected to grow especially as it projects itself as a stable partner in contrast to Trump’s whimsical conduct. While both countries have a mutual interest to de-escalate, 2026 will determine how durable the temporary calm in their relations will be. Four, efforts for peace in the Middle East will continue to dominate the international agenda. Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan, endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution, hangs in the balance as obstacles to its implementation have yet to be surmounted. Hamas rejected the resolution on several counts. Israeli violations of the ceasefire continue. So does its occupation of over half of Gaza and violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. In these circumstances, Hamas will not disarm. Muslim countries that earlier indicated their intention to join the international stabilisation force are now getting cold feet because of their reluctance to undertake Hamas’s disarmament. The fate of the peace plan will be decided in 2026. The coming year will also determine whether a US-Russia agreement can be forged to end the Ukraine war. For now, uncertainties abound on both fronts. The fifth trend is the growing importance of middle powers. Structural changes and dispersal of power in the international system have created a favourable environment for middle power diplomatic activism and for them to wield influence. US-China competition has offered opportunities and leeway to countries to increase their leverage by playing off that rivalry and strengthen their bargaining power. The reinforcement of this trend in 2026 will oblige the two global superpowers to spend more diplomatic capital to engage middle power countries.

AI-powered tools in business, workplaces, entertainment, media and healthcare have transformed the way we live, learn and work.

      "summary_en": "THE world faces heightened uncertainty in 2026 as geopolitical and geo-economic tensions intensify and conflicts persist. With the world appearing more unsettled than at any time since the end of the Cold War, President Donald Trump’s ‘ America First ’ unilateralism will inject more instability into global affairs. The rules-based order, in precipitous decline, will fragment further. Multilateralism will come under greater stress. Western dominance will decline even though the US-led West will continue to exert significant influence in the international system. China’s global power and role will increase. Volatility will be a pronounced feature of the fractured international landscape. A more multipolar world will see middle powers play a growing role in shaping geopolitics and acting assertively. Six major trends will shape world affairs in the coming year, although this of course is not an exhaustive list. The first is a shifting geopolitical landscape with changing alignments, eroding rules and a high degree of unpredictability. Geopolitical shifts will principally be determined by how the situation evolves in the Middle East and Ukraine , the course of US-China relations and adjustments countries make in response to the trade war unleashed by Trump. With global norms being upended by Trump’s disruptive policies and other powers showing similar disregard, the drift to what some call a ‘no-rules world’ will become more evident. In its assessment of top risks for 2026, Control Risks, a London-based consultancy firm, forecasts a world in which established rules will fade and even break down. This will make international relatio­nships more transactional and situational. Int­e­rests, it argues, will become the “new values”. The second trend continuing into the coming year is greater use of hard power that characterised international politics in 2025. This is apparent in military or economic coercion rather than dialogue and diplomacy becoming the preferred policy choice of powerful countries and regional powers to bend other states to their will. The threat or the use of force in defiance of international law has become more frequent in this new era of conflict. Israel’s war on Gaza , attacks on Iran , Syria , Lebanon and Yemen , the Russian invasion of Ukraine, US bombardment of Iran and India’s military action against Pakistan all testify to the increasing use of force. It means a fraying global order will fragment further. Trends point to heightened geopolitical tensions, persisting conflicts and fragmenting world order. In its annual publication ‘ The World Ahead ’, The Economist poses the question whether the world is headed towards a new Cold War between blocs led by the US and China or will Trump’s deal-driven approach divide the world into American, Chinese and Russian “spheres of influence” where each of them will decide rules of the game in their domain. It notes foreign policy experts are conflicted on this and there is little certainty which of the two will materialise. Three, the course of relations between the US and China will be the most significant strategic dynamic in the year ahead as it has been in recent years. This remains the world’s most consequential relationship with far-reaching global impact. Trump’s tariff offensive against China set relations onto a turbulent course. Nevertheless, Trump has repeatedly said he wants a deal with Beijing and he did reach a trade agreement with President Xi Jinping in their October 2025 meeting. But this only marks a temporary truce in the trade war as the one-year sunset clause indicates difficult negotiations later next year. Other issues of discord that drive tensions also remain unresolved. China’s effective pushback against US tariffs by using its leverage on critical rare-earth minerals, on which it has a near-monopoly, showed two things — that it can also inflict pain on America and is not hesitant to flex its muscles. China is set to emerge as the largest economy in 2026 and is already the largest trading partner of around 70 countries. Its global influence is therefore expected to grow especially as it projects itself as a stable partner in contrast to Trump’s whimsical conduct. While both countries have a mutual interest to de-escalate, 2026 will determine how durable the temporary calm in their relations will be. Four, efforts for peace in the Middle East will continue to dominate the international agenda. Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan, endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution, hangs in the balance as obstacles to its implementation have yet to be surmounted. Hamas rejected the resolution on several counts. Israeli violations of the ceasefire continue. So does its occupation of over half of Gaza and violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. In these circumstances, Hamas will not disarm. Muslim countries that earlier indicated their intention to join the international stabilisation force are now getting cold feet because of their reluctance to undertake Hamas’s disarmament. The fate of the peace plan will be decided in 2026. The coming year will also determine whether a US-Russia agreement can be forged to end the Ukraine war.

      "summary_orig": "YouTuber Saadur Rehman, also known as Ducky Bhai, uploaded a nearly hour-long video to his YouTube channel on Sunday, in which he made allegations of physical and verbal abuse while in the custody of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA). Rehman was arrested in August at Lahore Airport by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting online gambling and betting applications through his platform. He was granted bail in the case by the Lahore High Court on November 25, but was not released from official custody. Meanwhile, in September, NCCIA Lahore Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry was removed from his post, reportedly over different controversies, including allegedly beating Rehman. In the video uploaded on Sunday, Rehman outlined the timeline of events from his arrest and being remanded into the NCCIA’s custody. He described meeting Chaudhry, alleging that he was verbally and physically abusive. “He stood up from his chair and verbally abused me,” Rehman alleged. “He asked me, ’Where does your money come from?’ I replied that it comes from YouTube. I have eight million subscribers. He accused me of corrupting the minds of children. “He kept verbally abusing me and slapped me so much I lost count.” Rehman further alleged that officials tried to bribe him, offering to resolve the issue for Rs70-80 million, which he said he did not have. “When I was in NCCIA custody, you probably heard about $326,000 during a podcast with the assistant director. He said that they seized this money from me … the investigating officer (IO) ordered me to open my Binance account,” Rehman alleged. “He closed all my trades and tokens at a loss and converted them to US dollars. He then ordered me to transfer it.” The YouTuber further accused the IO of transferring the sum to his own personal account. Rehman said that he felt “very helpless” during the first day of custody, further alleging that he was beaten by authorities despite cooperating with the investigation. He added that when he met with someone he knew, he asked them to request that the guards “beat him less”. An NCCIA Lahore spokesperson responded to Dawn’s request for comment on the allegations, replying that it is individuals who engage in corrupt practices, not institutions. “The NCCIA maintains an uncompromising zero-tolerance policy toward any form of corrupt conduct by its officials,” the spokesperson said. “All proceedings in this matter are being pursued strictly on merit and in full accordance with due process, and an investigation is already underway with FIA Anti-Corruption,“ he added. On October 28, six NCCIA personnel were arrested and remanded on allegations of misusing their authority and taking bribes. Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq told Dawn the six were “taken into FIA custody and arrested on charges of misuse of authority and bribery” and would be produced in district court, where he would represent them. Ashfaq said the six staffers were Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, In-charge Zawar, Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Yasir Gujjar and Mujtaba Kamran. The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered against nine people, including eight NCCIA personnel, with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Rehman’s wife, Aroob Jatoi.",

Eleven people died in the 2 September attack , including two men killed in a follow-up strike as they reportedly clung to wreckage for an hour. That killing has been met with intense scrutiny and accusations of war crimes after the Washington Post reported defense secretary Pete Hegseth gave an order to “kill them all” . Adm Frank Bradley of the US navy, who oversaw the attack, told lawmakers on Thursday there was no such order – and the Pentagon has defended the legality of the attack. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the second phase of a US plan to end Tel Aviv’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza was close, but cautioned several key issues still needed to be resolved, including whether a multinational security force would be deployed. Netanyahu, speaking to reporters alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Jerusalem, said that he would hold important discussions with US President Donald Trump at the end of the month on how to ensure the plan’s second phase was achieved. The prime minister’s office in November said that Trump had invited Netanyahu to the White House “in the near future”, although a date for the visit has not yet been made public. Netanyahu said that he would discuss with Trump how to bring an end to Hamas rule in Gaza. Israel and Hamas entered a ceasefire two months ago, but Israel has continued its bombardment of Gaza, killing Palestinians, as the death toll in the besieged enclave reached over 72,300 as of November 19, 2o25. Gaza’s health ministry says 373 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire started. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed by Hamas. Earlier today, Israel’s army killed seven Palestinians in northern Gaza, including a 70-year-old woman and her son. Attacks also wounded a child in Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera . Tel Aviv also alleges that Hamas has been violating the ceasefire. Netanyahu said that it was important to ensure Hamas not only upholds the ceasefire but also follows through on “their commitment” to the plan to disarm and for Gaza to be demilitarised. Israel retained control of 53 per cent of Gaza under the first phase of Trump’s plan, which involved the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel. The final hostage remains to be handed over are those of an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023, fighting Hamas. Phase 2 must come out now: German chancellor According to the plan, Israel is to pull back further in the second phase as a transitional authority is established in Gaza and a multinational security force is deployed, Hamas is disarmed, and reconstruction begins. A multinational coordination centre has been established in Israel, but there are no deadlines in the plan and officials involved say that efforts to advance it have stalled. “What will be the timeline? What are the forces that are coming in? Will we have international forces? If not, what are the alternatives? These are all topics that are being discussed,” Netanyahu said, describing them as central issues. Merz said that Germany was willing to help rebuild Gaza but would wait for Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump, and for clarity on what Washington was prepared to do, before Berlin decides what it would contribute, but that phase two “must come now”. West Bank annexation remains subject of discussion: Netanyahu Netanyahu said that he would also discuss with Trump “opportunities for peace”, an apparent reference to US efforts for Israel to establish formal ties with Arab and Muslim states. “We believe there’s a path to advance a broader peace with the Arab states, and a path also to establish a workable peace with our Palestinian neighbours,” Netanyahu said, asserting Israel would always insist on security control of the West Bank. Trump has said he promised Muslim leaders that Israel would not annex the occupied West Bank, where Netanyahu’s government is backing the development of Jewish settlements. The “question of political annexation” of the West Bank remains a subject of discussion, Netanyahu said.",

      "summary_orig": "Karachi police arrested 45 people participating in the Sindh Culture Day rally on Sunday, after people allegedly pelted police personnel with stones. South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that upon being attacked by participants, police responded with a baton charge and tear gas shelling. “We detained 45 people on Sharea Faisal,” DIG Raza said. “The South SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) is at the scene, and the situation is under control.” The DIG said that since the Red Zone has been closed, alternative traffic routes are being provided for citizens and commuters. He added that the law enforcers asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the main Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”. “They allegedly pelted stones on the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he said, adding that it prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them. According to police sources, participants at the rally were arguing with police over being stopped and that dispute escalated into stone-throwing. Asked as to why the law enforcers blocked the road at the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover, DIG Raza said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the Cultural Day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intend to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal. “In view of certain past untoward incidents, the law enforcers were asked to ensure that no participant was allowed to move beyond FTC under any circumstances, as the area ahead leads into the Red Zone, which contains sensitive installations. “Thus, the police and rangers were deployed at the FTC bridge to enforce the diversion and prevent any unauthorised movement.” Later, the DIG said that 12 of the 45 arrested were released on the surety of the Karachi Bar Association president. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took strict notice of the incident on Sharea Faisal and ordered immediate action against those involved, according to a statement from his office. In a phone call with the additional inspector general, Lanjar ordered, “Those damaging police vehicles and citizens’ property should be arrested immediately.” Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh. Raza recalled that in 2023, during Sindh Cultural Day celebrations, there were violent confrontations between law enforcers and protesters in which a first information report was also registered. Similarly, last year, Raza said a police van was damaged, and police personnel were manhandled, while some of the protestors managed to cross into the Red Zone and reached the KPC via Jinnah Bridge. “Around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached the Fawara Chowk and KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "Local public transporters on Sunday announced a wheel-jam strike for tomorrow (December 8) in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, rejecting the local administration’s request to delay the protest against the new traffic ordinance, which has raised fines for heavy vehicles. The strike was announced on the call of the Punjab Public Transport Association. Before the announcement, representatives of the association, along with the Goods Transporters Association, met City Traffic Police officer Farhan Aslam and Regional Transport Authority Secretary Asad Shirazi. The administration urged transporters not to observe a wheel-jam strike in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. However, local transporters refused to withdraw their decision, insisting they would go ahead with the strike to pressure the provincial government into repealing the ordinance. “We tried to convince the transporters not to go for a wheel-jam strike, but they demanded to abolish the new amendments, and it was beyond our authority to do anything about it,” Shirazi said. He added that the Punjab government had been informed of the demands of the transporters, and it would hold negotiations with the United Transport Association in Lahore. Mutahida Transport Federation of Twin Cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chairman Raja Muhammad Riaz told Dawn that “transporters were facing problems due to heavy fines, and it was difficult to manage their household budgets.” “Heavy fines from Rs5,000 to Rs20,000 had become routine, and it destroyed their business,” Riaz said, adding that the government was trying to recover its financial burdens from transporters, who were already struggling with fuel and spare parts. He demanded an immediate reduction in fines and an end to policies that “destroyed the sector.” During the meeting, he said that the traffic police agreed not to impose fines on vehicles having a fitness certificate. Meanwhile, the President of the Goods Transport Association, Shakeel Qureshi, said that freight vehicles and goods transporters in Rawalpindi would support the wheel-jam strike on Monday. “We will join them in the decision of the Pakistan United Transporters Committee to strike on December 8,” he said, adding that the Rawalpindi transporters will keep their bases completely closed. “We strongly condemn the traffic laws passed by the Punjab Assembly and the rate of fines,” he said. “Amendments to the customs laws that will be made are tantamount to economic murder of transporters.” Qureshi went on to say that the government should take the time to be conscious and make decisions, keeping in mind the interests of the people. “It should not be that decisions are made by listening to one side and making laws without consulting stakeholders,” he said. On the other hand, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI) Rawalpindi district has announced its full support for the December 8 strike of the Transport Action Committee against heavy traffic fines. Spokesperson JUI Rawalpindi Hafiz Ziaullah said that heavy fines imposed by the Punjab government have made life difficult for the people of Rawalpindi, especially the poor motorcyclists. He demanded that the Chief Minister of Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, “adopt a people-friendly policy and reduce the unnecessary and unfair burden of fines.”",
