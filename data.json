      "summary_orig": "A shooter killed at least one person and wounded others in a shooting on Wednesday at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office in Dallas before dying of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, local and federal authorities said. Police responded to reports of the shooting at the office in northwest Dallas at about 6:40am local time (4:40pm PKT), the Dallas police department said on X.\nThe suspect opened fire on the office from an adjacent building, according to the preliminary investigation, police said. Two people were transported to a hospital with gunshot wounds, while a third person died at the scene. ICE officers were not injured, but it was not clear whether the victims included ICE detainees, local security or local law enforcement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in an interview on Fox News ’ ‘Fox & Friends’. Investigators are looking at the possibility that the shot came from the rooftop of a nearby apartment building, McLaughlin added. “Those details are still murky. It looked like it might have been a sniper or some sort of a long-form shot,“ McLaughlin said. She also said the shooting took place at an ICE field office, not a detention facility, where ICE officers conduct short-term processing of recently-arrested detainees. The incident comes two weeks after the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk by a sniper during an event in Orem, Utah, which fueled fears of a new wave of political violence in the United States. US President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and other administration officials have blamed, without proof, liberal organisations for fomenting unrest and encouraging violence against the right. On Monday, Trump signed an executive order declaring the anti-fascist movement Antifa as a domestic terrorist organisation despite the fact that there has been no evidence made public linking Antifa to Kirk’s death. The Trump administration’s aggressive use of ICE agents as part of its crackdown on undocumented immigrants has sparked outcries from Democrats and liberal activists. ICE detention facilities have increasingly become sites of conflict, with heavily armed agents deploying pepper ball guns, tear gas and other chemical agents in clashes with protesters. An ICE facility in suburban Chicago, where protesters have gathered daily since a Trump administration immigration surge began earlier this month, erected fencing on Monday after several demonstrators, including the mayor of Evanston, Illinois, were injured in a clash with agents last week. In July, an ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Texas, was the target of a coordinated protest that saw multiple gunshots fired and one police officer injured.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces on Wednesday killed 13 terrorists in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) carried out in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, the military’s media wing said in a statement. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), security forces conducted the operation in the Daraban area, upon the reported presence of terrorists “belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij ”. The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “During the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and [as a result], 13 Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read. The ISPR added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area. The statement added that these terrorists were involved in “facilitation [of] a suicide bombing attack in Daraban in December 2023, [the] abduction and target killing of government officials and innocent civilians”. “[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded. On September 21, security personnel launched an IBO in the same district, where they killed seven terrorists, including three “Afghan nationals”. In a statement, the ISPR said that the operation was carried out in the Kulachi area upon the presence of “ khawarij ”. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and [as a result], seven Indian sponsored khwarij, including three Afghan National khwarij and two suicide bombers, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said. The statement added that Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government, run by the Afghan Taliban, to uphold its responsibilities and deny the use of its soil to carry out acts of terror. Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.",

      "summary_orig": "British police said on Wednesday that a man had been arrested as part of an investigation into a ransomware attack against Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX, which knocked check-in systems at airports offline and caused widespread travel disruption across Europe. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said in a statement that the man, in his 40s, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act and had since been released on conditional bail. “Although this arrest is a positive step, the investigation into this incident is in its early stages and remains ongoing,” NCA Deputy Director Paul Foster said. It remained unclear which criminal group was behind last week’s hack. An NCA spokesperson declined to provide further details. Ransomware gangs routinely publicise attacks and leak stolen data on dark web “leak sites” but websites that monitor those portals had not, as of Wednesday, detected any group claiming the hack. Ransomware is malicious software used by cybercriminals to encrypt a company’s data and demand payment for its release. They typically operate in the shadows, and many try to avoid targets which might earn them unwanted attention from law enforcement agencies. The attack on Collins Aerospace was the latest in a string of online hacks in Europe which have had significant offline consequences. Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors, said on Tuesday it was extending the closure of its factories until October 1 following a hack this month that has left its operations paralysed and smaller suppliers struggling. Berlin airport, one of several airports across Europe to have been impacted by the Collins Aerospace hack, said on Wednesday that it may take several more days before it had functional and secure software again, operator BER said in a statement.",

      "summary_orig": "EVERY year of my journalistic career of nearly half a century, I have known only a free and independent press in the United States. My professional start was in the 1970s. Those were years when Americans could see clearly how the press served democracy. With the publication of the Pentagon Papers, first by The New York Times , the American public learned of the failures its government had covered up during a long war in Vietnam that cost so many lives. Then there was Watergate, an investigation spearheaded by The Washington Post. US citizens learned how their president had weaponised the government against his political adversaries, abusing his powers and sabotaging the Constitution. In the decades since those revelations, I took for granted that my country would always enjoy press freedom — and that the First Amendment of our Constitution would guarantee it. We now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between ‘true’ and ‘false’; we cannot even agree on how to determine ‘a fact’ I no longer take any of that for granted. I no longer assume that the constitutional order will hold in the United States. Or that the rule of law will prevail. Or that free expression — not just for the press, but for all Americans – will endure. That is because we have a president who has demonstrated disdain for traditional restraints on his power. Because a majority in Congress remains servile. Because a majority on the Supreme Court has handed this president extraordinary authority and immunity. Because the president appears determined to lay siege to institutional pillars of democracy, with the press as a high-priority target. And it is because those institutions are proving to be more fragile and faint-hearted than I imagined possible. And perhaps most concerning to me is that we now live in a time when people are unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between what is true and what is false. It is only natural — and, in a democracy, expected — that we will disagree about which policies are best. Yet today we cannot agree on how to determine a fact. All of the elements we have historically relied upon to establish facts — education, expertise, experience and, above all, evidence — have been denigrated, dismissed and denied. How can democracy flourish, or even survive, when we can’t determine the most basic facts. If democracy is in danger, a free press is, too. An independent press cannot survive without a democracy. And there is a corollary to that. A democracy cannot survive without a free press. There has never been a democracy without a media that is free and independent. The playbook of aspiring authoritarians is well-established. High on their to-do list is crushing the press, an institution that can shed light on what political leaders are up to and that might hold them to account. Their repressive practices extend well beyond the press, however: They seek to abolish free expression altogether: The right of musicians, authors, artists, playwrights and screenwriters to express themselves as they wish. The right of the public to listen to, see and read what they feel they should. The right of business executives, academics, activists and political leaders to advocate for the policies they believe in. The right of every one of us to speak freely with family, friends, neighbors and colleagues without fear of surveillance and reprisal. The rights that the press strives to safeguard are no different from the rights most people want for themselves — the freedom to inquire into facts, to share what they’ve learned, to communicate what they believe. Much more is at risk than the freedom to express opinions. The real target of autocrats is truth itself. They aim to extinguish all independent arbiters of fact, whether they happen to be judges, scholars, scientists, statisticians or journalists. In nations tilting toward authoritarianism, heads of state claim sole ownership of the truth. And they rig, suppress or erase data to advance their lies. That is what is happening now in the United States. Facts are under attack while government demands that its fictions be unquestioningly repeated. For decades, the United States was a bastion of free expression of all types, with constitutional protections seemingly secured. That is no longer the case. We were a model for citizens in other nations who yearned for similar liberty. We no longer are. We were a forceful champion for these freedoms elsewhere. Civil rights activists, democracy advocates and independent journalists worldwide often counted on our support when faced with repression. They no longer can expect it. In a famous 1941 speech about four essential human freedoms, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt listed “freedom of speech and expression” as the very first. And he pointedly added the words: “everywhere in the world.” Today, with an aspiring autocrat as president, the United States is failing to embrace the freedoms that Franklin D. Roosevelt considered indispensable for a better world. Independent media was already in peril globally, a casualty of diminished confidence in democracy and the rise of a new generation of authoritarians. Our president has placed the press worldwide — and freedom of expression generally — in even greater jeopardy. What President Donald Trump and his allies contemptuously disregard is why the founders of the United States drafted the First Amendment to the Constitution. James Madison was the principal author. And in describing the role of the press and of free expression, he spoke of the “right of freely examining public characters and measures.” The word “examining” deserves special attention. Here is how the dictionary defines its meaning: “To inspect closely,” “to inquire into carefully/investigate,” “to test by questioning in order to determine progress, fitness, or knowledge.” Apply that to journalists, and it means we are not stenographers. Nor should we be. We go behind the curtain and beneath the surface – to learn who did what and why, who will be affected and how, who influenced those decisions and with what intent. The purpose of journalism, in my view, is to provide the public with the information it needs and deserves to know so that people might govern themselves. Embedded within that mission is a particularly high calling: Holding powerful individuals and institutions to account. Those with power have the capacity to do enormous good. When they do, and when ordinary individuals do, we in the press should make that known. Praiseworthy efforts to improve society should be shared with others. At the same time, some wrongs can be committed at extraordinary scale. Often the fault lies with those who possess disproportionate power, including the means to cover up their misdeeds. Immoral or unlawful conduct can go undetected for years, or decades. Ordinary people can suffer severe harm. Victims are often ignored or muzzled. So, the public has much at stake in the struggle for free expression and an independent press. People must have a right to voice their grievances. The media should be prepared to listen and investigate. When there is grave wrongdoing, often no one but journalists will explore the facts. When there are no journalists to report on corruption, inevitably there is more of it, with ordinary citizens paying the greatest price. When no independent media exists to draw attention, those who possess immense power seize the opportunity to acquire more. Their interests are served, the public’s needs are not. As the US government abandons the cause of freedom worldwide, my hope is that citizens in other countries now will become a model for Americans who took their own freedoms for granted. They can show us how best to struggle against a repressive government. And in the difficult fight to uphold the fundamental democratic principles of free expression and an independent press, they can provide inspiration.

      "summary_orig": "A portion of a busy road in Thailand’s capital caved in early on Wednesday, leaving a hole dozens of metres deep in front of a main hospital and forcing people nearby to evacuate. Just outside a local police station and Vajira Hospital in a residential district of Bangkok, a roughly 50-metre (160-foot) hole pulled down power lines and exposed a burst pipe gushing water, AFP journalists saw. Dozens of police and city officials cordoned off the site, while a pickup truck teetered precariously on the edge of the hole. Suriyachai Rawiwan, director of Bangkok’s disaster prevention department, told AFP at the scene that the collapse was likely linked to recent heavy rain and a leaky pipe. “There was a leak in the water pipe — water from the pipe eroded (earth) under the road so this incident happened,” he said, adding that there were no known casualties. “The water that eroded brought some soil that dropped down to an under-construction subway station, causing the collapse,” Suriyachai added. The tunnel is part of an underground service being built by the state-run Mass Rapid Transit Authority, which said it would investigate the cause of the cave-in. Suriyachai said the local police station facing the collapsed road was evacuated. Senior police officer Sayam Boonsom also said he had ordered the evacuation of nearby apartment blocks. “The location is at a station, and the soil was sucked into the site … it collapsed,” Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt told AFP at the scene. A video posted on social media and verified by AFP shows several people running from a construction area on Samsen Road as the street cracks open and collapses, revealing a water-filled hole. View this post on Instagram Vajira Hospital, a teaching facility for one of Thailand’s top medical universities, said in a Facebook post it was suspending outpatient services, adding that they would “resume as soon as possible”. Noppadech Pitpeng, a 27-year-old hospital staffer who lives in a nearby building, said he was frightened by a rumbling sound on Wednesday morning that woke him up. “The sound was like an electricity pole collapsing and my whole flat shook,” he said, while carrying clothes in a large bucket out of his building.",

The remarks come days after alleged aerial strikes in KP’s Tirah valley killed at least two dozen residents, including women and children. The incident prompted protests in the region, with local tribesmen, as well as the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan , calling for an inquiry into the matter. On the other hand, officials claimed that the explosions that led to the killings were caused by terrorists storing and manufacturing explosive devices in houses. During an interview on the DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’, Wali was questioned about the PTI-led government in KP criticising the security situation in the province, with some suggesting the party was on board with military operations, while others claimed the party opposed the measures. He was asked how he viewed this apparent contradiction. In response, Wali said, “Our brothers, sisters, friends, sons, children, and elders in tribal areas should not give refuge to people targeted in military operations.” “Do not make people who are wanted by the state your guests,” Wali asserted. When asked if he meant locals were sheltering the terrorists, Wali replied: “It certainly cannot be an outsider. How would the terrorists be operating in these areas otherwise?” “Someone has to be giving refuge to them and facilitating them. And when operations are carried out, our citizens also lose their lives.” At this point, Wali was asked to confirm if he was saying that locals of tribal areas were giving refuge to terrorists. To this, Wali did not respond in the affirmative but instead repeated his claim, saying, “There certainly has to be facilitation from some side.” The country, mainly KP and Balochistan, has lately witnessed a rise in terrorist incidents, particularly after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a peace deal with the government and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement personnel. Earlier this month, at least one person was killed in a bomb blast while a cricket match was being played in KP’s Bajaur district on Saturday, according to the police. In May, four children were killed and five others, including a woman, were injured in a suspected quadcopter munitions drop in Mir Ali tehsil of North Waziristan district, prompting locals to protest against frequent strikes. Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice. While earlier this year, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, but officials said was an operation carried out against militants. According to locals, the deceased were civilians, including women and children, working as shepherds.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Wednesday that it has received Third Country Operator (TCO) approval for flight operations in the United Kingdom and is expected to return to British skies next month, according to a statement. In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to now apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. Having received the TCO certification, the national carrier announced that it would now be allowed to operate direct flights and carry not only passengers but also cargo. “In the first phase, flight operations to Manchester will be resumed, after which Birmingham and London will be included in the B network,” the statement read, adding that the carrier was informed about the approval a day prior. “The same day, the British Department of Transport also issued PIA Security and Cargo ACC3 certificates for five years,” PIA added. “These certificates, issued by international aviation organisations, are a manifestation of complete confidence in PIA’s air operations and safety.” it said. In a post on X, the national carrier expressed gratitude to the prime minister, foreign minister, defence ministry and Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority for their assistance in getting operations resumed. The carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”. The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.",

In a post on X, the national carrier expressed gratitude to the prime minister, foreign minister, defence ministry and Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority for their assistance in getting operations resumed. The carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”. The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.",

      "summary_orig": "• Eight prosecution witnesses record statements; nine more to appear at next hearing • Imran’s lawyer opposes video link arrangement for PTI chief, will appeal ATC order • Plea in IHC seeks enforcement of conjugal rights for incarcerated ex-PM, spouse RAWALPINDI: The prosecution is likely to conclude its evidence against former prime minister Imran Khan and other PTI leaders next week in the case pertaining to a violent protest outside the army’s General Headquarters (GHQ) on May 9, 2023, following the arrest of Mr Khan in a corruption case. During the hearing, ex-PM Imran Khan also marked his attendance from the Adiala jail via video link, but connectivity issues marred the PTI leader’s appearance before the court. On Tuesday, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Rawalpindi recorded the statements of eight prosecution witnesses, after the defence sought deferment of the proceedings to challenge the order requiring Mr Khan’s appearance through video link. The order was passed in pursuance of a Punjab government notification directing trial proceedings be held via video link, citing security concerns. ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah on Sept 19 ruled that the trial would be conducted on the court premises instead of in Adiala jail, with Mr Khan’s attendance to be mar­k­ed through video link. When the hearing resumed on Tuesday, the defence counsel requested an adjo­u­rnment, informing the judge that the legal team intended to file an appeal against the Sept 19 order. The prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum. The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement. The court recorded statements of eight prosecution witnesses, incl­uding three officers of the Fed­eral Investigation Agency’s Cyber Crimes Wing, who testified regarding tweets and other social media posts of the PTI leaders ahead of and during the May 9 protests. Two Islamabad magistrates, Awais Bhatti and Abdullah Khan, also testified that they had recorded statements of PTI local leaders Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Wasiq Qayyum and Omar Tanveer Butt, who affirmed the allegations against Mr Khan and the party leadership. According to Raja Ikram Ame­en Minhas, the head of the prosecution in the GHQ case, the testimony of 41 prosecution witnesses has been completed so far, while the remaining nine witnesses will be produced at the next hearing. He said that the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses would start afterwards. The court adjourned the case till Sept 27. Mr Khan, who has been incarcerated in Adiala jail since 2023, faces multiple cases, including GHQ protest case. He was indicted in December last year and was arrested in this case by the Rawa­lpindi police in January 2024. Conjugal rights Separately, the Islamabad High Court issued notices to the authorities concerned on a petition seeking permission for Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, to exercise their conjugal rights while incarcerated in prison. Justice Arbab Tahir took up the petition filed under Article 199 by Shahid Yaqoob, a resident of Islamabad and Imran’s supporter. The court issued a one-page written order, directing the Islamabad chief commissioner, the Punjab government, Punjab’s inspector general of prisons, and the jail superintendent, among others, to submit their replies before the next hearing. During proceedings, the petitioner’s lawyer argued that Section 545A of the Criminal Proc­edure Code supported the protection of family life and provision of facilities for marital relations to prisoners as a basic need. He argued that denial of conjugal rights violates constitutional protections, international conventions, and previous judicial rulings. It also cites a 2010 notification issued by the Sindh Home Department in compliance with Supreme Court directions, allowing convicted inmates conjugal visits every three months. Additionally, the petition relies on a landmark Shariat Court judgement that recognised conjugal rights for prisoners as a fundamental entitlement. Published in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",

The meeting , held on the sidelines of the 80th UNGA at United Nations Headquarters, brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia. Ahead of the meeting, in a televised interaction with Muslim leaders, Trump said: “We have to get the hostages back… This is the group that can do it, more than any other group in the world… so it’s an honour to be with you.” “We had 32 meetings here, this is the one that’s very important because we’re gonna end something that should’ve probably never started,” he said, before the start of formal consultations with world leaders. Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani thanked the president for hosting such an important meeting at such an important time, saying that they were only there to stop the war and bring the prisoners back. “We count on your leadership as well to end this war and to help the people of Gaza,” the Qatari leader said. ‘Stop the war immediately’ Earlier, in his speech at the UNGA, Trump said that greater recognition for Palestine would amount to rewarding “horrible atrocities” by Hamas. He called on world powers to focus instead on securing the release of prisoners held in Gaza. Trump said the US wants a ‘ceasefire-for-prisoners’ deal that would see the return of all remaining prisoners, alive and dead. “We have to stop the war in Gaza immediately. We have to immediately negotiate peace,” he said. Reacting to Trump’s address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US leader’s “commitment to establishing peace in the world,” saying it showed he was “indeed a man of peace”. He also recalled that Trump and his team had “played a crucial role in preventing a potentially devastating war between India and Pakistan,” adding: “For that we thank him from the depths of our hearts.” The remarks came ahead of the multi-lateral meeting with Muslim leaders, where Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also accompanied PM. When asked about the upcoming meeting by reporters, PM Shehbaz refused to comment, saying: “It is not the right time; I will speak about it only after the meeting is over.” The PM Office also released pictures showing PM Shehbaz in a meeting with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. Both the White House and Pakistan’s mission in Washington were expected to hold a briefing after the meeting, but no formal statements were issued until going to press. Plan for peace According to the White House, Trump’s plan envisions a phased Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of regional peacekeeping troops, and an internationally supported transition and reconstruction process for the battered enclave. Quoting diplomatic sources, Israel’s Channel 12 and US-based Axios reported that while the plan had not been drafted by Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been made aware of its outlines. It envisages a role for the Palestinian Authority (PA), but not for Hamas, which both Washington and Tel Aviv insist must be dismantled. Washington wants Arab and Muslim countries to agree to send military forces to Gaza to enable Israel’s withdrawal and to secure funding for transition and rebuilding programs, Axios reported. Ahead of the multilateral meeting, Sec­retary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News that the only way to a permanent solution to the “challenge between Palestinians and Israelis is a negotiated settlement”. Describing the possible deal, he said it would be “one in which the Palestinians are going to have a territory and they’re going to govern it, but it cannot be one that’s going to be used as a launchpad for attacks against Israel.” In separate remarks to CBS News , he described the multilateral meeting as “one last shot” at ending the conflict in Gaza, getting all remaining prisoners released, and putting in place a humanitarian relief programme.
