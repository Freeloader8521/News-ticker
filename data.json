The workers at the 14 airports said they will resume their duties through Oct. 14, when the presidential office is scheduled to meet with officials from the state-run Korea Airports Corp. for talks on the issue. \"If the government and the relevant agencies fail to take responsible action after the talks, we will resume the general strike Oct. 15,\" they said in a press release. Unionized workers at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul, will continue their full-scale walkout throughout the Chuseok break, which runs from Friday through next Thursday.

      "summary_orig": "The death toll in an Indonesian school collapse rose to 17 on Saturday, officials said, as rescuers deployed heavy machinery to recover dozens more victims believed still buried under the rubble. Part of the multi-storey boarding school collapsed suddenly on Monday as students gathered for afternoon prayers. Rescuers retrieved two bodies and a body part from the rubble today, bringing the death toll to 17, National Search and Rescue Agency (Basarnas) operation director Yudhi Bramantyo said in a statement. “The evacuation process is still ongoing. Debris removal is focused to the north side in an area not integrated with the main structure,” Yudhi said. Local search and rescue agency head Nanang Sigit confirmed the updated toll in a separate statement. Earlier today, authorities said they had recovered nine bodies on Friday. Rescuers were searching for 49 people still missing, National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) chief Suharyanto said before prior to the retrieval of the latest bodies. More victims could be found, said Suharyanto, who, like many Indonesians, only goes by one name, as rescuers brought heavy machinery to clear locations where the victims were believed to be buried underneath the rubble. “After the last victim was found last night, we are focusing on a massive cleanup, with heavy equipment entering the collapsed areas,” he said, as reported by broadcaster Kompas TV . The school collapse was so violent that it sent tremors across the neighbourhood, according to residents. Investigators have been looking into the cause of the collapse, but initial signs pointed to substandard construction, experts have said. The rescue operation was complex because vibrations in one place could affect other areas, officials said. But the families of the missing agreed on Thursday for heavy equipment to be used, after the 72-hour “golden period” for the best chance of survival came to an end. The rescue operation was complicated by an earthquake that struck overnight on Tuesday, briefly halting the search.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Saturday that it would resume flights to the United Kingdom from October 25, with nonstop flights from Manchester to Islamabad. This comes a day after the Pakistan High Commission in London announced that the national carrier would resume flight operations to the UK this month as PIA received its Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and Third Country Operator approval , but no exact date was given. PIA announced its “historic return” to British skies with a post on X today, which read: “The wait is finally over! Pakistan International Airlines proudly reconnects Manchester and Islamabad, bringing loved ones closer once again.” In yesterday’s announcement, the high commission said flight operations to Manchester would be resumed during the first phase, after which Birmingham and London would follow suit. In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. The national carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people. The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”. The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.",

      "summary_orig": "PPP Sindh President Senator Nisar Khuhro on Saturday assailed Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks regarding the contentious canals issue as a violation of the decision made by the Council of Common Interests (CCI). The war of words between the two sides, that kicked off over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP had lawmakers stay away from parliamentary proceedings to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad on Wednesday to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces. However, she declared a day ago that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47. In a statement issued today, the PPP senator said her remarks regarding the controversial canal project were a “violation of the CCI’s decision and an insult to the constitutional forum”. The party demanded that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif take notice of her remarks and clarify the party’s policy. It also demanded that the Punjab government disclose the aid provided to flood victims. The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. “The CCI, a constitutional forum, has already rejected and buried the controversial canal project,” reiterated the PPP leader. “Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz is not above the CCI’s constitutional forum, and Maryam Nawaz holds no standing alone against the CCI.” He said it was the CCI’s unanimous decision that no canal project would be built until all provinces agreed, adding that Sindh would not accept the project under any circumstances. Khuhro further said that Maryam was violating the forum’s decision and insulting it with her remarks about the project, adding that she “lacks political wisdom”, which is why she was criticising a constitutional forum. The senator said Nawaz was the PML-N’s leader and should take notice of his daughter’s remarks and clarify the party’s stance on the issue. “Sindh will not allow anyone to plunder the water of its Indus River, nor will it allow any dam to be built on the Indus River. “Constitutionally, the province of Sindh, being at the tail end, has the first right to water, and any attack on Sindh’s water share will be considered an attack on the unity of Sindh and the country.” He further alleged that CM Maryam was “frightened by the growing popularity” of the PPP in Punjab, which is why she was opposing the process of providing relief to flood victims through the Benazir Income Support Programme. “Punjab is not the fiefdom of any single party; the PPP, along with every political party, has the right to engage in political activities in Punjab.” Criticising her administration’s flood relief and rescue efforts, he added her “hollow claims” about her performance are “limited to TV channels only” and stood “exposed”. “Punjab’s flood victims are still waiting and yearning for aid and relief.” “If the Punjab CM is providing complete relief and aid to flood victims, she should disclose it to the nation,” he said. US commits $1m to Unicef flood response Meanwhile, a press release from Uncief issued a day ago said the United States has committed $1 million to support the organisation’s emergency response for children and families affected by the recent floods in Pakistan. Unicef said it would reach over 65,000 people, including pregnant women and children, with life-saving nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene support through the contribution. It explained that it would screen 32,500 children for malnutrition, provide treatment to 2,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition and deliver multi-micronutrient supplements to 32,500 children and 32,500 pregnant and breastfeeding women and caregivers. Furthermore, over 50,000 people would gain access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, including restoration of damaged water systems, installation of temporary toilets, and distribution of hygiene kits. “Children are always the most vulnerable in emergencies, facing the compounded threats of malnutrition and deadly waterborne diseases. This timely support from the United States enables us to deliver life-saving services and help restore dignity and hope to families who have suffered loss and displacement, as they begin the difficult journey of recovery,” the press release quoted Pernille Ironside, Unicef representative in Pakistan, as saying.",

      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday lauded the security forces for eliminating more than 14 terrorists in Khuzdar district. Earlier, a statement issued on X by state broadcaster PTV News said security forces “foiled an attempt to harass peaceful people in the Zehri area” of the district and destroyed multiple terrorist hideouts during an operation while killing over 14 Fitna al-Hindustan members and injuring over 20. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. Congratulating the security forces, Naqvi hailed the operation as a “major success”, saying that the nation was “proud of the professional capabilities and courage of the security forces”. He further said: “Security forces are determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists in Balochistan. The people of Balochistan stand with the security forces. Indian-sponsored terrorists will not be allowed to hide anywhere.” Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also said operational successes such as the above were “proof that the people of Balochistan and the forces are together grinding the nefarious designs of the country’s enemies into the dust. I am proud of the bravery of my youth and people. Long live Pakistan!” Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakistan and Balochistan. A day ago, security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the province’s Sherani district. On Wednesday, four terrorists were apprehended during an IBO in Khuzdar district.",

      "summary_orig": "Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has said that authorities are in contact with X (formerly Twitter) over the use of former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan’s account on its platform and an investigation into who has been operating it is underway. Speaking on Dawn News TV’s programme ‘Doosra Rukh with Nadir Guramani’ on Friday, Barrister Aqeel Malik said: “Investigations are underway [into who is operating PTI founder’s X account].“ “Evidence and further material will come forward, and that will disclose where the account’s links are and who is running it,” the state minister added. “At this moment, all I can say is that there is definitely an [the authorities’] engagement with X. Along with this, I believe that the legal process which is being adopted in this investigation [and] its results will also be before you very soon.” Imran was recently quizzed in prison by Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials about his “anti-state” tweets, critical remarks on foreign policy and other topics, according to a post on his official X account. Although Imran does not have access to his X account in prison, the detailed statement disclosed the five key areas of questioning and his responses. The PTI founder has repeatedly been quizzed about his social media postings, and he has previously refused to answer any questions without his lawyers present. That was also the first time that such an account of a questioning by law enforcement personnel was posted to his official X account. It may be noted that Imran does not have access to the internet in jail and his X account is operated by someone else. Last month, a petition was filed in the Islamabad High Court challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment. The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.",

      "summary_orig": "A high-level federal government delegation on Saturday signed an agreement with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) to end days of unrest in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying that “all issues have been resolved amicably”. The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between the high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Since then, rival groups since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. A day earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said it was “deeply alarmed“ by the ongoing violence in AJK, and condemned the “use of excessive force” and the communications blackout. In a post on social media platform X during the early hours of Saturday following day-long talks, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said — who was part of the government negotiating committee — said: “Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened.” “This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added. Chaudhry also shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”. Under the agreement, it was decided that first information reports (FIRs) would be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protestors”, with a judicial commission appointed where required. “Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the pact read, adding that gunshot injuries would be compensated with Rs1 million per person, while a government job would be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days. Chaudhry, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team. From the AJK government’s side, Education Minister Diwan Ali Chugtai and Local Government Minister Faisal Rathore took part in the talks, according to a copy of the signed pact shared by Chaudhry. Raja Amjad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir and Anjum Zaman Awan represented the JAAC. On September 25, a deadlock emerged between the AJK government and the JAAC over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir. Subsequently, a shutter-down strike had paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continued for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands . Conspiracies now stand buried as issues resolved amicably: PM Shehbaz Welcoming the agreement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said “all conspiracies and rumours now stand buried and issues have been resolved amicably”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported . He appreciated the members of the federal government’s negotiation committee and the JAAC for signing the pact to “settle all issues”. Terming it an achievement for Pakistan and AJK, the premier said the “restoration of peace and normalcy is a good gesture”, the report added. PM Shehbaz asserted that the government “is ever ready to resolve issues of Kashmiri brethren as public interest and service are among our top priorities”. He appealed to Kashmiris not to pay heed to rumours, affirming that the government had “always protected” their rights and will also ensure them in the future. On Thursday, PM Shehbaz had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues. ‘Pakistan, AJK & democracy wins’: Ahsan Iqbal Iqbal also welcomed the development, writing on X: “Pakistan, AJK and democracy wins.” He stressed that the people of AJK had “always stood at the frontlines of Pakistan’s national cause, and their voice carries immense weight”. Noting that the nation “saw a difficult situation emerge due to legitimate public concerns”, the planning minister commended the “wisdom of local and national leadership and the spirit of dialogue that enabled us to resolve this stand-off peacefully, without violence, without division, and with mutual respect”. He highlighted that the resolution of the issue showed that “when the government listens, and when the people engage constructively, we can find solutions together”. “The Joint Action Committee raised voice of citizens, and the government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took these voices seriously. Instead of confrontation, we chose consultation. Instead of egos, we chose empathy. We commit to work together for good governance and development in AJK,” Iqbal added.",

      "title_orig": "Trump calls on Israel to ‘stop bombing Gaza’ after Hamas ‘conditionally’ agrees to peace plan",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said early on Saturday that Israel must stop bombing Gaza immediately and that he believes Hamas is ready for peace after an earlier statement by the Palestinian resistance group. Hamas said it would agree to some of the terms in Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, including releasing hostages, but avoided addressing more vexing issues like disarmament and said it would seek further negotiations. Soon after, Trump posted Hamas’ response to his Truth Social account. Trump had earlier not specified whether the terms would be subject to negotiation, as Hamas is seeking. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas’ response. Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce offensive activity in Gaza. Notably, the resistance group did not say if it would agree to disarm and demilitarise Gaza — something Israel and the US want but Hamas has rejected before. It also did not agree to an Israeli withdrawal in stages, as opposed to the immediate, full withdrawal the group demands. A senior Hamas official told Al Jazeera that the group would not disarm before Israel’s occupation of the besieged enclave ends, comments that underscored the gap between the parties as the war approaches its two-year mark. Hamas seeks further negotiations In its statement, Hamas said it “appreciates the Arab, Islamic, and international efforts, as well as the efforts of US President Donald Trump, calling for an end to the war on the Gaza Strip, the exchange of prisoners, (and) the immediate entry of aid,” among other terms. It said it was announcing its “approval of releasing all occupation captives — both living and remains — according to the exchange formula contained in President Trump’s proposal, with the necessary field conditions for implementing the exchange.” But Hamas added: “In this context, the movement affirms its readiness to immediately enter, through the mediators, into negotiations to discuss the details.” The resistance group said it was ready “to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats) based on Palestinian national consensus and supported by Arab and Islamic backing.” Hamas has previously offered to release all hostages and to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to a different body. Earlier, Trump had given Hamas until 2200 GMT on Sunday (3am PKT on Monday) to accept his plan for peace in Gaza, warning the Palestinian resistance group faced “all hell” if it did not agree to the terms. The US leader set the deadline — which would fall at 1am on Monday in Gaza — after an official for Palestinian group told AFP earlier on Friday that the group still needed time to study the proposal to end nearly two years of devastating war in the Palestinian territory. “If this last chance agreement is not reached, all hell, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump had posted on his Truth Social platform. “Every Country has signed on! If this LAST CHANCE agreement is not reached, all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas.” The proposal , backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calls for a ceasefire, the release of hostages within 72 hours, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. That would be followed by a post-war transitional authority headed by Trump himself. Hamas was not involved in the negotiations that led to the proposal, which calls on the resistance group to disarm, a demand it has previously rejected. “Hamas is still continuing consultations regarding Trump’s plan … and has informed mediators that the consultations are ongoing and need some time,” an official had said earlier on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. On Tuesday, Trump gave Hamas “three or four days” to accept his plan, which has been welcomed by world powers, including Pakistan among Arab and Muslim nations. Mohammad Nazzal, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, had said in a statement on Friday that the “plan has points of concern, and we will announce our position on it soon”. ‘Places of death’ On the ground, Gaza’s civil defence agency — a rescue force operating under Hamas authority — reported heavy air bombardment and artillery shelling on Gaza City. It said Israeli strikes killed at least 11 people across the territory, including eight in Gaza City. AFP has contacted the Israeli military for comment. Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing swathes of the territory mean AFP cannot independently verify details or casualty figures provided by the Israeli military or the civil defence. Smoke rises from Gaza after an explosion, as seen from the Israeli side of the border on October 3. — Reuters The Israeli military is waging an air and ground offensive on the territory’s largest urban centre, from which hundreds of thousands have been forced to flee. The UN on Friday reiterated there was no safe place in Gaza and that Israel-designated zones in the south were “places of death”. “The notion of a safe zone in the south is farcical,” Unicef spokesman James Elder said from the Gaza Strip. Amnesty International condemned a “catastrophic wave of mass displacement” as Israel intensified its Gaza City offensive. The rights group said hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, many of whom had already been displaced multiple times, were being forced into “overcrowded enclaves in the south … that lack access to clean water, food, medical care, shelter and life-sustaining infrastructure”. As the war nears the two-year mark and the death toll continues to rise, protesters around the world have railed at Israel’s interception of a flotilla carrying pro-Palestinian activists and aid for Gaza. On Friday, the organisers of the Global Sumud Flotilla said its last remaining boat had been intercepted and Israel’s foreign ministry said it had deported four Italian participants. ‘Two opinions’ in Hamas As Hamas mulled Trump’s peace plan this week, a Palestinian source close to the group’s leadership told AFP on Wednesday that the Islamist movement wanted to amend some clauses, including the one on disarmament. Hamas leaders also want “international guarantees” for a full Israeli withdrawal and that no assassination attempts would be made inside or outside Gaza, the source added. Another source familiar with the negotiations told AFP that the group was split over Trump’s plan. Structurally, the group’s leadership is divided between officials based in the Gaza Strip and those abroad, particularly in Qatar. Much of Hamas’s leadership has also been wiped out in Israeli attacks throughout the conflict. The source told AFP that “the first [opinion] supports unconditional approval, as the priority is a ceasefire under Trump’s guarantees, with mediators ensuring Israel implements the plan”. “The second has serious reservations regarding key clauses… They favour conditional approval with clarifications reflecting Hamas’s and the resistance factions’ demands,” the source added. Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said “ultimately it’s not just about convincing Hamas leadership in Doha, but also the leadership in Gaza, as well as Hamas members and fighters in Gaza”. “Additionally, Hamas must then be able to convince other factions in Gaza,” he added. The conflict was triggered by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 66,288 Palestinians, according to health ministry figures in the Hamas-run territory that the United Nations considers reliable. Their data does not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but indicates that more than half of the dead are women and children.",

      "summary_orig": "• Maryam refuses to apologise, wants PPP to eat its words for ‘ridiculing’ Punjab in times of disaster • PPP leaders question her mandate, see no point in ‘continuing alliance’ LAHORE: As Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst against it on flood and canal issues, the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47. “Maryam Nawaz will never apologise (to the PPP) for raising her voice for Punjab. Rather, those (PPP leaders) who ridiculed Punjab in times of disaster should apologise,” the Punjab CM said while addressing the inauguration ceremony of the e-bus project in Lahore. The war of words between the two sides, which began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as the Punjab chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP, the ruling party in Sindh, had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe. On Wednesday, PPP and PML-N leaders met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces and the PPP leadership. “I want to remind (President) Asif Zardari and (PPP Chairman) Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that I was deeply hurt when they held three press conferences in a single day mocking Punjab and spreading lies during the flood crisis here,” Maryam said, adding that she had remained quiet about Bilawal’s remarks because she did not want to get into a fight, as she was serving the people of Punjab “24 hours a day and did not have the time”. She said Punjab wanted to build its own canals from its own resou­rces, but approval was denied at the CCI, and later protests were staged against Punjab. “If this isn’t provincialism, then what is?” she asked. The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. “That water is the right of Punjab’s farmers, but it was politicised. Let me make it very clear… Whenever Punjab is targeted, there will be a response and a strong one. Think 100 times before talking negatively about Punjab,” she said. Further targeting the PPP, she said when floods swept through Pun­jab, the people of one province (PPP in Sindh) not only wrongly criticised the PML-N government in Punjab, but also rubbed salt into the wounds. “If there is any issue in any province, do we level false allegations at press conferences? Do we spread lies? What we do is help them.” Giving an example of how she had offered help to her party’s arch-rival during floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ms Nawaz said: “I called KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and offered him Punjab’s assistance during the floods despite him being a political opponent.” BISP vs flood survivors data On the Benazir Income Support Pro­­gramme , she said she did not wa­­nt the data of poor people but only that of the people affected by floods. The Punjab CM also defended a controversial YouTuber who had made derogatory remarks about the people of Sindh over the canal issue . “When someone (the YouTuber) apologises, you forgive them, right? But these people (PPP leaders) made fun of him. Still, I remained silent. However, I will not let this happen to another person in Punjab,” the PML-N leader warned. False mandate, venomous speeches Responding to Maryam Nawaz’s diatribe, PPP leader Sassui Palijo said: “Maryam Nawaz does not have a public mandate; rather, she is doing politics on charity seats. Without winning even a single genuine seat, Maryam Nawaz has been given the entire province. The people didn’t even find her worthy of seven seats, yet she was gifted a whole province. Where was your honour when you accepted a province on a charity mandate?” Ms Palijo further said Maryam had no moral grounds to speak aga­inst smaller provinces, particularly Sindh. “Maryam’s domicile may be powerful, but in reality she is nothing more than a product of Form 47.” She said false mandates and venomous statements cannot alter reality. “If there is ever a transparent election, Maryam Nawaz will not even be visible in the country’s politics. Her speeches filled with ethnic prejudice and animosity against smaller provinces have become a habit. But politics rooted in hate and lies never lasts long,” the PPP leader said, adding that the people of Sindh would never allow anti-Sindh dams or canals to be built. Another PPP leader, Maula Bakh­­sh Chandio, said Maryam, after ousting her father Nawaz Sharif from politics, had now taken the driving seat and was targeting the PPP. “This alliance (of PML-N and PPP) cannot continue any more,” he said.

      "title_orig": "US only hope for peace in Gaza, Dar tells NA",
      "summary_orig": "• Foreign minister distances Islamabad from 20-point plan by White House; insists Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remains ‘unchanged’ • Says several states eyeing Saudi-style defence pacts; claims controversial ‘speechwriter’ was not part of ‘official UN team’ • Return of flotilla activists being negotiated through ‘European country’ in absence of ties with Tel Aviv ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the United States was now “the only hope” after the United Nations, European Union and Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) had failed to secure peace in Gaza. Making a policy statement in the National Assembly, Mr Dar again distanced the government from US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza “peace plan” , saying it differed from a draft jointly prepared by eight Muslim countries and shared with Washington. He said the prime minister’s initial statement welcoming the plan was issued while in transit, while he was “unaware of the changes”. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine is what was the policy of the Quaid-i-Azam. There was no change, there is no change and there will be no change in it,” he assured the House. Reiterating the country’s consistent and principled position, he said that the two-state solution was the only viable path to a just and lasting peace, through the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Mr Dar also disclosed that several Arab and non-Arab countries had exp­ressed interest in concluding security agreements with Pakistan, along the lines of the recent ‘strategic mutual defence’ pact with Saudi Arabia . He cautioned, however, that decisions on such requests would “take some time”. He said several foreign ministers had raised the proposal with him on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He likened multiple countries signing bilateral pacts with Pakistan to the formation of an “eastern Nato”, without explaining how separate arrangements could evolve into a multilateral bloc. “It is my faith that Pakistan will one day lead the Islamic ummah,” he said. “Allah Almighty has made you a nuclear and missile power and now you are to become an economic power,” adding that this would require unity. He said talks on the Saudi agreement had been underway for about one and a half years, beginning during the PDM government. “We are fortunate to have been included among the defenders of Haramain Sharifain,” he remarked. He also read out the joint statement, issued alongside seven other Muslim countries following consultations in New York, which called for unrestricted humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of Palestinians, full Israeli withdrawal, reconstruction of Gaza and a credible path to a two-state peace with Gaza fully integrated with the West Bank. He said the focus would remain on these objectives, including holding Israel accountable, and noted that the Pales­tinian Authority had accepted the plan. Responding to opposition questions about British-Pakistani activist Shama Junejo’s presence at UN-related events in New York, Mr Dar clarified she was not part of the official government delegation. “Her involvement was confined to civil society interactions and did not reflect state policy,” he said. Flotilla Mr Dar also briefed the House on Pakistanis aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla seized by Israeli forces, condemning the interception as a violation of international maritime law and humanitarian principles. He said Islamabad was pursuing diplomatic channels, including through an “influential European country”, to secure their safe return. Israel on Friday deported four Italian activists, the first of hundreds detained from the aid flotilla, shortly after the interception of the group’s final boat brought an end to its mission. The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail last month, ferrying politicians and activists including former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg towards Gaza. The Israeli navy began intercepting the boats on Wednesday, and an Israeli official said the following day that boats with more than 400 people on board had been prevented from reaching the Palestinian territory. The military said on Friday that the navy had stopped all 42 of the fleet’s vessels “in an operation that lasted approximately 12 hours”, and transferred flotilla members to Israel’s Ashdod Port for processing by police. Israel’s foreign ministry said it deported four Italian activists who were aboard the flotilla, adding that “the rest are in the process of being deported”. Videos circulating on social media showed far-right Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunting activists from the Global Sumud Flotilla, as they were in Israeli custody. Videos showed him pointing at the detained activists, and calling them “terrorists.” The International Committee to Break the Siege on Gaza condemned his actions, saying that it was not surprising “for the criminals of genocide to send their minister swaggering before activists from 50 countries around the world, surrounded by his guards”. PM asked to apologise Earlier, PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser demanded that the prime minister apologise for “hurting public sentiments” on Palestine, saying no decision would be acceptable without the will of the Palestinian people. He said Haramain Sharifain were central to Pakistanis’ beliefs and that the nation would stand united for their defence. “If anyone dares to cast an evil eye towards the Haramain, the entire Pakistani nation will stand united in their defence,” he said. He criticised the government for failing to take parliament into confidence on key national decisions. The PTI leader stated that Mr Dar’s clarification regarding Shama Junejo had raised further questions. He said the foreign minister had admitted she was the prime minister’s speechwriter and therefore responsibility rested with the premier. Commenting on the recent “Trump peace deal”, Mr Qaiser said no Muslim leader had endorsed the agreement, yet Pakistan’s prime minister, “in a display of sycophancy”, acknowledged an incomplete agreement through a tweet. “If the deal was so good, why did the Palestinians reject it?” he asked.

      "summary_en": "• Foreign minister distances Islamabad from 20-point plan by White House; insists Pakistan’s policy on Palestine remains ‘unchanged’ • Says several states eyeing Saudi-style defence pacts; claims controversial ‘speechwriter’ was not part of ‘official UN team’ • Return of flotilla activists being negotiated through ‘European country’ in absence of ties with Tel Aviv ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the United States was now “the only hope” after the United Nations, European Union and Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) had failed to secure peace in Gaza. Making a policy statement in the National Assembly, Mr Dar again distanced the government from US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza “peace plan” , saying it differed from a draft jointly prepared by eight Muslim countries and shared with Washington. He said the prime minister’s initial statement welcoming the plan was issued while in transit, while he was “unaware of the changes”. “Pakistan’s policy on Palestine is what was the policy of the Quaid-i-Azam. There was no change, there is no change and there will be no change in it,” he assured the House. Reiterating the country’s consistent and principled position, he said that the two-state solution was the only viable path to a just and lasting peace, through the establishment of a contiguous, independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Mr Dar also disclosed that several Arab and non-Arab countries had exp­ressed interest in concluding security agreements with Pakistan, along the lines of the recent ‘strategic mutual defence’ pact with Saudi Arabia . He cautioned, however, that decisions on such requests would “take some time”. He said several foreign ministers had raised the proposal with him on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He likened multiple countries signing bilateral pacts with Pakistan to the formation of an “eastern Nato”, without explaining how separate arrangements could evolve into a multilateral bloc. “It is my faith that Pakistan will one day lead the Islamic ummah,” he said. “Allah Almighty has made you a nuclear and missile power and now you are to become an economic power,” adding that this would require unity. He said talks on the Saudi agreement had been underway for about one and a half years, beginning during the PDM government. “We are fortunate to have been included among the defenders of Haramain Sharifain,” he remarked. He also read out the joint statement, issued alongside seven other Muslim countries following consultations in New York, which called for unrestricted humanitarian aid to Gaza, no displacement of Palestinians, full Israeli withdrawal, reconstruction of Gaza and a credible path to a two-state peace with Gaza fully integrated with the West Bank. He said the focus would remain on these objectives, including holding Israel accountable, and noted that the Pales­tinian Authority had accepted the plan. Responding to opposition questions about British-Pakistani activist Shama Junejo’s presence at UN-related events in New York, Mr Dar clarified she was not part of the official government delegation. “Her involvement was confined to civil society interactions and did not reflect state policy,” he said. Flotilla Mr Dar also briefed the House on Pakistanis aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla seized by Israeli forces, condemning the interception as a violation of international maritime law and humanitarian principles. He said Islamabad was pursuing diplomatic channels, including through an “influential European country”, to secure their safe return. Israel on Friday deported four Italian activists, the first of hundreds detained from the aid flotilla, shortly after the interception of the group’s final boat brought an end to its mission. The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail last month, ferrying politicians and activists including former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg towards Gaza. The Israeli navy began intercepting the boats on Wednesday, and an Israeli official said the following day that boats with more than 400 people on board had been prevented from reaching the Palestinian territory. The military said on Friday that the navy had stopped all 42 of the fleet’s vessels “in an operation that lasted approximately 12 hours”, and transferred flotilla members to Israel’s Ashdod Port for processing by police. Israel’s foreign ministry said it deported four Italian activists who were aboard the flotilla, adding that “the rest are in the process of being deported”. Videos circulating on social media showed far-right Israeli Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir taunting activists from the Global Sumud Flotilla, as they were in Israeli custody. Videos showed him pointing at the detained activists, and calling them “terrorists.” The International Committee to Break the Siege on Gaza condemned his actions, saying that it was not surprising “for the criminals of genocide to send their minister swaggering before activists from 50 countries around the world, surrounded by his guards”. PM asked to apologise Earlier, PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser demanded that the prime minister apologise for “hurting public sentiments” on Palestine, saying no decision would be acceptable without the will of the Palestinian people. He said Haramain Sharifain were central to Pakistanis’ beliefs and that the nation would stand united for their defence. “If anyone dares to cast an evil eye towards the Haramain, the entire Pakistani nation will stand united in their defence,” he said. He criticised the government for failing to take parliament into confidence on key national decisions. The PTI leader stated that Mr Dar’s clarification regarding Shama Junejo had raised further questions. He said the foreign minister had admitted she was the prime minister’s speechwriter and therefore responsibility rested with the premier. Commenting on the recent “Trump peace deal”, Mr Qaiser said no Muslim leader had endorsed the agreement, yet Pakistan’s prime minister, “in a display of sycophancy”, acknowledged an incomplete agreement through a tweet. “If the deal was so good, why did the Palestinians reject it?” he asked. He noted that over 60,000 innocent Pale­stinians had been martyred in a brutal campaign of genocide, the likes of which the world had rarely witnessed. Mr Qaiser categorically stated that Pakistan’s 250 million people would never accept recognition of Israel. “Any peace accord is incomplete without the recognition of an independent Palestinian state, with Al-Quds as its capital,” he asserted.
