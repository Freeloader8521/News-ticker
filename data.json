      "title_orig": "Ukraine war talks to resume in Geneva as US signals progress",
      "summary_orig": "Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were to resume a second round of peace talks in Geneva on Wednesday, as Washington’s top envoy signaled optimism in its bid to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II. The talks are the latest diplomatic bid to halt the fighting, which has killed hundreds of thousands, forced millions to flee, and decimated much of eastern and southern Ukraine. The United States has been pushing for an end to the nearly four-year war, but has failed to broker a compromise between Moscow and Kyiv on the key issue of territory. Two previous rounds of negotiations between the two sides in Abu Dhabi failed to yield a breakthrough. But US envoy Steve Witkoff, representing the Trump administration at the talks, said President Donald Trump’s diplomatic efforts had made strides in Washington’s bid to end the conflict. “President Trump’s success in bringing both sides of this war together has brought about meaningful progress,” he wrote on X, without elaborating. “Both parties agreed to update their respective leaders and continue working towards a deal.” The latest talks “lasted six hours” and “were very tense”, a source close to the Russian delegation told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address he was ready “to move quickly towards a worthy agreement to end the war”, but questioned whether Russia was serious about peace. “What do they want?” he added, accusing them of prioritising missile strikes over “real diplomacy”. Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the ensuing conflict resulting in a tidal wave of destruction that has left entire cities in ruins. Breakthrough hopes low For the Geneva talks, the Kremlin reinstated nationalist hawk and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky as its lead negotiator. Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov was leading Kyiv’s side and said negotiations would continue Wednesday. He thanked Washington for its mediation and said he informed European allies of the outcomes from the first round of talks, which he said had focused on “practical issues and the mechanics of possible solutions” to the conflict. “I have concluded a separate meeting with representatives of the United States and European partners — France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy and Switzerland,” he wrote on Telegram. “We discussed the results of today’s round of negotiations and aligned our approaches on further steps.” Zelensky has repeatedly said his country is being asked to make disproportionate compromises compared to Russia. Trump put pressure on Ukraine on Monday to make a deal, saying they “better come to the table, fast”. Zelensky told Axios on Tuesday it was “not fair” that Trump kept calling on Ukraine to broker a deal, adding that lasting peace would not be achieved if “victory” was just handed to Russia. “I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision,” Zelensky said. Hopes for a breakthrough remain low. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had told journalists to expect no major news from the first day of talks. ‘Disregards peace efforts’ Even before talks were underway, Ukraine had accused Russia of undermining peace efforts by launching 29 missiles and 396 drones in attacks overnight into Tuesday that authorities said killed four people and cut power to tens of thousands in southern Ukraine. Late Tuesday, Ukraine’s general staff said Russia had fired 28 missiles and 109 guided aerial bombs at its territory since the beginning of the day. “The extent to which Russia disregards peace efforts: a massive missile and drone strike against Ukraine right before the next round of talks in Geneva,” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga wrote on social media. Russia, meanwhile accused Ukraine of launching more than 150 drones overnight into Tuesday, mainly over southern regions and the Crimean peninsula — occupied by the Kremlin in 2014. Russia occupies around one-fifth of Ukraine — including the Crimean peninsula it seized in 2014 — and areas that Moscow-backed separatists had taken prior to the 2022 invasion. It is pushing for full control of Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region as part of any deal, and has threatened to take it by force if talks fail. But Kyiv has rejected this deeply unpopular demand, which would be politically and militarily fraught, and signalled it will not sign a deal without security guarantees that deter Russia from invading again. Russia has been slowly seizing territory across the sprawling front line for months. But its wartime economic worries are mounting, with growth stagnating and a ballooning budget deficit as sanction-hit oil revenues drop to a five-year low.",

      "summary_orig": "DEMONSTRATORS protest in front of New York’s Trump Tower.—Reuters • Hillary accuses Trump of orchestrating ‘cover-up’ • Los Angeles mayor calls for 2028 Olympics chief to resign • Hyatt boss steps down SANTA FE: Lawmakers in the US state of New Mexico passed legislation on Monday to launch the “first full investigation” into what happened at Zorro Ranch, where the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is accused of trafficking and sexually assaulting girls and women. A bipartisan committee will seek testimony from survivors of alleged sexual abuse at the ranch, located about 50 kilometres south of Santa Fe, the state capital. Legislators have urged local residents to testify. Meanwhile, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton accused President Trump of orchestrating a ‘cover-up’ over the Epstein files. “Get the files out. They’re slow-walking it,” the former first lady said in an interview with the BBC . In other developments, the mayor of Los Angeles called upon Casey Wasserman, the chief organiser of the 2028 Olympics committee, to resign after his name figured in the Epstein files. Thomas Pritzker, the chairman of the Hyatt chain of hotels, said he had decided to leave his position after emails revealing his ties to Epstein came to light. Truth commission The “truth commission” named by New Mexico, comprising four lawmakers, seeks to identify ranch guests and state officials who may have known what was going on at the 7,600-acre property, or taken part in alleged sexual abuse in its hacienda-style mansion and guest houses. The Democratic-led investigation adds to political pressure to uncover Epstein’s crimes that has become a major challenge for President Donald Trump, weeks after the Justice Department released millions of Epstein-related files that shed new light on activities at the ranch. The files reveal ties between Epstein and two former Democratic governors and an attorney general of New Mexico. The committee started its work on Tuesday, and will deliver interim findings in July. “He was basically doing anything he wanted in this state without any accountability whatsoever,” said lawmaker Andrea Romero, a Democrat.Testimony to the committee could be used for future prosecutions, she said. Victim advocates applauded the move, saying Zorro Ranch had been overlooked by federal investigations that focused on Epstein’s Caribbean island and New York townhouse. “Many of the survivors had experiences in New Mexico, and as we’ve learned, you know, there were local politicians and other people that were aware of what was happening in New Mexico,” said attorney Sigrid McCawley, whose law firm has represented hundreds of Epstein survivors. Hillary Clinton slams ‘cover-up’ “Get the files out. They are slow-walking it,” Clinton, who is due to testify before a Congressional committee on the issue next week, told the BBC in Berlin. Former president Bill Clinton features regularly in the files, but no evidence has come to light implicating either of the two in criminal activity. The couple has been ordered to give closed-door depositions before the House Oversight Committee, which is probing the deceased financier’s connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled. “We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public,” Hillary Clinton told the BBC . “I just want it to be fair,” she said. “I want everybody treated the same way.” Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has called on Casey Wasserman, whose name was also mentioned in the Epstein files, to step down as chief organiser of the 2028 Summer Olympics. Bass told CNN it was “unfortunate” the Olympic organisers were supporting Wasserman after revelations he exchanged flirtatious emails with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. He said: “My opinion is that he should step down. That’s not the opinion of the board.” She said that “we need to look at the leadership” of LA28. Hyatt CEO resigns The executive chairman of the Hyatt hotel chain also stepped down after emails revealing his ties to Jeffrey Epstein came to light.

Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka restrained police from arresting the PTI founder in the said cases and also extended the pre-arrest bail of Bushra Bibi in one related matter. The hearing was adjourned till Feb 18. During the proceedings, the PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were represented by their legal team. However, despite earlier directions, the former prime minister could not be produced before the court through a video link. Owing to his absence and the unavailability of his counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, arguments on the acquittal application could not be advanced. The court subsequently directed that the PTI fou­nder must appear at the next hearing either personally or via video link. The cases against the PTI founder stem from the May 9 incidents and incl­ude charges of attempted murder, submission of fake receipts and other offences. A separate case has also been registered against Bushra Bibi for allegedly submitting fake receipts. Also, Additional Distr­ict and Sessions Judge Amir Zia extended the interim bail of Bushra Bibi in a case related to the November 26 protest. Meanwhile, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra deferred indictment proceedings in the Sangjani Jalsa case due to the non-appearance of the accused PTI lawmakers. Published in Dawn, February 18th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Punjab officials are tight-lipped on reports that claim the provincial government has acquired a Gulfstream aircraft for “VIP transport role”. Meanwhile, the alleged move continues to draw criticism. On Monday, it was claimed by an X account, The Stratcom Bureau — which mainly shares defence- and security-relates news — that the “government of Punjab, Pakistan has acquired a new, 2019-manufactured Gulfstream GVII-G500 aircraft for their VIP transport role”. In a separate post by the same account, it was claimed that “the registration number of the luxury plane is N144S” and its “old Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) registration would be changed to Pakistani registration soon”. The post also said that the approximate asking price for the aircraft was $38 million to $42m. Meanwhile, the US FAA registry shows that the aircraft is currently owned by TVPX Aircraft Solutions Inc. Trustee, which, as per its website, commonly acts as the registered owner for aircraft trusts, facilitating the buying, selling, and leasing of planes, particularly for non-US citizens or for privacy reasons. According to flight tracking service Flight Radar, the aircraft has been flying between various airports in Punjab since at least February 12. Dawn reached out to several officials for a confirmation of the purchase’s claims, but they remained tight-lipped on the matter. Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman and Additional Chief Secretary Ahmad Raza Sarwar did not respond to calls and text messages to clarify the Punjab government’s position. Punjab Additional Secretary (Welfare) Waseem Hamid, however, denied the claims of the aircraft’s purchase before abruptly disconnecting the call. Dawn also tried to contact Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, but she, too, did not respond to any calls or the query sent to her as a text message. Amid this silence by the officials, the reported purchase of the aircraft continues to draw criticism, including by former finance minister Miftah Ismail and ex-Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair. Sharing the Stratcom Bureau’s post on X, Miftah juxtaposed the reported purchase of the aircraft with the recent hike in petroleum prices by the government. “So while Pakistanis are supposed to tighten our belts and sacrifice, Punjab’s entitled VIPs are fastening their seatbelts for taking off in luxury private jets,” he said. Similarly, Zubair posted on X: “Such a beautiful plane worth more than 1,000 crore, which has been bought by the Punjab govt for the use of its CM and party’s elite.” He questioned whether a nation facing economic difficulties, with 45 per cent of the people living below the poverty line and amid record unemployment — afford this luxury. “The Punjab government may issue a denial if not true,” he said about the claims of the aircraft’s purchase.",

The post also said that the approximate asking price for the aircraft was $38 million to $42m. Meanwhile, the US FAA registry shows that the aircraft is currently owned by TVPX Aircraft Solutions Inc. Trustee, which, as per its website, commonly acts as the registered owner for aircraft trusts, facilitating the buying, selling, and leasing of planes, particularly for non-US citizens or for privacy reasons. According to flight tracking service Flight Radar, the aircraft has been flying between various airports in Punjab since at least February 12. Dawn reached out to several officials for a confirmation of the purchase’s claims, but they remained tight-lipped on the matter. Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman and Additional Chief Secretary Ahmad Raza Sarwar did not respond to calls and text messages to clarify the Punjab government’s position. Punjab Additional Secretary (Welfare) Waseem Hamid, however, denied the claims of the aircraft’s purchase before abruptly disconnecting the call. Dawn also tried to contact Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, but she, too, did not respond to any calls or the query sent to her as a text message. Amid this silence by the officials, the reported purchase of the aircraft continues to draw criticism, including by former finance minister Miftah Ismail and ex-Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair. Sharing the Stratcom Bureau’s post on X, Miftah juxtaposed the reported purchase of the aircraft with the recent hike in petroleum prices by the government. “So while Pakistanis are supposed to tighten our belts and sacrifice, Punjab’s entitled VIPs are fastening their seatbelts for taking off in luxury private jets,” he said. Similarly, Zubair posted on X: “Such a beautiful plane worth more than 1,000 crore, which has been bought by the Punjab govt for the use of its CM and party’s elite.” He questioned whether a nation facing economic difficulties, with 45 per cent of the people living below the poverty line and amid record unemployment — afford this luxury. “The Punjab government may issue a denial if not true,” he said about the claims of the aircraft’s purchase.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and police to ensure the reopening of roads blocked by PTI supporters and protesters in recent days. The protesting PTI workers have blocked KP’s entry and exit points for the past five days , demanding that the federal government move incarcerated party founder Imran Khan from jail to a hospital for medical treatment . A two-member bench headed by Justice Ijaz Anwar and including Justice Farah Jamshed took up the set of petitions filed by MPA Sobia Shahid, lawyer Tariq Afghan, Swabi resident Yousaf Ali and Shaoor Khan. Upon the bench summoning them, KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed, Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah and Advocate General Shah Faisal Utmankhel appeared in court. At the outset of the hearing, Justice Anwar inquired about how many days it had been since the roads were blocked. “The roads have been shut for the past three days. Initially, 14 points were blocked, and now protests are underway at six points,” the KP IG replied. Justice Anwar wondered whether shutting roads was not a violation of the law, pointing out that lawyers for six cases were unable to reach the PHC from Islamabad. He remarked, “Such is the security situation in the province that even today, 14 have been martyred. These are the conditions, but despite this, there are protests and roads are closed.” The judge highlighted that the laws guaranteed citizens the right to freedom of movement, but they were still “facing difficulties”. He inquired about the number of first information reports (FIR) registered over the road blockades. “The traffic situation in Peshawar is the worst in the entire country. In fact, there is no traffic system in this province,” Justice Anwar observed, at which IG Hameed expressed his strong agreement. “We are now trying to streamline this, and are initiating e-challans,” the police chief assured the court. Justice Anwar quipped, “When the police want to take action against someone, they do. When they do not want to, then this happens.” At one point during the hearing, Justice Anwar said it was “unfortunate that the ruling party here is protesting [and] hurting the province’s people”. Utmankhel assured the bench that “no one would defend any wrong act.” IG Hameed sought two days for the police to “fix the situation”, but Justice Anwar declined the request, ordering that the roads be opened today. “Begin today, and do not let anyone block the roads,” he stressed. “The entire country is open, but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is shut. This is against our own people.” “The motorway should not be closed off under any circumstances,” he added, noting that people could not leave their houses due to the blocked routes. Protesters had blocked the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway (M-1) at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway. “Reopen the roads and ensure the same,” Justice Anwar ordered, telling the KP IG and the chief secretary to submit their reports regarding the matter by tomorrow. Subsequently, the bench adjourned the hearing till Wednesday. Following the court directives, the provincial police chief issued instructions for all regional and district police officers for reopening the roads, a statement by KP police said. “Instructions have been issued to start the process of reopening the blocked roads across the province on the PHC’s directives,” the statement read. The closure of M-1 — the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country — has put the GT Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway. Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment. The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed. Roads reopen in DI Khan Hours after the court’s directives, District Police Officer (DPO) Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmed said that all highways in Dera Ismail Khan had been cleared and traffic flow had been restored. The protesters would remain at certain points “symbolically”, they would not obstruct vehicular movement, he said while speaking to the media. The reopened road links include the Dera–Darya Khan bridge that connects KP with Punjab. DPO Ahmed said that its closure had caused significant hardship for the public, particularly daily commuters, patients and members of the business community. “Public convenience is our priority, and traffic has now been fully restored,” he said, adding that police personnel had been deployed at key locations to maintain law and order. KP CM reacts Reacting to the developments regarding sit-ins in KP, Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said in a post on social media platform X that PTI workers, who had been staging a sit-in of their own accord, “have just one demand: the best treatment for Imran Khan sahib in the presence of his personal physicians and family members”. He added: “In my opinion, the respected court should also enquire about the issue before issuing an order.” The CM went on to allege that “the KP IG’s response to the court directives is clear proof that the khaki uniform’s directives are behind the black uniform”. He added that police IGs were representatives of the Centre. “When top police officials, brought to a terrorism-affected province from outside, and the province’s chief executive are brought face-to-face, in which direction are the conditions being pushed?” CM Afridi said the PTI did not want to politicise the matter of Imran’s health and “we … have been patient despite immense difficulties”.

Justice Anwar wondered whether shutting roads was not a violation of the law, pointing out that lawyers for six cases were unable to reach the PHC from Islamabad. He remarked, “Such is the security situation in the province that even today, 14 have been martyred. These are the conditions, but despite this, there are protests and roads are closed.” The judge highlighted that the laws guaranteed citizens the right to freedom of movement, but they were still “facing difficulties”. He inquired about the number of first information reports (FIR) registered over the road blockades. “The traffic situation in Peshawar is the worst in the entire country. In fact, there is no traffic system in this province,” Justice Anwar observed, at which IG Hameed expressed his strong agreement. “We are now trying to streamline this, and are initiating e-challans,” the police chief assured the court. Justice Anwar quipped, “When the police want to take action against someone, they do. When they do not want to, then this happens.” At one point during the hearing, Justice Anwar said it was “unfortunate that the ruling party here is protesting [and] hurting the province’s people”. Utmankhel assured the bench that “no one would defend any wrong act.” IG Hameed sought two days for the police to “fix the situation”, but Justice Anwar declined the request, ordering that the roads be opened today. “Begin today, and do not let anyone block the roads,” he stressed. “The entire country is open, but Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is shut. This is against our own people.” “The motorway should not be closed off under any circumstances,” he added, noting that people could not leave their houses due to the blocked routes. Protesters had blocked the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway (M-1) at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway. “Reopen the roads and ensure the same,” Justice Anwar ordered, telling the KP IG and the chief secretary to submit their reports regarding the matter by tomorrow. Subsequently, the bench adjourned the hearing till Wednesday. Following the court directives, the provincial police chief issued instructions for all regional and district police officers for reopening the roads, a statement by KP police said. “Instructions have been issued to start the process of reopening the blocked roads across the province on the PHC’s directives,” the statement read. The closure of M-1 — the main artery connecting Peshawar with the rest of the country — has put the GT Road, the other major road, under immense strain as the neglected highway is unable to cater to the traffic diverted from the motorway. Also, the GT Road is facing closures by PTI activists, causing massive inconvenience to people travelling to attend urgent business meetings and exams, take international flights from Islamabad airport and seek treatment. The businessmen, whose supplies have got stuck along the road, are also distressed. Roads reopen in DI Khan Hours after the court’s directives, District Police Officer (DPO) Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmed said that all highways in Dera Ismail Khan had been cleared and traffic flow had been restored. The protesters would remain at certain points “symbolically”, they would not obstruct vehicular movement, he said while speaking to the media. The reopened road links include the Dera–Darya Khan bridge that connects KP with Punjab. DPO Ahmed said that its closure had caused significant hardship for the public, particularly daily commuters, patients and members of the business community. “Public convenience is our priority, and traffic has now been fully restored,” he said, adding that police personnel had been deployed at key locations to maintain law and order. KP CM reacts Reacting to the developments regarding sit-ins in KP, Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said in a post on social media platform X that PTI workers, who had been staging a sit-in of their own accord, “have just one demand: the best treatment for Imran Khan sahib in the presence of his personal physicians and family members”. He added: “In my opinion, the respected court should also enquire about the issue before issuing an order.” The CM went on to allege that “the KP IG’s response to the court directives is clear proof that the khaki uniform’s directives are behind the black uniform”. He added that police IGs were representatives of the Centre. “When top police officials, brought to a terrorism-affected province from outside, and the province’s chief executive are brought face-to-face, in which direction are the conditions being pushed?” CM Afridi said the PTI did not want to politicise the matter of Imran’s health and “we … have been patient despite immense difficulties”.

      "title_orig": "Imran’s sisters, TTAP reject Naqvi’s account of events surrounding PTI founder’s medical examination",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), as well as incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters, rejected on Tuesday an account detailed by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi regarding the former prime minister’s medical examination. The TTAP particularly accused Naqvi of attempting to “distort” facts to “cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the former prime minister. The allegations came in response to a press conference by Naqvi earlier in the day, who asserted that the government did not want to “politicise” the matter of PTI founder Imran Khan’s health and blamed the opposition for doing the same. The opposition, PTI and Imran’s family have voiced concerns over the former prime minister’s health after his eye ailment came to light late in January. Addressing the media in Lahore, Naqvi referred to the recent medical report prepared by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday. “The medical report also came forward yesterday and everything is clear as per it. Neither we nor the government want to politicise this,” he said, adding that there were certain “requests” which the authorities allowed but were not suitable to publicise at the moment. “Putting up such a show is extremely inappropriate, especially misleading people,” the minister said. “Still, we picked our best government and private doctors because it had been three days and the checkup had not taken place,” he insisted. Naqvi said he then invited PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan to reach Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday to witness Imran’s checkup but the former refused, citing party consultations. Detailing the communication between the authorities and the opposition, Naqvi said Gohar was given the time of 2:30pm. “We kept on waiting for an hour but Gohar sahib replied in the negative, that he has consulted with his party and would not be able to come.” “Our intention was that the checkup be performed in front of everyone,” he asserted, adding that the doctors were at the Adiala jail for about 1.25-1.5 hours for the examination. Naqvi stated that Gohar, along with the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders — Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — and their preferred doctors, was then invited to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad. There, the doctors who examined Imran briefed the opposition leaders as well as spoke on the phone to the “two doctors” named by the PTI, with each conversation lasting for about 45 minutes. “They asked each and everything,” Naqvi said about the PTI-recommended doctors. “Excellent. This is the best treatment. Even if we had to provide treatment, we would have done the same,” he quoted the doctors as saying. According to Naqvi, the opposition representatives also expressed satisfaction over the treatment and said they would inform their supporters about it. Asked about former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s claims that Naqvi made unmatched efforts for Imran’s release, the minister said, “One thing, which is not new, is that I have believed from the first day that dialogue is the solution to everything. “This is not my personal opinion; the prime minister has also said what I say, and we are following those instructions. […] If you ask about my personal view, I always say talks are the [answer],” he said. Responding to another question, he said there were “sensible people” in every party and if they had been listened to, the “PTI would not have been in the current situation, nor would have done the May 9 things”. On whether any action was being taken against the former Adiala jail superintendent whom the PTI holds responsible for aggravating Imran’s health issue, Naqvi stated: “We will check with the Punjab government what they are doing on it. But they are on it.” ‘Politicians onboard but Aleema vetoed everything’ However, the minister claimed, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum told the PTI that the “issue would die down” if the opposition accepted the government’s arrangements. “The medical checkup could not take place for three days just because of her. On one hand, they claim to have great empathy, relation and everything. On the other hand, politics has been done to the utmost over this.” The interior minister then questioned why roads were being blocked despite all the steps taken for Imran’s treatment. “If your intention was good, then you would have agreed on the first day. Almost all political leaders used to be on board but Aleema Khan sahiba vetoed them. She used to reject everything,” Naqvi said. “The problem is they want to cash this matter,” he contended. During his media talk, Naqvi recalled how the issue of Imran’s eye ailment came to light after the government confirmed that the PTI founder was taken to Pims for a minor procedure. He noted that the treatment was merely an injection that needed to be administered. The minister pointed out that “as a precaution, so there are no germs”, Imran was taken to the hospital, even though doctors suggested it could be done in jail. “I will tell you very clearly that when any prisoner needs treatment, it is our duty,” he affirmed, questioning whether all thousands of prisoners were accorded the same facilities as Imran was being provided. The interior minister said he believed that journalists should be provided with a tour of prisons so they could witness the facilities available there. Naqvi quipped that if the aim was political vendetta, then the first step would be to adopt a strict demeanour and restrict their facilities to what is provided to an ordinary prisoner as per the jail manual. “If we wanted to exact political revenge, the first step would be to [tighten] him,” he said. On the topic of the ongoing road blockades due to PTI protests, the minister said: “Our duty is to tell people to be aware of whatever cells in your party that are doing this; they are enemies of your people that have different objectives and want to do their own politics. “[…] It is now clear to me about at least some individuals that they are more worried about their politics than his (Imran’s) health.” The interior minister affirmed that the government would ensure the implementation of the recent Peshawar High Court (PHC) order that has directed the KP government and its police to reopen the roads. Demand for 1-week hospital admission Recalling previous contacts between the government and the opposition with the mediation of NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Naqvi asserted: “We made one thing very clear that in the matter of treatment, we will provide whatever facility is available to any incarcerated person as per the Constitution and the law.” He stated that the government had sought the name of a “non-political” eye specialist for examining Imran, but the other side refused and insisted on a family member accompanying the doctor, which was also agreed to. “I am saying all this as it is on record and you can ask the PTI leaders about this,” the minister affirmed. He further said that the name of Kasim, who he said was a cousin, was also given by the party to come along, which was allowed. “When both things had taken place, they said ‘no, not like this, you must admit him to a hospital for a week and we will not accept anything else’,” Naqvi claimed. The minister said the authorities would “100 per cent” have Imran hospitalised for “even two weeks” given that the doctors recommended it. “But if the doctors do not recommend, then how can we have him admitted?” he asked. “It is not possible that just on your recommendation we admit him to hospital for one week.” Separately, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry posted on social media platform X that Imran would be administered an injection in the next few days, and a second injection would be administered after a month. The minister said this was expected to lead to further improvement in Imran’s condition, adding: “His (Imran’s) treatment will continue at the best hospital of Islamabad/ Rawalpindi and under the supervision of expert doctors.” Chaudhry asserted that Imran’s family was taken into confidence at every stage. He further said: “The government clarifies that no negligence will be committed. All prisoners are equal for us and their health is the state’s responsibility. “Politicisation should be avoided on this matter, and baseless doubts should not be spread.” The minister alleged that the PTI was “giving a political colour to this sensitive matter to hide its internal divide”. TTAP terms Naqvi’s presser contrary to facts Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) termed Naqvi’s press conference “blatantly misleading and contrary to the facts”. In a statement, the opposition alliance said that the government was attempting to “distort” facts and create a “fabricated narrative to cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the incarcerated former premier. “Concealing the facts from the nation is unacceptable,” the TTAP said. It added that the “distrust of government doctors and demand for the presence of Imran’s personal physician during the medical examination was not an act of stubbornness but rather a unanimous decision taken by his family, the leadership of PTI and the TTAP”. It said that only the incarcerated leader’s family “has the right to make a decision regarding his health”. The opposition alliance reiterated its demand for Imran’s personal physicians to be present, stressing that inviting the political leadership “was just a facade”. It also claimed that the “prolonged solitary confinement in which Imran has been kept comes under the category of torture, as per international human rights standards”. It recalled that Imran last met his personal physician in November 2024, while meetings with family “have remained suspended for two-and-a-half months”. It added that under such circumstances, “claiming that he was being given the best of facilities was a mockery of truth”. The TTAP warned the government “against attempts to suppress the truth, distort facts, and cover up rights violations”. Imran’s sisters dispute Naqvi’s account Separately, Imran’s sisters — Aleema, Uzma Khanum and Noreen Niazi — also disputed Naqvi’s account while addressing a press conference in Islamabad. First to speak among them, Aleema, said the daughter and sister-in-law of Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, had conveyed a message by the former premier after they met the latter at the Adiala jail today. Aleema said Imran had complained about the condition of his eye and asked for his reports to be shared with his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf. “Imran Khan has also said that his blood tests should be conducted and that the results be shared with his personal physicians,” Aleema added. “I ask why he is saying so,” she added, without further elaborating on the remark. She further said that Imran had stated that his vision had been perfect but he began facing problems around three months back. “He said he conveyed to the jail superintendent that he was unable to see, but no one bothered to provide him medical treatment for three weeks.” Aleema said Imran had also suggested initiating a case of criminal negligence against the jail superintendent. She maintained that “we had demanded that Imran be moved to Shifa International Hospital, and the government initially agreed to it. But, they suddenly said later that he would be moved to Al Shifa Eye Hospital”. Moreover, she continued, they had also shared the names with the government of the doctors they wanted to examine Imran. “But we were told that we should change the names, so we changed the names. Later, we suggested that Dr Nosherwan Barki be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but we got the message that it was not possible,” she claimed. Aleema also claimed that before leaving for a visit to Sri Lanka, Naqvi had given them the guarantee that Imran would be treated at Shifa International Hospital, but the commitment was not fulfilled. “They (government) said that [Imran’s] sisters will not be allowed to meet him. We accepted it and suggested that doctors should be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but that suggestion was also rejected,” she said. Aleema went on to say that if Naqvi was not afraid of Imran, he should allow moving the PTI founder to Shifa International. “They are scared of Imran Khan,” she asserted, urging “all Pakistanis” to raise their voice for the former premier. Speaking after Aleema, Uzma claimed she had received a “call from the government” and was informed that Imran’s cousin, Qasim Zaman, could be allowed to visit him. “I replied that Dr Barki and Dr Yusuf should be sent instead,” she said, further claiming that she was told that it was “not acceptable”. Uzma went on to claim that she was later informed that while Imran’s family would not be allowed access to him, Dr Yusuf could visit him. But, even he was not allowed, she added. She accused the doctors who had signed Imran’s medical report of “derailing their credibility”, saying that the report neither detailed any diagnosis nor any treatment plan. Uzma further maintained that “we have received messages from doctors from around the world that the report was not prepared by doctors. That is why we were demanding that at least one doctor of our choice be included in the medical board [for Imran]”. She also said that “an injection cannot be administered in jail”. “We do not know what kind of injection was administered to Imran. Was it an injection of poison?” she asked, adding that during her last meeting with Imran, he had expressed the fear that he would be killed in jail. PTI takes exception to minister’s remarks Meanwhile, the PTI took exception to Naqvi’s remarks regarding Imran, wherein he said that if the government wanted to harm the former premier it would have done so at the jail. “Given credible reports of vision loss, this statement is deeply alarming. A senior official openly implying deliberate worsening of custody conditions raises serious concerns about hidden mistreatment,” the party said on X. “Public threats on national TV make it legitimate to question humane treatment in prolonged solitary confinement without independent medical oversight, family contact or transparency,” the party said. “Prolonged solitary confinement is internationally recognised as harmful, especially with pre-existing conditions. Combined with deteriorating eyesight and treatment secrecy, the threat to ‘tighten’ conditions becomes far more sinister,” it said. “This is not mere rhetoric; it concerns actual custodial reality. A state claiming rule of law must prove it through actions, not threats. When power lacks transparency and such insinuations are normalised, the risk of custodial abuse becomes urgent and credible,” it added.",

The minister said the authorities would “100 per cent” have Imran hospitalised for “even two weeks” given that the doctors recommended it. “But if the doctors do not recommend, then how can we have him admitted?” he asked. “It is not possible that just on your recommendation we admit him to hospital for one week.” Separately, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry posted on social media platform X that Imran would be administered an injection in the next few days, and a second injection would be administered after a month. The minister said this was expected to lead to further improvement in Imran’s condition, adding: “His (Imran’s) treatment will continue at the best hospital of Islamabad/ Rawalpindi and under the supervision of expert doctors.” Chaudhry asserted that Imran’s family was taken into confidence at every stage. He further said: “The government clarifies that no negligence will be committed. All prisoners are equal for us and their health is the state’s responsibility. “Politicisation should be avoided on this matter, and baseless doubts should not be spread.” The minister alleged that the PTI was “giving a political colour to this sensitive matter to hide its internal divide”. TTAP terms Naqvi’s presser contrary to facts Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) termed Naqvi’s press conference “blatantly misleading and contrary to the facts”. In a statement, the opposition alliance said that the government was attempting to “distort” facts and create a “fabricated narrative to cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the incarcerated former premier. “Concealing the facts from the nation is unacceptable,” the TTAP said. It added that the “distrust of government doctors and demand for the presence of Imran’s personal physician during the medical examination was not an act of stubbornness but rather a unanimous decision taken by his family, the leadership of PTI and the TTAP”. It said that only the incarcerated leader’s family “has the right to make a decision regarding his health”. The opposition alliance reiterated its demand for Imran’s personal physicians to be present, stressing that inviting the political leadership “was just a facade”. It also claimed that the “prolonged solitary confinement in which Imran has been kept comes under the category of torture, as per international human rights standards”. It recalled that Imran last met his personal physician in November 2024, while meetings with family “have remained suspended for two-and-a-half months”. It added that under such circumstances, “claiming that he was being given the best of facilities was a mockery of truth”. The TTAP warned the government “against attempts to suppress the truth, distort facts, and cover up rights violations”. Imran’s sisters dispute Naqvi’s account Separately, Imran’s sisters — Aleema, Uzma Khanum and Noreen Niazi — also disputed Naqvi’s account while addressing a press conference in Islamabad. First to speak among them, Aleema, said the daughter and sister-in-law of Imran’s wife, Bushra Bibi, had conveyed a message by the former premier after they met the latter at the Adiala jail today. Aleema said Imran had complained about the condition of his eye and asked for his reports to be shared with his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf. “Imran Khan has also said that his blood tests should be conducted and that the results be shared with his personal physicians,” Aleema added. “I ask why he is saying so,” she added, without further elaborating on the remark. She further said that Imran had stated that his vision had been perfect but he began facing problems around three months back. “He said he conveyed to the jail superintendent that he was unable to see, but no one bothered to provide him medical treatment for three weeks.” Aleema said Imran had also suggested initiating a case of criminal negligence against the jail superintendent. She maintained that “we had demanded that Imran be moved to Shifa International Hospital, and the government initially agreed to it. But, they suddenly said later that he would be moved to Al Shifa Eye Hospital”. Moreover, she continued, they had also shared the names with the government of the doctors they wanted to examine Imran. “But we were told that we should change the names, so we changed the names. Later, we suggested that Dr Nosherwan Barki be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but we got the message that it was not possible,” she claimed. Aleema also claimed that before leaving for a visit to Sri Lanka, Naqvi had given them the guarantee that Imran would be treated at Shifa International Hospital, but the commitment was not fulfilled. “They (government) said that [Imran’s] sisters will not be allowed to meet him. We accepted it and suggested that doctors should be allowed to meet Imran Khan, but that suggestion was also rejected,” she said. Aleema went on to say that if Naqvi was not afraid of Imran, he should allow moving the PTI founder to Shifa International. “They are scared of Imran Khan,” she asserted, urging “all Pakistanis” to raise their voice for the former premier. Speaking after Aleema, Uzma claimed she had received a “call from the government” and was informed that Imran’s cousin, Qasim Zaman, could be allowed to visit him. “I replied that Dr Barki and Dr Yusuf should be sent instead,” she said, further claiming that she was told that it was “not acceptable”. Uzma went on to claim that she was later informed that while Imran’s family would not be allowed access to him, Dr Yusuf could visit him. But, even he was not allowed, she added. She accused the doctors who had signed Imran’s medical report of “derailing their credibility”, saying that the report neither detailed any diagnosis nor any treatment plan. Uzma further maintained that “we have received messages from doctors from around the world that the report was not prepared by doctors. That is why we were demanding that at least one doctor of our choice be included in the medical board [for Imran]”. She also said that “an injection cannot be administered in jail”. “We do not know what kind of injection was administered to Imran. Was it an injection of poison?” she asked, adding that during her last meeting with Imran, he had expressed the fear that he would be killed in jail. PTI takes exception to minister’s remarks Meanwhile, the PTI took exception to Naqvi’s remarks regarding Imran, wherein he said that if the government wanted to harm the former premier it would have done so at the jail. “Given credible reports of vision loss, this statement is deeply alarming. A senior official openly implying deliberate worsening of custody conditions raises serious concerns about hidden mistreatment,” the party said on X. “Public threats on national TV make it legitimate to question humane treatment in prolonged solitary confinement without independent medical oversight, family contact or transparency,” the party said. “Prolonged solitary confinement is internationally recognised as harmful, especially with pre-existing conditions. Combined with deteriorating eyesight and treatment secrecy, the threat to ‘tighten’ conditions becomes far more sinister,” it said. “This is not mere rhetoric; it concerns actual custodial reality. A state claiming rule of law must prove it through actions, not threats. When power lacks transparency and such insinuations are normalised, the risk of custodial abuse becomes urgent and credible,” it added.",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: Opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), as well as incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters, rejected on Tuesday an account detailed by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi regarding the former prime minister’s medical examination. The TTAP particularly accused Naqvi of attempting to “distort” facts to “cover up the deteriorating health and treatment meted out to” the former prime minister. The allegations came in response to a press conference by Naqvi earlier in the day, who asserted that the government did not want to “politicise” the matter of PTI founder Imran Khan’s health and blamed the opposition for doing the same. The opposition, PTI and Imran’s family have voiced concerns over the former prime minister’s health after his eye ailment came to light late in January. Addressing the media in Lahore, Naqvi referred to the recent medical report prepared by a team of doctors who examined the jailed ex-premier on Sunday. “The medical report also came forward yesterday and everything is clear as per it. Neither we nor the government want to politicise this,” he said, adding that there were certain “requests” which the authorities allowed but were not suitable to publicise at the moment. “Putting up such a show is extremely inappropriate, especially misleading people,” the minister said. “Still, we picked our best government and private doctors because it had been three days and the checkup had not taken place,” he insisted. Naqvi said he then invited PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan to reach Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday to witness Imran’s checkup but the former refused, citing party consultations. Detailing the communication between the authorities and the opposition, Naqvi said Gohar was given the time of 2:30pm. “We kept on waiting for an hour but Gohar sahib replied in the negative, that he has consulted with his party and would not be able to come.” “Our intention was that the checkup be performed in front of everyone,” he asserted, adding that the doctors were at the Adiala jail for about 1.25-1.5 hours for the examination. Naqvi stated that Gohar, along with the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders — Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai — and their preferred doctors, was then invited to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad. There, the doctors who examined Imran briefed the opposition leaders as well as spoke on the phone to the “two doctors” named by the PTI, with each conversation lasting for about 45 minutes. “They asked each and everything,” Naqvi said about the PTI-recommended doctors. “Excellent. This is the best treatment. Even if we had to provide treatment, we would have done the same,” he quoted the doctors as saying. According to Naqvi, the opposition representatives also expressed satisfaction over the treatment and said they would inform their supporters about it. Asked about former KP chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s claims that Naqvi made unmatched efforts for Imran’s release, the minister said, “One thing, which is not new, is that I have believed from the first day that dialogue is the solution to everything. “This is not my personal opinion; the prime minister has also said what I say, and we are following those instructions. […] If you ask about my personal view, I always say talks are the [answer],” he said. Responding to another question, he said there were “sensible people” in every party and if they had been listened to, the “PTI would not have been in the current situation, nor would have done the May 9 things”. On whether any action was being taken against the former Adiala jail superintendent whom the PTI holds responsible for aggravating Imran’s health issue, Naqvi stated: “We will check with the Punjab government what they are doing on it. But they are on it.” ‘Politicians onboard but Aleema vetoed everything’ However, the minister claimed, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum told the PTI that the “issue would die down” if the opposition accepted the government’s arrangements. “The medical checkup could not take place for three days just because of her. On one hand, they claim to have great empathy, relation and everything. On the other hand, politics has been done to the utmost over this.” The interior minister then questioned why roads were being blocked despite all the steps taken for Imran’s treatment. “If your intention was good, then you would have agreed on the first day. Almost all political leaders used to be on board but Aleema Khan sahiba vetoed them. She used to reject everything,” Naqvi said. “The problem is they want to cash this matter,” he contended. During his media talk, Naqvi recalled how the issue of Imran’s eye ailment came to light after the government confirmed that the PTI founder was taken to Pims for a minor procedure. He noted that the treatment was merely an injection that needed to be administered. The minister pointed out that “as a precaution, so there are no germs”, Imran was taken to the hospital, even though doctors suggested it could be done in jail. “I will tell you very clearly that when any prisoner needs treatment, it is our duty,” he affirmed, questioning whether all thousands of prisoners were accorded the same facilities as Imran was being provided. The interior minister said he believed that journalists should be provided with a tour of prisons so they could witness the facilities available there. Naqvi quipped that if the aim was political vendetta, then the first step would be to adopt a strict demeanour and restrict their facilities to what is provided to an ordinary prisoner as per the jail manual. “If we wanted to exact political revenge, the first step would be to [tighten] him,” he said. On the topic of the ongoing road blockades due to PTI protests, the minister said: “Our duty is to tell people to be aware of whatever cells in your party that are doing this; they are enemies of your people that have different objectives and want to do their own politics. “[…] It is now clear to me about at least some individuals that they are more worried about their politics than his (Imran’s) health.” The interior minister affirmed that the government would ensure the implementation of the recent Peshawar High Court (PHC) order that has directed the KP government and its police to reopen the roads. Demand for 1-week hospital admission Recalling previous contacts between the government and the opposition with the mediation of NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Naqvi asserted: “We made one thing very clear that in the matter of treatment, we will provide whatever facility is available to any incarcerated person as per the Constitution and the law.” He stated that the government had sought the name of a “non-political” eye specialist for examining Imran, but the other side refused and insisted on a family member accompanying the doctor, which was also agreed to. “I am saying all this as it is on record and you can ask the PTI leaders about this,” the minister affirmed.

      "title_orig": "Iran FM says agreed with US ‘on guiding principles’ for deal",
      "summary_orig": "Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday the latest talks with the United States saw them agree on “a set of guiding principles” that would pave the way for a deal. “Ultimately, we were able to reach broad agreement on a set of guiding principles, based on which we will move forward and begin working on the text of a potential agreement,” Araghchi told state TV. “I can say that, compared with the previous round, fully serious discussions were raised and the atmosphere was more constructive,” he added. Tehran and Washington held on Tuesday a second round of negotiations — which began earlier this month — after talks last year collapsed following Israel’s attack on Iran in June, which triggered a 12-day war. That war saw the United States briefly join Israel with strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. The latest talks were held after Washington deployed an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East following Iran’s deadly crackdown last month on anti-government protests, first sparked by economic hardships. During the interview with state TV, Araghchi said the two sides have begun a path towards an agreement, but noted that “this does not mean we can reach a deal quickly”. “We hope this process can be completed as soon as possible and we are ready to devote sufficient time to it,” he added. He acknowledged that it “will take time to narrow” the gap between the positions of both sides, “but at least we now have a set of guiding principles and a clearer path to move forward on”. Khamenei says US ‘will not succeed’ in destroying Iran Separately, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic. “In one of his recent speeches, the US president said that for 47 years America has not succeeded in destroying the Islamic republic … I tell you: you will not succeed either,” Khamenei said in a speech. During his speech, Khamenei warned that the US warship deployed in the Gulf could be sunk. “We constantly hear that they have sent a warship towards Iran. A warship is certainly a dangerous weapon, but even more dangerous is the weapon capable of sinking it,” he said. Khamenei expressed skepticism over the outcome of the negotiations with the US. “If there are to be negotiations — because there is no real room for negotiation — determining the outcome of the negotiations in advance is a mistake and madness,” he said, referring to US calls for Iran to abandon its nuclear programme. “The statements of the American president, at times threatening and at times dictating what should and should not be done, reveal a desire to dominate the Iranian nation,” Khamenei said.",

      "summary_en": "Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Tuesday the latest talks with the United States saw them agree on “a set of guiding principles” that would pave the way for a deal. “Ultimately, we were able to reach broad agreement on a set of guiding principles, based on which we will move forward and begin working on the text of a potential agreement,” Araghchi told state TV. “I can say that, compared with the previous round, fully serious discussions were raised and the atmosphere was more constructive,” he added. Tehran and Washington held on Tuesday a second round of negotiations — which began earlier this month — after talks last year collapsed following Israel’s attack on Iran in June, which triggered a 12-day war. That war saw the United States briefly join Israel with strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. The latest talks were held after Washington deployed an aircraft carrier group to the Middle East following Iran’s deadly crackdown last month on anti-government protests, first sparked by economic hardships. During the interview with state TV, Araghchi said the two sides have begun a path towards an agreement, but noted that “this does not mean we can reach a deal quickly”. “We hope this process can be completed as soon as possible and we are ready to devote sufficient time to it,” he added. He acknowledged that it “will take time to narrow” the gap between the positions of both sides, “but at least we now have a set of guiding principles and a clearer path to move forward on”. Khamenei says US ‘will not succeed’ in destroying Iran Separately, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump would not succeed in destroying the Islamic republic. “In one of his recent speeches, the US president said that for 47 years America has not succeeded in destroying the Islamic republic … I tell you: you will not succeed either,” Khamenei said in a speech.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: A Pakistani national was repatriated to his home country from India on Tuesday after spending 17 years in jail on charges of spying. “Muhammad Shahid Iqbal Bhatti, a Pakistani citizen imprisoned in India, was repatriated to Pakistan via the Wagah-Attari border today,” Pakistan’s High Commission in India said in a post on X. Separately, an official told Dawn that Bhatti was a resident of Kasur and was handed a 17-year sentence by an Indian court after he was accused of spying for Pakistan. Quoting Indian media reports , he said Bhatti was arrested in August 2008 by police in Indian Punjab. While in custody, he was interrogated for living in India allegedly without legal documents, the official said, adding that the then-chief manager of the State Bank of India had filed a complaint against him in November 2008. “Subsequently, Bhatti was sentenced by a court and sent to jail on charges of spying. He spent nearly 17 years of his life in prison,” the official said. He further said that as Bhatti’s prison term completed, Pakistani and Indian authorities held correspondence for his repatriation. “After the completion of legal formalities, he was escorted to the Wagah border, where he was handed over to Pakistani officials on Tuesday.” Meanwhile, Pakistan’s High Commission in India expressed its resolve to “continue to work towards the release and repatriation of all Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails”. Bhatti’s repatriation follows that of another three Pakistani prisoners from India in late November 2025. Among them, a man identified as Ramzan was arrested in 2010 by India on charges of illegally crossing the border and possessing narcotics. After receiving consular access, his status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in February 2011. Meanwhile, Muhammad Idrees from Narowal was arrested in 1995 for allegedly crossing the border illegally and was awarded 16 years of imprisonment. He was verified as a Pakistani national in 2005, 10 years after his arrest. Asghar Ali from Sadiqabad was arrested for allegedly crossing the border illegally in 2002. His status as a Pakistani national was confirmed in 2006.",

      "summary_orig": "A terrorist attack, involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On February 16, a cowardly terrorist attack was attempted on security forces and law enforcement agencies’ joint check Post in Bajaur District by Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khwarij ” . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The statement added that 12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khwarij with precision”. “In their desperation, the attackers rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. Due to the blast impact infrastructure at check post collapsed resultantly eleven brave sons of soil, rendered the ultimate sacrifice and [embracing] martyrdom.” ISPR elaborated that the blast affected residential buildings in the area as well, “leading to the martyrdom of one innocent young girl”. Another seven people were injured, including women and children, the ISPR said. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as a relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision “ Azm e Istehkam ” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement added. “The sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further reinforce our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the statement concluded. President, PM condemn attack President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack and extended condolences to the families of martyrs, according to a statement issued via PPP’s media cell. “The sacrifice made by the martyrs for the country’s defence further strengthens our resolve,” the president was quoted as saying. He vowed that the complete elimination of terrorists operating in the country with external support remained the state’s “topmost priority.” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed sorrow at the loss of lives and condemned the attack in the “strongest terms,” state broadcaster PTV reported. He extended condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the recovery of the injured, PTV said. “The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in this war against terrorism,” the premier was quoted as saying. He said the country remained determined to “root out terrorism from the country”. Noting the elimination of 12 terrorists, the prime minister lauded the security forces for their “timely action”. “Under the vision of Azm e Istehkam, security forces are gaining major success in the fight against terrorism,” the premier said. The attack comes days after an additional station house officer was martyred as terrorists attacked a police station in the War Mamund tehsil of Bajaur district. In December 2025, a major-ranked officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the district. KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”. This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.",
