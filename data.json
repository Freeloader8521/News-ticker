      "title_orig": "Imran will be taken wherever he prefers for medical treatment, says Tariq Fazal Chaudhry",
      "summary_orig": "Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Friday said that PTI founder Imran Khan would be taken “wherever he prefers” for medical treatment amid claims regarding the incarcerated leader’s vision, stating that there would be “no negligence in the matter”. On Thursday, the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. Addressing the media outside Parliament, Chaudhry said: “Wherever he (Imran) wants to go for a check-up, he will be taken. If he wants to go to Al-Shifa Eye Trust, then he will be taken there. There will be no negligence in the matter.” “If the CJP recommends a doctor, he will be taken there,” Chaudhry added. He called on the opposition to refrain from politicising the issue. “This is a sensitive issue; politicising it and misrepresenting facts is completely unfair.” He added that the incarcerated leader would “now be examined by eye doctors or super-specialists, and we will try to ensure he receives every possible treatment available”. Addressing the claims of Imran’s deteriorating vision, the minister dismissed the reports and stated, “The issue did not surface when Imran’s sister met him on Dec 2 or on Dec 9 when he was examined by a medical board or on Dec 20 when the Toshakhana verdict was announced.” “The complaint was not brought up anywhere before,” the minister said. He further recalled that, “On January 16, it was recommended by a doctor that Imran be shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for an eye checkup. It is also on record that he was not shifted at the request of PTI, but the jail authorities and the government”. He said that following Imran’s procedure on Jan 24, a medical report was issued by the doctors, “and then there is a ‘report’ by the lawyer” — referring to PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar’s report submitted to the SC. He added that a new medical report will be issued soon. The minister said that the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Yahya Afridi, was “himself looking after the case”. Safdar submitted a report in the SC on Thursday after meeting the former prime minister in Adiala jail earlier this week. The report quoted the PTI founder as telling him that “he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”. In a hearing of the case on Thursday, the two-member bench led by SC CJP Afridi ordered the formation of a medical team to examine the former premier’s eye, and directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday). Achakzai vows sit-in to continue until ‘all demands met’ Earlier in the day, Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai vowed to continue a sit-in outside the parliament— announced in the wake of claims regarding Imran’s vision a day earlier — “until all demands are met”. He made the demand in a video message posted on TTAP’s X account. On Thursday, the opposition Leader in the Senate, Allama Raja Abbas Nasir, announced the sit-in after the claim regarding Imran’s vision surfaced. Meanwhile, the TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, claimed that the government “has cordoned off all roads leading to the parliament” ahead of the sit-in. “Gates of parliamentary lodges have been shut, trapping MNAs and Senators inside,” he said, stressing that the measures were being taken to “stop opposition MPs from protesting and demanding medical access to Imran Khan.” “This doesn’t reflect strength, rather weakness,” he added. Chaudhry, when asked about the blockade during his media talk, maintained that the opposition has a right to protest. He went on to claim that the “blockade was not from the government’s side.” He held that the government has “repeatedly” assured the opposition that “no negligence will be tolerated regarding Imran’s health”. “There is no need to deal with it politically; it is a medical issue,” he added. PTI asks SC to issue written orders Earlier, PTI, in a post on X, addressed the CJP, demanding “formal written directions” for the PTI founder’s health examination. “CJP, we require formal written directions to ensure that Imran Khan is examined by specialists and treated under the supervision of his own doctors at Shifa International Hospital,” the party said. It called on the CJP to “issue and release the written orders,” stressing that Imran needed “urgent eye treatment.” “This is not politics, this is not about power. This is about Imran Khan’s life,” PTI added. Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, in a post on X, also said that the family had not yet received a written order from the SC regarding the PTI founder’s eye inspection. “It is 1pm on Friday the 13th, and we still have not received the written order from the Supreme Court of Pakistan. We require formal written directions to ensure that Imran Khan is examined by specialists and treated under the supervision of his own doctors at Shifa International Hospital,” Aleema said. She said that despite the court’s deadline of February 16, the “directive cannot be implemented without a written order from the court.” “Given the urgency and the risk to his eyesight, why has the CJP delayed issuing the written orders?” she added. Awaam Pakistan to join TTAP’s sit-in Separately, the leadership of Awaam Pakistan — Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Miftah Ismail — announced that it will participate in TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament House. “The peaceful protest is being staged in response to the alleged deprivation of vision in Imran Khan’s one eye, and the government’s refusal to allow access to his personal doctors and family.” The TTAP further said the decision was made last night in a meeting also attended by Awaam Pakistan’s leadership. “Denying any prisoner timely and appropriate medical care is immoral, inhumane and illegal,” the opposition alliance said, adding that Imran Khan was Pakistan’s former prime minister and the leader of the “country’s largest political party”. “The Awaam Pakistan party will join TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament immediately after Friday prayers today.” “We firmly believe in the rule of law, the people’s constitutional rights, free and fair elections, and true democracy, and we will always stand with the people in their struggle for these principles,” the post said. Dr Zafar Mirza, central spokesperson of Awaam Pakistan party, in a social media post on X, said, “Imran Khan’s eyesight is at risk without urgent medical treatment! Awaam Pakistan is part of the peaceful protest of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan and will stay until he receives the medical care he legally deserves.”",

      "summary_orig": "The UN Security Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a resolution extending by one year the mandate of the Monitoring Team that supports the 1988 Afghanistan Sanctions Committee, which oversees sanctions imposed on the Taliban. All 15 council members voted in favor of the US-drafted resolution, renewing the Monitoring Team’s mandate until February 17, 2027. The extension comes amid mounting international concern over Afghanistan’s deteriorating security situation, the growing influence of multiple terrorist groups, and the potential for regional destabilisation. Pakistan, which supported the resolution, stressed the ongoing threat posed by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K), Majeed Brigade, and Al-Qaeda. Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, said these groups “have been responsible for some of the most heinous terrorist attacks against Pakistan,” citing recent attacks that killed 80 people this month alone. “Once again, Afghan soil was used by these groups to plan and orchestrate attacks against neighbouring countries,” he said, urging the Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan territory for terrorist operations. “It is for the Taliban to decide what path they wish to choose for Afghanistan: whether the path to isolation or the path to peace and prosperity as a responsible member of the international community,“ he said. The ambassador also highlighted the council’s concerns over the wider humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. “The resolution rightly emphasises the dire human rights conditions, particularly for women and girls, economic collapse, political exclusion, and the challenges posed by drug trafficking,” he said. “Through this resolution, the council has sent a clear message that Afghan territory should not serve as a safe haven for terrorists and that all member states must prevent ransom payments or political concessions benefiting hostage-takers or terrorist groups.” The UN Monitoring Team’s 37th report, released this week, paints a grim picture of Afghanistan as a base for multiple terrorist organisations. It noted that the de facto Afghan authorities continue to provide a “permissive environment” for groups, particularly TTP. The report cited rising regional anxiety over cross-border attacks, the radicalisation of vulnerable communities, and the exploitation of commercial satellite communications and artificial intelligence by militant groups. While Afghan authorities insist no terrorist groups are present in the country, the Monitoring Team stated that “no UN member state supported that assessment.” Although the authorities have taken action against ISIL-K and control some external activities of other groups, TTP has enjoyed greater freedom, resulting in an escalation of attacks against Pakistan and heightened regional tensions. On Al-Qaeda, the report said the group’s intent and capability for external operations remain unchanged. It continues to serve as a training and advisory hub, particularly for TTP, and “favors spectacular attacks aimed at attracting global media attention,” highlighting the continued threat beyond the immediate region. Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), not listed under UN sanctions, remains active in southeastern Afghanistan, especially in areas influenced by the Haqqani Network. The report indicated AQIS leaders Osama Mahmoud and deputy Yahya Ghauri are believed to be in Kabul, with the group’s media cell operating from Herat. Member states warned that AQIS increasingly focuses on deniable external operations, possibly under cover groups such as Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, likely to avoid causing difficulties for the Taliban. TTP, one of the largest terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan, has intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces and state institutions. A November 11 attack on an Islamabad courthouse killed 12 people, marking the first such strike in the capital in several years. Despite operational setbacks, including the killing of deputy emir Mufti Muzahim in October, the group remains a serious threat. The Monitoring Team warned that TTP could deepen cooperation with Al-Qaeda-aligned groups, potentially expanding the threat beyond the region. ISIL-K, though under pressure from Taliban actions and regional security operations, retains significant combat capability, particularly in northern Afghanistan near Badakhshan and along the Pakistani border. The group continues to replenish its ranks through online recruitment and seeks alliances with other armed factions. Other groups of concern include the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM/TIP), which reportedly enjoys Afghan patronage, including identity documents, and raises funds through poppy cultivation and mining. Approximately 250 ETIM/TIP members joined Taliban police forces in 2025, and some have called for fighters in Syria and neighboring countries to relocate to Afghanistan in preparation for operations in China’s Xinjiang region. The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which is not listed under UN sanctions, has carried out attacks against Pakistani security forces and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, including a September 16 ambush that killed 32 soldiers. While Pakistani counter-terrorism operations have constrained the group’s activities, it remains operational, with some member states reporting coordination between BLA, TTP, and ISIL-K through shared training and resources. The Monitoring Team’s findings are expected to shape further deliberations at the Security Council on Afghanistan’s security trajectory and the effectiveness of the existing sanctions regime. Pakistan and other member states have emphasised that the resolution underscores the need for the Taliban to take “sustained and verifiable” action against terrorist groups, prevent Afghan territory from being used for external attacks, and uphold commitments to international peace and security.",

      "summary_orig": "The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Thursday said that it would stage a sit-in outside Parliament on Friday. The development came hours after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting a strong response from the PTI. The information was shared in a report submitted to the SC by PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who quoted the PTI founder as telling him that “he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”. Videos shared by the TTAP on the social media platform X on Thursday night showed Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas speaking to the media alongside the PTI leadership. “After Friday prayers, we will stage a sit-in outside Parliament,” he said. “We demand that Khan sahib be given full access to doctors whom he trusts,” he said. “I am told that Imran’s personal physician, Dr Asim Yusuf, is at Shifa Hospital, as are Dr Amir Awan and Dr Mazhar Ishaq; these are the two top specialists in Rawalpindi,” Abbas said. “We can trust them, so we demand that he (Imran) be shifted immediately and provided the right treatment,” he added. “He (Imran) was in the custody of the government, and his medical care and access to doctors were their responsibility,” he asserted. TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai said that the opposition would present their demands at tomorrow’s sit-in. “Our demand is just, and nobody will use abusive language or say hurtful things,” he vowed. “Only courteous and respectful language will be allowed.” “Only God knows how long we will sit there, and we promise not to stand up,” Achakzai stated, inviting those who opposed injustice to join them. In a post on X, he reiterated the same, saying, “A peaceful protest sit-in will begin outside the Parliament house from tomorrow. “We will present our demands during tomorrow’s sit-in, and the sit-in will continue until the demands are accepted. If, God forbid, something goes wrong in accepting the demands, the government will be responsible,” he said. ‘State has committed a crime against Imran’ Earlier in the day, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alongside Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, spoke to the media outside the SC. “A crime has been committed against Imran Khan, and this state has committed this crime,” Raja contended. The PTI secretary general further stated that the “face of this crime is Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. We will not forget this name”. Anjum has served as the jail superintendent at the Adiala jail, where Imran is imprisoned. Safdar told the court on Thursday that according to jail staff, he was transferred on Jan 16, being replaced by Sajid Baig. The PTI secretary general said it was difficult for him to control his emotions after reading the report. Raja said the pain in Imran’s eye began in November, and “sometime in December, he completely lost vision in his right eye”. “Yet Imran was only given drops meant to treat irritation in the eye. He was not taken to hospital, and a qualified doctor to treat eye ailments was also not called. Instead, prison doctors kept giving him eye drops as Imran continued to complain that the pain in his eye was not subsiding,” he alleged. Raja further claimed: “When the situation worsened, Ghafoor Anjum was immediately replaced on January 16. The new administrator who replaced him also wasted 10 days before a doctor from Pims, Dr Arif, was called [to the Adiala jail] on January 26.” The PTI secretary general said Dr Arif, after examining Imran’s eye, advised that he should immediately be taken to the hospital. The former premier was administered treatment , including an injection, at the Pims hospital in Islamabad. “The word used [in the report for Imran’s ailment] is occlusion of the retina,” Raja said, adding that Imran was quoted as saying that after treatment at the hospital, he regained 10pc-15pc vision in his right eye. “He is able to detect light through that eye, but he has not [fully] regained his vision.” “This is a very painful and terrifying situation,” he said, adding that they had no information about what medical condition was affecting Imran’s vision. He stressed the need for Imran’s medical examination at the earliest by doctors trusted by the PTI founder, family and public. “The ongoing situation is unacceptable,” he asserted. Pointing out that there were no doctors in Pims to treat ailments pertaining to the retina while Shifa International in Islamabad had two such doctors, he alleged that they were “deliberately” not asked to examine and treat Imran. “So, several people are involved in the crime that has been committed against Imran. All of those names will be revealed; we will not hide any of them. Khan sahib has himself identified one of them, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. A case will be filed against him immediately.” Raja further alleged that the “Islamabad High Court is also involved” in this matter, questioning why Imran’s cases were not being fixed for hearing. Meanwhile, “the condition of one of the eyes of the biggest leader of this nation is very concerning, and we have no information about his overall health condition”. Despite this, Raja continued, Imran had directed his party to approach the courts. “We will not spare these courts. This nation and history will avenge the crime committed by these courts,” he said, demanding that Imran’s cases be fixed for hearing. He also asserted that no reason was left to keep Imran behind bars and “freedom is his right now”. “He will get freedom and this nation will get him freedom. We will fight his case inside and outside courts,” Raja said. Imran’s sister, Aleema, said that the report had shattered her heart. “We haven’t done enough for a person who has been in jail for two-and-a-half years,” she said. She said that the jail authorities knew about Imran’s health but failed to arrange adequate treatment for him. “Imran Khan is in jail because our judiciary is not free,” she asserted. Speaking to the media later in the day, CM Afridi said that they had “options” and they were considering them. He announced that PTI’s core committee, political committee and TTAP leaders were set to meet later in the day to deliberate over those options. The KP CM recalled that it had been over 900 days since Imran’s incarceration, but he had “never complained” about his health. But now, he said, “We have called you and are doing our second press conference, which means that this is serious.” “God forbids. If there were an irreversible loss, then there would be no use in raising our voices,” Afridi stated, adding that the PTI would take some “serious” steps. Afridi branded the jail authorities’ negligence of Imran’s worsening eye condition a “criminal act”. “It violates human rights, the law, the Constitution, jail manuals and is just inhumane,” the chief minister stated. “When [former premier] Nawaz Sharif experienced health issues, the judiciary and our media fraternity collectively raised their voices, even though we knew that the tests or condition were false,” he added, recounting that despite this, the PML-N supremo was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment. “This man is a former premier and the chairman of the country’s largest political party. He is in pain right now and has serious issues,” he stressed. “We have to rise above politics and, on humanitarian and legal grounds, raise our voices for him,” he said. Senate opposition leader demands formation of medical board Abbas said in a post on X earlier in the day that he was “formally sending the full details of this matter, evidence and timeline to all national and international human rights organisations and ambassadors stationed in Pakistan so that they might take notice of this grave situation”. In the post, which quoted his address to the Senate, the TTAP vice chairman demanded that an “independent and transparent medical board be immediately formed, the complete medical records made public, and those responsible be identified and action taken in accordance with the law”. Lamenting that “timely and effective treatment was not provided”, Abbas also recalled that the nation was “constantly given the impression that he was completely healthy and had no problems”. “If Imran Khan had been allowed regular meetings with his family, if medical examinations had been transparent and reports had been made public, then perhaps this would not have come to this,” he said. Emphasising that the state was responsible for the life and health of any person in custody, Abbas stated: “Political disagreements have their place, but denying human rights and basic medical care is unacceptable in any civilised society. “Delaying treatment, withholding information, and limiting access to family were not only inhumane but also a shirking of constitutional and legal obligations,” he contended. “This was not just a matter of an individual; it is a matter of principle,” the TTAP leader asserted. “If a former prime minister and a popular public leader of the country can be treated like this today, to what extent are the rights of an ordinary citizen protected?” he questioned. “The state has a responsibility not to let political differences prevail over human dignity and fundamental rights,” Abbas noted. TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar wrote on X: “For months in a row Imran Khan kept on complaining about loss of vision in his right eye but was denied prompt medical attention. “This is not negligence. This is torture; cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment,” alleged Khokhar. He highlighted that Pakistan was party to the United Nations’ rules on treatment of prisoners — also known as the “ Nelson Mandela Rules ” – and of the UN Convention Against Torture . Khokhar, who is also a lawyer, argued that these rules “clearly prohibit such treatment” as meted out to Imran. ‘Not a matter to be trivialised’ Separately, in an official statement on the matter, the PTI expressed “profound concern and deep anguish” over the report detailing Imran’s health. “We strongly condemn the treatment meted out to Imran Khan, particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight,” the party said on social media platform X. “The report has laid before the nation facts that are sufficient to shake the conscience of every Pakistani,” it asserted. The PTI claimed that the jail authorities limited Imran’s treatment to basic eye drops during the last three to four months, while “denying access to his personal physicians”. “This constitutes a grave and inexcusable act of negligence. It is not merely a medical lapse; it amounts to playing with his life and health,” the party stated. It further said there would be “no compromise” on Imran’s health and rights. The PTI declared: “We will raise our voice against this injustice at every constitutional, legal, public, and international forum available to us. Should our legitimate demands remain unmet, we reserve the right to initiate a public movement. “Imran Khan’s health is not a matter to be trivialised. Any further negligence may provoke a severe public reaction.” “When the eyesight of a leader of such national and international stature is at stake, every possible transparent and independent medical facility must be provided immediately,” the PTI demanded. “Any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for,” the PTI warned, asserting that it reserved the right to initiate legal proceedings against Anjum, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab prisons inspector general, the provincial prisons minister and “other responsible officials”. While noting the SC’s directives regarding a medical team and contact with his sons, the PTI lamented that the “rejection of the request for a family member to be present during the medical examination, and the continued restriction or conditional provision of other basic facilities, is deeply disappointing”. The party demanded that the ex-prime minister be granted “immediate and unrestricted access to his personal physicians and that, for specialised eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team”. Stressing that unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights were his fundamental rights, the PTI said, “To deprive him of these rights is tantamount to trampling upon justice and violating established international norms.” The PTI urged international human rights organisations and global institutions to “take notice of the treatment being meted out” to Imran. “A former elected prime minister facing prolonged solitary confinement, restricted medical facilities, and impediments to family and legal contact raises serious concerns under universally recognised human rights standards, and falls within the ambit of mental and medical torture,” the PTI alleged. It also called upon the Pakistani media “not to treat this matter merely as a political dispute, but to highlight it as a serious human rights issue”. In a separate post on X, the PTI said the report submitted to the SC itself mentions “rapid vision loss, visible distress, lack of full medical transparency, and restricted independent access” for the party founder. “These aren’t social media claims. They are documented concerns,” the party contended. It added: “A former prime minister in state custody is dealing with serious health deterioration while basic transparency remains a question. When someone is imprisoned, their health becomes the responsibility of those in power. Period.” The party emphasised that this was not about politics anymore. “It’s about whether power is being used responsibly or ruthlessly,” it stated. “You can disagree with a man. You cannot gamble with his health.” ‘Inhumane treatment’ PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar pointed out that Imran’s right eye was left with 15pc vision because he “was not provided timely medical treatment”. “This stinking non-democratic, non-elected, and fascist system is the worst period in Pakistan’s history,” he said on X. PTI’s Omar Ayub demanded that jail officials Anjum and Baig be “sacked by the Supreme Court”, further calling for the initiation of criminal proceedings against them. “PM Imran Khan’s right eye vision deteriorated because of these personnel’s callous attitude. Shahbaz Sharif, Mohsin Naqvi and Maryam Nawaz are responsible as well as the establishment,” the former National Assembly opposition leader alleged in a post on X. He further stated, “It is time for some serious introspection by the Supreme Court. Justice delayed, is justice denied. Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi should have acted sooner. PM Imran Khan’s vision in his right eye could have been saved.” Ayub stressed that Imran should have access to an ophthalmologist with the requisite expertise and his family physician should be given unhindered access to him as well. PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh termed the report about his party founder “heart-wrenching and sad”. “The nation is in deep sorrow and grief today. We demand that Imran Khan be released immediately after providing complete and transparent medical facilities,” he said. Former KP CM and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur emphasised that Imran’s “health is the most important concern of every Pakistani”. “Proper treatment via his personal medical teams should be ensured,” he demanded. “Denying proper medical treatment to a former prime minister and Pakistan’s most popular leader is purely evil. Every Pakistani here and overseas condemns this fascist approach,” he asserted. Moonis Elahi, the son of former Punjab CM and PTI leader Parvez Elahi, posted on X saying that the damage to Imran’s eye was a “result of his inhumane and vindictive treatment of the leader in jail”. “The nation will neither forget nor forgive,” he said.",

Despite this, Raja continued, Imran had directed his party to approach the courts. “We will not spare these courts. This nation and history will avenge the crime committed by these courts,” he said, demanding that Imran’s cases be fixed for hearing. He also asserted that no reason was left to keep Imran behind bars and “freedom is his right now”. “He will get freedom and this nation will get him freedom. We will fight his case inside and outside courts,” Raja said. Imran’s sister, Aleema, said that the report had shattered her heart. “We haven’t done enough for a person who has been in jail for two-and-a-half years,” she said. She said that the jail authorities knew about Imran’s health but failed to arrange adequate treatment for him. “Imran Khan is in jail because our judiciary is not free,” she asserted. Speaking to the media later in the day, CM Afridi said that they had “options” and they were considering them. He announced that PTI’s core committee, political committee and TTAP leaders were set to meet later in the day to deliberate over those options. The KP CM recalled that it had been over 900 days since Imran’s incarceration, but he had “never complained” about his health. But now, he said, “We have called you and are doing our second press conference, which means that this is serious.” “God forbids. If there were an irreversible loss, then there would be no use in raising our voices,” Afridi stated, adding that the PTI would take some “serious” steps. Afridi branded the jail authorities’ negligence of Imran’s worsening eye condition a “criminal act”. “It violates human rights, the law, the Constitution, jail manuals and is just inhumane,” the chief minister stated. “When [former premier] Nawaz Sharif experienced health issues, the judiciary and our media fraternity collectively raised their voices, even though we knew that the tests or condition were false,” he added, recounting that despite this, the PML-N supremo was allowed to leave the country for medical treatment. “This man is a former premier and the chairman of the country’s largest political party. He is in pain right now and has serious issues,” he stressed. “We have to rise above politics and, on humanitarian and legal grounds, raise our voices for him,” he said. Senate opposition leader demands formation of medical board Abbas said in a post on X earlier in the day that he was “formally sending the full details of this matter, evidence and timeline to all national and international human rights organisations and ambassadors stationed in Pakistan so that they might take notice of this grave situation”. In the post, which quoted his address to the Senate, the TTAP vice chairman demanded that an “independent and transparent medical board be immediately formed, the complete medical records made public, and those responsible be identified and action taken in accordance with the law”. Lamenting that “timely and effective treatment was not provided”, Abbas also recalled that the nation was “constantly given the impression that he was completely healthy and had no problems”. “If Imran Khan had been allowed regular meetings with his family, if medical examinations had been transparent and reports had been made public, then perhaps this would not have come to this,” he said. Emphasising that the state was responsible for the life and health of any person in custody, Abbas stated: “Political disagreements have their place, but denying human rights and basic medical care is unacceptable in any civilised society. “Delaying treatment, withholding information, and limiting access to family were not only inhumane but also a shirking of constitutional and legal obligations,” he contended. “This was not just a matter of an individual; it is a matter of principle,” the TTAP leader asserted. “If a former prime minister and a popular public leader of the country can be treated like this today, to what extent are the rights of an ordinary citizen protected?” he questioned. “The state has a responsibility not to let political differences prevail over human dignity and fundamental rights,” Abbas noted. TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar wrote on X: “For months in a row Imran Khan kept on complaining about loss of vision in his right eye but was denied prompt medical attention. “This is not negligence. This is torture; cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment,” alleged Khokhar. He highlighted that Pakistan was party to the United Nations’ rules on treatment of prisoners — also known as the “ Nelson Mandela Rules ” – and of the UN Convention Against Torture . Khokhar, who is also a lawyer, argued that these rules “clearly prohibit such treatment” as meted out to Imran. ‘Not a matter to be trivialised’ Separately, in an official statement on the matter, the PTI expressed “profound concern and deep anguish” over the report detailing Imran’s health. “We strongly condemn the treatment meted out to Imran Khan, particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight,” the party said on social media platform X. “The report has laid before the nation facts that are sufficient to shake the conscience of every Pakistani,” it asserted. The PTI claimed that the jail authorities limited Imran’s treatment to basic eye drops during the last three to four months, while “denying access to his personal physicians”. “This constitutes a grave and inexcusable act of negligence. It is not merely a medical lapse; it amounts to playing with his life and health,” the party stated. It further said there would be “no compromise” on Imran’s health and rights. The PTI declared: “We will raise our voice against this injustice at every constitutional, legal, public, and international forum available to us. Should our legitimate demands remain unmet, we reserve the right to initiate a public movement. “Imran Khan’s health is not a matter to be trivialised. Any further negligence may provoke a severe public reaction.” “When the eyesight of a leader of such national and international stature is at stake, every possible transparent and independent medical facility must be provided immediately,” the PTI demanded. “Any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for,” the PTI warned, asserting that it reserved the right to initiate legal proceedings against Anjum, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab prisons inspector general, the provincial prisons minister and “other responsible officials”. While noting the SC’s directives regarding a medical team and contact with his sons, the PTI lamented that the “rejection of the request for a family member to be present during the medical examination, and the continued restriction or conditional provision of other basic facilities, is deeply disappointing”. The party demanded that the ex-prime minister be granted “immediate and unrestricted access to his personal physicians and that, for specialised eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team”. Stressing that unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights were his fundamental rights, the PTI said, “To deprive him of these rights is tantamount to trampling upon justice and violating established international norms.” The PTI urged international human rights organisations and global institutions to “take notice of the treatment being meted out” to Imran. “A former elected prime minister facing prolonged solitary confinement, restricted medical facilities, and impediments to family and legal contact raises serious concerns under universally recognised human rights standards, and falls within the ambit of mental and medical torture,” the PTI alleged. It also called upon the Pakistani media “not to treat this matter merely as a political dispute, but to highlight it as a serious human rights issue”. In a separate post on X, the PTI said the report submitted to the SC itself mentions “rapid vision loss, visible distress, lack of full medical transparency, and restricted independent access” for the party founder. “These aren’t social media claims. They are documented concerns,” the party contended. It added: “A former prime minister in state custody is dealing with serious health deterioration while basic transparency remains a question. When someone is imprisoned, their health becomes the responsibility of those in power. Period.” The party emphasised that this was not about politics anymore. “It’s about whether power is being used responsibly or ruthlessly,” it stated. “You can disagree with a man. You cannot gamble with his health.” ‘Inhumane treatment’ PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar pointed out that Imran’s right eye was left with 15pc vision because he “was not provided timely medical treatment”. “This stinking non-democratic, non-elected, and fascist system is the worst period in Pakistan’s history,” he said on X. PTI’s Omar Ayub demanded that jail officials Anjum and Baig be “sacked by the Supreme Court”, further calling for the initiation of criminal proceedings against them. “PM Imran Khan’s right eye vision deteriorated because of these personnel’s callous attitude. Shahbaz Sharif, Mohsin Naqvi and Maryam Nawaz are responsible as well as the establishment,” the former National Assembly opposition leader alleged in a post on X. He further stated, “It is time for some serious introspection by the Supreme Court. Justice delayed, is justice denied. Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi should have acted sooner. PM Imran Khan’s vision in his right eye could have been saved.” Ayub stressed that Imran should have access to an ophthalmologist with the requisite expertise and his family physician should be given unhindered access to him as well. PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh termed the report about his party founder “heart-wrenching and sad”. “The nation is in deep sorrow and grief today. We demand that Imran Khan be released immediately after providing complete and transparent medical facilities,” he said. Former KP CM and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur emphasised that Imran’s “health is the most important concern of every Pakistani”. “Proper treatment via his personal medical teams should be ensured,” he demanded. “Denying proper medical treatment to a former prime minister and Pakistan’s most popular leader is purely evil. Every Pakistani here and overseas condemns this fascist approach,” he asserted. Moonis Elahi, the son of former Punjab CM and PTI leader Parvez Elahi, posted on X saying that the damage to Imran’s eye was a “result of his inhumane and vindictive treatment of the leader in jail”. “The nation will neither forget nor forgive,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "The Bangladesh Nationalist Party raced ahead of its rival Jamaat-i-Islami on Thursday, early counting showed, after tens of millions of Bangladeshis voted in a pivotal national election. It was the first vote since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that toppled long-time premier Sheikh Hasina. Analysts say a clear outcome is crucial for stability in the nation of 175 million, after months of deadly anti-Hasina protests disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the garment sector, the world’s second-largest exporter. It was the first national election to follow the recent under-30, Gen Z-led uprisings scattered around the world, with Nepal set to hold a vote next month. Counting began at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT) at most booths, immediately after polls closed, with clear trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, election commission officials said. Contest between former allies The race pits two coalitions led by former allies, BNP and Jamaat, with opinion polls giving the BNP a slight edge. BNP was leading in 50 seats and Jamaat in 18, local TV news stations said. Bangladesh’s parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 300 seats, with 151 required for a simple majority. The party declared on its official Facebook page that its chief and prime ministerial candidate Tarique Rahman had won one of two seats he contested. Election authorities were yet to announce the result officially, however. BNP members clapped and cheered loudly as they celebrated outside the party office in Dhaka on hearing the news of his victory, visuals on the Facebook page showed. Turnout appeared on track to exceed the 42 per cent recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots. Bangladesh Jamaat-i-Islami party leader Shafiqur Rahman addresses the media after counting starts following Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 12. — AFP Hasina calls vote a farce Hasina’s Awami League is banned , and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi fray. Elections under Hasina were frequently marred by boycotts and intimidation, critics say. In a statement sent to journalists on WhatsApp, Hasina denounced the election as a “carefully planned farce”, held without her party and without real voter participation. She said Awami League supporters had rejected the process. Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. — Reuters “We demand the cancellation of this voterless, illegal, and unconstitutional election … the removal of the suspension imposed on the activities of the Awami League; and the restoration of the people’s voting rights through the arrangement of a free, fair, and inclusive election under a neutral caretaker government,” she said. Members of the army patrol outside the polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 12, 2026. —Reuters Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and a two-term limit for the prime minister. More than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, were on the ballot and at least 50 parties contested — a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died. Long lines of voters, heavy security There were no reports of major violence. Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths. “I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.” An electoral official seals a ballot box as voting ends at a polling station during Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 12. — AFP Many voters echoed that sentiment, telling Reuters that the atmosphere felt freer and more festive than in previous elections. Kamal Chowdhury, 31, who works as a driver for a company in Dhaka and travelled to his hometown in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria to cast his vote, said: “It feels festive here.” Outside a polling booth in Dhaka, where BNP chief Rahman and head of the interim government Muhammad Yunus voted, policemen were on horses with saddle blankets proclaiming: “Police are here, vote without fear.” President Zardari hopes for peaceful process President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning. “President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said. He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.",
