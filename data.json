      "title_orig": "KP govt must protect its people instead of begging Afghanistan for security: DG ISPR",
      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Friday that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government should rather work on protecting the people of the province instead of “begging Afghanistan”. The DG ISPR made these remarks while addressing a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He said that governance gaps in KP were being paid for by the blood of security personnel. “Appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators is never and not a policy,” he asserted, adding that the state and its institutions would not be bothered by “any political distortions”. “The state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of any single person who is singularly the most responsible person for bringing terrorism back to KP.” He said that he hoped the government would focus on governance and the people it was duty-bound to protect. “We also hope that instead of begging Afghanistan, you will protect this province and its people.” The DG ISPR began the press conference with paying homage on behalf of the armed forces of Pakistan to the “brave sons of soil” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said the purpose of the press conference was to give an overview of the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For the past two decades, Pakistan, particularly KP, has been facing the issue of terrorism, he said. In 2024, he said, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP, 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred while 165 civilians were killed. Moreover, he continued, 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025 until September 15. In these operations, 970 terrorists were killed while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred. While terrorism incidents had started increasing 2021 onwards, “the response also went up”, the DG ISPR said. “And more number of kharijis were killed in subsequent years.” The DG ISPR said following the 2014 attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, security forces had started uprooting terrorism as part of a comprehensive strategy. “We reached close to [realising] the dream of a peaceful Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. [But], unfortunately, as part of a plan, terrorists and their facilitators were then provided space here. “Governance and public welfare were deliberately weakened and attempts were made to build a misleading narrative. The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are paying its price with their blood and sacrifices even today.” He then outlined the factors that led to this situation. First reason, he said, was not fully implementing the National Action Plan, followed by politicising the issue of terrorism, India using Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the provision of modern weapons to terrorists in Afghanistan and the existence of a “terrorism-crime nexus” that had “complete local and political backing”. Going back to the 2014 APS attack, he said all political parties, and the provincial and federal government devised the NAP. “All political parties agreed that the implementation of the NAP was necessary for eliminating terrorism.” But, he added, the then-government removed some provisions of the plan in 2021 despite progress in those areas and came up with the “revised” NAP. All political parties, provincial governments and the federal government then agreed to the full implement all 14 points of the revised plan, he said. Pointing to a graphic of the plan on the screen, he said the first point concerned kinetic operations. “Is this being worked on or not? I have presented the data for KP to you. Just in KP, are law enforcement agencies not conducting more than 40 intelligence-based operations?” He asserted that the empirical evidence demonstrated that work was being done on the first point of the NAP. He then went on to question the work being done on the remaining 13 points. “Today, are we all standing under one narrative? Do you not hear voices calling for talks with these terrorists? Are we following this a NAP? “Does the solution to all problems lie in dialogue? You tell me. If the solution for every problem is in dialogue when India fired missiles on Pakistan on May 6 and 7 … Why didn’t the people of this country say let’s hold talks?” If the solution lay in just holding dialogue, there would be no wars, he emphasised. Coming to the fifth point he mentioned as a reason for the rise in terrorism, he said it had been decided to “break the terror-crime nexus” in order to eradicate terrorism. Moreover, he said, it had also been decided to “strengthen the judiciary” with regards to the counter-terrorism cases. Then, pulling up another graphic, the DG ISPR detailed the cases in anti-terrorism courts in KP. He said that no one was convicted, while 34 cases were pending. “This is the judicial system that was to be strengthened. The political government of the time decided it, we did not.” More to follow",

The following are some facts about the democracy campaigner: Upper-class background Maria Corina Machado, 58, was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on October 7, 1967. She is an industrial engineer by training, and her father was a prominent businessman in Venezuela’s steel industry. Her upper-class roots have made her a target of criticism from Venezuela’s governing socialist party.

The country’s electoral authority and top court say Maduro, whose time in office has been marked by a deep economic and social crisis, won the election, though they have never published detailed tallies. Machado emerged from hiding to make a brief appearance during a protest before Maduro’s inauguration in January. She was briefly arrested and then freed. Advocate of liberal economic reforms Machado advocates for liberal economic reforms, including the privatisation of state-owned enterprises such as PDVSA, Venezuela’s oil company. She also supports the creation of welfare programs aimed at aiding the country’s poorest citizens. Political activism Her political activism has come at a cost, leaving her isolated as nearly all of her senior advisers have been detained or forced to leave the country. Machado herself has accused Maduro’s administration of operating as a “criminal mafia.” Collective struggle Though sometimes criticised for being egotistical, even by her own mother, Machado rarely speaks about herself in public.

      "summary_orig": "Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado received the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. The committee chose to focus on Venezuela at this time, in a year dominated by US President Donald Trump’s repeated public statements that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Machado was on this year’s TIME Magazine “100 most influential People” list, where current US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said she was the “personification of resilience, tenacity, and patriotism”. “She is receiving the prize for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” said Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo. “As the leader of the democratic forces in the Venezuela, she is one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times,” he said. He said that Machado had been a “key unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided; an opposition that found common ground in the demand for free election and representative government”. “This is precisely what lies at the heart of democracy: our shared willingness to defend the principles of popular rule even though we disagree. At a time when democracy is under threat, it is more important than ever to defend this common ground,” he said. He stated that Venezuela had evolved from “a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal and authoritarian state” that was suffering from a humanitarian and economic crisis. “Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty even as the few at top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against its own population. Nearly eight million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution, and imprisonment,” he said. He further said that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime made carrying out political work in the country “extremely dangerous”, adding that Machado stood up for free and fair elections more than 20 years ago. Frydnes said that the Venezuela opposition leader had spoken out for judicial independence, human rights, and popular representation. “She has spent years working for the representation of the Venezuelan people,” he said. He further said that Machado was the opposition’s presidential candidate for the 2024 elections, but her candidacy was blocked by the regime. “She then backed the representative of another party Edmundo González Urrutia in the elections. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised across the political divides. They were trained as election observers to ensure a transparent and fair election. “Despite the risk of harassment, arrest, and torture, citizens across the country held watch over the polling stations. They made sure the final tallies were documented before the regime could destroy ballots and lie about the outcome,” he said, adding that the efforts of the collective opposition were innovative, brave, peaceful and democratic. Frydnes went on to say that democracy was a pre-condition for lasting peace. “However, we live in a world where democracy is in retreat. Where more and more authoritarian regimes are challenging norms and resorting to violence.” He said the repression of the Venezuelan population by its regime was not unique. “We see the same trends globally. Rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation. “In 2024, more elections were held than ever before. But fewer and fewer are free and fair.” Noting that she has been forced to live in hiding in the past year, he said, “Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.” Frydnes said that Machado “embodies the hope for a different future — one where the fundamental rights of citizens are protected and their voices are heard”. US President Trump had made no secret of his desire to win this year’s prize.\nSince returning to the White House for his second term in January, the US leader has repeatedly insisted that he “deserves” the Nobel for his role in resolving numerous conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated. But Nobel Prize experts in Oslo had insisted in the run-up to Friday’s announcement that he had no chance, noting that his “America First” policies run counter to the ideals of the Peace Prize as laid out in Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will creating the award. Last year, the prestigious prize went to the Japanese anti-nuclear group Nihon Hidankyo , a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The prize comes with a gold medal, a diploma and a prize sum of $1.2 million.\nThe award will be presented at a formal ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of the prizes’ creator, Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel. The Peace Prize is the only Nobel awarded in Oslo, with the other disciplines announced in Stockholm.",

      "summary_orig": "Roads in Islamabad have been blocked and mobile internet services suspended ahead of a Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protest in the federal capital today. The TLP has announced plans for a massive anti-Israel demonstration outside the US emb­as­sy in the federal capital today. In anticipation of the protest, the Islamabad administration had started placing shipping containers at Faizabad Interchange — the historic site of several TLP sit-ins . TLP protesters plan to gather at Faizabad and then march towards the US embassy situated in the Diplomatic Enclave in the capital’s Red Zone area. The party has also requested the deputy commissioner of Islamabad to provide security to its rally. TLP Naib Nazim-e-Ala in the Islamabad Zone Raja Aamir Shahzad, in a letter to the Islamabad’s deputy commissioner, said the party would hold a ‘Labbaik Al-Aqsa Million March’ on October 10 at 2pm from Faizabad to the US embassy. “The TLP’s central and provincial leadership, along with workers, activists and members of the public from across the country, will participate in the march. I request you to provide security for the peaceful rally so that no untoward incident occurs,” he wrote in the letter. Ahead of the protest, without naming the TLP, the US embassy in Islamabad posted on social media platform X that “the US consulates general in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar are monitoring planned protest activity across Pakistan on October 10”. “These protests may cause traffic delays/detours due to closed or blocked roads in the vicinity of the demonstrations. The duration of the protests is unknown. We advise US citizens to avoid large gatherings and remain aware of their surroundings,” the embassy said in the post. Internet services suspended in twin cities Meanwhile, it emerged earlier today that the Ministry of Interior had directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to suspend 3G and 4G services in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. A directive dated October 9 and addressed to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) chairman stated the ministry had “accorded approval to suspend 3G/4G services in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, starting from 12am tonight till further orders.” The missive, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , directed the PTA to take “further necessary action” in this regard in coordination with the Islamabad commissioner and police chief, and the Rawalpindi regional police officer. The ministry did not provide a reason for suspending services, but the development does come amid verious other measures being taken by the authorities ahead of the TLP protest. Traffic plan Islamabad traffic police also issued a diversion plan, referring to the “law and order” situation in the Faizabad area. The plan, posted on Islamabad police’s X account, said the entry of all heavy vehicles in the federal capital would not be allowed until further orders and detailed the diversion routes for smaller vehicles around the Faizabad area. A Dawn report, citing sources, earlier said around 500 containers would be used to seal the Red Zone in Islamabad, covering Attaturk Avenue, Third Avenue, Margalla Road, and Khayaban-i-Suharwardy as well as the capital’s entry and exit points. These containers were being placed at key locations, including Serena Chowk, Express Chowk, Nadra Chowk, Agha Khan Road near Marriott Hotel, Margalla Road near Trail 3 and Luqman Hakeem Road. Other blockades were being set up at Faisal Avenue’s Zero Point and Faisal Chowk, the report said. It added that entry points into the capital from Rawat T-Cross, Chungi No 26 and Faizabad will also be sealed with containers. The metro bus and electric bus services on 21 different routes were suspended on Thursday evening and these would remain suspended today as well. Some educational institutions also announced closures in view of the rally and the state’s preparations to counter it. Security measures and arrests Separately, according to a Dawn report , the capital police had started detaining local TLP leaders, activists and workers, taking into custody at least 280 people on Thursday. The report said about 7,000 security personnel, including 5,500 policemen, 1,000 Frontier Constabulary and 500 Rangers, would be deployed across the capital to intercept the TLP gathering and maintain law and order. Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and vehicles equipped with anti-riot gear, including tear gas shells and rubber bullets, would also be deployed at various locations. To avoid any law and order situation in Rawalpindi, the city police and administration have imposed Section 144 till October 11 and sealed major entry and exit routes with more than 300 containers. Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period. As part of the security plan, more than 6,500 police personnel, including 1,150 traffic police, contingents of Punjab Constabulary, and the newly formed Riot Management Police (RMP), have been deployed in Rawalpindi. Personnel from other districts have also been called in to assist the local force. On Thursday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the government always allowed peaceful marchers and demonstration, however, the TLP had not sought permission for its protest in the capital. Section 144 imposed in Punjab Late on Thursday, violence had also broken out in Punjab, after police launched a crackdown on the headquarters of TLP in a bid to arrest its chief, Saad Rizvi. The clashes left several people injured, including around a dozen policemen. An October 8 order by the Punjab Home Department, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , says that Section 144 has been imposed in the province for 10 days. The order states that the Punjab government has received credible reports from law enforcement and intelligence agencies indicating a “serious and imminent threat to public peace, tranquility, and the safety of life and property across the province”. “Multiple credible threat alerts, regarding possible terrorist activities planned by hostile groups, including RAW, TTP, BLA, Daesh etc., aimed at targeting minorities or Muslim scholars to trigger sectarian unrest have been received. Assemblies, rallies, gathering, sit-ins, processions, demonstrations, jalsa, etc., could present a convenient target for such terrorist attacks and the possibility of an untoward incident cannot be ruled out. “[…] There is a strong apprehension that certain political, sectarian or anti-social elements may engage in activities, assemblies, gatherings or demonstrations that are likely to cause a breach of public peace, disturb the public order and create a security risk for the general public and critical infrastructure,” the order read. Apart from a ban on assembly of four or more persons, the order also places a restriction on carrying, brandishing and displaying arms in public spaces, a ban on “misuse of loudspeakers, public address systems and audio amplifying devices for provocative, sectarian or inflammatory content”, and a ban on publishing, disseminating of displaying provocative, hateful or sectarian material. A notification by the University of Punjab, also available with Dawn.com , said that the varsity would remain closed today, as per the instructions of the government. Meanwhile, a statement by the Punjab Public Service Commission’s media and production deputy director said exams for the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority Sub-Divisional Officer’s post, scheduled for Oct 11 and 12, had been postponed following the imposition of Section 144. The statement, however, did not specify a new date for the exams. Additional reporting by Nauman Liaquat",

Section 144 imposed in Punjab Late on Thursday, violence had also broken out in Punjab, after police launched a crackdown on the headquarters of TLP in a bid to arrest its chief, Saad Rizvi. The clashes left several people injured, including around a dozen policemen. An October 8 order by the Punjab Home Department, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , says that Section 144 has been imposed in the province for 10 days. The order states that the Punjab government has received credible reports from law enforcement and intelligence agencies indicating a “serious and imminent threat to public peace, tranquility, and the safety of life and property across the province”. “Multiple credible threat alerts, regarding possible terrorist activities planned by hostile groups, including RAW, TTP, BLA, Daesh etc., aimed at targeting minorities or Muslim scholars to trigger sectarian unrest have been received. Assemblies, rallies, gathering, sit-ins, processions, demonstrations, jalsa, etc., could present a convenient target for such terrorist attacks and the possibility of an untoward incident cannot be ruled out. “[…] There is a strong apprehension that certain political, sectarian or anti-social elements may engage in activities, assemblies, gatherings or demonstrations that are likely to cause a breach of public peace, disturb the public order and create a security risk for the general public and critical infrastructure,” the order read. Apart from a ban on assembly of four or more persons, the order also places a restriction on carrying, brandishing and displaying arms in public spaces, a ban on “misuse of loudspeakers, public address systems and audio amplifying devices for provocative, sectarian or inflammatory content”, and a ban on publishing, disseminating of displaying provocative, hateful or sectarian material. A notification by the University of Punjab, also available with Dawn.com , said that the varsity would remain closed today, as per the instructions of the government. Meanwhile, a statement by the Punjab Public Service Commission’s media and production deputy director said exams for the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority Sub-Divisional Officer’s post, scheduled for Oct 11 and 12, had been postponed following the imposition of Section 144. The statement, however, did not specify a new date for the exams. Additional reporting by Nauman Liaquat",
      "title": "Roads blocked, mobile internet services suspended ahead of TLP protest in Islamabad",
      "summary": "Roads in Islamabad have been blocked and mobile internet services suspended ahead of a Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protest in the federal capital today. The TLP has announced plans for a massive anti-Israel demonstration outside the US emb­as­sy in the federal capital today. In anticipation of the protest, the Islamabad administration had started placing shipping containers at Faizabad Interchange — the historic site of several TLP sit-ins . TLP protesters plan to gather at Faizabad and then march towards the US embassy situated in the Diplomatic Enclave in the capital’s Red Zone area. The party has also requested the deputy commissioner of Islamabad to provide security to its rally. TLP Naib Nazim-e-Ala in the Islamabad Zone Raja Aamir Shahzad, in a letter to the Islamabad’s deputy commissioner, said the party would hold a ‘Labbaik Al-Aqsa Million March’ on October 10 at 2pm from Faizabad to the US embassy. “The TLP’s central and provincial leadership, along with workers, activists and members of the public from across the country, will participate in the march. I request you to provide security for the peaceful rally so that no untoward incident occurs,” he wrote in the letter. Ahead of the protest, without naming the TLP, the US embassy in Islamabad posted on social media platform X that “the US consulates general in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar are monitoring planned protest activity across Pakistan on October 10”. “These protests may cause traffic delays/detours due to closed or blocked roads in the vicinity of the demonstrations. The duration of the protests is unknown. We advise US citizens to avoid large gatherings and remain aware of their surroundings,” the embassy said in the post. Internet services suspended in twin cities Meanwhile, it emerged earlier today that the Ministry of Interior had directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to suspend 3G and 4G services in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. A directive dated October 9 and addressed to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) chairman stated the ministry had “accorded approval to suspend 3G/4G services in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, starting from 12am tonight till further orders.” The missive, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , directed the PTA to take “further necessary action” in this regard in coordination with the Islamabad commissioner and police chief, and the Rawalpindi regional police officer. The ministry did not provide a reason for suspending services, but the development does come amid verious other measures being taken by the authorities ahead of the TLP protest. Traffic plan Islamabad traffic police also issued a diversion plan, referring to the “law and order” situation in the Faizabad area. The plan, posted on Islamabad police’s X account, said the entry of all heavy vehicles in the federal capital would not be allowed until further orders and detailed the diversion routes for smaller vehicles around the Faizabad area. A Dawn report, citing sources, earlier said around 500 containers would be used to seal the Red Zone in Islamabad, covering Attaturk Avenue, Third Avenue, Margalla Road, and Khayaban-i-Suharwardy as well as the capital’s entry and exit points. These containers were being placed at key locations, including Serena Chowk, Express Chowk, Nadra Chowk, Agha Khan Road near Marriott Hotel, Margalla Road near Trail 3 and Luqman Hakeem Road. Other blockades were being set up at Faisal Avenue’s Zero Point and Faisal Chowk, the report said. It added that entry points into the capital from Rawat T-Cross, Chungi No 26 and Faizabad will also be sealed with containers. The metro bus and electric bus services on 21 different routes were suspended on Thursday evening and these would remain suspended today as well. Some educational institutions also announced closures in view of the rally and the state’s preparations to counter it. Security measures and arrests Separately, according to a Dawn report , the capital police had started detaining local TLP leaders, activists and workers, taking into custody at least 280 people on Thursday. The report said about 7,000 security personnel, including 5,500 policemen, 1,000 Frontier Constabulary and 500 Rangers, would be deployed across the capital to intercept the TLP gathering and maintain law and order. Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and vehicles equipped with anti-riot gear, including tear gas shells and rubber bullets, would also be deployed at various locations. To avoid any law and order situation in Rawalpindi, the city police and administration have imposed Section 144 till October 11 and sealed major entry and exit routes with more than 300 containers. Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period. As part of the security plan, more than 6,500 police personnel, including 1,150 traffic police, contingents of Punjab Constabulary, and the newly formed Riot Management Police (RMP), have been deployed in Rawalpindi. Personnel from other districts have also been called in to assist the local force. On Thursday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the government always allowed peaceful marchers and demonstration, however, the TLP had not sought permission for its protest in the capital.

      "summary_orig": "Thirty terrorists involved in the Orakzai incident earlier this week — during which 11 security personnel, including two officers, were martyred — were killed in a “retribution operation”, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday. The incident in Orakzai took place on Tuesday night when security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district on the reported presence of  “Indian proxy Fitna Al Khawarij ”. In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij , mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. In the Tuesday operation, 19 “India-sponsored” terrorists were killed, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, adding that 11 security personnel, including two officers, had also embraced martyrdom during the exchange of fire. In a statement issued today, the ISPR said, “Security forces have been conducting a series of retribution operations against the kharijis involved in [the] heinous incident that occurred in Orakzai District on October 7, resulting in the shahadat of brave sons of soil, including Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq and Major Tayyab Rahat.” It added that during an operation in the Jamal Maya area of Orakzai, conducted on the basis of credible intelligence, “all 30 India-sponsored khwarij involved in the terrorist incident have been sent to hell” after an intense exchange of fire. “These successful operations have avenged the heinous act and have brought the main perpetrators to justice,” the statement read. It said sanitisaton operations were under way to “hunt and eliminate any other India-sponsored khariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined and remain steadfast to eradicate and wipe out the menace of India-sponsored terrorism from the country”. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that security personnel were engaged in “safeguarding the motherland against the enemy by risking their lives”. According to state-run Radio Pakistan , he also reiterated the government’s resolve to stamp out the menace of terrorism from the country. President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement on the PPP’s X account, lauded the security forces’ “courageous” operation against “India-sponsored terrorists”. It quoted the president as saying that the nation would forever remember the sacrifices of Lieutenant Colonel Tariq and Major Rahat and that security forces had made the nation proud by dismantling a network of terrorists. “Continuous successes against terrorism reflect our resolve, [and] the brave sons of the soil have written history by sacrificing their lives for the protection of the motherland,” the president added. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the efforts of security forces, saying that the nation stood with them in the fight against terrorism. A statement posted on the interior ministry’s X account quoted Naqvi as saying, “I pay tribute to the security forces for thwarting the designs of the Fitna Al Khawarij terrorists. The security forces achieved great success by bringing 30 terrorists to a decisive end. “We will not let the terrorists of Fitna Al Khawarij hide anywhere in Pakistan,” he said. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Just a day after the Orakzai incident, a major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district. Last month, 19 soldiers were martyred in KP in multiple incidents in a span of a few days. Following that, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that the “Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khawarij or stand with Pakistan”. Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. But Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations. Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support. After Tuesday’s IBO in Orakzai, a statement from the ISPR said the participants at the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference held at General Headquarters on Wednesday had expressed the resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of “Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan . A day ago, PM Shehbaz said during a meeting of the federal cabinet that the nation was united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country, and the government would take all measures to crush violence perpetrated from across the border. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a similar warning in the National Assembly same day about going after terrorist facilitators “wherever they are”. Saying “enough is enough”, he added that the facilitators of terrorism would have to pay, whether they were present on Pakistani or Afghan soil. More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "India will reopen its embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul that was shut four years ago, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Friday. India had closed its embassy in Kabul after the Taliban seized power following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces in 2021, but opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support, and humanitarian aid. About a dozen countries including China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkiye have embassies operating in Kabul, although Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration. New Delhi’s announcement came as Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi began talks with Jaishankar on what is the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since 2021. “India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,” Jaishankar told Muttaqi in his opening remarks. “Closer cooperation between us contributes to your national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” he said, adding that India’s “technical mission” in Kabul was being upgraded to an embassy. According to Hindustan Times , Jaishankar also said that closer cooperation between the two countries would contribute to “regional stability and resilience“. “As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,” Jaishankar said, according to the report. Meanwhile, Muttaqi was quoted as saying that India was the first country to respond to “the recent earthquake in Afghanistan”. “Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations,” the Afghan minister was quoted as saying. New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries. The visit comes after Muttaqi attended a regional meeting in Moscow where Afgha­nistan’s neighbours including Pakistan, Iran, China and several Central Asian countries issued a joint statement opposing the deployment of foreign military infrastructure in the region. The statement was regarded as a signal of opposition to US President Donald Trump’s stated objective to retake control of the Bagram military base near Kabul.",

According to the press release, the CTD had received confidential information that terrorists belonging to the banned organisation Fitna-al-Khawarij were planning a “major terrorist operation” on Company Road within the limits of Domail police station. Fitnah-al Khawarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Per the statement, the CTD’s Special (SWAT) team surrounded the area immediately along with the district police. “Upon seeing the operation team, the terrorists tried to escape and started indiscriminate firing on the officials,” it said. “CTD and police retaliated vigorously to protect themselves and arrest the terrorists.” The exchange of fire between the CTD team and the terrorists reportedly continued for about 25 minutes. After the firing stopped, a search and clearance operation was conducted in the area and two terrorists were found dead, both of whom were identified as being from Bannu, it added. “Some of the terrorists’ accomplices took advantage of the darkness to successfully escape.” One of the terrorists killed was identified as the mastermind behind an attack on the Bannu CTD team on April 30, 2025, in which four personnel were killed and one injured. He had also been involved in attacks on two police posts in the district, in which a constable was martyred, the statement saod. The other was involved in several attacks and targeted killings on CTD and district police in 2023, including attacking and injuring a constable in November of that year, according to the CTD. “Two Kalashnikovs, six magazines, 23 rounds, two hand grenades, two mobile phones and two cards of the banned TTP were recovered from the possession of the slain terrorists,” the press release said, adding that additional police and CTD personnel had launched a search operation in the area to arrest the escaped terrorists. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. A major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district yesterday, according to the media wing of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The incident occurred a day after the ISPR reported that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, had been killed in an exchange of fire between the forces and TTP terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district.",

      "title_orig": "Powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake strikes off southern Philippines, tsunami warnings issued",
      "summary_orig": "A strong earthquake of magnitude 7.4 struck offshore in the southern Philippines on Friday, its seismology agency said, with tsunami warnings issued in several countries and people in nearby coastal areas urged to move inland or to higher ground. Agency Phivolcs warned of aftershocks from the quake, which struck in the morning in waters off Manay town in Davao Oriental in the Mindanao region. At least one person was killed, civil defence official Raffy Alejandro said on Facebook. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued an update around noon local time saying the tsunami threat in the Philippines had passed, having earlier said waves 1 to 3 metres high were possible, although warnings from other agencies remained in place. There were no other reports of casualties from disaster offices in the region contacted by Reuters , but one official in Manay said there were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges. The quake was among the strongest in recent years to hit the Philippines, which sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences more than 800 quakes each year. Rescue teams being prepared The US Tsunami Warning System issued a tsunami threat immediately after the quake, saying hazardous waves were possible for coasts within 300 kilometres of the earthquake’s epicentre. The earthquake came two weeks after the Philippines experienced its deadliest quake in more than a decade, with 74 people killed on the island of Cebu. That was a magnitude of 6.9 and also struck offshore. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said authorities were assessing the situation on the ground and said search-and-rescue teams would be deployed when it was safe to do so. “We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” Marcos said in a statement. Richie Diuyen, a disaster official in Manay near the epicentre, said the quake lasted 30-40 seconds and initial damage included some houses, the facade of a church, cracked roads and unpassable bridges. “We couldn’t stand earlier. I am 46 years old now, and this is the strongest earthquake I ever felt,” Diuyen said by phone. “The damage is quite big,” she said. Tsunami warning for Indonesia, Palau Phivolcs revised down the magnitude from an initial reading of 7.6 to 7.4, and put the depth of the quake at 23 km. A tsunami warning was issued in Indonesia for its northern Sulawesi and Papua regions, and the PTWC said some coasts in Indonesia and the Pacific island nation of Palau could see waves of up to 1 metre. A video of the quake from the Philippine city of Davao, posted on social media and verified by Reuters , showed office workers holding on to desks, with the creaking noises of structures. Another showed toppled cabinets and evacuated workers gathering outside. Jonathan Dolotina, a radio operator at the disaster office of the coastal Philippine city of Mati, said there were no immediate reports of casualties and authorities were checking a damaged school building. Sawsan Entrino, a disaster officer in Banay-Banay 10 km away, told Philippine broadcaster DZMM that local classes had been suspended and inspections were underway, but there were no immediate reports of damage. The governor of Davao Oriental in the Philippines said people panicked when the earthquake struck. “Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told DZMM . “It was very strong.”",

      "summary": "A strong earthquake of magnitude 7.4 struck offshore in the southern Philippines on Friday, its seismology agency said, with tsunami warnings issued in several countries and people in nearby coastal areas urged to move inland or to higher ground. Agency Phivolcs warned of aftershocks from the quake, which struck in the morning in waters off Manay town in Davao Oriental in the Mindanao region. At least one person was killed, civil defence official Raffy Alejandro said on Facebook. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued an update around noon local time saying the tsunami threat in the Philippines had passed, having earlier said waves 1 to 3 metres high were possible, although warnings from other agencies remained in place. There were no other reports of casualties from disaster offices in the region contacted by Reuters , but one official in Manay said there were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges. The quake was among the strongest in recent years to hit the Philippines, which sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences more than 800 quakes each year. Rescue teams being prepared The US Tsunami Warning System issued a tsunami threat immediately after the quake, saying hazardous waves were possible for coasts within 300 kilometres of the earthquake’s epicentre. The earthquake came two weeks after the Philippines experienced its deadliest quake in more than a decade, with 74 people killed on the island of Cebu. That was a magnitude of 6.9 and also struck offshore. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said authorities were assessing the situation on the ground and said search-and-rescue teams would be deployed when it was safe to do so. “We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” Marcos said in a statement. Richie Diuyen, a disaster official in Manay near the epicentre, said the quake lasted 30-40 seconds and initial damage included some houses, the facade of a church, cracked roads and unpassable bridges. “We couldn’t stand earlier. I am 46 years old now, and this is the strongest earthquake I ever felt,” Diuyen said by phone. “The damage is quite big,” she said.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: After Starlink , a European giant and a Chinese company, Amazon’s satellite broadband initiative — Project Kuiper — has expressed interest in rolling out its services in Pakistan. In a meeting with Minister for IT and Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja, a delegation from Amazon outlined plans to launch Project Kuiper in Pakistan by the end of 2026. The delegation, led by Mostafa Mousa — Project Kuiper’s lead for Licensing and Regulatory Affairs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa — also included Jeff Kietzemen and Hisham Alshaer. The IT minister welcomed the delegation, stressing that this development signals growing confidence among global tech giants in Pakistan’s expanding digital economy. She noted that the entry of Project Kuiper would create new opportunities for affordable, high-speed internet, particularly in remote and underserved communities where traditional connectivity options remain limited. Project Kuiper is Amazon’s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network, which plans to deploy 3,236 satellites to deliver broadband speeds of up to 400 Mbps using low-cost user terminals. Minister insists move signals tech giants’ growing confidence in Pakistan’s digital sector The delegation shared its intent to establish ground infrastructure in Pakistan, including gateways and points of presence (PoPs), to ensure stable connectivity and smooth integration with local networks. Welcoming Amazon’s plans, Ms Fatima said the partnership aligns perfectly with the government’s vision of “Digital Nation Pakistan”. “This initiative is not just about faster internet — it’s about opportunity,” she noted. “With Project Kuiper, we are taking a concrete step towards digital inclusion so every citizen, no matter where they live, can connect, learn and grow.” The Ministry of IT and Telecom emphasised that collaborations like these will create new opportunities for Pakistan’s IT sector, boost innovation and e-commerce and strengthen Pakistan’s position in the global digital ecosystem. Pakistan’s satellite broadband policy is guided by the Pakistan Satellite Services Regulatory Policy (PASRP), which defines procedures for foreign operators seeking landing rights and spectrum access. Several international companies have already shown interest . SpaceX’s Starlink has completed preliminary technical submissions, while OneWeb, a subsidiary of the French group Eutelsat, has opened talks for gateway testing and commercial collaboration. The application of the Chinese satellite internet provider, SSST, is currently in the initial process. Amazon’s Project Kuiper has now become the fourth major global LEO satellite operator to formally engage with Pakistan. The PASRP’s regulatory framework requires satellite operators to secure multiple clearances, including landing rights, gateway licensing, spectrum allocation and security vetting, through bodies such as Suparco, the Frequency Allocation Board, Pakistan Telecomm­unication Authority, and the Ministry of Interior.

His resignation letter, which was shared with the media the previous night, has apparently gotten lost in red tape, with Governor House denying having ever received it. Officials at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat told Dawn that Mr Gandapur’s resignation had been delivered to the Governor House on Wednesday night. A copy of the letter seen by Dawn showed that it was received by the governor’s staff at 10:57pm. However, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who was in Islamabad on Thursday, and other officials at the Governor’s Secre­tariat remained tight-lipped about the issue. An official on Mr Kundi’s staff told Dawn that they had yet to receive the resignation letter. “As far as I know, the resignation has not yet reached the Governor’s Office,” the official said, adding that the governor would sign it whenever he received it. He further said that Governor Kundi was due to return to the provincial capital on Friday (today). Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Mr Kundi said he had not yet received the chief minister’s resignation and would sign it as soon as it was received. He described reports regarding the receipt of the resignation letter at the Governor House as “fake news.” Meanwhile, in his first media interaction after ‘stepping down’, Mr Gandapur asserted that the federal government could not topple the PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Commenting on the delay in the acceptance of his resignation, he termed it a “drama” and advised the government not to waste time, warning that such a delay would harm the province. When asked if he had been re-offered the chief ministership, he denied receiving any such offer, saying that even if such an offer were made, he would not accept it. ‘PTI enables terrorists’ Meanwhile, at a press conference in Isla­m­abad, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI of “enabling terrorists”. In his view, the problem that led to Mr Gandapur’s ouster was that he did not do as he was told i.e., “enable and support terrorists and prevent actions against them”. He alleged that CM-in-waiting Sohail Afridi was nominated to “support, promote, and enable” terrorism in the province. “These [people] are enabled by a person sitting in jail,” the information minister said, calling Imran Khan the “chief sponsor of terrorism”.

The cabinet ratified recently inked the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The meeting also paid tribute to the leaderships of both the countries. The cabinet further approved the donation of 15 non-operational aircraft of the Department of Plant Protection to various institutions for educational, commemorative, and exhibition purposes. The remai­ning four operational aircraft will continue to be used by the department for anti-locust operations. It was noted that previous attempts to auction these aircraft had been unsuccessful, leading to the decision to donate them instead. Earlier, in his opening remarks, Prime Minister Shehbaz highlighted recent incidents in which army officers and soldiers embraced martyrdom while conducting operations against terrorists. PM Shehbaz remarked that facilitators were providing shelter to terrorists coming from across the border, and warned that such elements would no longer be spared. “The situation had reached a critical point. The martyrs have drawn a line with their blood while defending their country, and this line cannot be crossed,” he said. “The sacrifices of the martyrs will be remembered forever,” he asserted, adding that the country’s achievements on the economic and diplomatic fronts would mean nothing if terrorism was not eliminated.

      "summary_orig": "POLITICAL uncertainty in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) has been deepening with each passing day, as both major coalition partners in the Chaudhry Anwarul Haq-led government have urged their leaders to allow them to withdraw from the coalition, ahead of the upcoming elections. Following recent shifts in political affiliations in the 53-member AJK Legislative Assembly, the PPP has raised its strength to 17 and the PML-N to nine, while the PTI forward bloc stands at 20. The PTI, which holds the office of the leader of the opposition, is left with only five lawmakers — one of whom has tendered his resignation, although it hasn’t been accepted yet — while two seats are held by members of other parties. The PPP’s parliamentary party and some key ticket holders, who met in Islamabad on Wednesday with its regional president Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin in the chair, unanimously resolved that the party should quit the government “sooner rather than later” to protect its political goodwill among the masses. Amid suspicions that PM Haq ‘supported’ JKJAAC protest, PML-N, PPP lawmakers seek to pull out of ruling coalition Later, the 17-member parliamentary party held an exclusive meeting that was also attended by a non-legislator, Sardar Tanveer Ilyas. The meeting came in the backdrop of the PML-N’s offer to PPP to form its own government following the possible exit of Mr Haq. “Yes, we have offered them that we will support them in the event of a new election of the leader of the house. But we will not be part of the government and prefer to sit on the opposition benches,” a PML-N leader confided to Dawn. The PPP meeting deliberated on options to pave the way for the prime minister’s exit, either through a no-confidence motion or his voluntary resignation. According to one participant, Mr Ilyas assured the meeting that he would arrange the required tally of 27 to send Mr Haq packing. The issue will be further discussed by the PPP parliamentary party on Friday afternoon at Zardari House in Karachi, where the party’s central leadership is expected to take a final decision. Mr Ilyas has also been invited to attend. A day earlier, the PML-N’s political committee had met in Islamabad, alongside cabinet members Rana Sanaullah and Ahsan Iqbal, where a similar view was expressed — that remaining part of the coalition was politically damaging for the party ahead of the polls. Sources told Dawn that when PM Shehbaz Sharif was briefed about the recent agreement signed in Muzaffarabad between the federal government’s negotiation committee and representatives of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), he was told that PM Haq appeared to have tacitly backed the movement. “It seemed the AJK premier himself was behind the committee’s hard stance; otherwise, it could not have succeeded in getting each and every demand of the protesters implemented,” a well-placed source quoted a member of the negotiating team as telling the premier. This was why the head of the negotiation committee, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, had hinted to media persons that Mr Haq may be re­­p­laced. However, shortly afterwards, Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry sought to play down the claim, saying it was AJK’s internal matter. Meanwhile, Mr Haq is said to be under intense pressure over the removal of eight cabinet members elected from 12 constituencies of Pakistan-based refugees, in accordance with the agreement with the JKJAAC. These ministers belong to all three coalition partners. According to sources, the AJK PM had asked them to step down voluntarily, which was met stiff refusal. Two of them, belonging to the PML-N, even lashed out at the premier through social media posts, accusing him of backing the JKJAAC movement and urging him to resign himself. The AJK prime minister has yet to respond to these allegations. Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Police personnel face off against TLP activists outside their headquarters on Multan Road.—Murtaza Ali/White Star • Containers placed at key points to prevent march on Islamabad • Over a dozen cops injured in clashes; outfit claims casualties due to violence • Minister says TLP using ‘Gaza March’ as pretext to spread unrest LAHORE: The city remai­ned on edge throughout Thur­sday after late-night clashes between the police and the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) left several people injured, including around a dozen policemen. The standoff came following a call by the religious outfit to march on the federal capital, where it planned to stage a protest outside the US embassy in solidarity with Palestinians. In a bid to prevent the group from following through on its plans, authorities cracked do­wn, cordoning off the Mult­an Road headquarters of the TLP with shipping containers and sealing the city’s entry/exit points. Meanwhile, in Islamabad, the administration also placed containers at entry points to keep protesters at bay. More than 100 TLP supporters were also rounded up in the capital. After clashes with Lahore police a night ago, the TLP had called on its supporters to converge on the provincial capital for a ‘final call’ on Friday (today). This worried police, who feared the protest might turn violent and took extraordinary security measures across the province to maintain law and order. As a result, citizens, particularly those living in the densely populated areas from Chauburji to Yateem Khanna Chowk, faced inconvenience. Despite the added security measures, the situation remained tense, especially on Multan Road. The artery remained closed to all kinds of traffic as charged TLP supporters took positions in improvised shelters erected on the road, ready to pounce on police. On Thursday afternoon, the TLP supporters and the police faced off again, resulting in a skirmish. The religious outfit, however, ransacked some businesses and damaged vehicles. There were contradictory reports about casualties, as TLP claimed at least two of its workers were killed. However, police sources acknowledged only one death, saying the body had been handed over to the TLP for burial. The outfit also claimed that 50 of its workers sustained injuries, but police sources put the number at only seven. Over a dozen policemen were also injured in the violence since Wednesday night. A senior police officer told Dawn on anonymity that the Nawan Kot police station was lodging FIR under anti-terrorism and other offences against hundreds of TLP activists and supporters. He said TLP chief Saad Rizvi would also be nominated besides many central leaders of the party. ‘Unrest and anarchy’ Separately, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Thursday accused the TLP of attempting to spread unrest and anarchy in the country under the pretext of a so-called ‘Gaza March’. Speaking to reporters outside Parliament House, Mr Chaudhry said the government had always facilitated peaceful protests under legal procedures and standard operating protocols, but the TLP neither sought permission nor assured compliance with any law. “Was the TLP planning a protest or plotting violence? I will show you the difference,” he remarked. The minister said that several individuals arrested in Punjab and Islamabad were found carrying batons, chemicals, glass marbles, tear gas shells and guns, and face masks, which, he said, indicated violent intent rather than peaceful demonstration. “Does this look like a peaceful protest or an attempt to incite violence?” the state minister questioned, adding that those detained were confirmed to be the TLP office-bearers. He called the TLP a “mercenary-like group” that operates under the garb of religion and said the organisation was deliberately trying to divert national attention from security issues. “It was shameful that you were spreading blatant lies and giving false statements on social media regarding the deaths of your workers. Does our faith allow such things?” the minister added. Kalbe Ali in Islamabad contributed to this report Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2025",

The standoff came following a call by the religious outfit to march on the federal capital, where it planned to stage a protest outside the US embassy in solidarity with Palestinians. In a bid to prevent the group from following through on its plans, authorities cracked do­wn, cordoning off the Mult­an Road headquarters of the TLP with shipping containers and sealing the city’s entry/exit points. Meanwhile, in Islamabad, the administration also placed containers at entry points to keep protesters at bay. More than 100 TLP supporters were also rounded up in the capital. After clashes with Lahore police a night ago, the TLP had called on its supporters to converge on the provincial capital for a ‘final call’ on Friday (today). This worried police, who feared the protest might turn violent and took extraordinary security measures across the province to maintain law and order.

      "title_orig": "Hamas and Israel sign ceasefire and hostage deal",
      "summary_orig": "Hamas and Israel signed an agreement on Thursday to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the conflict in Gaza. Officials on both sides confirmed they had signed the deal following indirect talks in the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The deal’s announcement had been greeted with celebrations among Palestinians and Israelis alike. The deal includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement is ratified by his government, which would convene after a security cabinet meeting today. An Israeli government spokeswoman, confirming the deal had been signed, said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. After that 24-hour period, the captives held in Gaza will be freed within 72 hours, she said. A source briefed on details of the agreement said earlier that Israeli troops would begin pulling back within 24 hours of the deal being signed. An Israeli official said all 20 Israeli captives still believed to be alive in Gaza after being seized by Hamas would be released. The prisoners released in exchange will not include Marwan Barghouti, one of the most prominent Palestinian prisoners, the spokeswoman said. Trump said today that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons. “I’m not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. But … there will be disarming,” Trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting, adding that there would also be “pullbacks” by Israeli forces. He said he had no view regarding the possibility of a two-state solution and he would follow whatever was ultimately agreed on. “I don’t have a view. I’m going to go with what they agreed to,” he told reporters. On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We’re going to create something where people can live … We’re going to create better conditions for people.“ He said that the Gaza captives should be released on Monday or Tuesday and that he hopes to attend a signing ceremony in Egypt. Trump said he believed it will lead to “lasting peace”. “We are getting the hostages back on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, and that’ll be a day of joy,” Trump said. Trump said under the plan Gaza is going to be “slowly redone”, a reference to plans to rebuild the Palestinian enclave. He did not provide details. While questions remain about what happens in the region in the long term, Trump said he hoped it would lead to “an everlasting peace”. Key developments US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”; says he thinks captives will probably be released on Monday Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, Trump had said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal. Qatar had said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”. Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP . The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said. The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added. The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.” Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!” He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”. “The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview. “This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”. In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.” “Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”. Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”. In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt. “I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza. Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier. An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday. ‘Optimism prevails’ As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air. “We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza. Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce. In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday. Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible. The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning. Protests, prisoners Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return. One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for. High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media. Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”. Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration. Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen. There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007. Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries. It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza. Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack.",

      "summary": "Hamas and Israel signed an agreement on Thursday to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the conflict in Gaza. Officials on both sides confirmed they had signed the deal following indirect talks in the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The deal’s announcement had been greeted with celebrations among Palestinians and Israelis alike. The deal includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement is ratified by his government, which would convene after a security cabinet meeting today. An Israeli government spokeswoman, confirming the deal had been signed, said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. After that 24-hour period, the captives held in Gaza will be freed within 72 hours, she said. A source briefed on details of the agreement said earlier that Israeli troops would begin pulling back within 24 hours of the deal being signed. An Israeli official said all 20 Israeli captives still believed to be alive in Gaza after being seized by Hamas would be released. The prisoners released in exchange will not include Marwan Barghouti, one of the most prominent Palestinian prisoners, the spokeswoman said. Trump said today that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons. “I’m not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. But … there will be disarming,” Trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting, adding that there would also be “pullbacks” by Israeli forces. He said he had no view regarding the possibility of a two-state solution and he would follow whatever was ultimately agreed on. “I don’t have a view. I’m going to go with what they agreed to,” he told reporters. On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We’re going to create something where people can live … We’re going to create better conditions for people.“ He said that the Gaza captives should be released on Monday or Tuesday and that he hopes to attend a signing ceremony in Egypt. Trump said he believed it will lead to “lasting peace”. “We are getting the hostages back on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, and that’ll be a day of joy,” Trump said. Trump said under the plan Gaza is going to be “slowly redone”, a reference to plans to rebuild the Palestinian enclave. He did not provide details. While questions remain about what happens in the region in the long term, Trump said he hoped it would lead to “an everlasting peace”. Key developments US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”; says he thinks captives will probably be released on Monday Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, Trump had said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal. Qatar had said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”. Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP . The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said. The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added. The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.” Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!” He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”. “The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview. “This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”. In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.” “Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”. Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”. In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt. “I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza. Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier. An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday. ‘Optimism prevails’ As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air. “We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza. Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce. In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday. Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible. The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning. Protests, prisoners Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return. One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for. High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media. Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”. Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration. Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen. There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007. Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries. It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza. Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide.

      "title_orig": "Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan slams Muslim nations for failure to act during Gaza genocide",
      "summary_orig": "Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who was aboard the Gaza-bound Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) and imprisoned by Israel, criticised Muslim governments across the globe for not putting enough pressure on Israel or taking any action to prevent the ongoing genocide. Khan led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel GSF, which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. Khan was detained in Israel for five days before being deported to Jordan. Appearing on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, the ex-senator slammed the federal government, as well as other Muslim governments, for failing to put pressure on Israel to stop its onslaught in the Gaza Strip. Khan also outlined his experience in Israeli captivity during the interview. “What I want to ask is that if Sweden’s Greta [Thunberg] can lead the flotilla, then where are the Muslim countries?” he asked. “Why didn’t the people stand up? I am ashamed that 2 billion Muslims could not do anything. “There were parliamentarians in jail with me. Where were Pakistan’s parliamentarians?” Speaking about Pakistan’s role in the peace plan, specifically the meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Khan highlighted that the 20-point plan unveiled by United States President Donald Trump was a “project of slavery”. “Since they (Israel) could not capture Gaza by force, they tried to capture it through negotiations. That 20-point plan was a slap in Hamas’ face,” he emphasised. He highlighted that the Palestinian Authority’s involvement was also questionable, as they talked about Gaza “minus Hamas” at the UN General Assembly. “The world order had failed; thus, civilians undertook the mission,” Khan said.\nWhen asked about whether the Gaza peace plan would be successful, the ex-senator replied in the affirmative, adding that the people of Europe and their pressure on Israel would be a contributing factor and that they would be able to bring about a ceasefire. “Most of the people in this flotilla, 80 per cent, were Europeans and non-Muslims,” Khan explained. When asked about why Europeans were so fervently campaigning for Palestine, the ex-senator explained that they are complicit in decades of oppression by a colonising force. “On this flotilla, the Westerners decided that they would bring as many Jews on board as possible,” Khan said. “The goal was to show that Zionism is an enemy of humanity and exploits Judaism. The vast majority of Jews do not support Zionists.\n“They would use the f-word when talking about Israel,” he added. The ex-senator also hailed Swedish activist Greta Thunberg as a “hero of humanity” for standing up for the Palestinians. “Greta … a young girl left the world shaken,” he added. “I will invite her to Pakistan.” The senator also floated the idea of a new flotilla mission with participants from across the world, but under the leadership of international Islamic civil society members. “We will make sure that we fly Pakistani flags from the boats,” he vowed. “If the peace plan fails, if a humanitarian corridor is not opened, if the genocide is not stopped and if the culprits of this genocide are not brought to justice, then we will launch our own flotilla ourselves. Behind bars at Ktzi’ot Prison Programme host Hamid Mir pointed out the ex-senator’s loss of weight, to which he replied that it was due to a mix of the journey through the Mediterranean and a three-day hunger strike in jail. “It was a 20-day journey through the Mediterranean to Ashdod Port. We would eat once every 24 hours during the trip, and only ate salan (curry) twice,” Khan said. “There was bread and dates, that was all the food we ate. “In the Israeli jail, we staged a three-day hunger strike. That contributed to my weight loss,” he added, calling the jail a “concentration camp” with a “torture cell”. When asked about his faith in accomplishing the mission, Khan said he did not believe it, but was hopeful that “God would provide a path”. The ex-senator added that he had “exposed Israel’s genocidal face to the world” during the mission. “Malaysia sent the biggest delegation on the flotilla,” the ex-senator said, extending gratitude to Kuala Lumpur for its support. “I went straight to Tunis from Kuala Lumpur; I could not come back to Pakistan because I had several cases against me. I was afraid I’d be stopped at the airport (in Pakistan).” Khan said that he was part of the Palestine Action Coalition and was representing the Pak-Palestine Forum. When asked about the raid, Khan said that the participants had been given standard operating procedures in case of boarding or an Israeli attack. “When we left Crete, we knew that we were in danger of a drone attack,” he explained. He added that there were 50 boats in the flotilla when they left Crete. “This was a journey of four days and nights, so we expected interception and drone attacks. We were instructed to throw our phones and belongings into the sea so that the Israelis couldn’t get them,” the ex-senator said. “When I saw the Israeli navy ships up close, they were paper tigers,” he said. “Their entire navy responded and it took them 12 hours to intercept us all. “My boat, the ‘Allakatalla’ … was the second-last to be intercepted. The last boat was 28 kilometres [from Gaza] when it was intercepted,” he said. “One of the [Israeli] ships was bigger than this building and sailing behind a 12-metre boat; the wake it was creating nearly caused up to capsize.” He added that when the boat was boarded by Israeli commandos, the participants had been ordered to remain nonviolent and not resist at all. Khan said the Israelis shone bright lights at the flotilla and a team of 12 S-13 commandos boarded the vessel. “When they were jumping onto our boat, two of them fell over so badly that we were afraid that they would shoot us because they were scared,” Khan remarked. “Their training was awful, no professionalism. If we had 100 boats and we were not exhausted by the trip, they could not have intercepted us. “The only thing they (the Israeli military) can do is kill babies; they are unable to deal with any resistance.” Recalling his time in Israeli jail, the ex-senator said that Israeli officials expressed disdain for Palestine and ripped the Palestinian flag hoisted on the boat. He added that they forcefully removed the Pakistani flag. “We were ordered not to make eye contact with them (the Israelis). I quietly lifted the flag and put it inside the boat,” he recalled. “We were given instructions like ’hands up, lie face down on the ground. They would kick anyone for the smallest thing. “They assigned two army personnel to each of us. When they asked me where I’m from, I replied that I’m from Pakistan, to which they hurled abuse at me. They were provoking me so that I’d hit them and give them an excuse,” Khan added. “They kept probing us throughout and went through our documents before putting us in a bus to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev Desert, which is infamous for its brutality. We could not see anything from inside the van; there were walls all around.” When asked about what happened in the prison, Khan said that they were forced to remove their clothes and wear “jail clothes”. He added that they were led to their cells “like detainees at Guantanamo Bay”. “There were two big cell blocks; 10 rooms on either side in one of the blocks, with a 30-foot walkway in between,” the ex-senator described. “We were locked in cell number 911. We were called ‘troublemakers’; suddenly, people with guns and dogs entered our cells and forced us into a corner. “They then bound our hands and feet and blindfolded us, before taking us to isolation and then putting us in an open cage outdoors. Our hands were so tightly bound that we could not feel them after two hours. We were not allowed to offer our Maghrib prayers by the guards. We prayed anyway without wudu or prostration.” When asked about his cellmates, he replied that one was an American policeman, a Swiss senator and people from Europe. There were also two Tunisians and two Egyptians. The former senator arrived in Islamabad from Jordan earlier today wearing a keffiyeh and was accorded a hero’s welcome, with people showering him with petals and adorning garlands on the former lawmaker. @dawn.today Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan landed in Islamabad to cheers and applause on Thursday. Khan was part of the Global Sumud Flotilla's mission to Gaza to distribute humanitarian aid. His vessel was intercepted in the late hours of October 1 and he was taken in captivity along with other participants of the GSF. After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com The Pakistan embassy in Jordan, where he was deported to earlier, said late on Wednesday that Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan. In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan. “In accordance with the instructions of the honourable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said. The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post. Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi. According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home. “He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Khan was scheduled to reach Pakistan today. On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said. “Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said. Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted. He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.",

After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com The Pakistan embassy in Jordan, where he was deported to earlier, said late on Wednesday that Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan. In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan. “In accordance with the instructions of the honourable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said. The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post. Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi. According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home. “He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Khan was scheduled to reach Pakistan today. On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said. “Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said. Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted. He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.",

      "summary": "Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who was aboard the Gaza-bound Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) and imprisoned by Israel, criticised Muslim governments across the globe for not putting enough pressure on Israel or taking any action to prevent the ongoing genocide. Khan led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel GSF, which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. Khan was detained in Israel for five days before being deported to Jordan. Appearing on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, the ex-senator slammed the federal government, as well as other Muslim governments, for failing to put pressure on Israel to stop its onslaught in the Gaza Strip. Khan also outlined his experience in Israeli captivity during the interview. “What I want to ask is that if Sweden’s Greta [Thunberg] can lead the flotilla, then where are the Muslim countries?” he asked. “Why didn’t the people stand up? I am ashamed that 2 billion Muslims could not do anything. “There were parliamentarians in jail with me. Where were Pakistan’s parliamentarians?” Speaking about Pakistan’s role in the peace plan, specifically the meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Khan highlighted that the 20-point plan unveiled by United States President Donald Trump was a “project of slavery”. “Since they (Israel) could not capture Gaza by force, they tried to capture it through negotiations. That 20-point plan was a slap in Hamas’ face,” he emphasised. He highlighted that the Palestinian Authority’s involvement was also questionable, as they talked about Gaza “minus Hamas” at the UN General Assembly. “The world order had failed; thus, civilians undertook the mission,” Khan said.\nWhen asked about whether the Gaza peace plan would be successful, the ex-senator replied in the affirmative, adding that the people of Europe and their pressure on Israel would be a contributing factor and that they would be able to bring about a ceasefire. “Most of the people in this flotilla, 80 per cent, were Europeans and non-Muslims,” Khan explained. When asked about why Europeans were so fervently campaigning for Palestine, the ex-senator explained that they are complicit in decades of oppression by a colonising force. “On this flotilla, the Westerners decided that they would bring as many Jews on board as possible,” Khan said. “The goal was to show that Zionism is an enemy of humanity and exploits Judaism. The vast majority of Jews do not support Zionists.\n“They would use the f-word when talking about Israel,” he added. The ex-senator also hailed Swedish activist Greta Thunberg as a “hero of humanity” for standing up for the Palestinians. “Greta … a young girl left the world shaken,” he added. “I will invite her to Pakistan.” The senator also floated the idea of a new flotilla mission with participants from across the world, but under the leadership of international Islamic civil society members. “We will make sure that we fly Pakistani flags from the boats,” he vowed. “If the peace plan fails, if a humanitarian corridor is not opened, if the genocide is not stopped and if the culprits of this genocide are not brought to justice, then we will launch our own flotilla ourselves. Behind bars at Ktzi’ot Prison Programme host Hamid Mir pointed out the ex-senator’s loss of weight, to which he replied that it was due to a mix of the journey through the Mediterranean and a three-day hunger strike in jail. “It was a 20-day journey through the Mediterranean to Ashdod Port. We would eat once every 24 hours during the trip, and only ate salan (curry) twice,” Khan said. “There was bread and dates, that was all the food we ate. “In the Israeli jail, we staged a three-day hunger strike. That contributed to my weight loss,” he added, calling the jail a “concentration camp” with a “torture cell”. When asked about his faith in accomplishing the mission, Khan said he did not believe it, but was hopeful that “God would provide a path”. The ex-senator added that he had “exposed Israel’s genocidal face to the world” during the mission. “Malaysia sent the biggest delegation on the flotilla,” the ex-senator said, extending gratitude to Kuala Lumpur for its support. “I went straight to Tunis from Kuala Lumpur; I could not come back to Pakistan because I had several cases against me. I was afraid I’d be stopped at the airport (in Pakistan).” Khan said that he was part of the Palestine Action Coalition and was representing the Pak-Palestine Forum. When asked about the raid, Khan said that the participants had been given standard operating procedures in case of boarding or an Israeli attack. “When we left Crete, we knew that we were in danger of a drone attack,” he explained. He added that there were 50 boats in the flotilla when they left Crete. “This was a journey of four days and nights, so we expected interception and drone attacks. We were instructed to throw our phones and belongings into the sea so that the Israelis couldn’t get them,” the ex-senator said. “When I saw the Israeli navy ships up close, they were paper tigers,” he said. “Their entire navy responded and it took them 12 hours to intercept us all. “My boat, the ‘Allakatalla’ … was the second-last to be intercepted. The last boat was 28 kilometres [from Gaza] when it was intercepted,” he said. “One of the [Israeli] ships was bigger than this building and sailing behind a 12-metre boat; the wake it was creating nearly caused up to capsize.” He added that when the boat was boarded by Israeli commandos, the participants had been ordered to remain nonviolent and not resist at all. Khan said the Israelis shone bright lights at the flotilla and a team of 12 S-13 commandos boarded the vessel. “When they were jumping onto our boat, two of them fell over so badly that we were afraid that they would shoot us because they were scared,” Khan remarked. “Their training was awful, no professionalism. If we had 100 boats and we were not exhausted by the trip, they could not have intercepted us. “The only thing they (the Israeli military) can do is kill babies; they are unable to deal with any resistance.” Recalling his time in Israeli jail, the ex-senator said that Israeli officials expressed disdain for Palestine and ripped the Palestinian flag hoisted on the boat. He added that they forcefully removed the Pakistani flag. “We were ordered not to make eye contact with them (the Israelis). I quietly lifted the flag and put it inside the boat,” he recalled. “We were given instructions like ’hands up, lie face down on the ground. They would kick anyone for the smallest thing. “They assigned two army personnel to each of us. When they asked me where I’m from, I replied that I’m from Pakistan, to which they hurled abuse at me. They were provoking me so that I’d hit them and give them an excuse,” Khan added. “They kept probing us throughout and went through our documents before putting us in a bus to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev Desert, which is infamous for its brutality. We could not see anything from inside the van; there were walls all around.” When asked about what happened in the prison, Khan said that they were forced to remove their clothes and wear “jail clothes”. He added that they were led to their cells “like detainees at Guantanamo Bay”. “There were two big cell blocks; 10 rooms on either side in one of the blocks, with a 30-foot walkway in between,” the ex-senator described. “We were locked in cell number 911. We were called ‘troublemakers’; suddenly, people with guns and dogs entered our cells and forced us into a corner. “They then bound our hands and feet and blindfolded us, before taking us to isolation and then putting us in an open cage outdoors. Our hands were so tightly bound that we could not feel them after two hours. We were not allowed to offer our Maghrib prayers by the guards. We prayed anyway without wudu or prostration.” When asked about his cellmates, he replied that one was an American policeman, a Swiss senator and people from Europe. There were also two Tunisians and two Egyptians. The former senator arrived in Islamabad from Jordan earlier today wearing a keffiyeh and was accorded a hero’s welcome, with people showering him with petals and adorning garlands on the former lawmaker. @dawn.today Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan landed in Islamabad to cheers and applause on Thursday.
