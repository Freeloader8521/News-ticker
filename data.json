      "summary_orig": "WHILE the US may want regime change in Iran, and Israel the collapse of the established order, internal strife and chaos, it appears that Tehran has stayed safe from US-led military strikes , for the time being at least, because any such action seems less imminent now than it did earlier this week. Speculation abounds about what made US President Donald Trump change his mind — from entreaties by Gulf friends, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, to a seemingly bizarre New York Times report that claimed that the apartheid state’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also asked the US leader not to launch military strikes for the time being. However, in Trump’s own words “nobody” made him change his mind and it was the staying of 800 hangings of protesters that Iran had supposedly planned that was the main reason he had called off the strikes and also because the protesters’ “killing has stopped”. Whatever led to the pause, temporary or permanent, it is a welcome development for the region, which seemed to be sliding towards strife, with worries in the Gulf about Iran’s possible retaliatory missile strikes against American military bases and, who knows, even economic infrastructure such as oil and gas facilities. Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country’s western borders. Perhaps, the most serious challenges would have come Pakistan’s way in either a regime change or collapse-chaos scenario. In the case of regime cha­­­nge, it would not have been surprising to see an administration in Tehran sympathetic to Isra­­el. That would have meant a hostile entity like Israeli intelligence enjoying far greater access to Iran than, for example, Indian intelligence has at present. Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are like a sty in Israel’s eye. And, therefore, you can well imagine the consequences of the latter’s intelligence sitting on our nearly 1,000-kilometre border with Iran, adding to our existing security concerns due to the situation on the Indian and Afghan borders. Coastal security would be another concern. In the other scenario, where a central authority collapse would lead to chaos and fragmentation, it would be reasonable to assume that Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province would be one of the regions affected by any such development, which, in turn, would lead to even more issues across our common, often porous, border. With the same ethnicity straddling the border, you can well imagine the boost the insurgency in our Balochistan could get from the collapse of the central authority in Iran. Israel has enhanced its security through internal strife in Syria. It is the Mossad playbook for all states around it who are not in its pocket. So, Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country’s western borders and up the coast, in the short run at least. But Trump’s decision to impose another 25 per cent tariff on anyone doing business with Iran will deepen the crisis in the sanctions-clamped nation. It was the economic crisis, with the rapidly falling value of the Iranian currency and inflation, that triggered the recent round of street protests. There can be no doubt that the Israeli intelligence service Mossad was involved in arming and instigating some of the protesters as the former CIA chief and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo openly tweeted, but the protests erupted due to the economic mess where even purchasing bread is becoming a problem. This fact was acknowledged by Iran’s spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who said the government needed to address the legitimate concerns of the protesters who had a right to take to the streets. Now a new budget is expected to be presented before parliament to replace the earlier proposal rejected by it. But then, the protests turned violent and the security services were ordered to crack down. Some Tehran-based sources say the protests were peaceful till some elements from among the protesters fired at the security forces and also attacked infrastructure. These sources claimed that, of the 2,000 people killed, some 700 were law-enforcement officers. But these claims were impossible to verify independently. Trump’s tariffs on top of sanctions could create further problems for the Iranian leadership as even the thus far recalcitrant India is having second thoughts about doing business with Iran and has pulled out of the Chabahar port project , which it saw as vital to expanding its trade ties all the way to Central Asia. With the exception of China and Russia, additional US tariffs would be sufficient to discourage the smaller economies from trading with Iran, which would worsen the resource crunch in that country. The oppressive Iranian regime has some serious thinking to do over the coming weeks. The immediate threat of US-Israeli military action may have receded somewhat but the economic crisis is going to worsen. Iran may consider easing restrictions on how women should be attired and create more space for peaceful expression of dissent as a means of reducing tensions within its society. Side by side, it should consider what price tag it wants to attach to its nuclear programme. With its successful and lethal missile programme, it has already gained a degree of effective defence. Only Iran can tell if stopping its enrichment programme in exchange for lifting of sanctions and economic relief is worthwhile. If its missile stockpile, particularly of the hypersonic variant, is what prompted many of its Gulf neighbours and, by some accounts, even Israel, to ask the US not to provoke it by attacking, Iran’s defence shield seems to be working. Only the decision-makers in Tehran will know if that is enough or whether their pursuit of nuclear weapons is non-negotiable. Their past experience of doing a deal with the Obama administration in 2015 to cap enrichment that Trump later annulled is not encouraging. Even then, it’s not clear what other options a country facing economic ruin and internal strife can exercise.

In the other scenario, where a central authority collapse would lead to chaos and fragmentation, it would be reasonable to assume that Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province would be one of the regions affected by any such development, which, in turn, would lead to even more issues across our common, often porous, border. With the same ethnicity straddling the border, you can well imagine the boost the insurgency in our Balochistan could get from the collapse of the central authority in Iran. Israel has enhanced its security through internal strife in Syria. It is the Mossad playbook for all states around it who are not in its pocket. So, Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country’s western borders and up the coast, in the short run at least. But Trump’s decision to impose another 25 per cent tariff on anyone doing business with Iran will deepen the crisis in the sanctions-clamped nation. It was the economic crisis, with the rapidly falling value of the Iranian currency and inflation, that triggered the recent round of street protests. There can be no doubt that the Israeli intelligence service Mossad was involved in arming and instigating some of the protesters as the former CIA chief and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo openly tweeted, but the protests erupted due to the economic mess where even purchasing bread is becoming a problem. This fact was acknowledged by Iran’s spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who said the government needed to address the legitimate concerns of the protesters who had a right to take to the streets. Now a new budget is expected to be presented before parliament to replace the earlier proposal rejected by it. But then, the protests turned violent and the security services were ordered to crack down. Some Tehran-based sources say the protests were peaceful till some elements from among the protesters fired at the security forces and also attacked infrastructure. These sources claimed that, of the 2,000 people killed, some 700 were law-enforcement officers. But these claims were impossible to verify independently. Trump’s tariffs on top of sanctions could create further problems for the Iranian leadership as even the thus far recalcitrant India is having second thoughts about doing business with Iran and has pulled out of the Chabahar port project , which it saw as vital to expanding its trade ties all the way to Central Asia. With the exception of China and Russia, additional US tariffs would be sufficient to discourage the smaller economies from trading with Iran, which would worsen the resource crunch in that country. The oppressive Iranian regime has some serious thinking to do over the coming weeks. The immediate threat of US-Israeli military action may have receded somewhat but the economic crisis is going to worsen. Iran may consider easing restrictions on how women should be attired and create more space for peaceful expression of dissent as a means of reducing tensions within its society. Side by side, it should consider what price tag it wants to attach to its nuclear programme. With its successful and lethal missile programme, it has already gained a degree of effective defence. Only Iran can tell if stopping its enrichment programme in exchange for lifting of sanctions and economic relief is worthwhile. If its missile stockpile, particularly of the hypersonic variant, is what prompted many of its Gulf neighbours and, by some accounts, even Israel, to ask the US not to provoke it by attacking, Iran’s defence shield seems to be working. Only the decision-makers in Tehran will know if that is enough or whether their pursuit of nuclear weapons is non-negotiable. Their past experience of doing a deal with the Obama administration in 2015 to cap enrichment that Trump later annulled is not encouraging. Even then, it’s not clear what other options a country facing economic ruin and internal strife can exercise.

      "summary_orig": "IRAN’S clerical regime seems to have weathered yet another wave of internal resistance, exploited, as always, by its external rivals. But the human losses have left a deep new wound on the Iranian psyche. The immediate threat of a US-Israeli strike has also dispersed . Washington and Tel Aviv, backed by most Gulf capitals, recalibrated their stance after strategic assessments highlighted the danger of a wider regional war and the absence of any realistic plan for a post-regime change scenario. Inside Iran, resistance against the establishment still struggles to form a unified front or leadership. However, this does not mean the US, Israel or their allies have dropped the goal of political change in Tehran. Instead, they are adjusting their methods. Media reports indicate the regime will not collapse quickly due to a strong security apparatus, loyal institutions, and backing from a sizable segment of the population. Even so, external actors, along with internal resistance networks, are unlikely to allow the regime much time to fully recover from this crisis. Pressure is expected to persist, shifting from low to high intensity, to gradually soften the ground for change. A key indicator that the ground is fertile for such a shift are the visible cracks within the Assembly of Experts (Majles-i-Khobregan-i-Rahbari), the Guardian Council (Shura-i-Negahban), and disputes within or between the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the regular military (Artesh). All these critical institutions are still aligned with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s core strategic worldview, as one Iranian-origin expert noted. The recent internal resistance has emboldened separatist elements in Arab and Kurdish regions. To break the regime’s coherence, external actors would not only seek to energise internal political resistance but also exploit other domestic fault lines, including fuelling dormant or active insurgencies. Analysts speculate that separatist and anti-clerical movements are concentrated in several key regions: Khuzestan province in the southwest, where many Arab Iranians harbour grievances; the western border areas, including Kurdistan and West Azerbaijan, where Kurdish separatists remain active; and, from a Pakistani perspective, the Baloch districts in Sistan-Baluchestan and parts of the Khorasan region, where anti-regime Baloch insurgent groups continue their operations. As Vali Nasr explains in his latest book, Iran’s Grand Strategy, the clerical regime’s doctrine of ‘forward defence’, projecting power abroad to protect the state at home, can also be turned against Iran. Its adversaries can adopt the same approach to weaken the regime from within. Iran’s enemies have already disrupted the Axis of Resistance, the network of Iranian regional proxies built around this forward defence strategy. The next step, as a few analysts suggest, could be the deployment or activation of proxies inside Iran itself. If this occurs, the primary objective would be to draw the Iranian Revolutionary Guard into a deeper engagement on the internal front. An amalgam of political resistance and armed struggle can strain Iranian forces, especially when their proxies cannot come to their aid, as Iran’s Axis of Resistance is weak and unable to provide any support. These broader trends are now evident on the ground. Although reports suggest that the recent internal resistance has emboldened separatist elements in Arab and Kurdish regions, it is in the Sistan-Balochestan belt where several militant outfits have reportedly formed a stronger coalition to intensify their campaign against the Iranian state. Jaishul Adl is a Baloch separatist group operating along the Iran-Pakistan border. It frequently targets Iranian security forces in Baloch-majority regions. The group now calls itself the People’s Fighters Front (PFF). Three smaller militant outfits, the Nasr Movement, the Pada Baloch Movement, and the Muhammad Rasul Allah Group, have reportedly merged into this new organisation. This rebranding is significant. By shedding its overtly religious identity, Jaishul Adl is attempting to project a more accommodative, secular nationalist profile that resonates better with the region’s relatively moderate Baloch population. It also aligns the group’s ideology with that of other nationalist insurgent movements, such as the terrorist Baloch organisations BLF and BLA and Kurdish groups like PJAK. Such a shift is also likely to make the organisation more eligible for support and funding from the Baloch and Iranian diaspora, as well as other external backers. Strategically, the makeover aims to make the group acceptable to the West and the Arab world. It mirrors Abdolmalik Rigi’s approach. He was the founder of a Baloch militant group in Iran and sought Western backing but failed, as the global war on terrorism was at its peak then. This is a different time. If separatist groups inside Iran become more active, they might join forces with Baloch separatists in Pakistan, who have sharpened their skills. Some experts are unsure about this, arguing that the PFF has long been seen as Saudi-backed. Since Riyadh maintains strong ties with Pakistan, the alliance seems unlikely. But if the PFF has gained support from other external players, it could act with more strategic independence. Baloch separatist groups on both sides of the border ultimately subscribe to the idea of a ‘Greater Balochistan’. This concept spans regions of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, making cross-border cooperation a possibility. If turmoil grows in Sistan-Baluchestan, many terrorist actors could get involved. These could include IS elements and militants who have left Ahmed al-Sharaa’s networks in Syria. As this region is part of the Golden Crescent, a hub for drug trafficking and human smuggling, the ongoing instability could create a chaotic zone across Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Any significant political shift in Iran will inevitably affect Pakistan with its broad geopolitical and geoeconomic consequences. While certain outcomes may offer limited strategic advantages for Pakistan, escalating instability along the Iran-Pakistan border would raise internal security pressures and could generate serious frictions with the regime in Tehran.

We don’t share the concerns of the Greens on that one, and we’ve made that clear to them in the last week.

      "summary_orig": "In the theatre of global politics, a ‘doctrine’ is more than just a policy paper. It is a nation’s strategic DNA. From the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which fenced off the western hemisphere from European monarchs, to the 1947 Truman Doctrine that looked to aggressively ‘contain’ Soviet communism, these blueprints signal a country’s core values, and the consequences for those who cross them. In 1968, the Soviet Union introduced the Brezhnev Doctrine, asserting Moscow’s right to militarily intervene in socialist countries being threatened by capitalist/pro-US forces. Fast forward to the 21st century, and the blueprints have become increasingly aggressive. We’ve seen the Bush Doctrine’s ‘strike first, ask questions later’ approach (‘preemptive strikes’), and Russia’s Gerasimov Doctrine, which treats disinformation and cyberattacks as the new artillery. We see the Xi Jinping Doctrine seeking to enhance China’s glory through the sprawling veins of the Belt and Road Initiative, while Donald Trump’s recent ‘Donroe’ Doctrine is an obsession with border walls, drug cartels and keeping Chinese influence out of ‘America’s backyard.’ But doctrines are not static. They mutate. They adapt to the scent of power and economic reality. This is apparent in Pakistan as well. Pakistan began with its founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s high-minded idealism, but was quickly forced into a security-first straitjacket by the shadow of a much larger India. Pakistan’s national ‘doctrine’ has continued to mutate according to the whims of those in power, thus resulting in an often erratic and haphazard approach to strategy-building By 1958, the harsh realities of the Cold War had taken hold. Upon seizing power, Gen Ayub Khan established a doctrine that firmly anchored Pakistan within Western alliances. This manoeuvre was shaped to leverage US military and economic assistance to balance the scales with India, while simultaneously energising an ambitious industrialisation and modernisation programme at home. The Ayub regime fell in 1969. Under another dictator, Gen Yahya Khan, the country’s eastern wing broke away in 1971 to become Bangladesh. Rising to power in the wake of the 1971 crisis, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose party had secured a majority in the country’s western wing during the 1970 elections, began to forge a new national path. Bhutto’s doctrine was designed to reinvent Pakistan’s identity and champion a strategy that moved away from heavy Western dependency in favour of stronger ties with oil-rich Arab states, the ‘Islamic Bloc’, and the burgeoning ‘Third World’ movement. Most significantly, the doctrine established the groundwork for Pakistan’s nuclear programme, which Bhutto envisioned as the essential equaliser to offset India’s military strength. Bhutto’s regime fell in a military coup in 1977. The coup-maker, Gen Ziaul Haq decided to stay on. A Zia Doctrine emerged. It prioritised a policy of domestic ‘Islamisation’, while positioning Pakistan as a frontline state in a US-backed anti-Soviet ‘Afghan jihad.’ Consequently, the Zia dictatorship secured extensive American support, which Zia used as a cover to accelerate the country’s nuclear programme under a cloak of plausible deniability. During this era, the concept of ‘strategic depth’ also took root. This strategy sought to establish a pro-Pakistan government in Afghanistan, to ensure a secure territory where Pakistani armed forces could regroup in the event of conflict with India. Following Zia’s death in a 1988 plane crash, the Zia Doctrine remained a powerful influence over Pakistan’s foreign and domestic policies throughout the turbulent ‘decade of democracy’ that followed. In 1999, the political landscape shifted again when Gen Pervez Musharraf seized power in a coup. Now there was a Musharraf Doctrine. It was fundamentally defined by the global upheaval of the 9/11 attacks. Adopting a ‘Pakistan first’ mantra, Musharraf attempted to balance a high-stakes role as a key US ally in the ‘War on Terror’ with a domestic social vision known as ‘enlightened moderation.’ However, the doctrine ultimately collapsed as the country faced the dual pressures of surging Islamist militancy and widespread internal unrest. From 2008 onward, a ‘hybrid system’ began to take shape, creating a political mechanism through which civilian governments were elected to office but remained tethered to strategic doctrines drafted by the military leadership. A landmark shift occurred in 2013, with the emergence of the Raheel Sharif Doctrine, authored by the-then army chief. This doctrine represented a fundamental departure from traditional thinking by officially acknowledging that internal militancy posed a far greater existential threat to Pakistan than its historical rivalry with India. This shift was swiftly operationalised through a massive military offensive launched to dismantle Islamist sanctuaries and neutralise militant networks. Then, a Bajwa Doctrine surfaced during the tenure of Imran Khan, marking an attempt by former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to once again alter Pakistan’s national security focus. The core of this doctrine was a shift toward geo-economics, prioritising regional trade, transit and the infrastructure connectivity promised by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). However, this vision ultimately fractured under the weight of mounting civil-military discord. While the military leadership sought regional stability to facilitate economic growth, the Khan administration remained preoccupied with an aggressive campaign against political rivals and a polarising effort to ‘rehabilitate’ Islamist militants. This divergence in priorities, exacerbated by the stagnation of key CPEC projects, strained the working relationship between Khan and Bajwa. The resulting deadlock concluded in 2022, with Khan’s removal from office through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence. Appointed as Bajwa’s successor by a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led coalition, Gen Asim Munir oversaw the emergence of what is often referred to as the ‘Munir Model.’ Its outcome is perhaps the most rooted institutionalisation of military authority in Pakistan’s history. At its heart lies the concept of economic sovereignty, a framework where the military has moved to take a more active role in steering the nation’s economics. Strategically, the model is defined by a ‘zero-tolerance’ posture, as it maintains a relentless, uncompromising stance against Islamist militants and Baloch separatists. The model views internal security and economic stability as two sides of the same coin. By fusing state survival with economic growth and military muscle, the doctrine aims to project Pakistan as an assertive regional power. Geopolitically, the Munir Model is characterised by an intense anti-India tilt. It is deeply pro-China, and closely aligned with Saudi Arabia, while maintaining a pragmatic engagement with the US. Domestically, the model identifies political populism as an existential threat to the state’s functional integrity. Notably, the doctrine seeks to trim the Islamist dimension from Pakistani nationalism that was added by the Zia Doctrine. While Munir’s doctrine remains rooted in Pakistani nationalism, it replaces Islamist fervour with a brand of ‘rational Islam’ and hard-nosed pragmatism. The model has been a success on many fronts, but it will continue to be tested in an increasingly turbulent and mutating geopolitical landscape. Published in Dawn, EOS, January 18th, 2026",

      "title_orig": "Ukraine war briefing: Russia readying strikes on nuclear power system, Zelenskyy warns",
      "summary_orig": "Kyrylo Budanov arrives in US heading delegation for further talks on peace proposals. What we know on day 1,425 Russia is taking aim at Ukraine’s nuclear power system , Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday, as the Kremlin continues to try to freeze Ukraine into submission by crippling its energy grid. “We do not see any willingness on the part of the aggressor to comply with any agreements or end the war,” the Ukrainian president said. “Instead, there is ample information about preparations for further Russian strikes on our energy sector and infrastructure, including facilities and networks that serve our nuclear power plants . Each such Russian strike on the energy sector amid such a harsh winter weakens and undermines the efforts of key states – in particular the United States – to end this war.” Zelenskyy spoke after a briefing from Ukraine’s chief of defence intelligence, Oleh Ivashchenko – the recent replacement for Kyrylo Budanov, who was made head of the president’s office. Budanov on Saturday confirmed his own arrival in the US to discuss peace proposals . He and Ukrainian negotiators Rustem Umerov and Davyd Arakhamia would meet with US envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner and the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll, Budanov said. Zelenskyy has tasked his delegation at the Miami talks with finalising proposals about security guarantees and economic recovery. If American officials approve the proposals, the US and Ukraine could sign a deal next week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, according to Zelenskyy. However Russia has given no indication it will accept any peace deal without Ukraine’s entire Donbas region being handed over for a start. Russian attacks left at least two people dead and others injured in Kharkiv oblast on Saturday, regional authorities said. A strike that damaged a critical infrastructure facility in Kharkiv city’s industrial district could seriously affect power and heating, said the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, with the energy system “constantly operating at its limits”. One person was wounded in the attack. An attack on a house in Kharkiv city killed a woman aged 20 and wounded others. In the village of Borivske, a 52-year-old woman was killed when a drone hit a public transport stop, prosecutors said. In the Sumy region, emergency services said an airstrike on a residential neighbourhood wounded three women and a seven-year-old child, and left 15 residential buildings damaged. Russia struck energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s Kyiv and Odesa regions overnight into Saturday, the ministry of energy said. More than 20 settlements in the Kyiv region were left without power. Zelenskyy said Ukraine needed to ramp up the importation of electricity and the acquisition of additional equipment from partners. Officials have instructed state energy companies Ukrzaliznytsia, Naftogaz and Ukroboronprom to urgently purchase imported electricity covering at least 50% of their own consumption , according to Denys Shmyhal, the energy minister. Shmyhal announced that Lithuania would be providing Ukraine with more energy generating equipment for Kyiv and the most critically affected regions, after already supplying equipment for emergency repairs on coal and nuclear power plants. “In addition we have received over 2,000 solar panels, various equipment and machinery from our Lithuanian friends,” Shmyhal said. “Lithuania has contributed €5.7m euros to the energy support fund of Ukraine … There is not a single power plant left in Ukraine that has not been hit by Russian strikes. Ukrainian energy workers continue to repair around the clock and return electricity to people.” Continue reading...",

      "title_orig": "Trump invites world leaders to join Gaza ‘Board of Peace’",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump’s so-called “Board of Peace” for post-war Gaza began to take shape on Saturday, with the leaders of Egypt, Turkiye, Argentina and Canada asked to join. The announcements from those leaders came after the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel. Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory, which lies in rubble after two-plus years of relentless Israeli bombardment. The moves came after a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue. In Canada, a senior aide to Prime Minister Mark Carney said he intended to accept Trump’s invitation, while in Turkiye, a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he had been asked to become a “founding member” of the board. Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said Cairo was “studying” a request for President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to join. Sharing an image of the invitation letter, Argentine President Javier Milei wrote on X that it would be “an honor” to participate in the initiative. Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the heads of state of around 60 countries had recieved the charter of Trump’s proposed ‘Board of Peace’. The document was sent to 60 heads of state — including in Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia — along with an invitation to join the board, the publication reported while quoting diplomatic sources. According to the document, the board will work to “restore dependable and lawful governance and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,” in place of other organisations, the report said. “The charter also implicitly criticises the UN. It opens with emphasising the need for ‘a more nimble and effective international peace-building body’, adding that durable peace requires ‘the courage to depart from … institutions that have too often failed’,” the report added. Meanwhile, in a statement sent to AFP , Blair said: “I thank President Trump for his leadership in establishing the Board of Peace and am honored to be appointed to its Executive Board.” Blair is a controversial figure in the Middle East because of his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Trump himself said last year that he wanted to make sure Blair was an “acceptable choice to everybody”. Blair spent years focused on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as representative of the “Middle East Quartet” — the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia — after leaving Downing Street in 2007. The White House said the Board of Peace will take on issues such as “governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding and capital mobilisation”. The other members of the board so far are World Bank President Ajay Banga, an Indian-born American businessman; billionaire US financier Marc Rowan; and Robert Gabriel, a loyal Trump aide who serves on the US National Security Council. Trump has created a second “Gaza executive board” that appears designed to have a more advisory role. It was not immediately clear which world leaders were asked to be on each board. The White House, which said on Friday that additional members would be named to both entities, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Israel objects to line-up of Gaza governing body Separately, Israel said on Saturday it objected to the line-up of the Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern post-war Gaza, which began its work in Cairo this week. “The announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy,” said a statement from the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “The prime minister has instructed the foreign affairs minister to contact the US secretary of state on this matter,” it added. Israel strikes Washington has said the Gaza plan had gone on to a second phase — from implementing the ceasefire to disarming Hamas. On Friday, Trump named US Major General Jasper Jeffers to head the International Stabilisation Force, which will be tasked with providing security in Gaza and training a new police force to succeed Hamas. Jeffers, from special operations in US Central Command, in late 2024 was put in charge of monitoring a ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel, which has continued periodic strikes aimed at Hezbollah militants. Gaza native and former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath was earlier tapped to head the governing committee. Trump, a real estate developer, has previously mused about turning devastated Gaza into a Riviera-style area of resorts, although he has backed away from calls to forcibly displace the population.",

      "summary_orig": "The Ministry of Maritime Affairs on Saturday constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the cause of a fire at the Karachi International Container Terminal (KICT) a day earlier. Imported goods, mostly lithium batteries, stored in at least 20 containers were destroyed as a huge fire erupted at the KICT at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) on Friday afternoon, according to officials. A press release issued on Saturday said that Maritime Affairs Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry had constituted an inquiry committee to investigate the cause of the fire and to “fix responsibility to prevent similar incidents in the future”. The committee will comprise senior officers from KPT, who will coordinate with KICT operators to determine the reasons for the incident, it said. “KICT is a private terminal and the primary responsibility for safety measures at the container terminal rests with its administration,” the minister was quoted as saying. The press release further said the minister took immediate notice of the incident and directed all concerned officials, including KPT Chairman Rear Admiral (retd) Shahid Ahmed, to utilise all available resources to bring the blaze under control and also sought a detailed report on the incident. The statement said the KPT team supervised the firefighting operation and brought the fire under control, adding that no loss of life was reported. It added that the minister also announced appreciation certificates for members of the KPT team involved in the firefighting operation, and particularly lauded the role of KPT General Manager (Engineering) Rear Admiral Kashif Munir and his team. He added that the extent of financial losses and the exact cause of the fire were yet to be determined, and that investigations were ongoing, the statement said. The statement also said that a report by KPT was submitted on the directives of the minister. According to the report, the fire erupted at around 1:35pm near Berth Number 27 at KICT Terminal, Karachi Port. The incident was reported to KPT Central Fire Brigade and fire tenders were dispatched to the scene, the statement said. “Upon arrival, it was observed that the fire/smoke was spreading quickly in the closely placed set of containers which were also placed on one another [ sic ],” it said. It said that KPT fire tenders responded effectively in containing the fire, while support was also requested from the Pakistan Navy, the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works and Rescue 1122. “The report stated a total of eight fire tenders from KPT were deployed on-site, supported by four fire tenders from the Pakistan Navy, one from Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works and two fire tenders from Rescue 1122,” it added. “Through swift action, effective coordination, and professional handling by all responding teams, the fire was successfully brought under control, preventing its spread and ensuring the safety of port infrastructure and operations,” the press release said. South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn on Friday that during the initial probe, it emerged that the fire erupted due to a short circuit inside a container.",

According to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat, the speaker made the remarks while visiting the National College of Arts (NCA) in Lahore. “Negative or controversial remarks on the role of the judiciary, the armed forces of Pakistan and judges are unacceptable,” he said. He further stated that any kind of remarks against the armed forces was “intolerable”. He further stated that only those remarks that fell within the ambit of the law and the Constitution would be allowed. “Those who speak against Pakistan will not be allowed to express their views on the floor of the National Assembly,” he was quoted as saying. Sadiq further asserted that as the NA speaker, he would continue to play an impartial role. He further said that in a democratic society, protesting was a citizen’s right. However, this protest should be peaceful and remain within the ambit of the law and the Constitution, he said. “There is no room for arson, damage to life and property or vandalism,” Sadiq was quoted as saying, adding that the “use of sticks and weapons” was a threat to the rule of law. The development comes a little over a month after Senate Deputy Chairman Syedal Khan Nasar barred criticism of “national heroes” and political leadership in the House. “You cannot speak against political heroes who suffered martyrdom, went into exile, worked for the nation and the country, conducted nuclear tests, and made [the] nuclear bomb,” he had remarked just after finishing the day’s agenda amid voices of dissent from the opposition benches. He had later vowed to enforce his ruling. In an informal conversation with media persons at the Parliament House, he had made it clear that derogatory or disrespectful remarks against national heroes whether from the armed forces, politics, judiciary, or any national institution cannot be tolerated within the House. “Every member has the right to express views, but that right must be exercised within the constitutional framework, rules of procedure, and established parliamentary traditions,” he had emphasised.",

He further stated that any kind of remarks against the armed forces was “intolerable”. He further stated that only those remarks that fell within the ambit of the law and the Constitution would be allowed. “Those who speak against Pakistan will not be allowed to express their views on the floor of the National Assembly,” he was quoted as saying. Sadiq further asserted that as the NA speaker, he would continue to play an impartial role. He further said that in a democratic society, protesting was a citizen’s right. However, this protest should be peaceful and remain within the ambit of the law and the Constitution, he said. “There is no room for arson, damage to life and property or vandalism,” Sadiq was quoted as saying, adding that the “use of sticks and weapons” was a threat to the rule of law. The development comes a little over a month after Senate Deputy Chairman Syedal Khan Nasar barred criticism of “national heroes” and political leadership in the House. “You cannot speak against political heroes who suffered martyrdom, went into exile, worked for the nation and the country, conducted nuclear tests, and made [the] nuclear bomb,” he had remarked just after finishing the day’s agenda amid voices of dissent from the opposition benches. He had later vowed to enforce his ruling. In an informal conversation with media persons at the Parliament House, he had made it clear that derogatory or disrespectful remarks against national heroes whether from the armed forces, politics, judiciary, or any national institution cannot be tolerated within the House. “Every member has the right to express views, but that right must be exercised within the constitutional framework, rules of procedure, and established parliamentary traditions,” he had emphasised.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: A district and sessions court on Saturday reissued non-bailable arrest warrants against Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, for their repeated absences from trial proceedings. In the case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. Court proceedings on Saturday were conducted over three sittings — 9am, noon and 2pm. At each stage, Imaan and Hadi were absent from the proceedings. In the certified copies of court orders dated January 17, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka — presiding over the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Court (Islamabad-West) — noted that earlier warrants could not be executed despite repeated attempts by law enforcement and the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA). During the proceedings, officials from the NCCIA submitted reports stating that the non-bailable warrants had returned unexecuted, with NCCIA Assistant Director Imran Haider informing the court that the accused had intentionally concealed themselves to avoid arrest. At one point during the day, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad requested an adjournment until Monday, arguing that the accused had challenged the court’s January 15 order cancelling their bail before the Islamabad High Court. The court subsequently accepted the request but ordered that non-bailable warrants be reissued against the accused. Judge Majoka further directed the Islamabad deputy inspector general (Operations) and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre In-Charge Muhammad Iqbal to depute senior officers — not below the rank of superintendent of police or deputy director — from the NCCIA to execute the arrest warrants. The court ordered that once Imaan and Hadi were arrested, they could be produced via video link to join proceedings on Monday. On Thursday, the same court had cancelled Imaan and Hadi’s bail following repeated absences and heated scenes in the courtroom. The court had expressed displeasure over the conduct of the accused and the defence, revoked their right to cross-examination, and ordered that their statements under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) be recorded. The prosecution, led by Special Public Prosecutor Rana Usman, had opposed adjournments, while the courtroom proceedings had been disrupted by a heated exchange between the prosecutor and Islamabad District Bar Association President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, prompting the judge to briefly rise from the bench. The case will now be taken up on Monday, subject to the execution of the arrest warrants. The case stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the NCCIA, Islamabad. The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The first information report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. The accused were indicted in the case in October last year.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday accused US President Donald Trump of being responsible for “casualties” during a protest wave in the country that rights groups said was met with a deadly crackdown. “We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation,” he told a crowd of supporters during an address marking a religious holiday. “This was an American conspiracy,” Khamenei said, adding that “America’s goal is to swallow Iran … the goal is to put Iran back under military, political and economic domination”. “By God’s grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition,” he said. “We do not intend to lead the country to war, but we will not spare domestic criminals,” he added, saying that “international criminals” were “worse” and would also not be spared punishment. Iranian authorities have blamed the United States for fuelling a “terrorist operation” that they say hijacked peaceful protests over the economy. Iran was rocked by weeks of demonstrations sparked by anger over economic hardship that exploded into the biggest protests against the Islamic republic in more than three years. Meanwhile, after repeated warnings, Trump on Thursday had changed his stance on military intervention in Iran, adopting a “watch it and see” posture instead. He had cited assurances from “very important sources on the other side” indicating that Tehran had ceased using lethal force against demonstrators. “They’ve said the killing has stopped and the executions won’t take place,” Trump said. Asked by a reporter if US military action was now off the table, the president replied: “We’re going to watch it and see what the process is.”",

      "summary_en": "Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday accused US President Donald Trump of being responsible for “casualties” during a protest wave in the country that rights groups said was met with a deadly crackdown. “We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation,” he told a crowd of supporters during an address marking a religious holiday. “This was an American conspiracy,” Khamenei said, adding that “America’s goal is to swallow Iran … the goal is to put Iran back under military, political and economic domination”. “By God’s grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition,” he said. “We do not intend to lead the country to war, but we will not spare domestic criminals,” he added, saying that “international criminals” were “worse” and would also not be spared punishment. Iranian authorities have blamed the United States for fuelling a “terrorist operation” that they say hijacked peaceful protests over the economy.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Saturday condemned the reported profiling of mosques and mosque management committees in India-occupied Kashmir, saying the “blatant intrusion into religious affairs constitutes a grave violation of the fundamental right to freedom of religion and belief”. The FO’s statement comes after police in the occupied valley distributed forms to “collect” financial and personal details of mosques and seminaries, including mosque leaders and members of management committees, according to a report by the Hindustan Times , which quoted local residents and Kashmiri leaders. The action “reflects yet another coercive attempt to intimidate and marginalise the Muslim population of the occupied territory,” the FO said. The forms included sections for seminary teachers and mosque leaders to provide details of their “Aadhaar cards, bank accounts, property ownership, social media handles, passport, ration card, driving licence, SIM cards and mobile phone model along with the IMEI”, the Hindustan Times reported. It added that details regarding the “religious sect” of the mosques were also sought. A lawmaker from Srinagar called it “an infringement of the religious freedom guaranteed under the Indian Constitution,” saying the move aimed to “control religion and mosques”, the report said. In the statement released on Saturday, the FO said, “The forcible collection of personal details, photographs and sectarian affiliations of religious functionaries amounts to systematic harassment, aimed at instilling fear among worshippers and obstructing the free exercise of their faith. “These actions form part of a broader pattern of institutionalised Islamophobia driven by the Hindutva ideology of the occupying Indian government,” said the statement, adding the “selective targeting of mosques and Muslim clergy lays bare the discriminatory and communal character of these policies”. The FO maintained that the “people of Jammu and Kashmir possess an inalienable right to practice their religion without fear, coercion or discrimination”. “Pakistan will continue to stand in solidarity with them and will persist in raising its voice against all forms of religious persecution and intolerance targeting Kashmiris,” said the statement. In November, United Nations experts sounded the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the Indian government, issuing the warning in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.",
