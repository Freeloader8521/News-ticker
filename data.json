      "summary_orig": "As the Foreign Office sought clarification from India via a letter over a sudden variation in the Chenab River’s flow, the situation is badly affecting wheat and other crops being fed through the Marala-Ravi link and other canals in various parts of Punjab. “The situation is really disturbing as the Chenab River’s control from upstream (India) is being handled by the Indian authorities through various run-of-the-river hydropower projects,” a senior official of the Punjab Irrigation Department said while speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity.* “When India releases the water from dams towards downstream (Pakistan) without informing us, the flow suddenly increases. Sometimes, they hold water for days, reducing flow massively,” He continued, “Once the river inflows recorded at Marala reduced to 1,500 cusecs, leaving us with no option but to stop outflows.” “The situation is very serious and strange for us, as the growers, in several villages, couldn’t water wheat crops due to the lack of water flow they used to receive through various canals.” According to daily reports of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks was found to be alarming from December 9-18. The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on December 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on December 10. No outflows were monitored from Dec. 11-17, with 3,700 cusecs of inflows on Dec. 11, 3,800 on Dec. 12, 3,000 on Dec. 13, 2,000 on Dec. 14, 2,000 on Dec. 15, 1,800 on Dec. 16 and 3,800 on Dec. 17. Ameer Langra, a local grower of Mauza Sahib Langra from Baqir Pur Union Council, Kabirwala, Khanewal, told Dawn , “We rarely irrigate wheat crop by purchasing water from tube well owners when we have no water in designated channels. “Sometimes, we see a sudden rise in water courses, while other times the respective canals and water courses don’t receive a single drop of water,” he said, adding that a large number of growers weren’t able to water their crops fully. “It is affecting the main and other crops as well.” Langra told Dawn that his area was already facing water scarcity due to the closure of a large number of tube wells after the recent floods swept them away. “We appeal to the government to help us and ensure water availability to save our farming.” Pakistan Kissan Ittehad President Khalid Khokar, while speaking to Dawn, condemned the Indian government for water aggression and termed it a serious violation of the Indus Water Treaty. “Many cultivators have complained about variations in water levels in the river and its impact on the agricultural activities,” he said, requesting the government to take up the issue with India and international forums. FO seeks clarification from India Earlier today, in a weekly press briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi shared that a letter had been written to India seeking clarification about the “abrupt variation” in the flow of the Chenab River, noting the matter had been in the news in the past week. Several media outlets reported this week that India had released water into the Chenab River. “Pakistan views these variations with extreme concern and seriousness. They allude to unilateral release of water into the Chenab River by India, without any prior notification,” Andrabi said. “Our Indus water commissioner has written a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matters in accordance with the procedures enshrined in the Indus Waters Treaty,” he said. “Any manipulation of river flow by India, especially at a critical time of our agricultural cycle, directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as food and economic security of our citizens,” he said. “We call upon India to respond to the queries raised by the Pakistani Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flow and fulfil its obligations in letter and spirit under the Indus Water Treaty provisions,” he said. He further said that the Indus Waters Treaty was a “binding international agreement”, which had been “an instrument of peace and security and stability in the region”. Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin. Andrabi said that violating the treaty threatened the “inviolability of international treaties and compliance with international law” and also posed a serious threat to “regional peace, principles of good neighbourliness, and norms governing interstate relations”. “The international community must take notice of India’s continued disregard of a bilateral treaty, and counsel India to act responsibly and in accordance with international law and established norms as well as its own obligations,” Andrabi said. “Pakistan remains committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes and issues with India but will not compromise on the existential water rights of the people of our country,” he said. In April, India had held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war” , noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. The supplemental award was issued in a 2023 case that Pakistan brought to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty. Removal of Indian woman’s hijab During his press briefing, the FO spokesperson also talked about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar pulling down a female doctor’s hijab this week, a move which had invited criticism. Noting the incident, Andrabi said that the incident was followed by the “public mocking” of a minister from Uttar Pradesh. A minister from Uttar Pradesh had defended Kumar, before backtracking. “The forcible removal of the Muslim woman’s hijab by a senior political leader and subsequent public ridicule of this act are deeply disturbing and warrant strong condemnation,” he said. “The action risks normalising the humiliation of Muslim women in India. The conduct also demonstrates public disrespect of India’s religious minorities, particularly its Muslim citizens,” he said. “Such conduct reflects a broader and troubling pattern associated with Hindutva-inspired politics, namely the alarming rise of religious intolerance and Islamophobia,” he added. “We urge all responsible stakeholders and the Indian government to recognise the seriousness of this incident and to reaffirm their commitment to the protection of minority rights, respect for religious freedom, and the preservation of human dignity,” he said.",

A minister from Uttar Pradesh had defended Kumar, before backtracking. “The forcible removal of the Muslim woman’s hijab by a senior political leader and subsequent public ridicule of this act are deeply disturbing and warrant strong condemnation,” he said. “The action risks normalising the humiliation of Muslim women in India. The conduct also demonstrates public disrespect of India’s religious minorities, particularly its Muslim citizens,” he said. “Such conduct reflects a broader and troubling pattern associated with Hindutva-inspired politics, namely the alarming rise of religious intolerance and Islamophobia,” he added. “We urge all responsible stakeholders and the Indian government to recognise the seriousness of this incident and to reaffirm their commitment to the protection of minority rights, respect for religious freedom, and the preservation of human dignity,” he said.",
      "title": "Sudden variation in Chenab River’s flow affect wheat, other crops in Punjab",
      "summary": "As the Foreign Office sought clarification from India via a letter over a sudden variation in the Chenab River’s flow, the situation is badly affecting wheat and other crops being fed through the Marala-Ravi link and other canals in various parts of Punjab. “The situation is really disturbing as the Chenab River’s control from upstream (India) is being handled by the Indian authorities through various run-of-the-river hydropower projects,” a senior official of the Punjab Irrigation Department said while speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity.* “When India releases the water from dams towards downstream (Pakistan) without informing us, the flow suddenly increases. Sometimes, they hold water for days, reducing flow massively,” He continued, “Once the river inflows recorded at Marala reduced to 1,500 cusecs, leaving us with no option but to stop outflows.” “The situation is very serious and strange for us, as the growers, in several villages, couldn’t water wheat crops due to the lack of water flow they used to receive through various canals.” According to daily reports of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks was found to be alarming from December 9-18. The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on December 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on December 10. No outflows were monitored from Dec. 11-17, with 3,700 cusecs of inflows on Dec. 11, 3,800 on Dec. 12, 3,000 on Dec. 13, 2,000 on Dec. 14, 2,000 on Dec. 15, 1,800 on Dec. 16 and 3,800 on Dec. 17. Ameer Langra, a local grower of Mauza Sahib Langra from Baqir Pur Union Council, Kabirwala, Khanewal, told Dawn , “We rarely irrigate wheat crop by purchasing water from tube well owners when we have no water in designated channels. “Sometimes, we see a sudden rise in water courses, while other times the respective canals and water courses don’t receive a single drop of water,” he said, adding that a large number of growers weren’t able to water their crops fully. “It is affecting the main and other crops as well.” Langra told Dawn that his area was already facing water scarcity due to the closure of a large number of tube wells after the recent floods swept them away. “We appeal to the government to help us and ensure water availability to save our farming.” Pakistan Kissan Ittehad President Khalid Khokar, while speaking to Dawn, condemned the Indian government for water aggression and termed it a serious violation of the Indus Water Treaty. “Many cultivators have complained about variations in water levels in the river and its impact on the agricultural activities,” he said, requesting the government to take up the issue with India and international forums. FO seeks clarification from India Earlier today, in a weekly press briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi shared that a letter had been written to India seeking clarification about the “abrupt variation” in the flow of the Chenab River, noting the matter had been in the news in the past week. Several media outlets reported this week that India had released water into the Chenab River. “Pakistan views these variations with extreme concern and seriousness. They allude to unilateral release of water into the Chenab River by India, without any prior notification,” Andrabi said. “Our Indus water commissioner has written a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matters in accordance with the procedures enshrined in the Indus Waters Treaty,” he said. “Any manipulation of river flow by India, especially at a critical time of our agricultural cycle, directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as food and economic security of our citizens,” he said. “We call upon India to respond to the queries raised by the Pakistani Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flow and fulfil its obligations in letter and spirit under the Indus Water Treaty provisions,” he said. He further said that the Indus Waters Treaty was a “binding international agreement”, which had been “an instrument of peace and security and stability in the region”. Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin. Andrabi said that violating the treaty threatened the “inviolability of international treaties and compliance with international law” and also posed a serious threat to “regional peace, principles of good neighbourliness, and norms governing interstate relations”. “The international community must take notice of India’s continued disregard of a bilateral treaty, and counsel India to act responsibly and in accordance with international law and established norms as well as its own obligations,” Andrabi said. “Pakistan remains committed to the peaceful resolution of disputes and issues with India but will not compromise on the existential water rights of the people of our country,” he said. In April, India had held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war” , noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. The supplemental award was issued in a 2023 case that Pakistan brought to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty. Removal of Indian woman’s hijab During his press briefing, the FO spokesperson also talked about Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar pulling down a female doctor’s hijab this week, a move which had invited criticism. Noting the incident, Andrabi said that the incident was followed by the “public mocking” of a minister from Uttar Pradesh.

      "summary_orig": "The Islamabad High Court (IHC) ruled on Thursday that Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s elevation to the superior court was “without lawful authority”, declaring that he “ceased to hold” the office of the IHC judge forthwith. A division bench led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan issued the judgment, which was reserved earlier today, on a plea that challenged the legitimacy of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree and appointment as a judge. Political figures and lawyers came out and assailed the IHC ruling, stating that the “case and bench had no merit to be heard”, while standing in solidarity with Jahangiri. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan called Jahangiri’s removal an “unprecedented and troubling move” in a post on X. “I take strong exception to the order. It further erodes judicial independence,” he wrote. “The constitutional oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution becomes meaningless if judges are unable to protect and defend themselves within their own court.” Gohar noted that this was not the first case in which judges have been unceremoniously removed from their offices, but urged that this be the last one. He also demanded the restoration of Justice Jahangiri. PTI lawyer Naeem Haider Panjhuta took to X and said that Jahangiri ‘s “degree became fake” when he “refused to open three constituencies”. “Under Article 209 of the Constitution, only the Supreme Judicial Council has the authority to remove any judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court,” Panjhuta wrote. “Not a judge of any high Court, and that judge must be one whose seniority has been challenged by the affected judge, who is sitting in the light of the 26th Amendment.” In a post on X, lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir lamented that an “ honest and brave judge was sent home for upholding his oath. “This is a stain that cannot be erased. This is the result of the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh amendments,” she wrote. “If the lawyers let the lion of the judiciary become a martyr today, then tomorrow, when everyone’s turn comes in the jungle, no one should complain. Such a country cannot function.” She added that lawyers need to come out onto the streets in protest of the ruling. “In what words will the judges of this division bench be remembered? Everyone knows.” Lawyer Hadi Ali Chatta, who is married to Imaan, also expressed solidarity with Jahangiri in a post on X “Justice Jahangiri will remain ever alive, but those who attacked him will keep hiding their cowardly faces.” Digital activist Usama Khilji also condemned the removal of Justice Jahangir, writing: “Bit by bit, whatever good is left in the judiciary in Pakistan is being completely dismantled — [the] question is how long will we continue to let this happen to us?” Barrister Ahsan J Pirzada said that there was no “legal, ethical or constitutional justification for the ‘transferred’ judges of Islamabad High Court to hear or decide [the] manufactured case against honourable Justice Jahangiri”. “This just goes to show how rotten the system has become, on one hand, 16 years old son of a ‘transferred’ judge can get away with killing two young women and on the other hand, the ‘transferred’ judges are absolutely comfortable and willing to humiliate their own institution by playing a role which is both questionable & unconstitutional,” he wrote, referring to an incident in which two women were killed by a car allegedly driven by an IHC justice’s son.",

Everyone knows.” Lawyer Hadi Ali Chatta, who is married to Imaan, also expressed solidarity with Jahangiri in a post on X “Justice Jahangiri will remain ever alive, but those who attacked him will keep hiding their cowardly faces.” Digital activist Usama Khilji also condemned the removal of Justice Jahangir, writing: “Bit by bit, whatever good is left in the judiciary in Pakistan is being completely dismantled — [the] question is how long will we continue to let this happen to us?” Barrister Ahsan J Pirzada said that there was no “legal, ethical or constitutional justification for the ‘transferred’ judges of Islamabad High Court to hear or decide [the] manufactured case against honourable Justice Jahangiri”. “This just goes to show how rotten the system has become, on one hand, 16 years old son of a ‘transferred’ judge can get away with killing two young women and on the other hand, the ‘transferred’ judges are absolutely comfortable and willing to humiliate their own institution by playing a role which is both questionable & unconstitutional,” he wrote, referring to an incident in which two women were killed by a car allegedly driven by an IHC justice’s son.",

      "summary": "The Islamabad High Court (IHC) ruled on Thursday that Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s elevation to the superior court was “without lawful authority”, declaring that he “ceased to hold” the office of the IHC judge forthwith. A division bench led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan issued the judgment, which was reserved earlier today, on a plea that challenged the legitimacy of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree and appointment as a judge. Political figures and lawyers came out and assailed the IHC ruling, stating that the “case and bench had no merit to be heard”, while standing in solidarity with Jahangiri. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan called Jahangiri’s removal an “unprecedented and troubling move” in a post on X. “I take strong exception to the order. It further erodes judicial independence,” he wrote. “The constitutional oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution becomes meaningless if judges are unable to protect and defend themselves within their own court.” Gohar noted that this was not the first case in which judges have been unceremoniously removed from their offices, but urged that this be the last one. He also demanded the restoration of Justice Jahangiri. PTI lawyer Naeem Haider Panjhuta took to X and said that Jahangiri ‘s “degree became fake” when he “refused to open three constituencies”. “Under Article 209 of the Constitution, only the Supreme Judicial Council has the authority to remove any judge of a High Court or the Supreme Court,” Panjhuta wrote. “Not a judge of any high Court, and that judge must be one whose seniority has been challenged by the affected judge, who is sitting in the light of the 26th Amendment.” In a post on X, lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir lamented that an “ honest and brave judge was sent home for upholding his oath. “This is a stain that cannot be erased. This is the result of the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh amendments,” she wrote. “If the lawyers let the lion of the judiciary become a martyr today, then tomorrow, when everyone’s turn comes in the jungle, no one should complain. Such a country cannot function.” She added that lawyers need to come out onto the streets in protest of the ruling. “In what words will the judges of this division bench be remembered?

      "title_orig": "PTI leaders once again return from Adiala without meeting Imran",
      "summary_orig": "PTI members, including former KP minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, protested the denial of meetings with party founder and ex-premier Imran Khan outside Adiala jail on Thursday. Water cannons were used early on Wednesday to disperse PTI leaders and protesters staging a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, after his family was denied a meeting with the ex-premier. A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. Jhagra was accompanied by PTI leaders, including Aftab Alam, Adnan Qadri, Pir Musavir Khan, Muhammad Israr and Liaqat Ali Khan. They were stopped at the Dahgali checkpoint on their way to the prison and staged a sit-in on the spot. However, they quietly gathered and left after a period of time. Jhagra wrote in a post on X: “870 unique meetings supposedly, but today was the 60th Thursday in a row when no one was allowed to meet Imran Khan,” referring to a quote by the Prime Minister’s Spokesperson Mosharraf Zaidi. “When you learn to lie about numbers, lie shamelessly: Form 47 disease going viral from the ECP to government spokesmen!” “However, the fact is that since October 2024, as many as 60 weeks have passed, but not a single meeting of Imran Khan with his political friends has been allowed,” Jhagra told reporters at the site. “Party leaders come here every week, but they are not allowed to meet [Imran]. On the other hand, during the last 60 weeks, just one or two meetings of Imran Khan have been allowed with the family in which all family members were allowed to meet the former prime minister,” he added. Jhagra said that the PTI came to Adiala to expose the “hybrid, fascist system” and to protest the use of water cannons to disperse party leaders and workers during a sit-in in the early hours of Wednesday. “There is no law prohibiting prisoners from meeting their families,” he said. “You (the authorities) break the law by not allowing a meeting and then make it difficult to protest this. Everyone sits in a plot over there, yet you close the main road.” He also assailed the government for filing a case against PTI members under terrorism charges and claiming that the KP government is incapable of handling terrorism. “You call every PTI member a terrorist, misuse anti-terrorism law, people appear in anti-terrorism courts in politically-motivated cases, and you level allegations at us that we cannot combat terrorism,” Jhagra said. He also warned the government to beware of the day when things would “get out of the hands of the party and people would take control into their hands and come on the roads”. “It is condemnable that Imran Khan’s sons are not being allowed to talk to their father and they are unaware of his health,” he said. “This attitude is creating embarrassment for Pakistan. “If you say that Pakistan first, the country should be placed before the hybrid system,” he suggested while replying to questions. Replying to a question about why the party was not issuing a protest call, the ex-provincial minister said that it was the PTI’s responsibility to protect the lives of workers and not place them in front of bullets. “Moreover, they want [KP Chief Minister] Sohail Afridi to make a mistake and provide them an opportunity to take further action against the KP government,” he said. Replying to a question, Jhagra said a major issue was that only Imran’s narrative held credibility, not the hybrid system. He also suggested that when the slogan of “Pakistan First” is chanted, Pakistan should be placed before the hybrid system. “It was General Pervez Musharraf who allowed free media, thinking that he was the most popular figure in Pakistan. But later, when he became infamous, he himself closed the media,” he added. When asked why CM Afridi was absent, Jhagra said that he had a “double responsibility”. “He is running the province along with efforts to release Imran Khan. He holds a cabinet meeting every week,” he said. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes. Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards. Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.” In an interview with Sky News ’ Yalda Hakim, Zaidi said that Imran had 870 unique meetings during his 860 days of incarceration. “This doesn’t sound like solitary confinement to me,” Zaidi said, adding that Imran had held 451 interviews with his lawyers.",

      "summary_en": "PTI members, including former KP minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, protested the denial of meetings with party founder and ex-premier Imran Khan outside Adiala jail on Thursday. Water cannons were used early on Wednesday to disperse PTI leaders and protesters staging a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, after his family was denied a meeting with the ex-premier. A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. Jhagra was accompanied by PTI leaders, including Aftab Alam, Adnan Qadri, Pir Musavir Khan, Muhammad Israr and Liaqat Ali Khan. They were stopped at the Dahgali checkpoint on their way to the prison and staged a sit-in on the spot. However, they quietly gathered and left after a period of time. Jhagra wrote in a post on X: “870 unique meetings supposedly, but today was the 60th Thursday in a row when no one was allowed to meet Imran Khan,” referring to a quote by the Prime Minister’s Spokesperson Mosharraf Zaidi. “When you learn to lie about numbers, lie shamelessly: Form 47 disease going viral from the ECP to government spokesmen!” “However, the fact is that since October 2024, as many as 60 weeks have passed, but not a single meeting of Imran Khan with his political friends has been allowed,” Jhagra told reporters at the site. “Party leaders come here every week, but they are not allowed to meet [Imran]. On the other hand, during the last 60 weeks, just one or two meetings of Imran Khan have been allowed with the family in which all family members were allowed to meet the former prime minister,” he added. Jhagra said that the PTI came to Adiala to expose the “hybrid, fascist system” and to protest the use of water cannons to disperse party leaders and workers during a sit-in in the early hours of Wednesday. “There is no law prohibiting prisoners from meeting their families,” he said. “You (the authorities) break the law by not allowing a meeting and then make it difficult to protest this. Everyone sits in a plot over there, yet you close the main road.” He also assailed the government for filing a case against PTI members under terrorism charges and claiming that the KP government is incapable of handling terrorism. “You call every PTI member a terrorist, misuse anti-terrorism law, people appear in anti-terrorism courts in politically-motivated cases, and you level allegations at us that we cannot combat terrorism,” Jhagra said.

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh police on Thursday stopped protesters from marching towards an Indian diplomatic mission, a day after India’s foreign ministry conveyed its concerns over the “deteriorating” security environment in the country. Ties between the two countries have been frosty since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising last year. Dhaka has repeatedly asked for her extradition so that she could stand trial for her alleged crimes, with Delhi responding that it was examining the requests. On Thursday, dozens of demonstrators began marching towards the assistant Indian high commissioner office in Rajshahi district, which borders India. Miftahul Jannat, one of the protesters, said the plan was to carry out a sit-in, demanding the “repatriation of all the killers including Sheikh Hasina”. The protest was stalled by the police, who said they “listened to their demands and promised to forward them to the authorities”. “We are not aware of any further plans (for demonstrations) and hope the issue will be resolved peacefully,” Nashid Farhad, a senior officer with the Rajshahi Metropolitan Police, told AFP . On Wednesday, a group of protesters tried to march towards the Indian High Commission in Dhaka. India’s foreign ministry on Wednesday summoned Bangladesh’s top diplomat in New Delhi to convey its concerns about the actions of some “extremist elements”. In a statement, the ministry also said it expected the interim government under Muhammad Yunus to “ensure the safety of missions and posts in Bangladesh in keeping with its diplomatic obligations”. Hasina, 78, was sentenced to death in absentia by a Bangladesh court last month for crimes against humanity. The country of 170 million people goes to the polls on February 12, with Hasina’s former ruling party, the Awami League, banned from running.",

      "summary_orig": "The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday issued a stern reminder to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other authorities concerned, saying that any person offloaded or restrained from travelling must be provided with written reasons at the time of the action being taken. LHC’s Justice Ali Zia Bajwa made the observations in an order issued after a hearing held at the Multan Bench. On Wednesday, the judge had heard a petition filed by a citizen, Shaheryar Qandeel, against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other authorities following his offloading from a flight despite being in possession of valid travel documents. In the order, a copy of which is available with Dawn , Justice Bajwa said, “Let this court take a moment to remind the FIA and all concerned authorities that every exercise of power that infringes upon the fundamental rights of an individual must find its firm and unambiguous foundation in law.” He said that no administrative discretion, however broad, could justify curbing the liberty of citizens unless “it is traceable to a clear statutory provision or legal mandate”. Justice Bajwa held that the rule of law demanded that no person be deprived of their right to move freely or leave the country except through due process and fair procedure. “The rule of law demands that no person should be deprived of their right to travel, move freely, or leave the country, particularly when in possession of valid travel documents, except in accordance with law, due process, and fair procedure,” he said. The judge also noted that during the proceedings, the law officers and FIA officials again sought additional time to identify the specific statutory provisions or rules that empowered them to restrain passengers at the “eleventh hour”. The judge also expressed concern after learning from the law officers that no written reasons for the petitioner’s offloading were available on the record. The judge directed the FIA to provide the petitioner with written reasons for his offloading well before the next hearing. Justice Bajwa ruled that this requirement was not a mere formality, but a “substantive safeguard to uphold transparency, accountability, and the individual’s right to seek redress”. “The failure to provide such reasons not only contravenes the principles of natural justice and due process but also constitutes a violation of the constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of movement,” the judge maintained. The case has been relisted at a future date, when law officers are expected to assist the court by citing the specific legal provisions that allow for such travel restrictions. The development comes as, over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. These actions followed a crackdown on migrant smuggling launched after the 2024 Greece boat tragedy , which claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the frequent offloading of passengers from international flights, an issue that has reportedly affected numerous travellers despite them holding valid documents.",

      "summary_orig": "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Thursday promised a crackdown on hate speech in the wake of an attack on a Jewish holiday event at Sydney’s Bondi Beach, as the youngest of 15 victims was laid to rest. The alleged father-and-son gunmen opened fire as hundreds of people celebrated Hanukkah on Sydney’s famous Bondi Beach on Sunday. The attack, which shocked the nation and led to fears over rising anti-Semitism, appears to have been inspired by the Islamic State, authorities say. Criticised by many in the Jewish community for not doing enough to combat a rise in anti-Semitism since the start of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, Albanese said the government will seek to introduce legislation that makes it easier to charge people promoting hate speech and violence. Penalties would be increased, cancelling or refusing visas would be made easier, and a regime for targeting organisations whose leaders engage in hate speech would be developed, he said. “Australians are shocked and angry. I am angry. It is clear we need to do more to combat this evil scourge much more,” Albanese told a news conference announcing the reforms. Albanese’s government has said it has consistently denounced anti-Semitism over the last two years. It passed legislation to criminalise hate speech, and in August, it expelled the Iranian ambassador after accusing Tehran of directing two anti-Semitic arson attacks in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. Still, anti-Semitic incidents have been mounting. A 19-year-old Sydney man was charged and will face court on Thursday after allegedly threatening violence towards a Jewish person on a flight from Bali to Sydney on Wednesday. “Police will allege the man made antisemitic threats and hand gestures indicating violence towards the alleged victim, who the man knew to be affiliated with the Jewish community,” Australian Federal Police said on Thursday. Youngest victim laid to rest Yellow toy bees topped the coffin of 10-year-old Matilda, who was remembered as a “ray of sunshine” who loved animals and dancing. Matilda’s middle name was Bee, which inspired attendees to wear bee stickers, and bee-themed toys and balloons, while some mourners wore yellow. Matilda’s family has asked the media not to use their surname. “The tragic, so totally cruel, unfathomable murder of young Matilda is something to all of us as if our own daughter [were] taken from us,” said Rabbi Yehoram Ulman. “Matilda grew up like a child would, loving what children love. She loved the outdoors, animals. She went to school, she had friends, everybody loved her.” The line outside the hall where Matilda’s funeral was held in Sydney’s eastern suburbs snaked down the street. Many mourners who could not get in watched the service on a screen outside the building. “It’s like your heart’s been ripped out. It’s terrible … no one wants this,” said Jae Glover, 25, as he handed out bee stickers. “It’s a feeling, it could have been avoided. Anti-Semitism has now been brewing in Australia for over two years.” Philippines, Islamic State links investigated Police allege the attack was carried out by Sajid Akram, 50, and his 24-year-old son Naveed. Sajid was shot dead by police at the scene, while Naveed Akram was charged with 59 offences on Wednesday after waking from a coma, including murder and terror charges. The centre-left Labour government has ruled out holding a Royal Commission, a high-level inquiry with judicial powers, into the shootings for now. On Wednesday, the leader of New South Wales, where the attack took place, said he would next week recall the state parliament to pass urgent reforms on gun laws. Police are looking into Australia-based Islamic State networks as well as the gunmen’s alleged links to militants in the Philippines. The Philippines’ National Security Council on Wednesday said that while Sajid and his son had been in the country for a month in November, the pair had not engaged in any military training. Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. “There is no valid report or confirmation that the two received any form of military training while in the country, and no evidence supports such a claim at present,” Philippine national security adviser Eduardo Ano said in a statement.",

      "summary_orig": "• UNSC assessment reveals some senior Taliban members increasingly view TTP as a liability, others remain supportive • Report says border closures estimated to cost Afghan economy around $1 million per day • Monitoring body says Al Qaeda has ‘blended itself with TTP’, with or without Taliban acquiescence ISLAMABAD: A United Nations Security Council report has rejected the Taliban’s claim that terrorist groups are not using Afghan territory for cross-border violence, calling the assertion “not credible” and warning that neighbouring states increasingly view Afghanistan as a source of regional insecurity. The assessment is contained in the sixteenth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, submitted to the UN Security Council, as international concern grows over Afghanistan’s security landscape more than four years after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. “The de facto authorities continue to deny that any terrorist groups have a footprint in or operate from its territory. That claim is not credible,” the report said. The Taliban had pledged under the 2020 Doha Agreement to prevent Afghanistan from being used to threaten other countries. While following their return to power in Aug 2021, they have aggressively targeted Islamic State-Khorasan Province, or ISIL-K, their stance toward other terrorist groups has been markedly different, according to various UN assessments. The latest report said “a wide range of member states consistently report that ISIL-K, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al Qaeda, the Eastern Turkistan Isla­mic Movement, also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIM/TIP), Jamaat Ansarullah, Ittiha­dul Mujahideen Pakistan, and others are present in Afghanistan. Some groups have used or are continuing to use Afghanistan to plan and prepare external attacks.” Al Qaeda is assessed by the United Nations as maintaining close ties with the Taliban, with a persistent presence in several provinces. While its activities are kept low-profile, UN monitors say the group benefits from a permissive environment that allows training and reorganisation. By contrast, ISIL-K is considered the Taliban’s primary adversary. Taliban operations have degraded its territorial control, but the group has remained resilient, carrying out attacks inside Afghan­istan and abroad. The most acute threat to regional stability, however, is seen as the TTP, which the UN report describes as enjoying strong support from elements within the Taliban and operating from Afghan sanctuaries. “Taliban authorities continue to deny and deflect responsibility for failing to restrain TTP,” the report said. “Within the Taliban there are varying degrees of sympathy for and allegiance with TTP.” “Some senior members increasingly view TTP as a liability, unnecessarily disrupting and antagonising relations with Pakistan, while others remain supportive of it,” the report said. Assessing the likelihood of the Taliban severing ties with the group under Pakistani pressure, the report said, “Given the historical ties, the Taliban are unlikely to confront or act against TTP.” It added, “Even should they wish to, they may lack the ability to do so.” According to the report, the TTP has conducted “numerous high-profile attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil”, making it the most serious immediate challenge to relations between Kabul and Islamabad. “The number of TTP attacks in Pakistan has been increasing throughout 2025,” the report said. “By some estimates, there have already been more than 600 attacks in Pakistan in 2025.” It added that “many attacks have been complex in nature, involving multiple, coordinated attackers using methods such as vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices, combined with teams of suicide attackers on foot”, and noted that “a majority of those conducting suicide bombings in Pakistan were reported to be Afghans”. Pakistan has long accused the Taliban of harbouring TTP fighters, estimated by the UN report at about 6,000. These TTP fighters are said to be living in Afghanistan provinces of Khost, Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika and Paktia with the group’s chief Noor Wali Mehsud, reportedly living in Kabul. An unnamed member state was said to have reported that the family of Mehsud received a monthly payment of three million afghanis (roughly $43,000) from Taliban. The dispute over the presence of TTP in Afghanistan has severely strained ties between the two neighbours, though the Afghan Taliban were once considered to be closely allied with Pakistan. “These attacks have led to cross-border military confrontation, causing a number of casualties, as well as disruptions to bilateral trade,” the report said. “At the time of writing, in addition to the loss of life, the closure of border crossings with Pakistan is estimated to cost the Afghan economy around $1 million per day.” The monitoring team said TTP has expanded its targeting. “In January, TTP issued a new directive expanding targets of its attacks to include military-owned businesses,” the report said, “thereby significantly escalating its focus on the economic interests of the military of Pakistan and of Chinese enterprises in Pakistan.” It also pointed to cooperation between TTP and other terrorist groups. Despite the broader militant presence, the report noted some counterterrorism progress made by Pakistan. “There have also been a number of high-profile arrests by the Pakistani authorities, such as the arrest of an ISIL-K spokesperson, Sultan Aziz Azam, on 16 May 2025,” it said. “Overall, the capability of ISIL-K has been degraded as a result of counter-terrorism operations by the de facto authorities and Pakistan,” the report added, noting that “the arrest in mid-2025 by Turkish and Pakistani authorities of Ozgur Altun, known as Abu Yasir al-Turki, a key figure in the group’s media and logistical operations, may have contributed to the suspension of ‘Voice of Khorasan’.” On Al Qaeda, the report said, “In March 2025, Osama Mahmoud was formally declared ‘emir’ of AQIS. He comes from Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.” Zaki Abbas also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, December 18th, 2025",

Pakistan has long accused the Taliban of harbouring TTP fighters, estimated by the UN report at about 6,000. These TTP fighters are said to be living in Afghanistan provinces of Khost, Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika and Paktia with the group’s chief Noor Wali Mehsud, reportedly living in Kabul. An unnamed member state was said to have reported that the family of Mehsud received a monthly payment of three million afghanis (roughly $43,000) from Taliban. The dispute over the presence of TTP in Afghanistan has severely strained ties between the two neighbours, though the Afghan Taliban were once considered to be closely allied with Pakistan. “These attacks have led to cross-border military confrontation, causing a number of casualties, as well as disruptions to bilateral trade,” the report said. “At the time of writing, in addition to the loss of life, the closure of border crossings with Pakistan is estimated to cost the Afghan economy around $1 million per day.” The monitoring team said TTP has expanded its targeting. “In January, TTP issued a new directive expanding targets of its attacks to include military-owned businesses,” the report said, “thereby significantly escalating its focus on the economic interests of the military of Pakistan and of Chinese enterprises in Pakistan.” It also pointed to cooperation between TTP and other terrorist groups. Despite the broader militant presence, the report noted some counterterrorism progress made by Pakistan. “There have also been a number of high-profile arrests by the Pakistani authorities, such as the arrest of an ISIL-K spokesperson, Sultan Aziz Azam, on 16 May 2025,” it said. “Overall, the capability of ISIL-K has been degraded as a result of counter-terrorism operations by the de facto authorities and Pakistan,” the report added, noting that “the arrest in mid-2025 by Turkish and Pakistani authorities of Ozgur Altun, known as Abu Yasir al-Turki, a key figure in the group’s media and logistical operations, may have contributed to the suspension of ‘Voice of Khorasan’.” On Al Qaeda, the report said, “In March 2025, Osama Mahmoud was formally declared ‘emir’ of AQIS. He comes from Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.” Zaki Abbas also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, December 18th, 2025",

      "summary": "• UNSC assessment reveals some senior Taliban members increasingly view TTP as a liability, others remain supportive • Report says border closures estimated to cost Afghan economy around $1 million per day • Monitoring body says Al Qaeda has ‘blended itself with TTP’, with or without Taliban acquiescence ISLAMABAD: A United Nations Security Council report has rejected the Taliban’s claim that terrorist groups are not using Afghan territory for cross-border violence, calling the assertion “not credible” and warning that neighbouring states increasingly view Afghanistan as a source of regional insecurity. The assessment is contained in the sixteenth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, submitted to the UN Security Council, as international concern grows over Afghanistan’s security landscape more than four years after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021. “The de facto authorities continue to deny that any terrorist groups have a footprint in or operate from its territory. That claim is not credible,” the report said. The Taliban had pledged under the 2020 Doha Agreement to prevent Afghanistan from being used to threaten other countries. While following their return to power in Aug 2021, they have aggressively targeted Islamic State-Khorasan Province, or ISIL-K, their stance toward other terrorist groups has been markedly different, according to various UN assessments. The latest report said “a wide range of member states consistently report that ISIL-K, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al Qaeda, the Eastern Turkistan Isla­mic Movement, also known as the Turkistan Islamic Party (ETIM/TIP), Jamaat Ansarullah, Ittiha­dul Mujahideen Pakistan, and others are present in Afghanistan. Some groups have used or are continuing to use Afghanistan to plan and prepare external attacks.” Al Qaeda is assessed by the United Nations as maintaining close ties with the Taliban, with a persistent presence in several provinces. While its activities are kept low-profile, UN monitors say the group benefits from a permissive environment that allows training and reorganisation. By contrast, ISIL-K is considered the Taliban’s primary adversary. Taliban operations have degraded its territorial control, but the group has remained resilient, carrying out attacks inside Afghan­istan and abroad. The most acute threat to regional stability, however, is seen as the TTP, which the UN report describes as enjoying strong support from elements within the Taliban and operating from Afghan sanctuaries. “Taliban authorities continue to deny and deflect responsibility for failing to restrain TTP,” the report said. “Within the Taliban there are varying degrees of sympathy for and allegiance with TTP.” “Some senior members increasingly view TTP as a liability, unnecessarily disrupting and antagonising relations with Pakistan, while others remain supportive of it,” the report said.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: After negotiations with various government departments, goods transporters on Wed­n­esday called off their 10-day strike that had paralysed the movement of raw materials, local production and exports. Nisar Hussain Jafri, chairman of the Pakistan Goods Transporters Allia­nce (PGTA), which represents around 20 major transport associations across the country, told Dawn that the government had accepted the group’s major demands and goods’ movement had resumed. Earlier, PGTA President Malik Shehzad Awan announced the decision at a press conference at the Gulbai Truck Stand in Karachi along with Punjab Transport Minister Bilal Akbar and Murtaza Wahab, representing the Sindh government. He said the strike was being withdrawn on assurances given by the authorities. “We have called off the strike after it continued for 10 days. The decision was taken after the federal, Punjab and Sindh governments accepted our demands and signed the settlement document,” said Mr Awan. He said the authorities had agreed to substantially reduce fines and resolve issues related to axle-load limits, the issuance of heavy transport driving licences, disputes with Customs authorities and the motorway police, and controversial provisions of the amended Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025. As part of the commitments, the meeting also decided the temporary allocation of 50 acres for truck parking opposite the US Consulate on Mai Kolachi Road under the administrative control of the Karachi Port Trust (KPT). It was also agreed that around 600 acres on the Northern Bypass (M-10) would be acquired from the Sindh government and earmarked for parking to ease congestion. The decisions included construction of a 6km stretch of the Northern Bypass by April 2026, with the remaining portion to be completed subsequently. To further facilitate port traffic, the National Highway Authority plans to expand the route to six lanes, and a detailed design will be finalised by March 2026. On reports of container-theft gangs stealing goods from import containers, the settlement also envisaged action by the Sindh police, with the provincial inspector general tasked with investigating the complaints and taking strict action against those involved. All Pakistan Truck Trailer Owners Association Chairman Lala Yasir Naseer confirmed that freight movement had resumed following the announcement. “After being informed by our alliance, we have conveyed instructions to our members to resume business activities,” he told Dawn. Transporters had gone on strike over what they described as excessive fines and had demanded the withdrawal of the Traffic Ordinance 2025. Mr Akbar said heavy fines and the registration of FIRs against transporters had been abolished. He added that fitness certificates issued in Karachi would be recognised in Punjab and would be valid for six months. He said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had directed that truck stands be built in cities across the province, along with rest areas for drivers. Mr Wahab, who is also Karachi’s mayor, said the Sindh government had taken transporters into confidence before making decisions affecting them. Talks between goods transporters and representatives of the Punjab and Sindh governments, the Customs department and the Ministry of Communications were held on Tuesday but remained inconclusive. Mr Jafri said a fresh meeting was held on Wednesday at the Customs House in Karachi, attended by the same government side and joined via video link by Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Federal Minister for Communications Aleem Khan, Port and Shipping Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiani. Industrialists said the strike had begun in Punjab on Dec 8, with protests in cities including Rawalpindi and Lahore led by the Punjab Public Transport Association and the Goods Transporters Association against the provincial government’s enforcement of the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025. They said the ordinance introduced sharply increased fines and penalties for traffic violations such as speeding, overloading and operating older vehicles, which transporters deemed an unbearable financial burden. Industrialists estimated the textile sector alone incurred losses of around $500 million over the past 10 days, while stranded consignments attracted demurrage and detention charges at ports and factory premises. They said production lines were forced to slow down or shut down due to disruptions in the supply of raw materials and the dispatch of finished goods, raising the risk of missed vessel sailings and cancellations of international orders. The strike also affected the movement of industrial inputs from seaports to factories across the country.
