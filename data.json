      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic development in the narcotics and terrorism case against senior journalist Matiullah Jan, a forensic report submitted to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday revealed that the substance allegedly recovered from him was not a prohibited drug. The case — registered at Margalla Police Station on Nov 28, 2024 — had accused the journalist of snatching a government-issued rifle, hitting a vehicle at a police barrier and possessing narcotics. Initiation of legal proceedings against Jan drew strong criticism from journalist bodies and rights groups, who maintained that he was being targeted for investigating reports of alleged deaths during law enforcement action against PTI protesters in November 2024. On Thursday, a division bench comprising Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the matter in a packed IHC courtroom. During the hearing, the Islamabad police placed on record a laboratory report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency. According to the forensic analysis, the material allegedly recovered from the journalist did not contain methamphetamine — commonly known as “ice”. The courtroom was filled with members of the legal fraternity, political workers and journalists expressing solidarity with Jan. When former senator Farhatullah Babar was spotted in the courtroom, Justice Tahir inquired about his presence. Babar responded that he had come to show support for the senior journalist. Advocate Rai Hanif Rahi informed the bench that lawyers had appeared in solidarity, while journalist Saqib Bashir submitted that the case had been pursued “as if Matiullah Jan were a drug dealer”. The advocate further apprised the court that the matter had been fixed before the trial court for framing of charges. Observing that the forensic findings carried significant legal implications, the bench questioned whether narcotics-related charges could be sustained in the absence of a prohibited substance. The judges remarked that an appropriate order would be passed and subsequently referred the matter back to the trial court for further proceedings. A day ago, an Islamabad ATC had rejected Jan’s application challenging the jurisdiction of the court and fixed February 19 (today) as the date for framing of charges. ‘Allegations proven false’ In a post on X after the hearing, Jan said the allegations against him of “smuggling narcotics have been proven false”. He highlighted that the PFSA report presented before the court “revealed that the substance allegedly recovered from me was not narcotics or ice”. According to the journalist, the IHC bench asked the prosecution counsel how charges could be framed against Jan in light of the lab report. The court then referred the case to the trial court and directed the state to submit a supplementary charge-sheet, he added. “On this occasion, in my legal team, I am first grateful to Advocate Imaan Mazari and Advocate Hadi for giving me their full support, who stood by me fully from my arrest until the case was made,” Jan said. “May Allah Almighty grant them release,” he added, referring to the lawyer couple who were convicted in January over controversial social media posts, with their sentencing sparking outrage among rights bodies. “After that, my current legal team — Advocate Ali Ashfaq, Barrister Abdul Qadeer, Barrister Ahad, Advocate Fayyaz, and my younger brother Advocate Shahid Akbar Abbasi — gave me their full support from the trial to the high court and are still standing with me,” Jan said. He stated that Barrister Qadeer was representing him in the IHC. “Finally, thanks to those government and non-government politicians who, immediately after the registration of this fake case, openly declared it wrong and fabricated. By the way, thanks to the lab folks too,” he jested. The case On Nov 28, 2024, Jan’s son had posted on X about his father being “abducted from the parking” of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad by “unmarked abductors in an unmarked vehicle”. Authorities later the same day confirmed he had been booked in a first information report (FIR), which claimed that Jan was found possessing 246 grams of narcotic methamphetamine (crystal meth) when his vehicle was stopped at E-9 in the federal capital. The case was registered at 3:20am, nearly an hour after the alleged incident took place. Jan was initially sent on a two-day physical remand in police custody by an Islamabad Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC). However, the next day, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) overturned that decision and sent him to judicial custody. On Nov 30, 2024, the journalist was granted bail by the ATC and subsequently released from the Adiala jail. On Oct 31, 2025 — the day Jan was set to be indicted — an ATC issued a notice to police on the journalist’s application for the provision of case documents. The FIR invoked Control of Narcotic Substances Act (CNSA) 1997 ’s Section 9(2)4, which specifies the punishment for possessing or trafficking “more than 100g and up to 500g” of psychotropic substance. The FIR also invoked Sections 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 as well as Sections 186 (obstructing public servant), 279 (Rash driving or riding on a public way), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) and 506ii (threat to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code .",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan issued a demarche to the Taliban regime over the use of Afghan soil for a terrorist attack on security forces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur that martyred 11 soldiers, it emerged on Thursday. According to a press release by the Foreign Office (FO), the demarche was issued on Wednesday afternoon when the FO summoned the Afghan deputy head of mission. “Pakistan condemned in the strongest possible terms the vehicle-borne suicide terrorist attack followed by a fire raid on Pakistan military and law enforcement agencies’ posts in Bajaur, carried out by Fitna al Khawarij [or] the TTP,” the statement said. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The FO expressed concern that the group, whose entire leadership is based in Afghanistan, “operates with impunity from Afghan soil”. It re-emphasised that Pakistan had received repeated assurances from the Afghan Taliban regime, “but, regrettably, with no visible or concrete actions”. “The Afghan Taliban regime has been told to take immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership,” the press release said. The ministry also “categorically informed” the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan “reserved the right to respond and eliminate any khawarij belonging to the group as well as their affiliates”, wherever they were located, “to ensure [the] safety of its soldiers, civilians and territorial boundaries”. It is worth mentioning that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Wednesday that Islamabad will not hesitate to launch air operations inside Afghanistan to combat militancy, characterising the current regional instability as the “price we are paying” for decisions made during the 1980s and after Sept 11 terrorist attacks. Speaking during a visit to Berlin, Asif accused the Afghan Taliban regime of conducting a “proxy war” alongside India against Pakistani interests and said military action would remain on the table until Kabul offered meaningful “assurances of peace”, according to a BBC report. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), a terror attack involving an explosive-laden vehicle on a checkpost in Bajaur martyred 11 security personnel on Monday. The statement added that 12 terrorists were eliminated after security forces retaliated and “engaged the fleeing khawarij with precision”. President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the terrorist attack and extended condolences to the families of martyrs. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed sorrow at the loss of lives and condemned the attack in the “strongest terms”. Pakistan had also issued a demarche to Afghanistan in late December, over its failure to rein in terrorist organisations ope­r­ating from Afghan soil, after a deadly attack on a military camp in North Waziristan.",

The February 6 attack , claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, on the outskirts of the capital was the deadliest in Islamabad since a 2008 truck bombing that killed 60 people at the Marriott Hotel. “Relief cheques have been delivered to the heirs of 36 martyrs belonging to Islamabad,” PMO said in a statement, adding each victim’s family received Rs5m. Cheques will also be delivered to four families of victims living outside Islamabad, the statement said. Although officials have not released a final death toll, the statement marked the first official acknowledgement that 40 people were killed in the blast. On Feb 11, PM Shehbaz had announced compensation for those martyred and injured in the suicide attack while visiting the site of the attack. Speaking on the occasion, he said, “These terrorists have no religion, and they have crossed all the limits of cruelty.” The suicide attack occurred during Friday prayers. The last major attack in Islamabad took place in November when a suicide blast outside a court killed 12 people and wounded dozens, the first such incident to hit the capital in nearly three years.",

      "summary_orig": "Bill Gates pulled out of India’s AI Impact Summit hours before his scheduled keynote address on Thursday, dealing another blow to a flagship event already marred by organisational lapses, a robot row and complaints of traffic chaos. Gates’ absence, followed by another high-profile cancellation by Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, adds to a difficult opening for a summit billed as the first major artificial intelligence forum in the Global South, where India has sought to position itself as a leading voice in worldwide AI governance. The Gates Foundation said the billionaire will not deliver his address “to ensure the focus remains on the AI Summit’s key priorities”. Only days ago, the foundation had dismissed rumours of his absence and insisted he was on track to attend. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for children’s safety on AI platforms as he addressed the gathering on Thursday, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei. “We must be even more vigilant about children’s safety. Just as a school syllabus is curated, the AI space should also be child- and family-guided,” Modi said, after standing on stage with top AI executives and posing for photographs with their arms raised in a show of strength. The photoshoot produced an awkward moment when Altman and Amodei, chiefs of rival AI firms OpenAI and Anthropic, stood side by side on stage but did not hold hands, although the other executives did. India’s first major AI summit has been marred by organisational lapses that have left attendees shocked and angry over what they described as a lack of planning by the Indian government. Chaos and traffic snarls Gates’ cancellation comes after the US Department of Justice released emails last month that included communication between late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the Gates Foundation’s staff. Gates has said the relationship was confined to philanthropy-related discussions and that it was a mistake for him to meet Epstein. The summit exhibition halls were shut to the public on Thursday in a surprise move that led to more anger among participating companies that had put up stalls and pavilions. The venue compound was largely deserted after three days of large crowds at the event. Indian university Galgotias was asked to vacate its stall after a staff member presented a commercially available robotic dog made in China as its own creation, sparking a public uproar. Police repeatedly shut roads to give preference to VIP movement at the summit, creating chaos in the city of 20 million people. The Indian government has apologised for the inconvenience caused to attendees in the initial days. But on Wednesday, footage on social media showed scores of attendees at the summit walking for miles in central Delhi as roads were shut, with no availability of taxis and no shuttle services arranged. Opposition parties attacked the government and the prime minister for poorly managing the global summit. “How can you expect your engineers, AI guys, to walk such distances…And then we complain that entrepreneurs are leaving India,” said Pawan Khera, the Congress party spokesperson. Still, there has been more than $100 billion of investment in India AI projects pledged during the summit, including from the Adani Group conglomerate, tech giant Microsoft, and data centre firm Yotta. The Indian government has said it expects total pledges to exceed $200bn in the next two years, although analysts have warned that the rapid build-out risks straining India’s power grid and water supply.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday issued notices to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) on appeals filed by Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, against their conviction in the controversial tweets case. Justice Muhammad Asif, who heard the appeals, also issued notices on the couple’s applications seeking suspension of their sentence and called for a response from the agency. The IHC then adjourned further proceedings, observing that a date for the next hearing would be fixed. On January 24, Imaan and Hadi were handed a total of 17 years in jail on multiple charges under the Prevention of Electr­onic Crimes Act (Peca) by a sessions court in Islamabad, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society. The lawyer duo was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment under Peca’s Section 10 (cyberterrorism), five years’ jail under Section 9 (glorification of an offence) and two years in prison under Section 26-A (false and fake information). All sentences will run concurrently. Appearing on behalf of the appellants, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqui, along with Zainab Janjua and other members of the defence team, contended that the trial court announced its verdict while a transfer application was still pending before the IHC . Siddiqui argued that two prosecution witnesses were examined in the absence of the accused and questioned the manner in which the trial judge subsequently expunged a paragraph from the judgment. “Punishment may be awarded ten times over, but a fair trial must first be conducted,” Siddiqui contended, stressing that due process had been compromised. Justice Asif remarked that notices were being issued and directed that the paper books be prepared. Siddiqui requested an early date for the hearing of the suspension of sentence applications, pointing that he travelled from Karachi to appear before the court, and sought a Monday or Tuesday date. The judge responded that an appropriate date would be fixed. The IHC subsequently issued notices to the NCCIA and sought the agency’s reply before adjourning the matter. On February 7, the couple had challenged the trial court’s order convicting them. In their appeals, the two contended that the impugned judgment was passed in blatant violation of settled legal principles and mandatory procedural requi­rements. They argued that the trial court proceeded to pronounce the verdict despite the fact that an application seeking transfer of the case was pending adjudication before the IHC, rendering the decision “unlawful and without jurisdiction”. Imaan and Chattha’s convictions had sparked concerns from the United Nations Human Rights Office, a team of UN special rapporteurs, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), and a European Union (EU) official. The case The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the NCCIA in Islamabad. The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the banned outfits Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Judge Majoka indicted Imaan and Hadi on Oct 30, 2025 and then issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025. Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him. Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them. Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.",

Judge Majoka indicted Imaan and Hadi on Oct 30, 2025 and then issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025. Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him. Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them. Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.",

      "summary_orig": "The White House warned on Wednesday that Iran would be “wise” to do a deal with the United States as President Donald Trump once again hinted at military action. The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman, after Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month. A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites. “Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. On Wednesday, Trump again suggested the United States might strike Iran in a post on his Truth Social site, with a US military buildup underway in the Middle East. He warned Britain against giving up sovereignty over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, saying that the archipelago’s Diego Garcia airbase might be needed were Iran not to agree a deal, “in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime”. CNN and CBS reported on Wednesday that the US military will be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Trump has been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper. Earlier on Wednesday, Tehran’s top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran was “drafting” a framework for future talks with the US. Iran and the US held a second round of Oman-mediated negotiations on Tuesday in Geneva. Araghchi said then that Tehran had agreed with Washington on “guiding principles”, but US Vice President JD Vance said Iran had not yet acknowledged all of Washington’s red lines. ‘Do not want war’ Speaking on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted “we do not want war” but suggested Tehran could not give in to US demands. “From the day I took office, I have believed that war must be set aside. But if they are going to try to impose their will on us, humiliate us and demand that we bow our heads at any cost, should we accept that?” Earlier on Wednesday, Araghchi held a phone call with Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. In the call, the Iranian foreign minister “stressed the Islamic Republic of Iran’s focus on drafting an initial and coherent framework to advance future talks”, according to a statement from his ministry. Tehran has suspended some cooperation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog’s inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes. Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned that Washington would deter Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons “one way or the other”. “They’ve been very clear about what they would do with nuclear weapons. It’s entirely unacceptable,” Wright told reporters in Paris on the sidelines of meetings of the International Energy Agency. Displays of military might The Omani-mediated talks were aimed at averting the possibility of US military action, while Tehran is demanding the lifting of US sanctions that are crippling its economy. Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran’s ballistic missiles programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table. While talks have resumed, the US has also been building up its military forces near Iran. Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed. Iran has sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps beginning a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a major global conduit for oil and gas. On Tuesday, state TV reported that Tehran would close parts of the waterway for safety measures during the drills.",

The airspace will remain closed for all Indian civil and military registered aircraft till March 23, the Pakistan Airport Authority (PAA) said in a new notice to airmen (Notam) issued today. Pakistan’s airspace is divided into two flight information regions (FIRs) — Karachi and Lahore, according to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) document from 2022.

New Delhi, without evidence, had alleged that Islamabad backed the attack. Pakistan strongly denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe . Then, in early May, the nuclear-armed nations fought their fiercest military conflict in decades. Pakistan says it downed seven Indian jets during the conflict.

      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday strongly rejected media speculations regarding any “deal” between the government and incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan. In a statement shared on X, Tarar said, “There is neither any deal nor any leniency for Imran.” He added that any impression of the government granting the ex-premier concessions was “entirely false and misleading”. “Imran Khan is a criminal convicted by courts, and the reports about  leniency for him are baseless,” Tarar asserted. “There is no truth in these reports.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was months ago convicted in another case regarding state gifts. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023 . Tarar’s clarification follows recent statements made by Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, wherein he said efforts were made to reach a solution, but Imran was not ready for “any deal”. “He (Imran) is not ready for any deal,” Sanaullah said in an interview with ARY News aired on Wednesday. “Two very serious efforts were made [and] not only is he not ready for a deal but his demands are such that the current government cannot fulfil them,” he added. Sanaullah described the PTI founder as having a “non-political attitude” and being “stubborn”. “The way they (PTI supporters) say that he is standing tall,” he quipped. According to the PML-N leader, “one serious effort” was made between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in the aftermath of the November 2024 protests . “On the second [effort], I cannot go into details more than this that some individuals had arrived from abroad,” Sanaullah said, adding that they “had links” with Imran. “They also met with Imran Khan sahib , and as per my information, Imran Khan sahib first agreed with them, but then he stepped back from it.” In January 2026, Sanaullah had said PTI leaders were seeking dialogue with the government but Imran opposed the move. On Tuesday, Parliamentary Secretary Barrister Danyal Chaudhry also denied any kind of “deal” with Imran, claiming that the latter wanted a deal and concession since day one. “We are also ready for talks, but we will not accept any blackmail in this regard. The only reason for sending Imran Khan abroad for treatment can be that, God forbid, he may be suffering from a life-threatening disease that cannot be treated here,” he had said. His statement came amid concerns raised by the PTI about the party founder’s health after a report submitted to the Supreme Court quoted him as saying he had lost partial vision in his right eye due to an ailment .",

      "summary_orig": "PARIS: More than 150 European ex-diplomats and lawmakers on Wednesday urged France’s foreign minister to retract “inaccurate” comments about a UN expert on Palestinians rights who he wants to resign. France and Germany have called for Francesca Albanese to step down over remarks in which she referred to a “common enemy of humanity” after criticising “most of the world” and the media for enabling Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza. Critics and Israel have accused the UN Special Rapporteur of referring to Israel as a “common enemy”, while Albanese has denounced this as a “manipulation” and “completely false”. In response to a question about the comments, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Feb 11 told parliament she should step down. In an open letter, the former diplomats criticised what they called “the use of inaccurate and manipulated elements to discredit a holder of an independent UN mandate”. They called on Barrot to “retract his inaccurate statements about Ms Albanese and correct them.” “This controversy must not divert attention from the massacres of civilians, nor from the humanitarian crisis and the massive human rights violations taking place in Gaza,” said the signatories. The letter, written in French, was signed by mostly former foreign ministers and diplomats from the Netherlands. More than a dozen current members of parliament and senators from Europe were also among the signatories, along with a former foreign minister of South Africa. Columbia University activist A US immigration judge has blocked the deportation of a Palestinian graduate student who helped organize protests at Columbia University against Israel’s war in Gaza, according to US media reports. Mohsen Mahdawi was arrested by immigration agents last year as he was attending an interview to become a US citizen. Mahdawi had been involved in a wave of demonstrations that gripped several major US university campuses. Published in Dawn, February 19th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA: Two days of peace talks in Geneva between Ukraine and Russia ended on Wednesday without a breakthrough, with Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelensky accusing Moscow of stalling US-mediated efforts to end the four-year-old war. Ukraine has faced repeated pressure from US President Donald Tru­mp to agree to a deal that could mean painful concessions, as Russ­ian forces pound its power grid and slowly advance on the battlefield. As the delegations met for a second day at a hotel in the Swiss city, under the mediation of US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, Zelensky had called the first day “difficult”. “We can state that Russia is trying to drag out negotiations that could already have reached the final stage,” he wrote on X. No date for talks to resume Moments after his statement, the delegations broke off the talks and said they would meet again in the future, without providing a date. Russia’s chief negotiator, former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, described the talks as “difficult, but business-like”. Medinsky — whom Ukrainian officials have accused of engaging in history lectures rather than substantive talks — spoke with the Ukrainians for nearly two hours after formal talks ended, according to a representative of Kyiv’s chief negotiator, Rustem Umerov. A spokesperson for Zelensky said the formal part of the talks had addressed territory in Ukraine’s east and the fate of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, both sticking points since the beginning of the process. Moscow wants Ukraine to cede the roughly 20pc of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian forces have been unable to conquer — something Kyiv has repeatedly rejected. Kyiv, meanwhile, wants Zaporizhzhia, Europe’s largest nuclear plant, to be operated by the US and Ukraine, which Russia has said is unacceptable. Pressure from Trump Tuesday is the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion , which has killed hundreds of thousands, driven millions from their homes, and ravaged Ukrainian cities, towns and villages. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians. Trump has twice suggested in recent days that it is up to Kyiv to make sure a deal is agreed quickly. He had told reporters on Monday: “Ukraine better come to the table fast. That’s all I’m telling you.” In an interview with the US news outlet Axios , Zelensky was quoted as saying that it was “not fair” that Tr­u­mp kept publicly demanding con­­c­essions from Ukraine, not Russia. Zelensky also said any plan requiring Ukraine to give up territory that Russia had not captured in the east would be rejected if put to a referendum. “I hope it is just his tactics and not the decision,” Zelensky was quoted as saying. The Geneva meeting follows two rounds of US-brokered talks in Abu Dhabi that made no breakthrough. Both Zelensky and Umerov have made a point of repeatedly thanking the US for its mediation in recent weeks. Zelensky has expressed concern that US Congressional mid-term elections in November could draw Washington’s attention away from efforts to end Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two. Kyiv is also seeking strong US-backed security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks in the event of a peace deal. US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll and Brigadier General Michael Adamski took part in three-way military negotiations on Wednesday, according to a US official. Published in Dawn, February 19th, 2026",
