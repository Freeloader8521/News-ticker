      "summary_orig": "Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar tabled the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment in the National Assembly (NA) on Tuesday, a day after the government succeeded in manoeuvring it through the Senate . The bill needs a two-thirds majority in order to be passed by the NA, which the ruling coalition has in the 336-member house as compared to the opposition’s 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, the PPP has 74, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has 22, the  Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid has five, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party has four, and the PML-Z, the Balochistan Awami Party, and the National Peoples Party have one seat each. The NA session today began with a prayer for PML-N Irfan Siddiqui, who passed away yesterday. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then asked Tarar to move the bill for the constitutional amendment to be taken into consideration, as stated in the house’s agenda for today. The law minister moved the bill, recalling that when the legislation for the 26th Constitutional Amendment had landed in the house, “two main political parties, after much debate and discussion, made a few adjustments in the promises made to the public under the Charter of Democracy ”. “One of those key points was the establishment of a constitutional court […] Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman kept our friends from the opposition on board regarding this, and you all know that it was on their request that we agreed on establishing a constitutional bench instead of a constitutional court,” Tarar continued. Subsequently, he said, the amendment for establishing a constitutional bench was passed. However, he added, several objections were raised over it, with the critics saying that “you have formed a court within a court, and that this system will not continue”. Making a case for the constitutional court, Tarar said “some sensitive constitutional matters had surfaced in the past — and they will surface in the future as well — that took up most of the quality time of the court”. So, he continued, coalition partners were consulted, and it was agreed that a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) should be established. The minister said the salient features pertaining to the FCC in the amendment bill were the same as the points agreed in the Charter of Democracy. At this point, opposition members could be heard protesting in the background. Nevertheless, Tarar continued that an impression had been created that Article 184(3) of the Constitution — which elaborates on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court — was being abolished. But it was not the case, he clarified, adding that the powers granted under the clause would be transferred to the FCC and “a pari materia provision has been introduced after Article 175-B [in the Constitution], pertaining to the [court’s] jurisdiction”. He said in connection with Article 184 of the Constitution, the parliamentary committee that deliberated on the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment also discussed the matter of the court’s suo motu powers, “to which prime ministers, government employees, actors and even the country’s economic system had fallen victim”. In view of these past instances, he said the FCC was not being granted suo motu powers under the new proposed amendment. Instead, an application would have to be submitted and fulfil the criteria outlined under Article 184(3) — that the matter in question was of public importance and required the enforcement of fundamental rights — to exercise this power, elaborated. This power “will not be used to grill an individual”, he asserted. Bill sails through Senate The PML-N-led coalition government on Monday succeeded in manoeuvring the passage of the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill through the Senate, securing a two-thirds majority with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines. The bill, seeking crucial changes to a number of articles mostly dealing with the judiciary and the military leadership, was presented before the upper house of parliament for a final vote by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar amid a noisy protest by opposition senators. As soon as Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani started putting up the bill for a clause-by-clause vote, the opposition senators started gathering in front of his dais and chanted anti-government slogans. They tore up copies of the bill and agenda and some of them were seen hurling the documents towards the law minister, prompting the sergeants-at-arm to make a human wall at the aisle between the treasury and the opposition benches to prevent any possible physical clash. After staying in the house for a few minutes, the opposition senators belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) staged a walkout from the house, providing the government with an opportunity to proceed smoothly. After holding the vote on the bill by division, Senate Chairman Gilani announced that the 27th Amendment bill had been passed with 64 votes, which is not less than a two-thirds majority in the 96-member house. After casting his vote against the party line, PTI’s Saifullah Abro announced his resignation from the house. Speaking on the floor, Senator Abro said he had “voted only for [Field Marshal] Gen Asim Munir”, adding that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by defeating India in the May war. He added that during the [passage of the] 26th Amen­dment, “my 10 family members were abducted, but my party [PTI] did not come to the rescue. Interestingly, when he tendered his resignation, Senate Chairman Gilani said, “We will make you a senator again”. Meanwhile, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. Changes in the bill During yesterday’s Senate session, PPP Senator Farooq Naek presented the final report on the bill, approved by the standing committees on the law and justice of the two houses, highlighting three to four changes that had been suggested by members. About the changes incorporated into the bill on recommendation of the parliamentary committees, Senator Naek said the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) would have equal representation of all provinces besides a representative from the Islamabad High Court. He said the initial draft of the bill stated a judge having served for seven years in the high court could be nominated for the FCC, but this qualification merit has been curtailed to five years on the recommendation. Moreover, he said, the committees agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. On the other hand, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. However, he added, if multiple judges would take the oath the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. Also, the parliamentary committees suggested a change in the nomination for the reconstituted Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), he said. The 26th Amendment had authorised the speaker to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate for the JCP, he explained. However, the committees proposed that the nominee should be a technocrat, he added. The PPP senator said the suo motu powers of judges had not been taken away, but the court would exercise these powers only when an application was submitted. “The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed,” he said. The PPP senator, who was part of the committee that examined the initial draft of the bill, said that an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided under Article 199 of the Constitution. Since this created a huge backlog, the amendment suggested that interim order would be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made, he explained. Referring to the procedure of judges’ transfer, Mr Naek said previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, the President could transfer judges with their consent and after consultation with the chief justices of both relevant high courts. However, this procedure has been amended, he said. “Now a judge refusing his transfer would be given an opportunity of presenting his reasons for the decline before the JCP. And if the JCP finds the reasons invalid, he would have to retire,” the senator explained. About the provision of lifetime immunity to the president from facing criminal trial or arrest under Article 248, he said it was suggested that this immunity would not be available if the President holds a public office after the end of his term, but as soon as he ceases that public office he would again be entitled to this immunity. According to a proposed amendment in Article 243, this type of lifetime immunity has also been provided to the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the navy.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that Kabul must understand that lasting peace could only be achieved by reining in terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil. “Afghanistan must understand that lasting peace can only be realised by reining in Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory,” Shehbaz said while addressing the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference in Islamabad. In his remarks, the premier said that the theme of the conference, “Peace, Security and Development”, could not be more timely and relevant. He added that the theme was particularly resonant for Pakistan, saying that the country had always advocated for peace through dialogue and diplomacy. “We firmly believe that peace and security form the foundation of sustainable national and regional development,” he said. “The true value of peace is most profoundly understood when we are confronted with the conflicts that continue to plague our world,” he said. The premier especially called attention to the recent border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, calling Islamabad’s response “firm and decisive, teaching an unforgettable lesson”. He also deeply appreciated the efforts of Turkiye and Qatar in facilitating peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban regime. “A peaceful Afghanistan holds the key to regional connectivity, peace, and prosperity,” he said. “This peace has remained elusive for decades. However, Pakistan has never lost hope. We believe in a peaceful neighbourhood and have been striving hard for this purpose,” he asserted. He regretted that terrorist groups continued to “imperil peace”, both within Afghanistan and outside it. The premier also talked about the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. “In May, Pakistan faced unprovoked aggression from the eastern front. Our armed forces displayed remarkable preparedness and performed outstandingly on the battlefield,” he said. “Having won the war, we need to win peace, through sincere and honest efforts,” Shehbaz said. He added that Pakistan’s commitment to upholding peace and security was manifested by its constructive role at diplomatic forums including the United Nations ( UN ), Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ), Economic Cooperation Organisation ( ECO ) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ). The prime minister’s remarks come days after a third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif insisted that the negotiations were “over” and had “entered an indefinite phase”.

      "summary_en": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that Kabul must understand that lasting peace could only be achieved by reining in terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil. “Afghanistan must understand that lasting peace can only be realised by reining in Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory,” Shehbaz said while addressing the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference in Islamabad. In his remarks, the premier said that the theme of the conference, “Peace, Security and Development”, could not be more timely and relevant. He added that the theme was particularly resonant for Pakistan, saying that the country had always advocated for peace through dialogue and diplomacy. “We firmly believe that peace and security form the foundation of sustainable national and regional development,” he said. “The true value of peace is most profoundly understood when we are confronted with the conflicts that continue to plague our world,” he said. The premier especially called attention to the recent border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, calling Islamabad’s response “firm and decisive, teaching an unforgettable lesson”. He also deeply appreciated the efforts of Turkiye and Qatar in facilitating peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban regime. “A peaceful Afghanistan holds the key to regional connectivity, peace, and prosperity,” he said. “This peace has remained elusive for decades. However, Pakistan has never lost hope. We believe in a peaceful neighbourhood and have been striving hard for this purpose,” he asserted. He regretted that terrorist groups continued to “imperil peace”, both within Afghanistan and outside it. The premier also talked about the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. “In May, Pakistan faced unprovoked aggression from the eastern front. Our armed forces displayed remarkable preparedness and performed outstandingly on the battlefield,” he said. “Having won the war, we need to win peace, through sincere and honest efforts,” Shehbaz said. He added that Pakistan’s commitment to upholding peace and security was manifested by its constructive role at diplomatic forums including the United Nations ( UN ), Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ( OIC ), Economic Cooperation Organisation ( ECO ) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ). The prime minister’s remarks come days after a third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif insisted that the negotiations were “over” and had “entered an indefinite phase”. The defence minister also said that the fragile ceasefire agreed between the two countries stood for the time being but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”.

      "summary_orig": "Supreme Court (SC) Justice Athar Minallah has written an emphatic letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, calling for the convening of a conference to consider threats to the judiciary while also lamenting the use of the apex court as an instrument to suppress the people’s will by “unelected elite”, it emerged on Tuesday. The development comes as the government is making moves for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The bill, which has been passed by the Senate, seeks crucial changes to a number of articles, mostly dealing with the judiciary and the military leadership. In the seven-page letter, which Dawn has seen, Justice Minallah said that the missive was being recorded as a “solemn duty to the Constitution and to place on record for future generations how their destiny was being shaped behind the marble walls of the last resort of justice”. He said that it was being written in the wake of recent events, which had greatly eroded public confidence in the judiciary. “Institutions are not built overnight, but they can be destroyed in no time through fear, surrender or submission to the powers. The history of our judiciary is not unblemished nor flattering. However, its past failings, no matter how grave, cannot justify its continued capture to serve the interests of the unelected elites,” he said. Justice Minallah said that as a sitting SC judge, he felt it was his duty to raise his concerns regarding the erosion of the people’s trust. “I had taken an oath to defend, protect, and preserve the Constitution, but find myself helpless because the fundamental rights covenanted to the people have too often been reduced to mere cliché or rhetoric. We may pretend otherwise, but the stark reality is unpleasant and embarrassing for me as a judge of the highest Court and as a guardian of the Constitution,” he said. Justice Minallah said that the truth had been concealed from the people for too long, adding that they had been misled and exploited so that the elite capture could sustain. “From the very inception of our independence, the history of the state has been marred by the unholy alliance between certain state institutions and entrenched elites. An alliance having the hallmark of control, privilege, and impunity. The SC, by design or omission, has too often been employed as an instrument to suppress the will of the people rather than to safeguard it,” he said. ‘Political dissent has been criminalised’ In his letter, Justice Minallah also said that jurisprudence had too often bowed before power and might instead of standing on the side of the people. He highlighted the removal and execution of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, saying it “remains one of the gravest and most unpardonable betrayal of our oath and of the people’s trust”. He further said that the persecution of Benazir Bhutto by “unelected elements” within state institutions, and the disqualification of Nawaz Sharif and the harassment of him and his daughter were a “continuation of a pattern of suppression of the people’s will when the interests of the unelected elite were threatened”. The SC judge noted that President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also fallen victim to this phenomenon. “The phenomenon represents a consistent pattern of elite manipulation, wherein leaders are fostered and then ruined. Once they are backed by the people’s mandate, they are systemically dismantled if and when they challenge the entrenched power. The will of the people has repeatedly been subverted to perpetuate the elite capture of the state; a betrayal and subversion that strikes at the very heart of constitutional democracy,” he said. He said that PTI founder Imran Khan was also being victimised under the same cycle of suppression. “Political dissent has been criminalised, those who refuse to bend, including women, are made to endure inhuman conditions. It is no longer a secret that justice is denied to them,” he said. “The truth is known to us, but it is whispered only in the tea room and chambers of this Court. The independence of this institution has too often been compromised from within, whether through surrender or through active participation,” he said. “We proclaim ourselves to be guardians of the fundamental rights, but we maintained silence when a former chief justice of Pakistan told us that the phenomenon of enforced disappearance had reached his doorstep. We also chose to look the other way when another chief justice, who in the context of the reserved seats case , had warned twelve judges of this very court that he was the one responsible for stalling the imposition of martial law and that ‘they would come and send us home’.” He further said that under the watch of the apex court, electoral outcomes were manipulated, the will of the people suppressed, dissenting voices silenced, undesirable political allegiance and opinions criminalised, and journalists abducted or intimidated. ‘Need for introspection undeniable’ Justice Minallah further said that at this critical juncture, the need for introspection was “undeniable”. “I would respectfully urge that a judicial conference be convened for having an open institutional dialogue with all judges of the SC and the high courts to consider threats to independence of the judiciary that may be jeopardising its constitutional function of acting as a machinery for enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens,” he said. “A candid and open discussion on the state of our institution, the challenges to its independence, and the steps necessary to reclaim the people’s trust has become inevitable. The judiciary is at a perilous crossroads. The truth must be spoken at this moment of reckoning,” he said. He further said that Parliament may wish to consider the judiciary’s institutional perspective articulated through the proposed judicial conference, before it embarks upon “tinkering with the basic law of the land”. He noted that news reports suggested that preparations were underway to house the new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) within the building of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC). “What is the invisible process through which some within the judiciary have been made aware of the changes that are to proposed through a Constitutional amendment? And what explains their eagerness to make advance administrative arrangements to accommodate the proposed structure of the judiciary even prior to the Parliament considering it?” he asked. He said that the judiciary’s foremost loyalty lay not in self-preservation nor in deference to power but in allegiance to the people and to the Constitution. “This court and the judiciary as an institution are at a perilous crossroad and silence in the face of the systemic erosion of judicial independence would only\namount to complicity. Our oath compels us to speak and uphold the truth and to guard the Constitution even when it is inconvenient to do so,” he said. Full court demanded amid executive onslaught Justice Minallah’s letter comes a day after Justice Mansoor Ali Shah , in addition to several lawyers and former judges , requested CJP Afridi to play his role and act as the guardian of the judiciary’s independence. Senior puisne judge Shah, in a six-page letter, described the proposed amendment as a political device to weaken the judiciary and urged CJP Afridi to confront the executive to lay down a rule that no amendments affecting the judiciary be adopted without prior consultations with superior judges. “You [CJP] act not merely as its administrator but as its guardian,” Justice Shah said while also requesting a full court meeting or preferably a joint convention of all constitutional court judges, including the FSC and high courts, to articulate the judiciary’s collective stance. Justice Shah emphasised that this moment demanded leadership, transparency and institutional resolve. If such consultation is not initiated under CJ’s stewardship, it will inevitably be seen as acquiescence and an abdication of the trust reposed in the high office, he added. In his letter, Justice Shah also questioned the justification for creating the proposed FCC, asking what constitutional vacuum it would seek to fill. The proposed FCC does not arise from any genuine reform agenda, and its judges will be appointed without any constitutional parameters, as was the case with the Constitutional Bench (CB), the letter said, adding that such an arrangement vested decisive power in the executive and invited manipulation of the judicial process. A court may serve transient political interests, but it will permanently damage the republic, he added. Separately, former judges and top lawyers also wrote a letter to CJP Afridi, urging him to summon a full court meeting to discuss the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The request came in a letter that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers.",

Our oath compels us to speak and uphold the truth and to guard the Constitution even when it is inconvenient to do so,” he said. Full court demanded amid executive onslaught Justice Minallah’s letter comes a day after Justice Mansoor Ali Shah , in addition to several lawyers and former judges , requested CJP Afridi to play his role and act as the guardian of the judiciary’s independence. Senior puisne judge Shah, in a six-page letter, described the proposed amendment as a political device to weaken the judiciary and urged CJP Afridi to confront the executive to lay down a rule that no amendments affecting the judiciary be adopted without prior consultations with superior judges. “You [CJP] act not merely as its administrator but as its guardian,” Justice Shah said while also requesting a full court meeting or preferably a joint convention of all constitutional court judges, including the FSC and high courts, to articulate the judiciary’s collective stance. Justice Shah emphasised that this moment demanded leadership, transparency and institutional resolve. If such consultation is not initiated under CJ’s stewardship, it will inevitably be seen as acquiescence and an abdication of the trust reposed in the high office, he added. In his letter, Justice Shah also questioned the justification for creating the proposed FCC, asking what constitutional vacuum it would seek to fill. The proposed FCC does not arise from any genuine reform agenda, and its judges will be appointed without any constitutional parameters, as was the case with the Constitutional Bench (CB), the letter said, adding that such an arrangement vested decisive power in the executive and invited manipulation of the judicial process. A court may serve transient political interests, but it will permanently damage the republic, he added. Separately, former judges and top lawyers also wrote a letter to CJP Afridi, urging him to summon a full court meeting to discuss the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The request came in a letter that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers.",

Professor Beckett argues that the current turbulence at the BBC goes far beyond the fallout from a “bad edit” of Trump's infamous January 6th speech in a special edition of Panorama on Trump's second run for the presidency. Our guest asserts that the BBC's \"extraordinary\" loss of its top two executives is symptomatic of a decline in institutional trust, squeezed resources, weakened oversight and an environment in which politicised criticism and commercial pressure undermine the idea of an independent public service broadcaster. And the fragility of journalism is becoming more evident in a fractured hyper-politicised media eco‑system, where the audience demands relevance, the players fight for funding, and the mission becomes harder to maintain. Professor Beckett contends that if the BBC cannot defend its distinctiveness, transparency and value, we may lose not just a broadcaster but a valued global institution that has long stood for “objective, evidence‑based” journalism. The crisis, then, is both internal and external: \"In the same way that Donald Trump attacked media organisations that weren't slavishly loyal to him, so we're getting a much more partisan approach from politicians in the UK, and indeed from our newspapers, like the Daily Telegraph, which has always been very honestly right-wing, but is increasingly anti-BBC.",

In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Mamdani emerged as the city’s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, clinching just over 50 per cent of the vote in one of the most closely watched races in decades. The shock wasn’t just in the result. It was in how he won. It was an insurgent campaign powered by aunties, taxi drivers, club DJs and night-shift nurses — not your average billionaires and consultants. Mamdani turned relentless field work into a campaign that made New Yorkers feel seen and the diaspora feel represented; a moment that spilled across boroughs and ricocheted through diasporas from Queens to Karachi. And yet, this victory wasn’t about vibes or progressive ideology alone. It was a strategy rooted in something older and truer: proximity. Mamdani embedded himself in the city’s daily rhythms from dawn at taxi depots to dusk at tai chi sessions, and from Queens bodegas to Bronx dance floors meeting New Yorkers where they actually live. While the existing political establishment figures such as Andrew Cuomo relied on TV ads and fundraisers, Mamdani relied on multilingual messaging, human contact and most importantly, the moral weight of showing up. The architecture a movement Long before declaring his run for Mayor, Mamdani stood shoulder to shoulder with medallion-debt taxi drivers, sleeping on pavements during their 2021 hunger strike . That solidarity didn’t fade with time; in fact, it matured into a network of trust. When he finally ran, those same drivers became his storytellers and precinct captains, spreading his name through garages, mosques, diners, and WhatsApp groups. While traditional campaigns clocked off at sunset, Mamdani’s chose to come alive. Volunteers canvassed outside airports, hospitals, and bodegas at odd hours handing out tea, talking and logging contacts all in real time. In immigrant corridors such as Jackson Heights, Richmond Hill and Flushing, “pop-ups” replaced rallies in the form of micro-events filled with food, music, and one key message: We see you. Moreover, in a race obsessed with youth turnout, Mamdani quietly also focused on seniors. He joined tai chi classes in Lower Manhattan parks, opting for softer introductions over hard pitches. It was low-ego politics that transformed sceptics into supporters. “He didn’t talk to us,” one volunteer recalled. “He moved with us.” Politics is never really found on a dance floor, but Mamdani’s team leaned in . From salsa nights to queer venues based in Brooklyn, the campaign turned nightlife into voter registration drives with club promoters and DJs becoming unexpected messengers of policy, blending the beat to the sound of ballot reminders. Then came the diaspora multiplier; the secret superstructure of the campaign. His campaigning understood the power of kinship. South Asian, Caribbean, West African and Arab communities were mobilised through WhatsApp groups, diaspora radio, Gen Z’s and auntie-driven relational networks where “Aunties for Zohran” became both a meme but also a massive movement. But what appeared spontaneous was rigorously organised. Nearly 100,000 volunteers helped knock on over a million doors . Nightly debriefs, real-time mapping, and turf adjustments turned chaos into choreography. Mamdani’s core promises were tailored to free buses, rent relief and childcare, which were repeated in every language, every borough. Simple, unfiltered and accessible. He told Time : “If your politics can’t be explained at a bus stop, it’s not politics for the people.” The campaign’s short-form videos, meme-ready graphics, and participatory humour turned supporters into broadcasters. Every now and then, Mamdani let his personality slip through the political cadence — a lyric dropped mid-speech, a joke left hanging just long enough. At one event, he wove a line from PinkPantheress into a point about political honesty, delivering it so casually that half the crowd caught it a beat late before bursting into laughter. It didn’t feel like a gimmick; it felt like someone speaking in the cultural shorthand of the city he was trying to lead. Unlike other campaigns that treated social media as more of an afterthought, Mamdani’s team engineered virality as a primal form of mobilisation, using key platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube to feed real-world turnout. Even the campaign’s visual identity felt like a love letter to the city. Mamdani’s team didn’t just campaign at full throttle, they redlined the engine, moving at a pace that made the establishment look motionless. The team pulled from the design grammar of everyday New York: the hand-painted warmth of bodega signs, the punchy signage of Coney Island, flashes of taxi-yellow, and a bold purple reminiscent of vintage Brooklyn Dodgers iconography. It also felt like the campaigning signage was layered with a touch of Bollywood’s saturated colour sensibility. The palette felt joyful rather than corporate; deeply human rather than consultant-made. It was an aesthetic born from the streets he canvassed, a visual dialect telling New Yorkers, before a single speech was delivered, ‘I speak your language.’ The establishment’s miscalculation Andrew Cuomo entered the race assuming that name recognition, big donors, and a polished record would suffice. His campaign operated from Midtown boardrooms, not subway platforms; it was flush with billionaire donations yet starved of intimacy. Cuomo ran a race built for an electorate that no longer exists. It wasn’t that he lacked achievements ; in fact, his record was full of landmark reforms. As governor, he signed the NY SAFE Act , one of the nation’s strongest gun-control laws in the wake of Sandy Hook; expanded paid family leave; legalised same-sex marriage in New York ; and positioned himself as a leader on climate action. But in this campaign, he rarely invoked those victories. Instead of defending a record that once resonated with working New Yorkers, he leaned on legacy and attacked his opponent. The absence was telling as his policies may have been progressive on paper, but his campaign’s posture was unmistakably elite. While Mamdani was out walking subway platforms and sitting in taxi garages, Cuomo spoke from studios and fundraisers. The result was a contrast of scale and sincerity: one man meeting voters where they lived, and another trying to remind them who he used to be. Institutional Democrats mistook endorsement lists for enthusiasm. Their outreach centred on press hits, corporate lunches, union halls, and Manhattan fundraisers, while Mamdani’s people were canvassing, dancing, and listening in the places politics tends to forget. The result was a rare thing in New York: a grassroots landslide that elite money couldn’t stop. The view from the ground And if policy analysts could see the strategy, ordinary New Yorkers could feel its effects even more sharply. For Amal, 26, who lives in Manhattan, Mamdani’s win wasn’t just political, it was personal. “I’m Muslim and South Asian, and living in New York you can feel how much our community keeps this city running — cab drivers, Uber drivers, restaurant workers, small businesses. They’re the backbone of New York, but they’ve always been invisible in politics. This isn’t about being given a chance; it’s about finally being seen.” “Zohran’s campaign captured the real essence of New York. People forget this city’s true demographic, that it’s a land of immigrants. He went everywhere — from Orthodox Jewish neighbourhoods to Queens — walking from Upper to Lower Manhattan and talking to people. He captured what New York really is: fast, chaotic, crazy, alive!” Amal recalled the exact moment she realised his campaign understood the city’s texture. “I realised his campaign was different the moment he got on a Citi Bike . If you’re a New Yorker, you know that’s the great equaliser, everyone rides one. It told me he understood New York’s culture at a granular level. He wasn’t throwing money at consultants or hiding behind buzzwords. He was out there, doing the everyday things we do.” She added that it was a small gesture, but it revealed a larger truth about Mamdani: he communicates fluently in the city’s everyday language, not as performance, but as instinct. “Right now, with everything happening globally, Islamophobia is rampant. I’m excited to see him challenge that, to break stereotypes around South Asians and Muslims in public life,” she remarked. For Ryan, 30, also based in Manhattan, the win was less about symbolism and more about substance — a campaign that finally spoke to the city’s working realities. “I knew it was going to happen. 70pc of Mamdani’s votes came from people under 30, the generation feeling the full brunt of how unaffordable New York has become. You’d need to make around $150,000 before tax to afford a $5,000 rental, and even then, rent takes up 60-70pc of your income. That’s how out of reach living in this city is.” Mamdani’s policies — from rent freezes to free childcare — didn’t just resonate ideologically; they answered the most basic urban question: how do we live here? “This was the first time we had a candidate who was educated, informed, and not part of some political dynasty. People are tired of lineage politics. They want accountability. Most people in New York don’t have a sob story; we’re educated, ambitious, doing well on paper, but still struggling to afford life here. Mamdani represents those of us who are doing everything right but still can’t make the math work,” he said. For Erica, a 30-year-old Brooklynite, Mamdani’s rise was less a surprise than a correction; the moment New York finally rewarded a campaign that felt genuinely built for its people. “He was everywhere. His campaign was chronically online and offline at the same time, and that meant he was reaching groups of New Yorkers who have never really felt seen by politicians before. You could feel how authentically he was out in the community, talking to people who agreed with him and people who didn’t. It felt very personal.” Affordability was the point where her personal life and Mamdani’s message met most sharply. “It’s almost impossible as a young person trying to imagine a future here, owning a home and raising a family. So to have a candidate say openly that what we’ve tried in the past hasn’t worked and it’s time for something new, felt refreshing.” Mamdani’s identity as a South Asian Muslim became a political talking point in itself, often weaponised by opponents who tried to frame his campaign as identity-driven rather than policy-driven. But Erica didn’t see performance; she saw focus. “It felt policy-grounded. He never strayed from his three main promises. He kept steering the conversation back to the three promises: free fast buses, a rent freeze and universal child care. Everyone knew exactly what he stood for,” she noted. A turnout surge and future of city politics More than two million New Yorkers voted, this being the city’s highest mayoral turnout this century. Mamdani secured 50.4pc of the votes , Cuomo trailed at 41.8pc, and Republican Curtis Sliwa fell below 7pc. In victory, Mamdani told supporters in Queens, “We built this with our hands, our phones, our feet. We proved that New York’s power doesn’t sit in the skyscrapers, it walks these streets.” Mamdani’s win is a case study in how campaigns will be run, not only in New York, but in any city where trust has eroded and communities crave presence over polish. He turned political participation into something social, visible, and joyful. The message to future candidates is simple: if you’re willing to do the hours, you can beat the machine. In a world tired of cynicism, Mamdani’s win offered something rare: proof that hope is not naïve but rather a strategy. And as he walked out to the pulsing intro of Dhoom Machale , the message was clear: it wasn’t just a win; it was an arrival. This was a moment only he could pull off, a choice that sent the Gen Z and millennials into full-body joy. It was pop-culture mischief and political messaging at once, a South Asian anthem turned victory strut. It told New Yorkers exactly who their new mayor is. Fall of the old guard While Mamdani’s campaign strategy was undoubtedly decisive, elections are rarely won on tactics alone. His rise was aided by a confluence of factors and demographic shifts, record youth turnout, and widespread disillusionment with establishment politics. Issues like housing affordability, public transport, and cost of living had reached a boiling point, creating fertile ground for his message. Cuomo’s overreliance on legacy power and donor networks only sharpened that contrast. Mamdani’s victory, then, wasn’t a fluke of charisma or digital virality, it was the political expression of a city that had outgrown the comfort of its old elite.",

For Erica, a 30-year-old Brooklynite, Mamdani’s rise was less a surprise than a correction; the moment New York finally rewarded a campaign that felt genuinely built for its people. “He was everywhere. His campaign was chronically online and offline at the same time, and that meant he was reaching groups of New Yorkers who have never really felt seen by politicians before. You could feel how authentically he was out in the community, talking to people who agreed with him and people who didn’t. It felt very personal.” Affordability was the point where her personal life and Mamdani’s message met most sharply. “It’s almost impossible as a young person trying to imagine a future here, owning a home and raising a family. So to have a candidate say openly that what we’ve tried in the past hasn’t worked and it’s time for something new, felt refreshing.” Mamdani’s identity as a South Asian Muslim became a political talking point in itself, often weaponised by opponents who tried to frame his campaign as identity-driven rather than policy-driven. But Erica didn’t see performance; she saw focus. “It felt policy-grounded. He never strayed from his three main promises. He kept steering the conversation back to the three promises: free fast buses, a rent freeze and universal child care. Everyone knew exactly what he stood for,” she noted. A turnout surge and future of city politics More than two million New Yorkers voted, this being the city’s highest mayoral turnout this century. Mamdani secured 50.4pc of the votes , Cuomo trailed at 41.8pc, and Republican Curtis Sliwa fell below 7pc. In victory, Mamdani told supporters in Queens, “We built this with our hands, our phones, our feet. We proved that New York’s power doesn’t sit in the skyscrapers, it walks these streets.” Mamdani’s win is a case study in how campaigns will be run, not only in New York, but in any city where trust has eroded and communities crave presence over polish. He turned political participation into something social, visible, and joyful. The message to future candidates is simple: if you’re willing to do the hours, you can beat the machine. In a world tired of cynicism, Mamdani’s win offered something rare: proof that hope is not naïve but rather a strategy. And as he walked out to the pulsing intro of Dhoom Machale , the message was clear: it wasn’t just a win; it was an arrival. This was a moment only he could pull off, a choice that sent the Gen Z and millennials into full-body joy. It was pop-culture mischief and political messaging at once, a South Asian anthem turned victory strut. It told New Yorkers exactly who their new mayor is. Fall of the old guard While Mamdani’s campaign strategy was undoubtedly decisive, elections are rarely won on tactics alone. His rise was aided by a confluence of factors and demographic shifts, record youth turnout, and widespread disillusionment with establishment politics. Issues like housing affordability, public transport, and cost of living had reached a boiling point, creating fertile ground for his message. Cuomo’s overreliance on legacy power and donor networks only sharpened that contrast. Mamdani’s victory, then, wasn’t a fluke of charisma or digital virality, it was the political expression of a city that had outgrown the comfort of its old elite.",

      "summary_orig": "Islamabad has warned that the acquisition of abandoned weapons by terrorist groups based in Afghanistan not only threatens peace and security in Pakistan but also in the region. Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations, made the remarks while addressing the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) open debate on small arms late on Monday, according to a press release by the mission. In his remarks, Ambassador Iftikhar said, “Pakistan is seriously concerned about the presence of stockpiles of sophisticated arms and ammunition in Afghanistan, as noted in the findings of the secretary general’s reports.” The report states that transnational criminal dynamics were observed in Afghanistan, where possible arms and ammunition transfer to neighbouring states in breach of the arms embargo and unofficial markets for weapons have emerged, further escalating the threat to regional security. The envoy said Pakistan had “credible information of attempts to smuggle these arms to neighboring countries for terrorist activities”. “Weapons confiscated at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border are traced back to stockpiles of weapons left behind by foreign forces in Afghanistan and illegal weapons being sold across black markets in Afghanistan,” Ambassador Iftikhar said. “The movement of unmarked or unregistered weapons across the international border sustain and aid non-state armed groups, terrorist networks, and criminal gangs, undermining regional security and stability,” he said. He further said that Pakistan was “deeply concerned” at the acquisition and use of these “mostly abandoned, modern and potent weapons by terrorist groups based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose serious challenge to peace and security in Pakistan and the broader region”. He said that terrorist entities, such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K), the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade, had used these weapons against Pakistani civilians and law enforcement agencies, leading to the loss of thousands of lives. “We urge stronger international efforts to prevent access of illicit arms to armed terrorist groups in Afghanistan and to ensure that the Afghan interim authorities adhere to their international obligations and commitments in that regard,” he said. “The international community needs to step up its efforts and plug gaps in its response to effectively address these threats to international and regional peace and security,” he added. In his remarks, the envoy also noted that small arms and light weapons had emerged as “instruments of choice for non-state actors to perpetrate violence”, adding that illicit arms directly threatened national security and impeded counter-terrorism operations, and civilian protection. He further said that illicit weapons impeded development prospects, contributed to human rights abuses and imperiled peace, security and stability. “We firmly believe that the issue of illicit small arms and light weapons should be addressed comprehensively and in a balanced manner,” Ambassador Iftikhar said. “The United Nations’ ‘Programme of Action on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects’ strikes a balance between the legitimate security requirements of states and the imperative to address the issue of illicit arms on both the supply and demand sides. We remain committed to its implementation at the national level and call for its full execution at the global level to safeguard and promote international and regional peace and security,” he said. As the US troops departed Afghanistan in August 2021, they destroyed more than 70 aircraft, dozens of armoured vehicles and disabled air defences before flying out of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport following a chaotic evacuation operation. However, a large stock of weapons and equipment was still left behind that was coopted by the Afghan Taliban. The arms also fell into the hands of the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group and other terrorist outfits, as pointed out by Pakistan and others. Islamabad has repeatedly raised concerns over the use of Afghan soil by militants for cross-border terror­­ism and called on the United Nations for a “concerted campaign” to recover all weapons from terrorist groups such as the TTP. In January, the Foreign Office said the presence of advanced US weapons in Afghanistan following the August 2021 withdrawal had become a “profound concern” for Pakistan’s safety and security. The Washington Post also reported in April that terrorists who attacked the Jaffar Express train in Balochistan in March used weapons left behind when United States forces withdrew from Afghanistan. According to The Post , an M4A1 carbine rifle built by American manufacturer Colt was recovered from the site of the attack. The rifle’s serial number indicated that it was part of billions of dollars worth of weaponry sent to US forces in Afghanistan.",

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: The month-long closure of Torkham border crossing has caused a cumulative loss of over $4.5 billion and another Rs16.5 billion in terms of exports and imports respectively through Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan. Sources among official and trading circles told Dawn that Pakistan had already lost over 65 per cent of the Afghan market to Iran, some Central Asian States, Turkiye and even India due to hostile and aggressive trade policies dictated by security issues since the installation of the Taliban regime in Kabul in August 2021. They said that while big time Pakistan and Afghan exporters had lifted their capital from the export-import business between the two neighbouring countries due to the repeated border closure and a hostile environment for traders and investors, the month-long closure of all border points had seriously dented the confidence of remaining “bunch” of small traders. The sources said that while the uncertain situation had also dealt a severe blow to the burgeoning local manufacturing industry in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the border closure had seriously impacted manufacture of hundreds of daily items in Punjab and Sindh, which were exported to Afghanistan under the head of the miscellaneous items daily prior to the closure of the border. They said that Afghanistan was currently importing cement, garments, shoes and slippers, a variety of edibles including different vegetables, fresh fruits, fish, chicken and other poultry items, animal feed and confectionery items. The sources said that the prolonged border closure had negatively impacted the potato and banana exports, while the kinnow export was also in doldrums if immediate steps were not taken to ease border tensions. Qari Nazeem Gul, an exporter and clearing agent, told Dawn that even before the border tensions began, at least markets in Kabul and Jalalabad were flooded with Iranian, Turkish and Central Asian products with Iran grabbing the major share of its exports to Afghanistan. He said that Afghan traders were more interested and comfortable in doing trade with Iran instead of Pakistan as Iran was offering them more relaxations in acquisition of visas and custom duties. “We are now hugely disheartened with the current pattern of complicated business with Afghanistan with most of the local traders now developing a hatred for the said trade due to continuous security and political issues between the two neighbouring countries,” he said. Equally concerned was Mujeebullah Shinwari, who heads the Torkham customs clearing agents association. “We’ve long been advocating for a trader-friendly policy by the government with special focus on alienating bilateral trade from security and political issues with Afghanistan,” he said. Mr Shinwari said that the volume of Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan had dropped from $2.5 billion in the years from 2012 to 2016 to a mere $800 to 900 million dollars on an annual basis. “Gone are the times when 1000-1200 shipping containers loaded with multiple export items would cross over to Afghanistan on a daily basis, as we now have 250-300 containers left in the export field on a daily basis,” he said. The customs clearing agents’ leader said that the suspension of bilateral trade was also harming revenue generation through tax collection under various heads that was up till now a handsome amount for the national exchequer. He said that the current volatile and uncertain situation had deeply affected the small-time businessmen, traders and even shopkeepers in local markets as a large number of people affiliated with different trading fields had lost their legitimate earnings. Mr Shinwari said that the local trading and transport community had never experienced such a long closure of the border with a majority of the vehicle owners who got stranded due to sudden closure of Torkham on October 12 were now contemplating to switch over to other less profitable business venture in order to cover for the month-long financial loses. He suggested the formation of an all-powerful jirga of leading tribal elders, politicians and traders to hold meaningful dialogue with officials of both the countries to find a mutually agreed formula for reopening of all borders points for trading and thus, saving business communities of both countries from further financial losses. Meanwhile, Israr Shinwari, head of a local youth organisation, has demanded the immediate reopening of the Torkham border through a powerful jirga mediating between the two countries. During a meeting in Landi Kotal on Monday, he said that the Pak-Afghan border points should be kept open in all circumstances, with a special focus on promoting trade between the two countries. Mr Shinwari, however, warned a series of protest demonstrations would be staged if their legitimate demands weren’t met. Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",

      "title": "Month-long Torkham border closure inflicts $4.5 billion trade losses",
      "summary": "KHYBER: The month-long closure of Torkham border crossing has caused a cumulative loss of over $4.5 billion and another Rs16.5 billion in terms of exports and imports respectively through Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan. Sources among official and trading circles told Dawn that Pakistan had already lost over 65 per cent of the Afghan market to Iran, some Central Asian States, Turkiye and even India due to hostile and aggressive trade policies dictated by security issues since the installation of the Taliban regime in Kabul in August 2021. They said that while big time Pakistan and Afghan exporters had lifted their capital from the export-import business between the two neighbouring countries due to the repeated border closure and a hostile environment for traders and investors, the month-long closure of all border points had seriously dented the confidence of remaining “bunch” of small traders. The sources said that while the uncertain situation had also dealt a severe blow to the burgeoning local manufacturing industry in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the border closure had seriously impacted manufacture of hundreds of daily items in Punjab and Sindh, which were exported to Afghanistan under the head of the miscellaneous items daily prior to the closure of the border. They said that Afghanistan was currently importing cement, garments, shoes and slippers, a variety of edibles including different vegetables, fresh fruits, fish, chicken and other poultry items, animal feed and confectionery items. The sources said that the prolonged border closure had negatively impacted the potato and banana exports, while the kinnow export was also in doldrums if immediate steps were not taken to ease border tensions. Qari Nazeem Gul, an exporter and clearing agent, told Dawn that even before the border tensions began, at least markets in Kabul and Jalalabad were flooded with Iranian, Turkish and Central Asian products with Iran grabbing the major share of its exports to Afghanistan. He said that Afghan traders were more interested and comfortable in doing trade with Iran instead of Pakistan as Iran was offering them more relaxations in acquisition of visas and custom duties. “We are now hugely disheartened with the current pattern of complicated business with Afghanistan with most of the local traders now developing a hatred for the said trade due to continuous security and political issues between the two neighbouring countries,” he said. Equally concerned was Mujeebullah Shinwari, who heads the Torkham customs clearing agents association. “We’ve long been advocating for a trader-friendly policy by the government with special focus on alienating bilateral trade from security and political issues with Afghanistan,” he said. Mr Shinwari said that the volume of Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan had dropped from $2.5 billion in the years from 2012 to 2016 to a mere $800 to 900 million dollars on an annual basis. “Gone are the times when 1000-1200 shipping containers loaded with multiple export items would cross over to Afghanistan on a daily basis, as we now have 250-300 containers left in the export field on a daily basis,” he said. The customs clearing agents’ leader said that the suspension of bilateral trade was also harming revenue generation through tax collection under various heads that was up till now a handsome amount for the national exchequer. He said that the current volatile and uncertain situation had deeply affected the small-time businessmen, traders and even shopkeepers in local markets as a large number of people affiliated with different trading fields had lost their legitimate earnings. Mr Shinwari said that the local trading and transport community had never experienced such a long closure of the border with a majority of the vehicle owners who got stranded due to sudden closure of Torkham on October 12 were now contemplating to switch over to other less profitable business venture in order to cover for the month-long financial loses. He suggested the formation of an all-powerful jirga of leading tribal elders, politicians and traders to hold meaningful dialogue with officials of both the countries to find a mutually agreed formula for reopening of all borders points for trading and thus, saving business communities of both countries from further financial losses. Meanwhile, Israr Shinwari, head of a local youth organisation, has demanded the immediate reopening of the Torkham border through a powerful jirga mediating between the two countries. During a meeting in Landi Kotal on Monday, he said that the Pak-Afghan border points should be kept open in all circumstances, with a special focus on promoting trade between the two countries. Mr Shinwari, however, warned a series of protest demonstrations would be staged if their legitimate demands weren’t met. Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Indigenous leaders demand protection for their territories • Scientists highlight rapid destabilisation of the planet’s frozen regions • It’s unclear whether states would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for end of the event BELEM: The COP30 climate summit opened Monday in this Amazon city with the UN climate chief urging countries to cooperate with one another in the fight against a warming planet rather than battling over competing priorities. Host country Brazil brokered an agreement on the agenda for the two-week summit, fending off attempts from developing-country negotiating blocs to shoehorn contentious issues like climate finance and carbon taxes into the formal talks. The opening day was marked by calls for unity, stark warnings from scientists and Indige­nous groups, and a notable abse­nce by the US federal government that drew sharp criticism from one of its own governors. “In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another — your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates from more than 190 countries attending the conference. Stiell acknowledged that three decades of UN climate talks had helped to bend the curve in projected warming downward, “because of what was agreed in halls like this, with governments legislating, and markets responding.” It remained unclear whether countries would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for the end of the event — a hard sell in a year of fractious global politics and US efforts to obstruct a transition away from fossil fuels. Some officials have suggested that countries focus on smaller efforts that do not need universal consensus, after years of COP summits making lofty promises only to leave many unfulfilled. Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned against interests trying to obscure the dangers of climate change in his opening remarks. “They attack the institutions, the science, the universities,” he said. “It’s time to imp­ose another defeat to denialists.” The world’s biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States, opted to skip the summit at the federal level, while US President Donald Trump asserts that climate change is a hoax. However, a state-level US presence was expected, with California Gov Gavin Newsom and New Mexico Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham scheduled to arrive in Belem on Tuesday. Addressing a global investors summit, Newsom questioned the federal government’s disengagement. “What the hell is going on here?” Newsom said about the US government’s absence from the talks. “We’re in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world’s great democracies. I mean hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50 percent tariffs,” Newsom said. European nations planned to use the summit to press for firm commitments. Germany said it would join other European countries to push for commitments to rein in fossil fuel use, a goal also promoted by Lula. Warning signs Delegates were joined by Indigenous leaders, who arri­v­ed on Sunday by boat after travelling some 3,000 kilometres (1,864 miles) from the Andes. They are demanding more say in how their territories are managed as climate change escalates and industries such as mining, logging and oil drilling push deeper into forests. “We want to make sure that they don’t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,” said Pablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru.—Reuters Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",

Addressing a global investors summit, Newsom questioned the federal government’s disengagement. “What the hell is going on here?” Newsom said about the US government’s absence from the talks. “We’re in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world’s great democracies. I mean hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50 percent tariffs,” Newsom said. European nations planned to use the summit to press for firm commitments. Germany said it would join other European countries to push for commitments to rein in fossil fuel use, a goal also promoted by Lula. Warning signs Delegates were joined by Indigenous leaders, who arri­v­ed on Sunday by boat after travelling some 3,000 kilometres (1,864 miles) from the Andes. They are demanding more say in how their territories are managed as climate change escalates and industries such as mining, logging and oil drilling push deeper into forests. “We want to make sure that they don’t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,” said Pablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru.—Reuters Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",

      "summary": "• Indigenous leaders demand protection for their territories • Scientists highlight rapid destabilisation of the planet’s frozen regions • It’s unclear whether states would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for end of the event BELEM: The COP30 climate summit opened Monday in this Amazon city with the UN climate chief urging countries to cooperate with one another in the fight against a warming planet rather than battling over competing priorities. Host country Brazil brokered an agreement on the agenda for the two-week summit, fending off attempts from developing-country negotiating blocs to shoehorn contentious issues like climate finance and carbon taxes into the formal talks. The opening day was marked by calls for unity, stark warnings from scientists and Indige­nous groups, and a notable abse­nce by the US federal government that drew sharp criticism from one of its own governors. “In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another — your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates from more than 190 countries attending the conference. Stiell acknowledged that three decades of UN climate talks had helped to bend the curve in projected warming downward, “because of what was agreed in halls like this, with governments legislating, and markets responding.” It remained unclear whether countries would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for the end of the event — a hard sell in a year of fractious global politics and US efforts to obstruct a transition away from fossil fuels. Some officials have suggested that countries focus on smaller efforts that do not need universal consensus, after years of COP summits making lofty promises only to leave many unfulfilled.

      "summary_orig": "• CJCSC urged troop mobilisation • COAS cautioned against hasty escalation ISLAMABAD: The Natio­nal Secur­ity Committee (NSC) did not overrule the then army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa’s response plan during the 2019 Balakot crisis , according to at least two participants of that meeting who spoke on Monday. “The then army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s response strategy was agreed upon and executed by the Pakistan Air Force,” said a federal minister who attended the meeting, adding that the then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, Gen Zubair Hayat, had proposed a more radical option that was not accepted. An armed forces official who also participated in the meeting gave a similar account, saying that then prime minister Imran Khan was “displeased” with Gen Hayat’s suggestion, which he thought “did not make any sense.” The statements counter a recent claim by former defence secretary Lt Gen (Retd) Asif Yasin Malik, who said that during the 2019 NSC meeting held after the Balakot strikes, Gen Bajwa had advised restraint but was overruled by the air chief and the CJCSC. The 2019 escalation followed a Feb 14 suicide bombing in Pulw­ama, India-occupied Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel. India responded with airstrikes on Balakot on Feb 26, the first time since the 1971 war that Indian aircraft had crossed deep into Pakistani territory. According to the two participants, who spoke separately to Dawn , the sequence of events began in the early hours of Feb 26, 2019, when then chief of general staff (CGS) Gen Nadeem Raza called Gen Bajwa at about 2:30am to report an Indian airstrike near Balakot. Gen Bajwa asked for an assessment of the damage, and the CGS later informed him that no significant damage had occurred. A seminary built during the Afghan war, used for religious education of local children, had been the intended target. However, the missile missed its mark and landed some distance away, causing no casualties or structural damage. Soon afterwards, the then air chief marshal Mujahid Anwar contacted Gen Bajwa to discuss the situation. Gen Bajwa suggested that since no damage had been caused, the matter could be addressed during a meeting with the prime minister later that morning. Before attending the NSC meeting, Gen Bajwa convened his core team at General Headquarters (GHQ), where the director general of military operations (DGMO) suggested that Pakistan must respond, but in a measured way, to avoid escalation. The DGMO proposed that, unlike India’s night raid on a single site, Pakistan should strike multiple targets in broad daylight to send a clear message and restore deterrence. The response operation, later known as Operation Swift Retort , was conceived during these consultations. Gen Bajwa then took the plan to the National Security Committee meeting at the Prime Minister’s House. During the session, Gen Zubair Hayat spoke for about 40 minutes, emphasising that he was the prime minister’s principal adviser in times of war. When Gen Bajwa asked for his concrete suggestion, Gen Hayat proposed full mobilisation of troops and a declaration of war against India. According to participants, Gen Bajwa cautioned against hasty escalation. He then presented the operational plan prepared at GHQ, which was approved by the NSC. The detailed strategy was subsequently discussed with the PAF chief, who executed the air operation, they recalled. On Feb 27, Pakistani aircraft struck six targets in India-occupied Kashmir, hitting “open spaces” to demonstrate their capability to hit Indian targets without escalating the tensions further.

      "summary_orig": "At least two terrorists were killed during an attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan on Monday as security forces conducted a clearance operation at the educational facility, said the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The military’s media wing said the initial attempt by the terrorists to breach the perimeter security was foiled by the “vigilant and resolute response by own troops”. However, the attackers then rammed an explosives-laden vehicle against the main gate of the college, causing it to collapse and damaging an adjacent structure. The terrorists then entered the educational facility and were “cornered in the college’s administrative block”. “Displaying unwavering courage and professional excellence, own troops engaged the intruders with precision, eliminating two khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij ,” said the ISPR. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. The ISPR added that the terrorists, inside the college, are in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan and “are getting instructions”. “This blatant act of barbarism orchestrated by Khwarij from Afghanistan is in contrast to assertions made by the Afghan Taliban Regime claiming non-presence of these terrorist groups on their soil.” The military added that Pakistan reserves the right to respond against the terrorists and their leadership present in Afghanistan. “These khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij have once again tried to repeat the barbaric act of terrorism carried out by them in Army Public School Peshawar in 2014 ,” said the ISPR. On December 16, 2014, Pakistan lived through one of its most horrific chapters. The attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar and the operation to clear out the terrorists unfolded in less than 10 hours, during which 147 people, including 132 schoolchildren, were martyred. The military maintained that the latest attack aims to instill fear among the youth of the tribal areas, “who are acquiring quality education at their doorstep to excel in life and achieve a better future for not only themselves and their families but also for their communities.” Earlier today, the military’s media wing said at least 20 terrorists were killed in North Waziristan and Dara Adam Khel districts of KP. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel. PM, Naqvi condemn attack Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attack and lauded the retaliatory action of the security forces. He said the cowardly enemy had once again tried to target an educational institution and failed. “Unwavering resolve of the security forces will thwart the nefarious designs of the terrorists,” the premier added. “The entire nation salutes the security forces,” he said, adding that the government was determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the professionalism and courage of the security personnel for repelling the attack and eliminating two terrorists. He said the timely and decisive action of the forces prevented a major tragedy and demonstrated their high level of preparedness. “By thwarting the terrorists’ attempt, our brave soldiers have once again proven their dedication to protecting the nation,” Naqvi said. Naqvi reiterated that the government and people stood united against terrorism and would continue efforts to eradicate all extremist elements from the country. State broadcaster PTV News also released a video message from parents of the students condemning the attackers and expressing their solidarity with the security forces.",

      "title_orig": "27th Constitutional Amendment Bill sails through Senate; PTI senator resigns after voting in favour",
      "summary_orig": "The contentious bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment sailed through the Senate on Monday after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The government and its coalition partners secured a two-thirds majority in the vote following the defection of two opposition members, leading to a total of 64 votes for the bill. The bill, which had stirred controversy in the country for weeks, was presented in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the proceedings. Initially, a clause-by-clause voting was carried out. Later, voting by division was conducted, with the entry and exit gates of the Senate closed as per the protocol. View this post on Instagram Before the passage of the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward Tarar’s table as he began to present it. Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber — paving the way for the smooth passage of the bill. A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s (NA) law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House. Following its approval by the Senate, the bill will also have to be voted on in the NA. The session had begun today but it was adjourned. The NA will now reconvene at 11am tomorrow (Tuesday). In the 336-member NA, the ruling coalition does enjoy a two-thirds majority. It has 233 members while the opposition holds 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM-P 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each. PTI senator resigns after voting in favour Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI resigned shortly after voting in favour of the bill. Speaking on the floor of the upper house, the lawmaker said he “voted only for Syed Gen Asim Munir”. He added that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by winning the war with India. “During the 26th Amendment, 10 family members of mine were abducted, but my party (PTI) did not come to the rescue.” When he tendered his resignation, the Senate chairman said, “We will make you a senator again”. Senators Saifullah Abro and Naseema Ehsan are seated in the Senate. — YouTube/PTV Parliament The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl also expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. ‘Historic bill’ Shortly after the passage of the bill, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to the floor of the house and termed the amendment a “historic bill”, saying that it was an “unfinished agenda” of the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by almost all political parties. “There was a feeling to maintain balance, and thus a constitutional court is being formed for the betterment of the judiciary,” he said. Dar added that the rank of field marshal was now included in the Constitution, adding that space was created for the rank of a five-star general in all three military forces. “The seniority of the current SC judges and the chief justice would not be impacted by the amendment,” he clarified. Govt presents parliamentary committee’s report Earlier in the day, Naek tabled a report in the Senate detailing some changes made in the draft bill by the parliamentary committee. Chairman Gilani asked for the opposition members to be called to the house as well, so they could be present during the briefing. Naek told the house that the joint committee deliberated on the bill for two days and made “many changes”. Sharing further details, he said the bill proposed the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which the committee “unanimously” approved with some changes to the relevant clause. Outlining those changes, he said there would be equal representation of all provinces in the FCC, and it would also include a representative from the Islamabad High Court. Moving on to the second change, he said the initial draft of the bill stated that a judge could be nominated for the FCC after serving on the high court for seven years. The committee reduced this qualification merit for the FCC from seven to five years, he added. Naek further said that the committee also agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. However, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. Moreover, he continued, if multiple judges would take the oath on the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. He added that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was reconstituted under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, with the speaker being authorised to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate to become a member. The committee changed this to include a technocrat, Naek said. “So now, the speaker can nominate a woman, non-Muslim or technocrat who qualifies to be a member of Parliament for the JCP.” He highlighted that currently, the SC had suo motu powers and could invoke Article 183 of the Constitution to take up a case at its discretion. As for the FCC, “we have retained the suo motu powers […] but we would exercise these powers when an application is submitted. The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed”. On the transfer of judges, the PPP senator said that previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, judges could be transferred by the president, but the consent of the said judge was required, and two chief justices of the relevant high courts were consulted. “The amended bill has changed the method of transfers, as now, a judge will be transferred from one high court to another through the JCP, which was reconstituted under the 26th Amendment and has the representation of all — the executive, parliament, judges, civil society, and lawyers,” Naek said. Naek said that under Article 199 of the Constitution, an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided. This created a huge backlog, he remarked, adding that the interim order would now be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made until then. Senate debate The Senate session began shortly after 11am with Senator Manzoor Kakar presiding over the proceedings in the absence of Chairman Gilani. At the outset, he said some speeches regarding the constitutional amendment could not be delivered yesterday, and proceedings today would begin with those addresses. He then gave the floor to PML-N’s Agha Shahzaib Durrani, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by the opposition benches. During his speech, Durrani mentioned that the opposition had questioned that what was the need for a constitutional court. He justified this need, citing the backlog of cases in the Supreme Court. Durrani also berated the opposition, particularly the PTI, for “abolishing the democracy” and “turning the President’s House into an ordinance factory” during its tenure. His speech was followed by that of PPP’s Zamir Hussain Ghumro, who rejected the opposition’s criticism that the 27th Amendment was a “9/11 on Pakistan“ . He defended the planned establishment of the constitutional court, alleging that the SC had not been performing its “original function, but enforcing fundamental rights, which is a function of the high courts”. “The Supreme Court has been interfering in [matters of] Parliament and the executive,” he claimed, further justifying the need for the constitutional court. “It will not only strengthen the independence of the judiciary but also the federation,” he argued. Regarding the proposed changes to Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he recalled the recent conflict with India in May . “The chief of army staff, the Field Marshal won a war for Pakistan,” he said, adding that he deserved immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests. “What is the problem with this? Do you want to drag your heroes through the streets and courts?” he questioned. He added that the PPP believed the 27th Amendment would be a “milestone in advancing democracy, the Constitution, and the 18th Amendment”. After Ghumro concluded his speech, PTI’s Fawzia Arshad pointed out that an opposition leader had still not been notified in the Senate. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Shibli Faraz in August. Arshad said the pendency of the notification was a denial of legislative rights to the PTI. She also assailed the proposed 27th Amendment and its proponents, saying that “institutions are being trampled and their rights are being taken away”. For his part, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Amir Waliuddin Chishti said his party was promised changes to Articles 142 (advocate general for a province) and 140-A (local government) under the 27th Amendment. “Now, after two days, I am hearing that while the amendments came under discussion, it is being said that they may be included in the 28th Amendment,” he added. PML-N Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu also referred to the May conflict, saying, “The entire nation won the war. The media and opposition also won. Everyone did. But under whose leadership? General Syed Asim Munir sahib .” Senator Sindhu quipped that it was not as if some land was being named for the army chief, but only an honorary title was being bestowed on him. He claimed that all Commonwealth nations had officers who remained in uniform for life. He also highlighted Field Marshal Munir’s role in “trade and foreign affairs as he accompanied the prime minister” on multiple visits. The PML-N leader dismissed the concerns regarding the 27th Amendment as “frivolous and concocted”, asserting there was nothing contradictory to the Constitution in it. Later, Kakar paused the proceedings and said the house would meet again at 3.30pm. Speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, a key minister said the government planned to get the bill passed today, “no matter what.” Will ensure amendment does not pass: PTI Separately, PTI Senator Ali Zafar said while speaking to the media in Parliament that the opposition would ensure the amendment was not passed if the government did not have the requisite numbers. “It is possible they may not be able to table it today,” he said while speaking to the media. He further said that the opposition was against giving immunity from criminal proceedings to anyone. “We are saying that if anyone has committed a crime, be it a president or a governor, they should be punished according to the law and the Constitution,” he said. However, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar defended the inclusion of a clause for providing lifetime immunity to the president from criminal proceedings and arrests under the proposed amendment. “The heads of state enjoy immunity across the world. This is a choice, and this system prevails in the whole world […] I think there is no harm in this,” he said while speaking to the media. He also welcomed the premier’s decision not to pursue the clause for immunity. The minister further said the amendment was for “good governance”, improving the federation’s relationship with the provinces, and for strengthening defence“. He said, constitutional courts also existed in other parts of the world, adding that this was also included in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006. Tarar said the demand for constitutional courts was jointly made by the PML-N, PPP and the Awami National Party, and that the Constitution was a living document which continued to evolve. He asserted that the government had the requisite votes, terming the amendment “positive” and in line with international practices. MQM-P backs Article 243, reiterates call for LG powers In his address, Senator Faisal Subzwari, parliamentary leader for the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), said: “When you concede your space, those succeeding you get even less space.” As he looked towards the opposition benches, Subzwari expressed the wish that politicians were as concerned about merits and justice when they were in power themselves. He stressed that all highs had a downfall, adding that the remark was meant for everyone. Speaking on changes in Article 243, he said, “We wish that after the passage of this amendment […] the honour of the Pakistan Army, the defence of Pakistan and the state of Pakistan rises, especially during a time when India — much more powerful than us and with a more armed military — is present on our eastern front.” The MQM-P leader also mentioned the “dispute” on the western front with Afghanistan, and added that on such occasions, there was a need to “encourage and support the armed forces in every possible manner”. He criticised PTI’s Omar Ayub for making remarks in the National Assembly that doubted the military’s preparedness and arms supplies. On the “much-debated” changes being brought in the judiciary, Subzwari said the formation of the FCC should “bear fruit” and not remain limited to high courts. “What steps have been taken by the constitutional courts that will be formed or have been formed that will impact the ordinary petitioner?” We need to answer this,“ he said. Subzwari recalled the MQM-P’s demand for local bodies’ autonomy made in an amendment submitted in the NA last year. He noted that the matter was still with the relevant standing committee and said the MQM-P will approach other parties, including the PTI and the PPP, for it. He refuted the impression that empowering local governments (LGs) amounted to rolling back the 18th Amendment that provided provincial autonomy. The lawmaker stressed that giving LGs powers in the same way as provinces was to ensure that the citizens there received the resources distributed to them. “This is a case for Jacobabad and Kashmore, and of Sajidabad and Rahim Yar Khan, which are away from their provincial capitals,” he said. Subzwari acknowledged that the proposals made earlier on the National Finance Commission (NFC) shares — which were not included in the current amendment bill following the PPP’s opposition — needed a debate. He suggested that a certain share be allocated for provincial finance commissions in the NFC.",

      "summary_en": "The contentious bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment sailed through the Senate on Monday after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The government and its coalition partners secured a two-thirds majority in the vote following the defection of two opposition members, leading to a total of 64 votes for the bill. The bill, which had stirred controversy in the country for weeks, was presented in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the proceedings. Initially, a clause-by-clause voting was carried out. Later, voting by division was conducted, with the entry and exit gates of the Senate closed as per the protocol. View this post on Instagram Before the passage of the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward Tarar’s table as he began to present it. Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber — paving the way for the smooth passage of the bill. A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s (NA) law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House. Following its approval by the Senate, the bill will also have to be voted on in the NA. The session had begun today but it was adjourned. The NA will now reconvene at 11am tomorrow (Tuesday). In the 336-member NA, the ruling coalition does enjoy a two-thirds majority. It has 233 members while the opposition holds 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM-P 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each. PTI senator resigns after voting in favour Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI resigned shortly after voting in favour of the bill. Speaking on the floor of the upper house, the lawmaker said he “voted only for Syed Gen Asim Munir”. He added that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by winning the war with India. “During the 26th Amendment, 10 family members of mine were abducted, but my party (PTI) did not come to the rescue.” When he tendered his resignation, the Senate chairman said, “We will make you a senator again”. Senators Saifullah Abro and Naseema Ehsan are seated in the Senate. — YouTube/PTV Parliament The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl also expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. ‘Historic bill’ Shortly after the passage of the bill, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to the floor of the house and termed the amendment a “historic bill”, saying that it was an “unfinished agenda” of the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by almost all political parties. “There was a feeling to maintain balance, and thus a constitutional court is being formed for the betterment of the judiciary,” he said. Dar added that the rank of field marshal was now included in the Constitution, adding that space was created for the rank of a five-star general in all three military forces. “The seniority of the current SC judges and the chief justice would not be impacted by the amendment,” he clarified. Govt presents parliamentary committee’s report Earlier in the day, Naek tabled a report in the Senate detailing some changes made in the draft bill by the parliamentary committee. Chairman Gilani asked for the opposition members to be called to the house as well, so they could be present during the briefing. Naek told the house that the joint committee deliberated on the bill for two days and made “many changes”. Sharing further details, he said the bill proposed the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which the committee “unanimously” approved with some changes to the relevant clause. Outlining those changes, he said there would be equal representation of all provinces in the FCC, and it would also include a representative from the Islamabad High Court. Moving on to the second change, he said the initial draft of the bill stated that a judge could be nominated for the FCC after serving on the high court for seven years. The committee reduced this qualification merit for the FCC from seven to five years, he added. Naek further said that the committee also agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. However, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. Moreover, he continued, if multiple judges would take the oath on the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. He added that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was reconstituted under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, with the speaker being authorised to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate to become a member. The committee changed this to include a technocrat, Naek said. “So now, the speaker can nominate a woman, non-Muslim or technocrat who qualifies to be a member of Parliament for the JCP.” He highlighted that currently, the SC had suo motu powers and could invoke Article 183 of the Constitution to take up a case at its discretion. As for the FCC, “we have retained the suo motu powers […] but we would exercise these powers when an application is submitted. The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed”. On the transfer of judges, the PPP senator said that previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, judges could be transferred by the president, but the consent of the said judge was required, and two chief justices of the relevant high courts were consulted. “The amended bill has changed the method of transfers, as now, a judge will be transferred from one high court to another through the JCP, which was reconstituted under the 26th Amendment and has the representation of all — the executive, parliament, judges, civil society, and lawyers,” Naek said. Naek said that under Article 199 of the Constitution, an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided. This created a huge backlog, he remarked, adding that the interim order would now be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made until then. Senate debate The Senate session began shortly after 11am with Senator Manzoor Kakar presiding over the proceedings in the absence of Chairman Gilani. At the outset, he said some speeches regarding the constitutional amendment could not be delivered yesterday, and proceedings today would begin with those addresses. He then gave the floor to PML-N’s Agha Shahzaib Durrani, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by the opposition benches. During his speech, Durrani mentioned that the opposition had questioned that what was the need for a constitutional court. He justified this need, citing the backlog of cases in the Supreme Court. Durrani also berated the opposition, particularly the PTI, for “abolishing the democracy” and “turning the President’s House into an ordinance factory” during its tenure. His speech was followed by that of PPP’s Zamir Hussain Ghumro, who rejected the opposition’s criticism that the 27th Amendment was a “9/11 on Pakistan“ . He defended the planned establishment of the constitutional court, alleging that the SC had not been performing its “original function, but enforcing fundamental rights, which is a function of the high courts”. “The Supreme Court has been interfering in [matters of] Parliament and the executive,” he claimed, further justifying the need for the constitutional court. “It will not only strengthen the independence of the judiciary but also the federation,” he argued. Regarding the proposed changes to Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he recalled the recent conflict with India in May . “The chief of army staff, the Field Marshal won a war for Pakistan,” he said, adding that he deserved immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests. “What is the problem with this? Do you want to drag your heroes through the streets and courts?” he questioned. He added that the PPP believed the 27th Amendment would be a “milestone in advancing democracy, the Constitution, and the 18th Amendment”. After Ghumro concluded his speech, PTI’s Fawzia Arshad pointed out that an opposition leader had still not been notified in the Senate. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Shibli Faraz in August. Arshad said the pendency of the notification was a denial of legislative rights to the PTI. She also assailed the proposed 27th Amendment and its proponents, saying that “institutions are being trampled and their rights are being taken away”. For his part, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Amir Waliuddin Chishti said his party was promised changes to Articles 142 (advocate general for a province) and 140-A (local government) under the 27th Amendment. “Now, after two days, I am hearing that while the amendments came under discussion, it is being said that they may be included in the 28th Amendment,” he added. PML-N Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu also referred to the May conflict, saying, “The entire nation won the war. The media and opposition also won. Everyone did. But under whose leadership? General Syed Asim Munir sahib .” Senator Sindhu quipped that it was not as if some land was being named for the army chief, but only an honorary title was being bestowed on him. He claimed that all Commonwealth nations had officers who remained in uniform for life. He also highlighted Field Marshal Munir’s role in “trade and foreign affairs as he accompanied the prime minister” on multiple visits. The PML-N leader dismissed the concerns regarding the 27th Amendment as “frivolous and concocted”, asserting there was nothing contradictory to the Constitution in it. Later, Kakar paused the proceedings and said the house would meet again at 3.30pm. Speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, a key minister said the government planned to get the bill passed today, “no matter what.” Will ensure amendment does not pass: PTI Separately, PTI Senator Ali Zafar said while speaking to the media in Parliament that the opposition would ensure the amendment was not passed if the government did not have the requisite numbers. “It is possible they may not be able to table it today,” he said while speaking to the media. He further said that the opposition was against giving immunity from criminal proceedings to anyone. “We are saying that if anyone has committed a crime, be it a president or a governor, they should be punished according to the law and the Constitution,” he said. However, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar defended the inclusion of a clause for providing lifetime immunity to the president from criminal proceedings and arrests under the proposed amendment. “The heads of state enjoy immunity across the world. This is a choice, and this system prevails in the whole world […] I think there is no harm in this,” he said while speaking to the media. He also welcomed the premier’s decision not to pursue the clause for immunity. The minister further said the amendment was for “good governance”, improving the federation’s relationship with the provinces, and for strengthening defence“. He said, constitutional courts also existed in other parts of the world, adding that this was also included in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006. Tarar said the demand for constitutional courts was jointly made by the PML-N, PPP and the Awami National Party, and that the Constitution was a living document which continued to evolve. He asserted that the government had the requisite votes, terming the amendment “positive” and in line with international practices. MQM-P backs Article 243, reiterates call for LG powers In his address, Senator Faisal Subzwari, parliamentary leader for the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), said: “When you concede your space, those succeeding you get even less space.” As he looked towards the opposition benches, Subzwari expressed the wish that politicians were as concerned about merits and justice when they were in power themselves. He stressed that all highs had a downfall, adding that the remark was meant for everyone. Speaking on changes in Article 243, he said, “We wish that after the passage of this amendment […] the honour of the Pakistan Army, the defence of Pakistan and the state of Pakistan rises, especially during a time when India — much more powerful than us and with a more armed military — is present on our eastern front.” The MQM-P leader also mentioned the “dispute” on the western front with Afghanistan, and added that on such occasions, there was a need to “encourage and support the armed forces in every possible manner”. He criticised PTI’s Omar Ayub for making remarks in the National Assembly that doubted the military’s preparedness and arms supplies. On the “much-debated” changes being brought in the judiciary, Subzwari said the formation of the FCC should “bear fruit” and not remain limited to high courts. “What steps have been taken by the constitutional courts that will be formed or have been formed that will impact the ordinary petitioner?” We need to answer this,“ he said. Subzwari recalled the MQM-P’s demand for local bodies’ autonomy made in an amendment submitted in the NA last year. He noted that the matter was still with the relevant standing committee and said the MQM-P will approach other parties, including the PTI and the PPP, for it. He refuted the impression that empowering local governments (LGs) amounted to rolling back the 18th Amendment that provided provincial autonomy. The lawmaker stressed that giving LGs powers in the same way as provinces was to ensure that the citizens there received the resources distributed to them. “This is a case for Jacobabad and Kashmore, and of Sajidabad and Rahim Yar Khan, which are away from their provincial capitals,” he said. Subzwari acknowledged that the proposals made earlier on the National Finance Commission (NFC) shares — which were not included in the current amendment bill following the PPP’s opposition — needed a debate. He suggested that a certain share be allocated for provincial finance commissions in the NFC.",

      "summary_orig": "The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday ordered the Punjab Wildlife Department to submit a report on the demolition of a pet market in the walled city within 30 days and decide on a framework to prevent such incidents from occurring again, according to the lawyer who filed the petition with the court. A demolition operation was carried out at a bird market in Lahore’s Bhati Chowk area, near Data Darbar last Friday by the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), with shopkeepers accusing the Punjab government of killing dozens of birds and other caged pets; allegations the government has denied. This incident led to public outrage as the animals were not moved during the demolition. Animal rights lawyer Altamush Saeed filed a petition with the LHC on Saturday, naming the Punjab government, the Punjab Wildlife and Fisheries Department and the LDA, as respondents. A press release stated that the court ordered the Wildlife Department to submit a “comprehensive report” on the matter. It added that LHC Judge Shehram Sarwar ordered the Wildlife Department to treat Saeed’s petition as a “formal representation” and submit a comprehensive report to the court on the demolition within 30 days. According to the lawyer, the department was ordered to include in its report the details and causes of the demolition, a concrete road map to ensure similar incidents do not happen in the future, criminal action against those responsible, and training and sensitivity programmes to promote “empathy and responsibility” towards animals within the Punjab government and its departments. The press release also stated that if the Wildlife Department does not submit the report within the 30-day deadline, they would be “brought back before the court under contempt proceedings”. “These deaths were entirely preventable. Had the [LDA] coordinated with the Wildlife Department, these animals could have been safely relocated,” the press release read. In separate comments to Dawn , Saeed stated that the department had an obligation to coordinate with the LDA to protect the animals at the market. “The legal issue is that [with] the demolition and everything that happened, the Wildlife Department had to be involved for the relocation of the animals,” he explained to Dawn . “That did not happen and that is why the animals died. “Secondly, there’s no accountability from the LDA as well, therefore sending this matter to Wildlife — which has the right authority and the legal authority under the Punjab Wildlife Act — to not only take criminal action, but also to devise some kind of framework that [ensures] this does not happen again.” Saeed noted that the department should have been involved from he beginning since they were the right authority to decide on the matter, adding that had the issue gone directly to the LDA, “we would have lost”. “You can clearly see that the LDA did everything unilaterally; the department does not have the jurisdiction to deal with wild animals, it also does not have the expertise,” Saeed stated. “We have no idea when the animals were relocated, we have no idea where they’re actually relocated. Secondly, it’s not in their (the LDA) legal domain to do so.” The petition — available with Dawn — requested that the court declare the actions of the LDA and the Lahore commissioner and DC’s actions “illegal if [the] killing of animals is proved and to ensure regardless [that] future projects of any kind do involve a safe animal evacuation or relocation program and no animal cruelty”. It further requested that six of the respondents launch an inquiry into the matter and publicly collect debris and rubble from the demolition site, in order to prove the presence of animals when the structure was torn down. “In the interim, do not allow any debris excavation without transparency to prevent [the] removal of evidence,” the petition read. It further requested that the court order the Punjab government “to hold ethics and empathy training on animal and human rights in light of Islam and the policy for government employees and [the] general public in line with Article 9, 9A and 25A of the constitution”.",

      "summary_en": "The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday ordered the Punjab Wildlife Department to submit a report on the demolition of a pet market in the walled city within 30 days and decide on a framework to prevent such incidents from occurring again, according to the lawyer who filed the petition with the court. A demolition operation was carried out at a bird market in Lahore’s Bhati Chowk area, near Data Darbar last Friday by the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), with shopkeepers accusing the Punjab government of killing dozens of birds and other caged pets; allegations the government has denied. This incident led to public outrage as the animals were not moved during the demolition. Animal rights lawyer Altamush Saeed filed a petition with the LHC on Saturday, naming the Punjab government, the Punjab Wildlife and Fisheries Department and the LDA, as respondents. A press release stated that the court ordered the Wildlife Department to submit a “comprehensive report” on the matter.

      "summary_orig": "Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday rubbished the notion that the status of incarcerated former premier Imran Khan had any bearing on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s withdrawal of proposed immunity for the top office as part of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Government senators Anusha Rahman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu had tabled a proposal for the 27th Amendment bill to extend the immunity currently enjoyed by the president under Article 248 of the Constitution to include the prime minister. The clause sought to extend presidential immunity to the prime minister, effectively barring criminal proceedings against the premier during the term in office. Article 248 of the Constitution stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office”. However, PM Shehbaz had ordered the clause’s withdrawal on Sunday, saying that the premier must remain “fully accountable”. Separately, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had said that PM Shehbaz told him earlier that “he had no interest in getting immunity”, owing to the executive nature of his role as the prime minister. Questioned in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’ today about speculation that the clause was withdrawn because it could potentially benefit the PTI founder, Sanaullah said: “No. If we had intended to do this, we could also have done it in a way that the benefit would apply only from today.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. He served as the prime minister from August 2018 till April 2022, when he was ousted through a vote of no-confidence. He said the prime minister made a very “democratic” decision and he should be congratulated for it. The premier’s aide added that the premier’s office was not a constitutional one but an executive and elected office, thus “it should remain answerable to the people”. PM Shehbaz was elected as the 24th premier of Pakistan in the 2024 general elections. Article 95 of the Constitution of Pakistan allows for a prime minister to be impeached via a no-confidence motion. It states: “A resolution for a vote of no-confidence moved by not less than twenty per centum of the total membership of the National Assembly may be passed against the Prime Minister by the National Assembly.” Issue of immunity Discussion also veered towards a post on X by renowned Islamic scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani, a former judge of the Federal Shariat Court, against immunity for anyone. “In our Constitution, previously, the president was granted protection during their tenure, which was against Islam. Now, granting anyone such protection for life is completely against the spirit of Sharia and the Constitution, and would be extremely shameful for the country … A heartfelt request to the members of Parliament is that they should not take this sin upon themselves.” Questioned about the senior scholar’s post, Sanaullah instead asked whether such immunity was not already present for the president, or was it being granted for the first time. He said the immunity would end if the president again accepted any public office. He said the president enjoyed immunity in his term of office since 1973 and such was the case for other heads of state around the world as well.",

      "summary_orig": "The government is set to table the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment in tomorrow’s National Assembly session after it sailed through the Senate kn Monday. A notification from the NA Secretariat for the orders of the day for Tuesday’s session said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar would table the bill. Today’s NA session was adjourned after being marred by ruckus from the treasury and opposition benches during speeches from each side. PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf was disrupted by shouting from the opposition benches as he began to speak in the NA. Speaking on the immunity for the president, he said this was standard practice in many countries for the head of state. Ashraf assailed the opposition, asking who was it to criticise the treasury benches when its ranks were filled with those who had violated the Constitution. As he continued to speak, PTI lawmakers chanted slogans of “Go Zardari go” and “Long live Imran Khan” while terming the former prime minister as “Raja rental”. The former premier said the opposition was only content when it was raising a hue and cry in the house, adding that treasury benches would react in a similar manner to any speaker from the other side. Taking the floor after the PPP leader, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the need for haste in the matter and said all stakeholders were not consulted and taken on board. Meanwhile, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi paid tribute to the army chief for “the respect God has granted us with in the world because of him and our martyrs”. The minister said Pakistan would fight every terrorist till they abandon militancy, whether they were in Pakistan, Afghanistan, or any other corner of the world. Earlier today, the government and its coalition partners secured a two-thirds majority in the Senate vote for the bill following the defection of two opposition members. The bill, which had stirred controversy in the country for weeks, was presented in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the proceedings. Before the passage of the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward the Tarar’s table as he began to present it. Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber — paving the way for the smooth passage of the bill. A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House. Approval by parliamentary committees The bill, which was tabled by Tarar in the Senate on Saturday amid outcry from the opposition and hours after getting the federal cabinet’s nod, aims to set up a federal constitutional court and grant lifetime status to the field marshal rank. On Sunday, a joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees had app­roved the 27th Consti­tutional Amendment bill with minor changes amid a boycott by the opposition. Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also attended the meeting, said all key amendments, including changes to Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces” and pertains to the military command structure, were amicably approved by both committees. Senator Naek, who was presiding over the meeting, said the bill was adopted with minor changes. He said that the committees empowered him and the law minister to make a couple of amendments. The committees, however, deferred the Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s (MQM) proposal, seeking to amend Article 140 that pertains to local governments, as well as the Awami National Party’s (ANP) recommendation for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The ANP had submitted a proposal to rename the province by removing ‘Khyber’, arguing that Khyber was a district and other provinces did not include district names in their titles. Likewise, the Balochistan National Party’s proposed amendment to increase the province’s seats in Parliament was also deferred. Earlier in the day, ANP’s Hidayatullah Khan told reporters that the committee had sought time until Monday to decide on his party’s suggestion for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Meanwhile, the law minister told reporters it was dec­ided that provinces would be taken into confidence on changing KP’s name.",
