      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday evening, directing agencies to initiate the formal process for designating certain chapters of the Muslim Brotherhood as terrorist organisations. The Muslim Brotherhood is already outlawed as a terrorist group in some countries, such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. More recently, Jordan banned it in April of this year. Signed at the White House on November 24, the order specifically mentioned its chapters in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. It stated that it “sets in motion a process by which certain chapters or other subdivisions of the Muslim Brotherhood shall be considered for designation” as both foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs) and specially designated global terrorists (SDGTs) under US counterterrorism laws. The directive described the Brotherhood as having developed into a “transnational network” since its founding in Egypt in 1928, with chapters across the Middle East that, according to the order, “engage in or facilitate and support violence and destabilisation campaigns” that harm their regions, US citizens, and American interests. The order highlighted activities attributed to Brotherhood chapters in Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt. It cited the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel which led to Tel Aviv’s relentless military campaign in the Palestinian enclave, stating that the Lebanese chapter’s military wing “joined Hamas, Hezbollah, and Palestinian factions to launch multiple rocket attacks against both civilian and military targets within Israel“. The White House document further noted that “a senior leader of the Egyptian chapter of the Muslim Brotherhood … called for violent attacks against US partners and interests“. It added that the Jordanian chapter’s leaders “have long provided material support to the militant wing of Hamas”. “It is the policy of the US to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the capabilities and operations” of chapters that may be designated under this process, the order said. It also instructed agencies to act to “deprive those chapters of resources, and thereby end any threat” they posed to US nationals and national security. Implementation timeline The executive order also established a clear timeline. Within 30 days, the secretaries of State and Treasury must submit a joint report evaluating which chapters should be designated. After that, the order directed that the relevant department must, within 45 days, take “all appropriate action” to complete the designations under the Immigration and Nationality Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Founded in Egypt in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood has been the subject of long-running debate within US policymaking circles. Some chapters have functioned as political parties participating in elections, while others have been accused by regional governments of supporting militant groups. Past US administrations resisted designating the organisation outright, citing its diverse branches and concerns over destabilising political consequences. Trump’s order marks the most detailed administrative mechanism yet to evaluate specific national chapters individually rather than treating the Brotherhood as a monolithic entity. Last week, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is also a Republican like Trump, had designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation at a state level.",

Shenzhou-22 was originally slated for a crewed launch in 2026. But it was launched early after a suspected space debris strike to the Shenzhou-20 return capsule made it unsafe for re-entry to Earth, leaving its crew briefly stranded. The Shenzhou-20 team returned aboard Shenzhou-21 on November 14 — nine days later than planned — leaving their relief crew without a reliable return vehicle. Recent Shenzhou missions have been used to crew China’s Tiangong space station, exchanging teams of three astronauts every six months. The accelerated launch ensures Shenzhou-21 astronauts Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang have a safe return option. The three were “working normally and in good condition”, the China Manned Space Agency said on Monday before the Shenzhou-22 launch. China is the third nation to put humans in orbit after the United States and the former Soviet Union. It has been excluded from the International Space Station since 2011, when the US banned Nasa from collaborating with Beijing. It has since sought to bring other countries into its efforts and signed a deal with Pakistan in February to recruit the first foreign “taikonauts” — a term used for astronauts in China’s space programme.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI/ISLAMABAD: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Pakistan Peoples Party’s Parliamentary Party Leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman have strongly condemned the recent remarks made by India’s Defence Minister regarding Pakistan’s Sindh province. CM Shah described the remarks as “a historically illiterate and diplomatically reckless statement”. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he wrote: “Sindh chose to separate from the Bombay Presidency in 1936, even before the Partition of Pakistan, because the people of Sindh sought autonomy, dignity and their own political identity. Sindh is an integral, inseparable part of Pakistan — yesterday, today, and forever.” CM Shah advised India’s defence minister to focus “on his own country’s internal divisions instead of daydreaming about ours”. Meanwhile, Ms Rehman said that India’s defence minister’s comments are “provocative, revisionist, and deeply irresponsible”, reflecting a dangerous pattern of rhetoric that undermines regional stability and violates internationally recognised norms governing state sovereignty. She noted that such statements were not just factually baseless but also expose an alarming escalation in expansionist Hindutva narrative within India that has no place in responsible statecraft. “The Indian Defence Minister’s remarks on Sindh are not only offensive, but expose an aversion or ignorance of history that borders on self-sabotage,” she said. It may be recalled that India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had in a recent speech said that although Sindh is not part of India today, borders can change in the future and Sindh may return to India.

      "summary_orig": "Twenty-two India-sponsored terrorists were killed in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday. A statement by the ISPR said that security forces conducted the IBO on Monday, based on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said. It added that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists in the area. The ISPR also said that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue with full pace to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation, saying that they were achieving “major successes” against terrorism under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam . “The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the war against terrorism,” the PM said. “We are determined to completely eradicate all kinds of terrorism from the country.” Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The latest in the string of terror incidents is a suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary’s (FC) headquarters in Peshawar yesterday morning, in which three FC men were martyred and 12 injured. The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage. The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered. According to the state-run APP , initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals.",

      "summary_orig": "Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, claimed on Tuesday that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country. In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. No official statement has been issued by Pakistan thus far. The strike was reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes. Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Ankara and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process. Last week, the Foreign Office (FO) said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: Frequent bombs and suicide attacks have compelled hospitals, especially the province’s biggest health facility Lady Reading Hospital, to upgrade mass emergency services. Given the vast experience of dealing with survivors of terror attacks, LRH recently organised training wherein healthcare professionals from Karachi, Lahore and other cities were imparted training in mass emergencies. LRH, the 1,800-bed oldest hospital of the province, has the first-ever emergency specialist due to which the level of mortalities from the terror strikes is very low. “During the last few years, we have handled 320 mass emergencies including suicide and bomb attacks. We treated affected persons with fractured bones, head and chest injuries and multiple wounds. The ratio of deaths remained extremely low because our staff has mastered the art of lifesaving procedures,” LRH spokesman Mohammad Asim told Dawn . According to him, more than 600 staffers, including doctors, nurses and paramedics have been deployed in addition to radiologists, pathologists and cardiologists and other consultants in accident and emergency department of the hospital to make it sure that people receive services during ‘golden hour’ –the critical 60-minute period after a traumatic injury when a patient’s chances of survival are the highest with prompt medical attention. Spokesperson says 10 injured were treated effectively at the hospital after attack on FC headquarters “So, our doctors are well-trained to make prompt decision in first hour about patients. LRH is the only hospital where basic life support and mass emergency preparedness, advanced cardiac life support and other trainings are happening on regular basis. Traditionally, our staff, even not on duty, rushes to the hospital to support lifesaving efforts,” said Mr Asim. He said that emergency department of the hospital had consultants round the clock. “Recently, we started collaboration with American Heart Association and partnership with ICRC for scaling up emergency response as a regular feature,” he added. He said that the hospital could manage 300 patients simultaneously. LRH is the first priority of patients as people are rushed to it not only from sites of terror attacks in Peshawar but from every nook and corner of the province. “On Monday, we received 10 wounded persons from the suicide attack at Federal Constabulary’s headquarters in Peshawar. They were treated effectively,” he said. Mr Asim said that more often people from manmade or natural disasters were brought to the hospital with multiple wounds. “They are given first aid in emergency and subsequently shifted to orthopaedic, neuro-surgery, general surgery and other wards for proper medication,” he said. He said that after every attack, most patients were sent home after their recovery with the advice for follow-ups while some remained for their surgeries and reconstruction procedures at general surgery and plastic surgery units of the hospital. “None of the injured persons are referred outside because the hospital has all specialties with more than two-decade experience,” he said. He also appreciated the people, who donated blood on every occasion due to which the hospital had enough stock that was transfused to patients. Mr Asim said that senior doctors in LRH were getting invitations from organisers of international seminars and symposiums where they shared their experiences regarding management of trauma patients. A doctor at the emergency department of the hospital said that first they carried out priority surgical procedures and stoppage of bleeding and later focused on other issues of blast victims. He said emergency department was headed by trauma specialist where all the facilities including operation theatres, blood bank, pharmacy, CT scan, ultrasound and X-ray machines and pathology were available under one roof and patients received implants, blood and surgical disposable free of cost. “The endless wave of terrorism in the province resulted in huge destruction and killing of security people but at the same time we have upgraded facilities and skills of health professionals to manage trauma incidents effectively,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "BACK in January, if a tarot card reader had predicted that it was going to be a fabulous year for the Pakistani government, she (or he) would not have been denied payment. But boy, would she have turned out to be right! May onwards, it seems as if the government — and others in the vicinity — can do no wrong. Islamabad (and Pindi) seemed to have been gifted with the Midas touch. Pushed into a conflict with India, it came out on top with an air combat that is being discussed around the world. The number of planes that Pakistan shot down is a topic no one can get enough of. But this wasn’t all. Even the communications battle was won hands down. And since then, there has been no looking back. This was followed with a romance with the US that no one had predicted. There was a one-on-one lunch at the White House and then a few months later a meeting at the Oval Office where both the field marshal and the prime minister were present. And before, during and after these meetings, the US president can’t stop praising the country and its military leadership. Some put it down to the decision to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel or give him credit for the cessation of hostilities in South Asia or lobbying. Regardless, it now appears to be a match made in heaven. Along with this came warmer relations with the Middle East and respect that perhaps had been missing in the past few years. Pakistan now has a seat at the table in the Middle East, whether on discussions on Gaza or in relations with Iran — and also thanks to the Saudi-Pak defence pact , which has ears wagging everywhere. If this weren’t enough, the government has been managing the IMF programme well enough so that no one fears any delays or any calls to ‘do more’ from the Fund. The missions visit Pakistan and leave without any major hiccups in terms of expectations or conditionalities, compared to the mess back in 2022 . Foreign policy miracles and numerous trips abroad still haven’t yielded the awaited manna. And now there are no local challenges either. Legislation has taken care of all else. In the rest of the world, they may have forcible conversions but in Islamabad, we have forcible consensus, which allowed for the 26th and 27th Amendments to the Constitution. ‘Pesky’ judges have been reined in and the entire judiciary defanged with the government in charge. If this weren’t enough, immunity was granted to the president and field marshal. The opposition is now in jail or disqualified. If someone still wants to be a troublemaker, Peca is there to the rescue. Even reporting or commenting on cricket can get one in trouble. Journalists have taken note. Is there anything left for Santa Claus to bring for the inhabitants of Constitution Avenue and Pindi? But for those gossiping in the drawing rooms in Islamabad, there is one question left unanswered. The great foreign policy miracle and the innumerable trips abroad still have not yielded the manna from the skies that is anxiously being awaited. For the well-heeled, foreign policy success is not entirely a success if it doesn’t bring foreign rents for the state and good times for the former. This also allows them to let the vulnerable breathe. So be it a lunch at the White House, or the defence pact with Saudi Arabia, or rumours about troops for Gaza, the relevant press release is scanned minutely for mention of aid, assistance or any such word that holds out the promise that the dollars-are-a-comin’. But so far, the press releases have let us all down. As a result, ministers wax lyrical about foreign policy successes and point at the plane flying over, carrying the PM or the FM or the DPM to the next trip but the ordinary citizens get easily distracted by the grocery bill or the latest message from FBR. The more generous and patriotic among the citizenry may even have felt happy that government officials could burn jet fuel for Pakistan’s success and worldwide fame, although the former could barely pay the monthly petrol bill. The rulers can make pit stops in London while the ruled cannot even fly from Karachi to Lahore. But it’s all about loving your country. For another, who woke up to the news of another attack in the nearby town, the debate over whether Pakistan shot down five planes or six by an American publication may also not bring much joy. The government ignores this just as some of us ignore the pressure of the ever-increasing waistline on the hapless button. Easy to do especially as the press/ media has also been reined in through hook and by crook and compelled to avoid the real stories out there. Be it the crisis in the agricultural sector, or the export and import of sugar or the whispers about corruption matters, few in the journalistic community are going to run with this. But a government of boomer uncles trying to adopt a Gen Z philosophy of ‘delulu is the solulu’ will eventually end up like Joe Biden . By the time it will fall apart, no one will be interested in their side of the story, while dumping all the blame on them. More importantly, like Biden, they also have a narrow window to take decisions. After that, it will be too late. And by this, I don’t mean they need to retire in time. But that if they don’t manage to improve the life quality of those paying the taxes and struggling with no purchasing power or get a handle on militancy, the photo ops abroad and foreign policy successes will be hard to wax lyrical about. Without improving the economy and addressing militancy, the successes in the air, the constitutional amendments and by-election wins will soon outlive their efficacy.

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA: The UN rights chief lamented on Monday the “meagre results” at the COP30 climate summit , warning that the “fatal inaction” of leaders might one day be considered a crime against humanity. Nations sealed a modest agreement at the UN climate summit in the Brazilian Amazon on Saturday as many countries swallowed weaker terms on a fossil fuel phaseout to preserve unity. The agreement calls on countries to voluntarily “accelerate” their climate action, but only with an implicit nod to phasing out fossil fuels. In an address to the UN’s business and human rights forum in Geneva, UN rights chief Volker Turk warned that the “meagre results of COP30 in Belem” illustrated how “corporate power imbalances … play out in the climate emergency”. “The fossil fuel industry is generating massive profits while devastating some of the poorest communities and countries in the world,” he said. “There needs to be proper accountability for this injustice, and for all other harms related to climate chaos.” Turk highlighted a recent ruling by the International Court of Justice determining that “governments need to prevent significant harm to our climate, including by regulating businesses”. And the Inter-American Court of Human Rights had also recognised the right to a stable climate and called on countries to “enforce corporate due diligence and provide remedies for climate related harm”, he said. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights told Monday’s gathering that he often wondered “how future generations will judge our leaders’ actions — and their fatal inaction — on the climate crisis in 50, 100 years from now”. “Could the inadequate response of today be considered ecocide or even a crime against humanity?” Published in Dawn, November 25th, 2025",

The move comes two weeks after Israeli military chief Eyal Zamir called for a “systemic investigation” into the failures that led to onslaught, even as the government dragged its feet on establishing a state commission of inquiry despite public pressure. The list of generals fired included three divisional commanders, one of whom was then serving as the military intelligence chief. A military statement released on Sunday said they bore personal responsibility for the armed forces’ failure to prevent the attack. The firing comes after all three had already resigned from their posts, including the former head of the southern command General Yaron Finkelman. Disciplinary actions were also announced against the heads of the navy and air force along with moves against four other generals and several senior officers. It remains to be seen how or if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might also be pinned with blame for having a role in the inability to prevent the Hamas onslaught. For the past two years, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the failures that lead to the October 7 attacks should be addressed after the war in Gaza ended. According to polls, a large number of Israelis across the political spectrum support the establishment of an inquiry to determine who is responsible for the authorities’ failure to prevent the attack. Netanyahu’s government has so far refused to form such a commission. Missile attack Meanwhile, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians in Gaza near the line demarcating areas of Israeli control on Monday, underlining the struggle to broaden a fragile ceasefire deal approved over six weeks ago to global acclaim. Palestinian medics said incidents involved an Israeli drone firing a missile at a group of people east of Khan Younis, killing two and wounding another, and a tank shell killing a person on the eastern side of Gaza City. Israel’s military said it had fired after identifying fighters crossing the so-called yellow line and approaching its troops, posing an immediate threat to them. Hamas and Israel signed a truce on October 9 halting two years of devastating warfare but the agreement left the most intractable disputes for further talks, freezing the conflict without resolving it. Both sides have since accused each other of deadly breaches of existing commitments in the agreement and of pushing back against later steps required by US 20-point peace plan for Gaza. Former British prime minister Tony Blair, who helped the US develop the plan and who Trump has said may join the board of peace, met the PA’s deputy leader Hussein al-Sheikh in the West Bank on Sunday. Sheikh said in a social media post they had discussed developments following the Security Council resolution and requirements for Palestinian self-determination. Meanwhile, a Hamas delegation in Cairo, led by its exiled chief Khalil al-Hayya, held talks with Egyptian officials on exploring the next phase of the ceasefire, according to Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza Separately, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday that at least 342 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli fire since the start of the truce.

The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage. The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered. Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad said three militants tried to attack the headquarters in the morning. The first blew himself up at the main gate, while two others managed to enter the premises. However, snipers and the armoured personnel carrier (APC) engaged the remaining bombers, restricting them to a parking lot reserved for motorbikes, he said, adding that the bombers sustained injuries in precise shots fired by the snipers and personnel from the APC. Initial investigations revealed that the bombers had been waiting to carry out the attack. They reached the area at 7:35am while they executed the attack at 7:50am, the official said, hinting at a possible security breach that was the focus of their investigation. “The bomber can be seen in the area at around 7:35am; the question is why did he take at least 25 minutes to carry out the attack despite the fact that he had passed the main gate twice — once while riding on a motorbike and then on foot,” a senior official said, fearing possible ‘facilitation’ from inside the headquarters. CCTV footage showed the first suicide bomber, clad in a chador, approaching the main gate and blowing himself up, clearing the path for his accomplices, who were waiting at a distance. These bombers had arrived on a motorbike and travelled towards the FC HQ via Charsadda Road. Their movement was also captured around the Nishtar Hall. During the investigation, it was revealed that they had been carrying backpacks, which suggested that they might have planned to take hostages once inside the premises. According to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan , initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals. It said that weapons and explosives were recovered from the deceased militants, adding that the specific identities of the Afghan terrorists were being ascertained. According to an APP report, investigations were underway to trace the facilitators behind the attempted attack, with intelligence agencies focusing on identifying possible support networks. The government is also expected to announce enhanced security measures for sensitive federal installations in the coming days, the agency said. Condemnations Soon after the attack, BRT services were suspended and the road was closed for all kinds of traffic, except for Rescue 1122 vehicles. An emergency was declared in all the hospitals as 11 injured persons were shifted to Lady Reading Hospital, while one was shifted to Khyber Teaching Hospital. During his visit to LRH, Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said that militants had always intended to disturb peace in the province and the country and that those who had resorted to such acts were the province’s and country’s enemies. He said that the provincial government would not let them do this. In a statement issued from his office, CM Afridi sought an immediate report from the KP police chief and directed that all available resources be utilised to bring the elements involved in this inhumane act to justice. Asked whether he had held any talks with security agencies regarding security issues, CM Afridi told reporters at LRH: “I have been briefed. The provincial government has ordered modern equipment for [police], but unfortunately, its delivery is taking time. Bullet cars are here, and we are working on capacity building of police.” Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the terrorist attack and lauded security forces for their “timely action,” as per a statement issued by the PM Office. “Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” he said, praying for the recovery of the injured. President Asif Ali Zardari, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti also condemned the attack, offering condolences to the families of the martyrs.

      "summary_orig": "United Nations experts on Monday sounded the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the Indian government, issuing the warning in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack. Pahalgam is the site where gunmen on April 22 killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists. New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation, triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict . In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown . The arrests were carried out across multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam. “We unequivocally condemn the brutal terrorist attack on a tourist area and extend our condolences to the victims, their families, and the Government of India. However, all governments must respect international human rights law while combating terrorism,” the experts said in a press release issued today on India’s response to the attack. They noted that Indian authorities launched sweeping operations across the territory in the attack’s wake, resulting in the arrest and detention of around 2,800 individuals, including journalists and human rights defenders. They pointed out that some were detained and charged under the Public Safety Act or the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which permitted prolonged detention without charge or trial and contained “vague and overbroad definitions of terrorism”. The experts noted that some detainees were allegedly tortured, held incommunicado, and denied access to lawyers and family members. “We condemn reports of arbitrary arrests and detentions, suspicious deaths in custody, torture and other ill-treatment, lynchings, and discriminatory treatment of Kashmiri and Muslim communities,” the experts said. They further highlighted reports of punitive house demolitions and forced evictions and arbitrary displacement, targeting families of individuals perceived as supporting freedom fighters, and carried out without court orders or due process. “Such actions constitute collective punishment and defy the 2024 ruling by India’s Supreme Court, which found that such demolitions are unconstitutional and violate the rights to life and human dignity, which includes the right to protection against arbitrary displacement,” the experts said. They also expressed concern at communication blackouts and restrictions on press freedom, saying that authorities reportedly suspended mobile internet services and blocked around 8,000 social media accounts, including those of journalists and independent media outlets. “These measures are disproportionate restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” the experts noted. They remarked that India’s response to the attacks was “also felt elsewhere in India”, with Kashmiri students subjected to surveillance and harassment, following government directives requiring universities to collect their personal data. “Hate speech and incitement to violence increased against Muslims, inflamed by political figures in the ruling party. Demolitions were reported in Gujarat and Assam, where thousands of Muslim homes, mosques, and businesses were destroyed.” “Nearly 1,900 Muslims and Rohingya refugees were also expelled to Bangladesh and Myanmar, often without due process,” the press release said. The experts stressed that such expulsions violated the international obligation of non-refoulement, which prohibited returning individuals to countries where they risked persecution, arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, or other serious harm. They further highlighted what they said was the “persistent nature of violations” in the territory with several human rights defenders, including Irfan Mehraj and Khurram Parvez , being arbitrarily detained for years under draconian security laws. “We urge the immediate unconditional release of all individuals arbitrarily detained in Jammu and Kashmir.” The experts also urged India to bring its counter-terrorism laws and practices “in line with international human rights obligations and independently investigate all alleged violations” and ensure accountability, including through prosecutions. “Excessive counter-terrorism measures not only violate human dignity, the Indian constitution and international law but counter-productively fuel social division and grievances that can spiral into further violence,” the experts warned. They lastly asked Pakistan and India to peacefully resolve the Kashmir dispute, which they said had “fuelled human rights violations and the destructive cycle of cross-border violence”.",

      "summary_orig": "A Pakistani diplomat in Afghanistan met a key Afghan governor amid tensions over rising terror incidents in Pakistan, saying efforts were underway to thaw bilateral ties, according to Afghan state media and Pakistani sources who spoke to Dawn . The meeting was held hours after three Federal Constabulary men were martyred in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area this morning. Security forces quickly neutralised the attackers. This was the first high-level contact in months between the Pakistani Consul General in Jalalabad, Shafqatullah Khan and Nangarhar Governor Mullah Muhammad Naeem Akhund. Akhund is an important Taliban leader and is considered a confidant of Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. Governor Akhund has previously served as deputy minister of Borders and Tribal Affairs and deputy minister of Civil Aviation during the Taliban’s first government from 1996-2001. He had played a key role in the Taliban’s military commission during the 20-year war against the US and its NATO allies and also led the Taliban’s military activities in southern Helmand province. He was a close confidante of the late Taliban’s chief, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, and is considered a close associate of Defense Minister Mullah Yaqoob Mujahid. “The Islamic Emirate has a constructive stance towards good relations, cooperation, and safeguarding common interests with the region, neighbouring countries, and other countries of the world, and relevant efforts in this regard are ongoing,” Afghanistan’s official Bakhtar news agency reported. Pakistan has long said that terrorist groups have used Afghan soil to plot and stage attacks across the border; a charge the Afghan Taliban deny . “The governor of Nangarhar noted the goodwill, brotherhood, and historical kinship of the Afghan people, and explained that the foundation of positive relations can remain strong in the presence of mutual respect, understanding and systematic coordination,” according to the report. No statement was issued by the Pakistani consulate about the meeting. The consulate and the Foreign Office spokesman did not reply to queries when approached for comments. However, sources with knowledge about the meeting said the Afghan governor told the diplomat that he has already “made efforts to reduce tension between the two countries”. The diplomat explained Pakistan’s position on the current security issues to Akhund, who is also keen to bring the relationship back on track. “The meeting discussed ethnicity, language, religion, culture, and other commonalities, and discussed the current situation in the region and the daily amenities of the people based on the tradition of good neighbourliness,” Bakhtar said. The meeting was attended by Nangarhar Deputy Governor Maulvi Azizullah Mustafa, Foreign Affairs Director Maulvi Jan Mohammad Inqelab, provincial spokesman Qari Ehsanullah Usmani and a number of other officials. Breakdown in Pak-Afghan ties Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.",

      "summary_orig": "The Saudi armed forces chief on Monday relayed the kingdom’s desire to elevate its defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights. Saudi Armed Forces Chief of General Staff General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili is currently on a visit to Pakistan and held meetings with senior officials. A statement from state broadcaster PTV News, on his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said: “General Al-Rowaili conveyed felicitations from the Saudi leadership to the prime minister and the people of Pakistan. He reaffirmed the kingdom’s strong desire to elevate the current excellent defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.” PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed his firm commitment to further strengthening the “historic fraternal relations” between the countries in all sectors, including economic, defence and security. “The prime minister welcomed General Al-Rowaili and commended Saudi Arabia for the unwavering support and solidarity it has always extended to Pakistan. He emphasised that the relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are based on shared faith, common values, and mutual trust. “The prime minister mentioned his highly successful visits to Riyadh over the past two months, during which historic Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement was signed between the two sides. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to further deepening bilateral defence cooperation, including joint training, exercises, and exchange of expertise.” PM Shehbaz also highlighted the joint resolve of both countries to combat all forms of terrorism and extremism and to promote peace and stability in the region. Earlier, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s military leadership discussed strengthening the “longstanding and strategic” cooperation between the two countries, focusing on defence, security and counterterrorism efforts, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. The discussion took place during a meeting between Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir and General Al Rowaili at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, according to the ISPR. “During the meeting, both leaders discussed matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening the longstanding and strategic military cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” the statement said. “They emphasised the importance of further enhancing defence collaboration, security cooperation, and counter-terrorism efforts, which continue to be pillars of the deep-rooted bilateral relationship,” it added. The visiting dignitary, according to ISPR’s statement, appreciated Pakistan’s cooperation in multiple fields with the Saudi armed forces and “reaffirmed his commitment to furthering the strong bonds of cooperation”. “Upon arrival at GHQ, General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and was presented a Guard of Honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army,” said the statement. General Al Rowaili later called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters. “During the meeting, both sides discussed evolving global and regional security environment. The dignitaries also explored concrete measures to deepen engagements between the armed forces of both countries and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen defence and security ties. “The CJCSC reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and ensuring the protection of Harmain al-Sharifain,” the ISPR said. In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. Earlier this month , CGS Lieutenant General Aamer Raza met General Rowaily in Riyadh to discuss broadening strategic ties and strengthening the mutual defence agreement signed by the two nations. The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies , with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz claimed on Monday that the PTI did not boycott yesterday’s by-elections but rather participated in all 13 constituencies up for grabs. By-elections were held on six National Assembly and seven Punjab Assembly seats on Sunday. The PML-N fielded its candidates on all seats except a provincial one in Muzaffargarh, and secured victory on all 12 of them. The PPP contested on three seats but could only win the Punjab Assembly seat from Muzaffargarh. The PTI failed to grab either of the Haripur or Lahore NA seats it campaigned for. “This was not even a boycott of the elections. What they are describing as a boycott, I have not seen such hypocrisy during my entire life,” CM Maryam said while addressing a meeting of provincial ministers today. “PTI candidates contested in all constituencies. They contested on ‘ qaidi No. 804’ (Imran) with photos of their leader. They set up polling camps, displayed pictures and campaigned while taking the [PTI’s] name. “And when they lost, they said ‘we boycotted’,” the chief minister said. The PML-N leader said the PTI employed a strategy where it would claim popular support “despite a boycott” if it won, but also attribute any loss to its boycott call. “This is a drama,” she quipped. During her address, Maryam repeatedly criticised the PTI’s “narrative” of a boycott, contending that politicians never opt out of democratic processes even if they have slim chances of emerging victorious. “[Lt] General Faiz Hameed went to jail, Umar Ata Bandial and Imran-daar judges went home, so they do not want to contest elections now,” she said, referring to the former intelligence chief and the ex-chief justice. The Punjab CM slammed the PTI for indulging in “politics of narrative”, saying that narratives had a shelf-life, which had now ended. The PML-N leader also recalled the July 2018 elections won by the PTI in the wake of the imprisonment of the top PML-N leadership, including her and her father Nawaz Sharif, who had been ousted as the prime minister the year prior. “Even us in 2018, when Nawaz Sharif sahib and I were in jail, I was perhaps the first Pakistani woman they jailed and did many injustices to,” Maryam claimed. “But we did not boycott the elections. We contested even in the worst circumstances,” she added, terming them the “most difficult elections” of the PML-N’s history. “I was alone here; Maryam Nawaz vs the entire power of the state,” she said, adding that the now-banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was “also created during that election”. “General Faiz’s entire power was with the PTI and Yasmin Rashid. It was the most difficult election in history [for us],” Maryam said. Addressing the PTI, the Punjab CM said, “When you break laws, when you take up militancy, you have no right to call yourself a political party.” “You conducted rigging, but were allowed to continue. You did manipulation and made people lose elections, but no one said anything. But the day you attacked your own country, your downfall started,” she said, referring to the May 9, 2023 riots . Maryam went on to assert that the “extra votes in all constituencies” were from people who switched support from PTI to PML-N. “The public accepted service, they stamped Nawaz’s ideology and buried the politics of lies, hypocrisy and conspiracy forever,” she added.",

During her address, Maryam repeatedly criticised the PTI’s “narrative” of a boycott, contending that politicians never opt out of democratic processes even if they have slim chances of emerging victorious. “[Lt] General Faiz Hameed went to jail, Umar Ata Bandial and Imran-daar judges went home, so they do not want to contest elections now,” she said, referring to the former intelligence chief and the ex-chief justice. The Punjab CM slammed the PTI for indulging in “politics of narrative”, saying that narratives had a shelf-life, which had now ended. The PML-N leader also recalled the July 2018 elections won by the PTI in the wake of the imprisonment of the top PML-N leadership, including her and her father Nawaz Sharif, who had been ousted as the prime minister the year prior. “Even us in 2018, when Nawaz Sharif sahib and I were in jail, I was perhaps the first Pakistani woman they jailed and did many injustices to,” Maryam claimed. “But we did not boycott the elections. We contested even in the worst circumstances,” she added, terming them the “most difficult elections” of the PML-N’s history. “I was alone here; Maryam Nawaz vs the entire power of the state,” she said, adding that the now-banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was “also created during that election”. “General Faiz’s entire power was with the PTI and Yasmin Rashid. It was the most difficult election in history [for us],” Maryam said. Addressing the PTI, the Punjab CM said, “When you break laws, when you take up militancy, you have no right to call yourself a political party.” “You conducted rigging, but were allowed to continue. You did manipulation and made people lose elections, but no one said anything. But the day you attacked your own country, your downfall started,” she said, referring to the May 9, 2023 riots . Maryam went on to assert that the “extra votes in all constituencies” were from people who switched support from PTI to PML-N. “The public accepted service, they stamped Nawaz’s ideology and buried the politics of lies, hypocrisy and conspiracy forever,” she added.",

      "summary": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz claimed on Monday that the PTI did not boycott yesterday’s by-elections but rather participated in all 13 constituencies up for grabs. By-elections were held on six National Assembly and seven Punjab Assembly seats on Sunday. The PML-N fielded its candidates on all seats except a provincial one in Muzaffargarh, and secured victory on all 12 of them. The PPP contested on three seats but could only win the Punjab Assembly seat from Muzaffargarh. The PTI failed to grab either of the Haripur or Lahore NA seats it campaigned for. “This was not even a boycott of the elections. What they are describing as a boycott, I have not seen such hypocrisy during my entire life,” CM Maryam said while addressing a meeting of provincial ministers today. “PTI candidates contested in all constituencies. They contested on ‘ qaidi No. 804’ (Imran) with photos of their leader. They set up polling camps, displayed pictures and campaigned while taking the [PTI’s] name. “And when they lost, they said ‘we boycotted’,” the chief minister said.
