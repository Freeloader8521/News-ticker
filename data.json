      "summary_orig": "Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar on Wednesday announced a “massive” operation against dacoits in the Katcha areas of the province. Speaking to reporters in Sukkur, Lanjar said a meeting was held wherein it was decided that “we are definitely heading towards a massive operation”. “We will use whatever resources we have, with specific targets and take ruthless action against the infamous dacoits that you see on social media,” he added. Asked when the operation against the riverine dacoits was expected to begin, the minister replied, “You may consider that the operation has begun from today”. Lanjar said dacoits would be “given a chance” to surrender before the courts. “But the absconders or criminals who consider themselves big champions, strict action will be taken against them, there will be a fight, and they will get their just deserts,” he warned. The Sindh home minister appreciated the Punjab government for its support in a recent “successful” operation wherein a no-go Katcha area was vacated. Responding to a question about whether the army’s help will be sought, Lanjar said, “The Sindh police is capable and the Rangers are with us in this, so I do not think we will need the army in our internal matters here.“ Although the Katcha areas extend to many districts of the central and southern Sindh, the districts such as Kashmore, Ghotki, Shikarpur and Jacobabad are particularly notorious for high prevalence of crimes like dacoity, kidnap for ransom and tribal conflicts. The minister further asserted that the required modern equipment will be provided to the personnel. When a reporter mentioned that the dacoits employed drones, Lanjar said, “I do not think drones have reached them. Action is definitely being taken against their facilitators, too.” On the possibility of a joint operation carried out by the Sindh and Punjab police, Lanjar said he has directed the Sindh inspector general to speak with his Punjab counterpart and the Bahawalpur regional police officer regarding the matter. “This will surely happen only after a joint effort,” he stressed, noting that the area of Machka extends into Punjab. “I have strong hopes that we will wipe out these dacoits,” Lanjar said. Asked about tribal disputes , the Sindh minister said this matter was also discussed in today’s meeting, and they had made the relevant contacts regarding the Jatoi-Mahar clash as well.

      "summary_orig": "At least four civilians were killed in Saudi-led coalition strikes in Yemen on Wednesday, two hospital sources told AFP , as the force raided the home province of a separatist leader. Yemen’s coalition attacked the home province of a UAE-backed separatist leader on Wednesday after he was kicked out of the presidency and accused of “high treason” for attempting to secede. More than 15 airstrikes hit Dhale, the home governorate of Aidaros Alzubidi, whose Southern Transitional Council (STC) grabbed swathes of territory last month before seeing the advance rolled back by the coalition and pro-Saudi forces. “The initial toll from the strikes on the province of al-Dhale is four civilian deaths and six wounded,” medical sources at the Al-Nasr and Al-Tadamon hospitals in al-Dhale told AFP . Alzubidi fled and mobilised “large forces” in Yemen’s southwest, around Aden, after failing to attend talks in Riyadh , the coalition said. Alzubidi “fled to an unknown location … after he had distributed weapons and ammunition to dozens of elements inside Aden”, coalition spokesperson Major General Turki al-Maliki said in a statement. The coalition carried out new strikes to prevent Alzubidi from “escalating the conflict” and extending it into Dhale governorate, he said. Alzubidi had been due to travel to the Saudi capital of Riyadh on Tuesday for talks aimed at easing the clashes. But his plane was delayed and he was not on board when it departed, the coalition said. A STC official told AFP that Alzubidi decided not to fly to Saudi Arabia after receiving information that he would be asked to dissolve the group, which forms part of the Presidential Leadership Council. The official said the delegation left for Riyadh without Alzubidi. A later statement from the STC said they had lost contact with the delegation that travelled to Riyadh for talks, and demanded Saudi authorities “guarantee the safety of its delegation currently in Riyadh”. STC spokesman Anwar Al-Tamimi told AFP that contact had been lost with the delegation that travelled to Riyadh during the night. In a statement, the Presidential Leadership Council, which holds executive power and groups rival factions, announced Alzubidi’s removal, accusing him of high treason. “It has been established that [Alzubidi] has abused the just cause of the South and exploited it to commit grave crimes against civilians in the southern governorates,” it said. More than 100 people have been killed in the airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition on the newly seized separatist positions in the southern governorates.",

Greenland’s prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, urged Trump to give up his “fantasies about annexation” of Greenland and accused the US of “completely and utterly unacceptable” rhetoric. “Enough is enough,” he said. The prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen previously warned that an attack by the US on a Nato ally would mean the “end” of the military alliance and “post-second world war security”. It would, she said, be the end of “everything”.

      "title": "Trump indicates that Venezuela is responding to demands for ‘total access’ for US oil companies – US politics live",
      "summary": "Statement on supposed agreement with Venezuelan government follows Trump’s threats of further military intervention Donald Trump has said Venezuela will be “turning over” $2bn worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States , a flagship negotiation that would divert supplies from China while helping Venezuela avoid deeper oil production cuts. Trump said in a post online : This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States! President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region. The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal. Trump’s administration is freezing more than $10bn in federal childcare and family assistance funds to California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York , the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said, citing what it called concerns about fraud and misuse.

      "title_orig": "PTI pushes back against criticism of party leadership, policies",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI has pushed back against criticism of its party leadership and policies, terming such remarks “regrettable”. In a statement posted on the social media platform X late on Tuesday, the party referred to the military spokesperson’s latest press conference . It said that it was “regrettable” that the party, its leadership and an elected provincial government were subjected to such criticism. The PTI maintained that consistent criticism “not only escalates political temperatures but also raises questions about the balance of the state apparatus”. The party said that terming opposition to a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it is in power, as support for terrorists was contrary to ground realities. It recalled that a peace jirga was organised by the provincial government on Nov 12, 2025, where participants “unanimously resolved that a military operation is not a sustainable solution to any problem, and a comprehensive, consensus-based, and inclusive national policy is indispensable for lasting peace”. It also took offence at the statement that terrorists do not target the PTI. “This is completely contrary to ground realities,” it said, adding that raising such questions would only add to the grief of the martyrs, the injured and the affected families. The party maintained that the impression the PTI was safe from terrorism reflected “a disregard for facts and is unfortunate”. The PTI noted that several state departments in the past had issued threat alerts for party founder Imran Khan and other leaders on multiple occasions. The party also objected to the “repeated targeting” of Imran, who it said was “not even allowed meetings and has not had an opportunity to respond to the allegations”. “Publicly criticising a political leader who is unjustly imprisoned, who cannot exercise his fundamental right to defend himself, and whose voice is being deliberately suppressed is not appropriate in any way,” the PTI said. It further stated that the images and speeches shown during the military spokesperson’s press briefing of “one province and one political party” were not “befitting of the country’s defence institution”. “The PTI wants to make it clear that we are against terrorism, believe in the supremacy of the Constitution and are willing to cooperate with all state institutions within the framework of the law,” the party said. It warned that “bringing political differences into press conferences will further stoke instability”. “There should be no politics on serious national issues such as terrorism,” the PTI asserted, stating that “staying united was essential, rather than dividing the nation on an issue like terrorism”. “History bears witness that despite internal political differences, the PTI has always chosen to stand with the state on matters of Pakistan’s security, sovereignty, and national interests,” it said, adding that there could be no compromise on national security. “Whenever the country has come face-to-face with external threats or security challenges, the PTI has played a responsible role on every platform and shown cooperation with the government,“ it said. KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’ in combating terrorism Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement posted on X, said that opposition to a potential military operation in the province was not limited to the PTI. He stressed that “all political and religious parties of KP, as well as individuals from different schools of thought, were in agreement that military operations are not a long-term solution”. “The issue is not merely that the state is not serious about combating terrorism; the problem also lies in decisions being made without taking into confidence the ground realities, elected representatives, local population, and the provincial government,“ he said. The KP CM said that the people in his province were “dealing with insecurity, economic stagnation, fears of displacement and had developed a distrust in state policies”. “Businesses, education, and daily routines are repeatedly disrupted, while the local population is not included in decision-making,” the KP CM said. He went on to say that despite “22 military operations and nearly 14,000 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted in KP, terrorism had not yet been eliminated”. CM Afridi said the situation indicated “serious flaws in policymaking and its implementation”. “In such a scenario, instead of insisting on ineffective policies from closed rooms, a clear policy shift has become inevitable, because the nation’s resources are being squandered endlessly on these failed strategies, and the protection of people’s lives and property remains continuously at risk,” he said. He questioned whether any “concrete guarantees” existed that would ensure that a military operation would result in long-term peace. “If past strategies, despite loss of life and the use of immense resources, failed to deliver the desired results, how are the people and their elected representatives being assured that the same approach will produce different outcomes this time?” CM Afridi asked. “Without transparency in policymaking, clear objectives, and measurable results, any new initiative risks adding to uncertainty rather than peace,” he added. He maintained that “a negative mindset from the representative of a state institution will damage national unity and also stoke instability”. “It is also a bitter reality that, despite repeated warnings, terrorism was allowed to re-enter KP, and its spread was fueled through self-serving narratives,“ he said. The KP CM said that the PTI had also “paid a toll in this war”. “Party officials, elected representatives, and ministers have been targeted by terrorists; some were martyred by bullets, while others were martyred in blasts,” he said. He stressed that instead of press conferences and unilateral decisions, implementation of the KP Assembly’s declaration following the national jirga should be allowed. “It is also essential that future decisions be made, not in closed rooms or based on the whims of individuals, but under policies formulated by all stakeholders and the elected representatives of the people,” Afridi added. The statements from the PTI and the KP chief minister come after Inter-Services Pub­lic Relations (ISPR) chief Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, in a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, accused the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 — ostensibly referring to the PTI — of “internally facilitating terrorists” and deciding to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan”.",

      "summary_en": "The PTI has pushed back against criticism of its party leadership and policies, terming such remarks “regrettable”. In a statement posted on the social media platform X late on Tuesday, the party referred to the military spokesperson’s latest press conference . It said that it was “regrettable” that the party, its leadership and an elected provincial government were subjected to such criticism. The PTI maintained that consistent criticism “not only escalates political temperatures but also raises questions about the balance of the state apparatus”. The party said that terming opposition to a military operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it is in power, as support for terrorists was contrary to ground realities. It recalled that a peace jirga was organised by the provincial government on Nov 12, 2025, where participants “unanimously resolved that a military operation is not a sustainable solution to any problem, and a comprehensive, consensus-based, and inclusive national policy is indispensable for lasting peace”. It also took offence at the statement that terrorists do not target the PTI. “This is completely contrary to ground realities,” it said, adding that raising such questions would only add to the grief of the martyrs, the injured and the affected families. The party maintained that the impression the PTI was safe from terrorism reflected “a disregard for facts and is unfortunate”. The PTI noted that several state departments in the past had issued threat alerts for party founder Imran Khan and other leaders on multiple occasions. The party also objected to the “repeated targeting” of Imran, who it said was “not even allowed meetings and has not had an opportunity to respond to the allegations”. “Publicly criticising a political leader who is unjustly imprisoned, who cannot exercise his fundamental right to defend himself, and whose voice is being deliberately suppressed is not appropriate in any way,” the PTI said. It further stated that the images and speeches shown during the military spokesperson’s press briefing of “one province and one political party” were not “befitting of the country’s defence institution”. “The PTI wants to make it clear that we are against terrorism, believe in the supremacy of the Constitution and are willing to cooperate with all state institutions within the framework of the law,” the party said. It warned that “bringing political differences into press conferences will further stoke instability”. “There should be no politics on serious national issues such as terrorism,” the PTI asserted, stating that “staying united was essential, rather than dividing the nation on an issue like terrorism”. “History bears witness that despite internal political differences, the PTI has always chosen to stand with the state on matters of Pakistan’s security, sovereignty, and national interests,” it said, adding that there could be no compromise on national security. “Whenever the country has come face-to-face with external threats or security challenges, the PTI has played a responsible role on every platform and shown cooperation with the government,“ it said. KP CM calls for ‘policy shift’ in combating terrorism Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement posted on X, said that opposition to a potential military operation in the province was not limited to the PTI. He stressed that “all political and religious parties of KP, as well as individuals from different schools of thought, were in agreement that military operations are not a long-term solution”. “The issue is not merely that the state is not serious about combating terrorism; the problem also lies in decisions being made without taking into confidence the ground realities, elected representatives, local population, and the provincial government,“ he said. The KP CM said that the people in his province were “dealing with insecurity, economic stagnation, fears of displacement and had developed a distrust in state policies”. “Businesses, education, and daily routines are repeatedly disrupted, while the local population is not included in decision-making,” the KP CM said. He went on to say that despite “22 military operations and nearly 14,000 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted in KP, terrorism had not yet been eliminated”. CM Afridi said the situation indicated “serious flaws in policymaking and its implementation”. “In such a scenario, instead of insisting on ineffective policies from closed rooms, a clear policy shift has become inevitable, because the nation’s resources are being squandered endlessly on these failed strategies, and the protection of people’s lives and property remains continuously at risk,” he said. He questioned whether any “concrete guarantees” existed that would ensure that a military operation would result in long-term peace. “If past strategies, despite loss of life and the use of immense resources, failed to deliver the desired results, how are the people and their elected representatives being assured that the same approach will produce different outcomes this time?” CM Afridi asked. “Without transparency in policymaking, clear objectives, and measurable results, any new initiative risks adding to uncertainty rather than peace,” he added. He maintained that “a negative mindset from the representative of a state institution will damage national unity and also stoke instability”. “It is also a bitter reality that, despite repeated warnings, terrorism was allowed to re-enter KP, and its spread was fueled through self-serving narratives,“ he said. The KP CM said that the PTI had also “paid a toll in this war”. “Party officials, elected representatives, and ministers have been targeted by terrorists; some were martyred by bullets, while others were martyred in blasts,” he said. He stressed that instead of press conferences and unilateral decisions, implementation of the KP Assembly’s declaration following the national jirga should be allowed. “It is also essential that future decisions be made, not in closed rooms or based on the whims of individuals, but under policies formulated by all stakeholders and the elected representatives of the people,” Afridi added.

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Venezuela’s interim government will deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States, and that the proceeds “will be controlled by me” as president. The development is a strong sign that the Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention. Trump has said he wants interim President Delcy Rodriguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry. Venezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump since mid-December. The blockade was part of rising US pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in US forces launching a “large-scale strike” in the country and kidnapping him this weekend. Top Venezuelan officials have accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves. Venezuela will be “turning over” between 30 and 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil” to the US, Trump said in a social media post. “This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” he added. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports. Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday. The Asian country has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020. “Trump wants this to happen early so he can say it is a big win,” an oil industry source said. Venezuelan government officials and Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the government and state oil company***,*** did not provide comment. Chevron in control of Venezuelan oil flows to US US crude prices fell more than 1.5 per cent after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US. That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron , PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation. Chevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade. It was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars. Venezuela has been selling its flagship crude grade, Merey, at around $22 per barrel below Brent for delivery at Venezuelan ports, giving a value for the deal at up to $1.9 billion. Rodriguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday, is herself under US sanctions imposed in 2018 for undermining democracy. Talks involve possible auctions with US buyers Venezuelan and US officials this week discussed possible sales mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested US buyers to bid for cargoes, and issuing US licences to PDVSA’s business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources told Reuters . Those licences have in the past allowed PDVSA’s joint venture partners and customers, including Chevron, India’s Reliance, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and European Eni and Repsol, to have access to Venezuelan oil to refine or to resell to third parties. This week, some of those companies have begun making preparations for receiving Venezuelan cargoes again, two separate sources said. The US and Venezuela have also discussed if Venezuelan oil can be used in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said. Trump did not refer to this possibility. Increased oil flows would be ‘great news’ US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that an increased flow of Venezuelan heavy oil to the US Gulf would be “great news” for job security, future gasoline prices in the US and for Venezuela. “Venezuela has an opportunity now to actually have capital come in and rebuild their economy and take advantage,” he told Fox News , when asked about talks between the governments on oil exports. “With American technology, American partnership, Venezuela can be transformed.” US refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela’s heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000bpd before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela. PDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. Without a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said. Oil traders reacted to news of the deal talks on Tuesday. Differentials for some heavy oil grades in the US Gulf slipped around 50 cents per barrel on Tuesday on the prospect of more Venezuelan supplies.",

Acting on intelligence gathered over several weeks, counter-terrorism officials intercepted a truck loaded with 2,000kg of explosive material, along with detonators, cylinders and other components. Three suspects are now in custody. Had the device reached its destination, the consequences could have been catastrophic. The details show that this was not a hasty or improvised plot. The suspects had rented a property on the outskirts of the city, kept their activities hidden, and transported explosive material over nearly 1,000km. According to investigators, the explosives were sourced from across the Afghan border, moved into Balochistan and then brought onwards to Karachi. The alleged involvement of the banned BLA shows how determined terrorist outfits remain and how they see urban centres as high-impact targets. Karachi was clearly chosen for its symbolic and practical value. As Pakistan’s economic and commercial centre, an attack here would have caused fear far beyond the blast site. It would have disrupted business activity, shaken investor confidence and deepened public anxiety at a time when the country can least afford further instability. Preventing the attack before the explosives could be deployed underlines the importance of intelligence-led operations that focus on stopping violence before it occurs. The case also reinforces the importance of coordination between security and intelligence bodies. According to the DG ISPR , the Karachi plot came to light because multiple agencies shared and combined information. This kind of cooperation is essential when terrorist networks operate quietly across regions and use long supply routes that are difficult to trace. The claim that explosive material was transported from across the Afghan border adds to long-standing concerns about terrorists exploiting external space to plan and supply attacks. While such assertions must always be examined carefully, this case shows why Pakistan should continue raising the issue diplomatically, while strengthening its own defences. At the same time, the incident exposes weaknesses. The alleged use of fertilisers and chemicals, and the ease of renting property without triggering suspicion, point to gaps in enforcement. Better control of explosive materials, stricter checks on rental housing, and closer monitoring of supply chains are basic but necessary steps. Preventing future plots will depend on staying alert, showing political resolve and enforcing the rules consistently, rather than celebrating isolated successes and moving on.

      "summary_orig": "The sisters of incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan and party supporters ended their sit-in near Adiala jail late on Tuesday after being given assurances of a meeting with the ex-premier being arranged next week. In a video posted by Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on the social media platform X, Imran’s sister Aleema said that Mahmood Khan Achakzai had informed them that a meeting would be arranged next week. Achakzai is the head of the TTAP opposition alliance and chairman of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party. “This is what he reassured us about, that a meeting will be arranged next week,” Aleema said, as she looked at Achakzai, who was standing next to her along with Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir. Achakzai and Nasir had arrived at the site of the protest earlier on Tuesday. “Achakzai sahib has said that because they are saying a meeting will be arranged next week, today we should disperse ourselves before the water cannons show up. That is his advice,” she said. Recently, protests staged by the PTI and Imran’s sisters have been dispersed by authorities with water cannons, which the party has alleged were filled with chemical-laced water. In another video, she said they were grateful for both Achakzai and Nasir, adding that their presence gave a lot of strength to the protesters. However, she warned that the protesters would not willingly disperse next week. “Next week, we will not move,” she said with a smile as people laughed around her. “If they do not allow a meeting, we will not move,” she asserted, calling on people to join their demonstration. She said that her sisters had first refused to end the sit-in. However, they had decided to do so in respect of Achakzai and Nasir. For his part, Achakzai said in a video posted by the PTI that the denial of a meeting with Imran was in contradiction of all international laws. He said that he had spoken to a station house officer (SHO) who had assured him that he would try to arrange a meeting. He further said that at least 10,000 people should gather at next Tuesday’s protest. “If people want that a meeting with Imran should be allowed, especially PTI protesters, if they want that his sisters are respected, [then] this is a test case for them. At least 10,000 people should be here next Tuesday,” he said. “If you don’t come, then forget about everything,” he said. On Tuesday, police had sprayed water at Factory Naka, where an anti-riot fence had been erected to prevent PTI leaders and supporters from moving forward. However, after waiting for the water to dry, the protesters had staged a sit-in at the site. The PTI leadership has provided a list of lawyers approved to meet Imran Khan in accordance with the Islamabad High Court’s order. The approved lawyers included Gohar Ali Khan, Salman Akram Raja, Ali Zaman, Waqas Raza Khan, Malik Faraz, and Sophia Noreen. A letter written by Salman Akram Raja was sent to the superintendent of Central Jail Adiala, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. It should be mentioned that Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said last month that meetings with Imran would remain suspended till Feb 8.",

      "summary_orig": "• The Hindu report says lobbying firm headed by former Trump aide Jason Miller led engagement with US officials on New Delhi’s behalf • Former diplomats say use of lobbyists is normal, but important meetings are usually set up directly by diplomats NEW DELHI: Although the government of Narendra Modi has persistently denied that the US played any role in mediating an end to the four-day India-Pakistan conflict following the Pahalgam incident, a report in The Hindu details how a lobbying firm engaged by New Delhi made hectic calls to approach US officials on May 10, and beyond. According to a filing with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) — including 60 entries made in December 2025 — did not divulge whether the calls on May 10 were made before or after the ceasefire, “they indicate close interaction on the day”, The Hindu wrote. It said the embassy approached White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Ricky Gill at the National Security Council to discuss “media coverage” of the conflict. This seems to contradict New Delhi’s stance, which has repeatedly denied several claims by US President Donald Trump, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s decision to award Mr Gill for the role he played in defusing the crisis. In particular, the External Affairs Ministry consistently denied Trump’s contention he had threatened to stop trade if the conflict was not ended, and the call made to Mr Greer to discuss Operation Sindoor is particularly significant, the paper said. The filings by US lobby firm SHW LLC raised eyebrows amongst diplomats in New Delhi as the firm also claimed that it set up meetings for several Indian officials — from External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, Deputy National Security Advisor Pavan Kapoor, and even Indian Ambassador Vinay Kwatra — with top Trump administration officials over the past year. SHW LLC was contracted by the Indian Embassy on April 24, 2025. Dawn had previously reported on May 2 that former Trump aide Jason Miller’s firm had been engaged by New Delhi as a registered foreign agent for $150,000 per month. It had no other clients over the year, according to the six FARA filings it made, and has been paid $900,000 in two quarterly instalments as part of an annual contract for $1.8 million. The practice is a first, say former and current Indian officials, and indicates that rather than normal bilateral channels, the engagements — broadly over India-US trade ties and Operation Sindoor — were set up by the firm, led by former Trump spokesperson Miller, who is listed as the principal of SHW LLC. While the embassy has always contracted two to three lobbyists at a time, to consult them on working with the Democrat and Republican parties, this is the first time a lobby firm has been asked to set up meetings with US officials, as also to schedule calls with government officials. “Such meetings are routinely sought by the mission directly,” at least two Indian government officials told The Hindu . “This seems to indicate that the Trump administration has set new rules of engagement and the government has been left with little choice but to play along,” a former diplomat, who had served at the Indian embassy previously, said. “The Indian Embassy has hired such firms, consistent with local practice and requirements, under successive governments since the 1950s,” a spokesperson for the Indian embassy in Washington said. About the lobbying firm, The Hindu quoted another official as saying that lobbyists are hired “for advice and to understand the landscape, giving advice, and opening some doors,” but that meetings and calls are made between diplomats directly. Apart from the calls on May 10, 2025, the firm billed the Embassy for making requests for the Parli­ame­ntary delegation led by Oppo­sition leader Shashi Tharoor to meet US Vice-President J.D. Vance and others. On June 23, 2025, days before Mr. Jaishankar’s visit to Washington to attend the Quad Foreign Ministers’ meeting, SHW says that it sent emails requesting meetings for the Minister with Mr. Vance, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and CIA chief John Ratcliffe. Of 60 entries detailing requests from the Indian Embassy, 30 reco­rded by SHW were requests for telephone calls to trade officials and White House senior officials to “discuss [the] status of US-India trade conversations”. The calls increased in frequency as relations nosedived over US decisions to impose 25pc reciprocal tariffs and another 25pc in penalty tariffs for India’s oil procurement. As tensions abated after Trump and Modi exchanged cordial words over social media, SHW said it made calls to White House officials to “flag social media post by Prime Minister Modi”. Trump subsequently called Modi for his birthday on September 17, 2025, and the two leaders have spoken several times since then. Published in Dawn, January 7th, 2026",

The Guardian’s legal correspondent, Haroon Siddique , has been in touch with him, and tells Nosheen Iqbal that he put some questions to Ahmed via an intermediary.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for more than 40 PTI leaders over their absence in the case concerning the May 9 protest outside the GHQ. The case was heard by Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Amjad Ali Shah. During the proceedings, defence lawyers sought the court’s permission to meet Mr Khan at Adiala Jail, stating that access was necessary to obtain instructions regarding the pending cases. Defence counsel told the court that they had alre­ady taken instructions from the PTI founder in connection with the cases, reiterating that effective legal represen­tation requi­red direct consultation with their client. Opposing the request, the special prosecutor submitted that Mr Khan was on bail in the May 9 GHQ attack case and was not in the custody of the ATC. He further informed the court that the PTI founder had since been convicted in ano­t­h­er case, adding that the defence could appro­ach the relevant forum if it had any grievance regarding access. The prosecutor mainta­ined that, as a convicted pri­s­oner, the PTI founder was in the custody of the jail sup­e­r­intendent and that, under the law, jail aut­hori­ties had the power to regulate meetings. He argued that the issue rai­s­ed by the defence did not fall within the jurisdiction of the ATC hearing the GHQ attack case. In response, the defence counsel adopted a firm position, stating that until they were granted access to the PTI founder, they would not be a part of the court proceedings. During the hearing, the court also took notice of the absence of several accused and issued non-bailable arrest warrants for 40 to 45 accused who failed to appear. Trial via video link The court provided defence lawyers with a copy of the Punjab government’s notification regarding the conduct of the trial through a video link. According to the notification issued on October 30 last year, proceedings in the May 9 GHQ attack case are to be conducted via video link. Later, the court adjourned the hearing until January 20. Separately, the hearing of the Judicial Complex attack case against the PTI founder and other accused in the Anti-Terrorism Court, Islamabad, was adjourned without proceedings due to the unavailability of Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra. The court fixed the next date of hearing for February 6. Similarly, the hearing of another case registered at the Secretariat Police Station was also adjourned without proceedings owing to the judge’s absence. As a result, statements of witnesses could not be recorded, and the next hearing was fixed for January 12. Published in Dawn, January 7th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Tuesday that Pakistan was “ready” to confront aggression simultaneously on its eastern and western borders — a reference to India and Afghanistan. Pakistan’s recent relations with both India and Afghanistan have been characterised by significant strain and tension. Pakistan fought a four-day war with India in May 2025 and had a border skirmish with the Afghan Taliban regime in October of the same year. “Absolutely, we are ready, by the grace of God,“ said Asif on Geo News programme Capital Talk when asked if the country was prepared and capable of handling a war of aggression on its eastern and western borders. Asif said the country and its armed forces had demonstrated proof of this preparedness during the May 2025 conflict with India. “The way we gave them a crushing response is the strongest evidence that we were prepared and responded in time,” said the defence minister. He maintained that the world witnessed how “Modi was thrashed” and how, following the conflict, he lost “all credibility both within his country and internationally”. The minister further said that following the befitting response by the Pakistan armed forces, India “approached the US” for a ceasefire. “You can determine from that how badly they were shattered — to the point that they had to call China.” Pakistan‘s response, which came during the early morning hours of May 10, saw large-scale attacks with guided weapons and drones on Indian military targets. Airbases along the border, posts on the Line of Control (LoC) and India’s S-400 surface to missile systems were hit among other targets. However, the defence minister expressed confidence that there would not be a full-scale war between the two nuclear powers when asked whether India could launch another attack, involve the Taliban, and then bring in US President Trump to enforce a ceasefire. He further said that the four-day war with India enhanced Pakistan’s prestige. “Our armed forces’ strength is recognised by the entire world,“ said the defence minister, adding that recent orders for fighter aircraft show ”that our jets have been [battle] tested“. The conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. During the conflict, the Pakistan Air Force shot down at least six India fighter aircraft. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire .",

      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Tuesday that Afghans were involved in major “high-impact” terror incidents in Pakistan in 2025. At the outset of the press conference, the military’s spokesperson said that the purpose of the briefing was to give a comprehensive overview of counter-terrorism measures taken in the past year. This “is the only purpose of this press conference, and I would request that we remain focused on counter-terrorism as terrorism is the biggest threat that is being faced by the state of Pakistan,” he added. The DG ISPR said 2025 was a “landmark and consequential year in our fight against terrorism”, adding there were four reasons behind this conclusion. He maintained that the fight against terrorism concerned the entire nation and had been ongoing for more than two decades. The DG ISPR further stated that the past year witnessed “unprecedented intensity in counter-terrorism efforts.” In 2025, he continued, the state of Pakistan, as well as the people, gained “complete clarity on terrorism”. “The state already had this clarity, which permeated slowly and gradually down[ward] that these terrorists are khawarij [and] they have no relation with Islam. They are Fitna-al-Hindustan and have no relation with Pakistan or [the people of] Balochistan,” he elaborated. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and it uses Fitna-al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Lieutenant General Chaudhry further highlighted that in 2025, the world acknowledged Pakistan’s stance and narrative regarding terrorism, particularly Afghanistan becoming a “base for terrorist operations”. Moreover, he added that the past year also demonstrated “how the National Action Plan (NAP) was reinvigorated and how it was being implemented”. In this connection, he also mentioned that the vision for Azm-i-Istehkam — a counter-terrorism operation launched by the military in 2024 — was drawn from the revised NAP, and that all political parties and segments of society had reached a consensus on the necessity of implementing the NAP to eliminate terrorism. He acknowledged, however, that “there are still deficiencies, and there is a lot of room for improvement” in the implementation of the NAP. After outlining these four factors as the reasons behind declaring 2025 a “landmark and consequential year” in counter-terrorism, the DG ISPR went on to discuss them in detail. .A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. 75,175 IBOs in 2025 Sharing data, the military spokesperson said law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in 2025. “Which comes down to 206 IBOs per day,” he said. Breaking it down, he noted that 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan last year, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas. Moreover, 2,597 terrorists were killed in Pakistan in 2025, the DG ISPR said. Among them, 1,800 were killed in KP, 784 in Balochistan, and 10 in other areas. In 2025, he continued, 1,235 law enforcement personnel and civilians were martyred in the fight against terrorism. Sharing data about suicide bombing incidents, he said a total of 27 had taken place in 2025. Of these, 16 occurred in KP, 10 in Balochistan, and one in Islamabad, at the judicial complex. “Out of them, two [involved] female suicide bombers.” In light of these facts and figures, he said, the question that came to mind was why the majority of terror incidents took place in KP. “The primary reason for this is the politically conducive environment provided [to terrorists], and the political-terror nexus that is flourishing in the province,” he said. The DG ISPR highlighted that data show terrorism began to rise in 2021. A total of 193 terrorists were killed that year compared to 592 law enforcement personnel who were martyred, a ratio of 1:3, he added. Moving to 2025, he pointed out that 2,597 terrorists were killed last year, while 1,235 law enforcement personnel were martyred. This translated to a ratio of 2:1, he added. “But more importantly, what happened in 2021 that caused terrorism to rise?” he questioned, and he elaborated on the reasons behind this development. The DG ISPR explained that there was a change in Afghanistan in 2021 following the Doha Agreement. “An armed group, the Afghan Taliban, sat down with the US and international partners and entered into an agreement. Under the agreement, they made three commitments — that they will form an inclusive government in Afghanistan, use of Afghan soil for terrorism will not be allowed and women will be given rights [in Afghanistan],” the DG ISPR recalled. But were the commitments fulfilled, the military spokesperson questioned. “They were not. Is there a government there? There is no government there. They [just] call themselves interim Afghan government […] Is there an inclusive government there? No, there is not.” “Has terrorism been eradicated [from Afghanistan]? Contrarily, Afghanistan has become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors. Terrorists of different creeds operate from there. So that is what started happening in 2021.” Naming various terror outfits that he said were operating from Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said Afghanistan had become a “centre point where terrorists of all kinds are being nurtured”. He said that around 2,500 terrorists, who were neither Afghans nor Pakistanis, had recently reached Afghanistan from Syria. The military spokesperson also said that the Afghan Taliban, “which is now the mother organisation,” had started organising the TTP according to its organisational structure. The DG ISPR added that they also trained and directed the terror outfit. Moreover, the Afghan Taliban built a “fake” narrative, boasting that they forced the US and international coalition forces to flee Afghanistan. “On the basis of that, they start further polluting the minds of youngsters, the youth and religious-minded people. They present themselves as the flag-bearers of Islam and increase their recruitment.” “But if you analyse the matter, you will realise that they did not make them [coalition forces and the US] flee. There were other reasons for it.” The DG ISPR also spoke about the war economy in this regard. He referred to a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which he said mentioned that around $144 billion was pumped into the reconstruction of Afghanistan. “When the [supply of] that money stopped, to continue running the war economy, they [Afghan Taliban] spread the war in the form of terrorism across the entire region. They find new patrons and financial sponsors, with the biggest patron for terrorism in Pakistan being India,” he said. The DG ISPR added that India was using the Afghan Taliban as proxies and providing them with financial and other assistance. “So the base of operations is being provided in Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and India’s money and patronage [is available].” The military spokesperson added that the Afghan Taliban were taking the assistance of sponsors from elsewhere too — wherever they were able to find them — to run the war economy. The military spokesperson elaborated that modern US equipment worth $7.2bn was left behind in Afghanistan. It included night-vision devices, high-powered sniper rifles, body armour and other personal protection equipment, M-4 and M-16 assault rifles — “the best of weapons and ammunition”. This equipment was “available to the Afghan Taliban, in the black market, to all these terrorist organisations”. Moreover, the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 began “internally facilitating terrorists” and decided to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan.” This was seemingly a reference to talks held between the then-Pakistan government and the TTP. The DG ISPR went on to say that “once you give them terrorists so much space and so much wherewithal, you see a rise in terror incidents.” By 2023, he added, that state began standing against them. Lieutenant General Chaudhry referred to a speech by the army chief following a blast in a mosque in Police Lines, Peshawar, in 2023, adding that on that occasion, the army chief gave clarity on terrorism. “Entire Pakistan has that clarity now.” Further elaborating on this “clarity,” he used strong language, saying that terrorists had no religious association; they had to be eliminated, and action had to be taken against them. “But it takes time. Because if you have to fight them, you have to equip yourself, train yourself, adopt the right technology, build the narrative, and take the nation along. “You saw this last year, which I said was a consequential and landmark year, when the tide started turning.” The military spokesperson acknowledged that questions were also raised about the large number of terror incidents: 5,397 in 2025. “Yes, this is a big number. Why? Because we are engaging them everywhere. We are conducting 75,000 IBOs, 206 per day, and we are taking them on.“ “By ‘we,’ I mean myself, you, and everyone in Pakistan. We have absolute clarity that we have to win this fight, not by appeasement, but by force and strength. There are a few things in life worth fighting for, where fighting is not only justified but necessary, and there is no alternative.” He said that when terrorism has reared its head in other countries, it has destroyed states. “But your state, your law enforcement agencies, and your army are fighting on a daily basis.” Terrorism surge after May conflict Referring to a chart, he said it could be deduced from the data that after Pakistan defeated India during a four-day conflict in May 2025, terrorism surged. After its defeat, “Indians immediately sought to influence non-state actors.” Afghanistan served as the base of operations for those incidents, he said, adding that Pakistan repeatedly urged Kabul to end cross-border terrorism. “And then we carried out strikes on terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border in October, not targeting the Afghan Taliban or their posts. And what did the Afghan Taliban regime do, which is acting as a proxy and a base of operations for Indians? They attacked Pakistani posts, coming in direct support of the terrorists.“ “So the state of Pakistan did what was necessary. Dozens of Afghan posts were obliterated within hours, and a hard message was sent.” The DG ISPR said that posts were obliterated not just at the border but also inside Afghanistan. He added that the border was closed after that, and terror incidents and the facilitation of terrorists declined. “The number of terrorists killed in the last three months after the border was closed in October rose to 276 per month. There are signs here for those who can understand.” He said parallels had been drawn between Pakistan‘s actions in October last year and India’s in May 2025. “Those drawing the parallel are trying to spin a narrative,” he said. He added, “In May 2025, India targeted Pakistani citizens; Pakistan, however, did not target Afghans in October.” “We targeted our own citizens who were present there and involved in terrorism in Pakistan. They have training centres there. “We knew TTP was present there. Did we target TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan)? No, we did not. “Only the state of Pakistan has the right to punish or reward its citizens in accordance with the law and Constitution of Pakistan. Who is India to cause harm to any Pakistani citizen?” He again asserted that in the October strikes, Pakistan’s military targeted the TTP. The DG ISPR said Pakistan had been pressing the Afghan Taliban for the constitution of a verifiable mechanism, adding that Pakistan had evidence of where and to whom the Afghan Taliban had been providing refuge. Stressing the difference between India‘s and Pakistan’s cross-border strikes, he said whoever tried to point out similarities between the two developments was lying. They were trying to deceive the people, spinning a misleading narrative, the DG ISPR said. Listing 10 “major” incidents of terrorism in Pakistan in 2025, he said: “And who are involved in all of these high-impact [terror incidents]? They are all Afghans.” The DG ISPR said all 78 terrorists involved in the 10 major incidents were killed. “None of them went back alive, and 60 civilians were martyred in those incidents. So the narrative they create that it is the military’s fight [is false]. This is the fight of the people. […] If we and you did not stand up against them, they would blow themselves up in your homes, markets, offices, schools, and streets until you adopt their perverted ideology.” After playing “confessional statements by some terrorists,” he said that 16 of the terrorists killed in 2025 could be clearly identified as high-value targets. They included Amjad Ali, who was the second-in-command in the shura of the TTP. He then asked his audience to rise from their seats, and those in uniform to salute, to pay tribute to the “martyrs,” including the people of Pakistan and personnel of the police, armed forces, and Federal Constabulary, who had lost their lives in terror incidents. Three main pillars of counter-terrorism Following that, the DG ISPR said there were three main pillars of the fight against terrorism. Essentially, it was intelligence-based, he said, but there were three main pillars of its final manifestation on the ground. The first among these pillars was the engagements on the Pak-Afghan border, the second was offensive actions by small teams, and the third was the technical surveillance and engagements, he explained. “These are the three pillars that are based on intelligence.” Speaking about technical surveillance and engagement, he said a narrative was created that Pakistan’s military was using drones. But in fact, it was the terrorists who began using those armed quadcopters, he said, adding that 405 quadcopter attacks by the terrorists were reported from KP alone during the year. “Their patron — India — provides them with funds, technical inventory and other assistance. So they have now started going into this armed quadcopter business. They also have a special wing for quadcopters in their organisations. “They also use mosques, public places and houses as human shields.” He explained that law enforcement bodies, including police and armed forces, were using drones only for technical surveillance. The military’s spokesperson mentioned that even the KP government had provided law enforcement bodies with quadcopters, as terrorists had been using them. He added that law enforcement did not use quadcopters in any built-up or populated area and ensured that there was no collateral damage. “It is important to brief you on this as a false narrative is being spun regarding this,” he remarked. “We use it with care, and your army does not cause any collateral damage. We hit only terrorists and their facilitators.” He said the army was not only engaged in kinetic action when it came to countering terrorism. It was also taking measures pertaining to “communication, engagement and social manoeuvre“, he said. “In our view, this is even more important than killing the terrorists,” he said as videos of the military’s engagement with the public played in the background. “And the narrative they create that there is a law and order situation, there is a gap between the public and the state — absolutely not. “I say with great pride that Pakistan’s people and the state are together.” He said the people of Pakistan now had clarity on what Fitna-al-Khawari j and Fitna-al-Hindustan were, on the India-Afghan Taliban terrorism nexus, on the other external sponsors of terrorism, on the international acknowledgement and acceptance of Pakistan’s stance on terrorism and on internal facilitators — most of whom were found in politics — of terrorism. A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. India-Afghan Taliban nexus Speaking about the India-Afghan Taliban nexus, he also played various clips of the Indian media as a portrayal of the “collusion”. In this connection, he also mentioned those who “promoted terrorism under the guise of human rights and democracy.” He specifically cited a professor from the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, who, the DG ISPR said, had confessed to involvement in terrorism. The military spokesperson said the professor was defended by people in Pakistan and abroad and showed social media posts by various users, including freelance journalist Kiyya Baloch, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Haazir. He then said that the Afghan Taliban was not a government but a group that had occupied Afghanistan, under whose patronage more than a dozen terrorist organisations had been operating. “Everyone knows this but the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government,” he said, following which a video of KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was played. In the video, Afridi was speaking in Pashto, and the DG ISPR quoted him as asking why other countries were not facing the issue of terrorism from Afghan soil. He then pointed out that other countries, too, were facing the issue, adding that a false narrative was being spun. The DG ISPR also rejected the impression that the fight against terrorism was being carried out in the pursuit of “dollars and minerals”. A clip of PTI leader Asad Qaiser was also played, who rejected military operations in KP. On this, the DG ISPR explained that the army was a federal force and worked under the instructions of the federal government. “We are constitutionally bound to ensure Pakistan’s territorial integrity and security. “No one can allow you to hand over your areas to terrorists for your politics and to facilitate whosoever.” Giving the example of ANP being targeted by terrorists after the party voiced opposition to terrorism, the DG ISPR, without naming the PTI, said: “They are saying that they are not ready to die. That they will not stand up. That they will join them (terrorists).“ Again without naming the PTI, he raised the question of why terrorists had not ever targeted the party. Then, showing a news report about “KP seeking Afghan help for negotiations”, the DG ISPR remarked: “What policy of appeasement is this in which you are begging Kabul?” “Their narrative also came out in the open in 2025.” Then, coming back to the revised NAP, he said the kinetic action detailed under it was already being taken by security forces. The rest of the provisions under the plan had to be fulfilled by society, political parties and provincial, federal and district governments, not the army. “On this, what we feel is that there is a reinvigoration under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.” He said a case study regarding this was about how the plan was being implemented in Balochistan. And “we should be very proud” of it, he added. “The credit must go to the chief minister and the government of Balochistan. What they have done is — and they will soon provide you with a comprehensive and final document — they have constituted district-level coordination committees, which include local MPAs, DC, DPO, and representatives of the army and intelligence [agencies]. “So the devolution sense in a real sense is reaching the districts of Balochistan through these district coordination committees.” The DG ISPR shared that 472 meetings had been held of these committees between February and November 2025, since their constitution. “Funds of Rs23bn by the Balochistan government and Rs8bn by the federal government have been made available to each committee at the district level,” he said, adding that locals were included in the committees and identified projects that needed to be executed. He said 127 projects have been completed, and 949 had been planned under this plan. Moreover, 54,000 social activities and engagements had been carried out under this plan, in which government and law enforcement functionaries, army representatives and political functionaries engage with the people. He said the Balochistan government was expeditiously working on this “NAP Balochistan”, further stating that the distinction between category-A and category-B areas in Balochistan had ended. “By law, the government of Balochistan has converted everything into Cat-A, which means that now there is a Balochistan police mandate all across Balochistan. “This will have far-reaching consequences. This is again part of efforts to combat terrorism at the ground level and terror-crime nexus at the grassroots level.” He said the Balochistan’s government had allocated Rs5bn separately for training the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department as part of this. The DG ISPR said the authorities had managed to curb the smuggling of Iranian oil in Balochistan in a bid to combat the political-terror-criminal nexus. He also highlighted that the high number of pending terrorism cases in courts in KP and the low conviction rate as other reasons behind the failure to eradicate terrorism from the province. Moreover, the military’s spokesperson said two more areas that were being addressed under the revised NAP were narcotics — as it was connected to terrorism — and illegal weapons. In both areas, he said the conviction rate was low. A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. “It is not the job of the army, but it has a direct bearing on our counter-terrorism efforts.” Afghan repatriation Gen Chaudhry said another important facet of the revised NAP was the repatriation of Afghans. He said Punjab had just one Afghan refugee camp that had been cleared and similarly, all 10 refugee camps in Balochistan had also been cleared. In contrast, of the 43 refugee camps in KP, just five had been cleared, he said. The DG ISPR said that of around 150,000 refugees repatriated from KP, 1.2 per cent had been “deported”. Deportation “means that an individual had been checked and found to be illegally [staying]. [Deportation] provides the impetus for others to leave willingly”. “In other provinces, the percentage of deportation is much higher. That means law enforcement agencies are not being given a freehand there (KP). […] The people and law enforcement bodies in KP want [repatriation of Afghans], but why are they not being utilised for this?” he said. The DG ISPR said a Pakistan Land Port Authority had been established, which would contribute to NAP’s reinvigoration. The body would facilitate coordination among agencies operating at land ports, he explained. He said the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre had also been established and termed it a “fusion of multiple agencies in one place”. He said a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi recently, for which the “fusion of intelligence” happened at NIFTAC and provincial centres associated with the body. He ended his briefing, asserting that the fight against terrorism would continue “with the singularity of purpose and singularity of narrative”. “Those in uniform and those not in uniform have to fight together and win this fight. And no power in the world can stop us from winning this fight.” ‘Afghan border closure more beneficial than a loss’ When a journalist asked whether Pakistan was ready for a full-fledged war after availing multiple other options in recent months but “getting nothing out of it,” the DG ISPR disputed the phrasing. He noted that the ratio of terrorists killed to people martyred was now 2:1, up from 1:3 in 2021, and that Pakistan’s stance was being acknowledged globally. “Pakistan was the first to say, two years ago, that attention needed to be paid to Afghanistan, where terrorists from across the world have gathered. Now, a United Nations report states that there are 20 regional terrorist organisations there.” Gen Chaudhry further said, “We will trace them and their facilitators. No one should have any doubt about Pakistan’s resolve—its public, its armed forces, and its political and military leadership.” Asked about the future of the Pak-Afghan border , the DG ISPR noted that the state’s top-most priority was the security and territorial integrity of Pakistan. He stressed that the border had been closed for a reason, which had also been communicated to Kabul. About Pakistani students in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said the state will do whatever is necessary for their protection. At another point, when asked about Afghanistan’s demand for a separate trade pact to reopen the border, the DG ISPR stated that the border closure only had “advantages” for Pakistan and no losses, as terrorism was permeating through it. Asked what the “long-term solution” for Afghanistan was, the DG ISPR said, “We will play all the cards, and we will engage with them where we have to in a hard manner. Where we have to engage them diplomatically, we will do that as well.” Asked if there was any hope of a change in Afghanistan’s attitude due to the recent joint statement by Pakistan and China , the DG ISPR said Islamabad and Beijing “see in the same way on regional terrorism“, and therefore cooperation in that domain is maintained. He said there was consensus in the entire region that Afghanistan had become the centre of terrorism. On whether a regime-change operation in Afghanistan, similar to the recent operation in Venezuela , would be in Pakistan’s favour, the DG ISPR said it was for Afghans to decide. “We have to take care of our country. That is enough for us.” On Pakistan’s future stance on such a development, Gen Chaudhry said the state would “curate its policy based on the circumstances at that time” and stressed that the foreign ministry takes the lead in such matters. Asked about who was supporting the IS-KP terrorists in Pakistan, as the group and the Afghan Taliban were enemies, the DG ISPR questioned who termed them as each other’s enemies. The DG ISPR asserted that terrorists have no ideology, whether it is the Daesh, Al Qaeda, TTP, FAK, FAH, or ETIM. “They have no nationality, humanity or ethnicity,” Gen Chaudhry said. “They all have one father — the Afghan Taliban. About them killing each other, you have been covering for a long time that one faction kills another.” “As far as Pakistan is concerned, there is no shade or colour of any sort of terrorist. We have no space or sympathy for any terrorist. I have already said that there is only one type of good terrorist: a dead terrorist,” the DG ISPR stated. He stressed that the nation has to fight the war of narratives, technology, and intelligence. He quipped that terrorists were “baffled” by Pakistan continuing to move forward despite various militant groups thrown in the mix, along with sectarian strife and internal political facilitators. Asked if Pakistan would inevitably carry out more strikes against the TTP in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR highlighted that in October 2025, Pakistan only carried out strikes “at the Pak-Afghan border area, on the terrorists that were infiltrating into Pakistan and those who were planning to go across into Pakistan and the places they were being organised”. He stressed that it was the TTP, who were Pakistani citizens, who were struck. Gen Chaudhry noted that it was the Afghan Taliban who struck the Pakistani posts then, which gave Pakistan the “ full right to respond ” as its territorial integrity was attacked. Questioned whether Pakistan had given the Afghan Taliban legitimacy by holding talks with them in Doha and Istanbul last year, the DG ISPR answered that they are the de facto rulers in Afghanistan. He pointed out that talks have been held during the entire period from 2021 to 2025, so there was “nothing new” about that now. “Who else will you speak with?” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that since 2021, high-level delegation visits have taken place, 225 border flag meetings have occurred, 836 protest letters have been written, and 13 demarches have been issued to the same Afghan Taliban. Issues in KP Asked whether there was any hope of the federal government taking action to remove the hindrances in KP, such as by imposing governor’s rule, the DG ISPR said these decisions were up to the political leadership to decide. “This is for them to decide. They have to see multiple things. A soldier thinks in black and white [but] a politician thinks in multiple shades.” “Our job is to separate the truth and the lies. We call a spade a spade,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that the current counter-terrorism narrative of declaring terrorists Khariji began in 2023. On whether the military was willing to hold talks with KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the DG ISPR said dialogue was for the government to have. Asked at another point what the solution to the lack of political will in KP was, the DG ISPR said politicians had to resolve those issues. “We are a democratic country. There is a parliamentary democratic system, which has the solution to this.” The military spokesman asserted, “Our job is to give the state and the public our perspective based on facts and cold logic. We have no emotions in this.” The military spokesperson termed the field marshal the “source of the clarity” of not holding any talks with the terrorists or giving them any space, and instead fighting them as per God’s directives. “The truth will come out if someone has personal vested interests and does not want to obtain that clarity.” On the KP government‘s decision to abolish the Action in Aid of Civil Power Ordinance and the army‘s plan of action for military operations, the DG ISPR said under Article 245, the armed forces were to defend Pakistan as per the federal government’s directives. “The validity of any direction issued by the federal government under Clause 1 shall not be called in question in any court,” he quoted Article 245 as saying. On how the military would launch any operation or conduct IBOs in KP when there was a difference of opinion with its provincial leadership, the military spokesperson pointed out that “operations” were continuing despite the KP CM saying they would not allow kinetic actions. “Those who say we will not allow [operations], are their personalities or statements above Pakistan’s sovereignty?” he asked rhetorically. “This is a war of our sovereignty. This is Pakistan’s war. No personality or politics is above Pakistan,” he asserted. ‘Cannot blame institution for certain persons’ acts’ Responding to a query about the military leadership’s involvement in the 2021 “rehabilitation” policy and their accountability, and whether calling out only the political leadership would be “selective justice”, the DG ISPR rebutted that the military leadership had input in the decision. “We have a political narrative imposed on us wherein powers are taken in full but not the responsibility. The method to it is saying ‘we were powerless’. The government has the authority,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that both the current government and its predecessor had authority. The military spokesman further said that some institutions were “not as empowered as they should be because of the politicisation that has crept into them over time”. “We repeatedly say not to impose any politics on us […] All political parties, political leaders and political ideologies, ethnicities, communities, religions, sects are equal for us as long as they are Pakistani.” The DG ISPR, without taking names, alluded to Imran Khan and said he was “running his party like a dictator” and added that he was insistent on holding talks with the Afghan regime. He quipped that he [Imran] was so empowered that he had even declared the then-army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa as “father of the nation”, a title that is reserved for Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Gen Chaudhry added that then-intelligence chief — referring to Faiz Hameed — was “used for politics”. “You cannot put this [blame] on the institution; it was a field of characters.”",

      "title_en": "DG ISPR says Afghans involved in major terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2025",
      "summary_en": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Tuesday that Afghans were involved in major “high-impact” terror incidents in Pakistan in 2025. At the outset of the press conference, the military’s spokesperson said that the purpose of the briefing was to give a comprehensive overview of counter-terrorism measures taken in the past year. This “is the only purpose of this press conference, and I would request that we remain focused on counter-terrorism as terrorism is the biggest threat that is being faced by the state of Pakistan,” he added. The DG ISPR said 2025 was a “landmark and consequential year in our fight against terrorism”, adding there were four reasons behind this conclusion. He maintained that the fight against terrorism concerned the entire nation and had been ongoing for more than two decades. The DG ISPR further stated that the past year witnessed “unprecedented intensity in counter-terrorism efforts.” In 2025, he continued, the state of Pakistan, as well as the people, gained “complete clarity on terrorism”. “The state already had this clarity, which permeated slowly and gradually down[ward] that these terrorists are khawarij [and] they have no relation with Islam. They are Fitna-al-Hindustan and have no relation with Pakistan or [the people of] Balochistan,” he elaborated. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and it uses Fitna-al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Lieutenant General Chaudhry further highlighted that in 2025, the world acknowledged Pakistan’s stance and narrative regarding terrorism, particularly Afghanistan becoming a “base for terrorist operations”. Moreover, he added that the past year also demonstrated “how the National Action Plan (NAP) was reinvigorated and how it was being implemented”. In this connection, he also mentioned that the vision for Azm-i-Istehkam — a counter-terrorism operation launched by the military in 2024 — was drawn from the revised NAP, and that all political parties and segments of society had reached a consensus on the necessity of implementing the NAP to eliminate terrorism. He acknowledged, however, that “there are still deficiencies, and there is a lot of room for improvement” in the implementation of the NAP. After outlining these four factors as the reasons behind declaring 2025 a “landmark and consequential year” in counter-terrorism, the DG ISPR went on to discuss them in detail. .A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. 75,175 IBOs in 2025 Sharing data, the military spokesperson said law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in 2025. “Which comes down to 206 IBOs per day,” he said. Breaking it down, he noted that 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan last year, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas. Moreover, 2,597 terrorists were killed in Pakistan in 2025, the DG ISPR said. Among them, 1,800 were killed in KP, 784 in Balochistan, and 10 in other areas. In 2025, he continued, 1,235 law enforcement personnel and civilians were martyred in the fight against terrorism. Sharing data about suicide bombing incidents, he said a total of 27 had taken place in 2025. Of these, 16 occurred in KP, 10 in Balochistan, and one in Islamabad, at the judicial complex. “Out of them, two [involved] female suicide bombers.” In light of these facts and figures, he said, the question that came to mind was why the majority of terror incidents took place in KP. “The primary reason for this is the politically conducive environment provided [to terrorists], and the political-terror nexus that is flourishing in the province,” he said. The DG ISPR highlighted that data show terrorism began to rise in 2021. A total of 193 terrorists were killed that year compared to 592 law enforcement personnel who were martyred, a ratio of 1:3, he added. Moving to 2025, he pointed out that 2,597 terrorists were killed last year, while 1,235 law enforcement personnel were martyred. This translated to a ratio of 2:1, he added. “But more importantly, what happened in 2021 that caused terrorism to rise?” he questioned, and he elaborated on the reasons behind this development. The DG ISPR explained that there was a change in Afghanistan in 2021 following the Doha Agreement. “An armed group, the Afghan Taliban, sat down with the US and international partners and entered into an agreement. Under the agreement, they made three commitments — that they will form an inclusive government in Afghanistan, use of Afghan soil for terrorism will not be allowed and women will be given rights [in Afghanistan],” the DG ISPR recalled. But were the commitments fulfilled, the military spokesperson questioned. “They were not. Is there a government there? There is no government there. They [just] call themselves interim Afghan government […] Is there an inclusive government there? No, there is not.” “Has terrorism been eradicated [from Afghanistan]? Contrarily, Afghanistan has become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors. Terrorists of different creeds operate from there. So that is what started happening in 2021.” Naming various terror outfits that he said were operating from Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said Afghanistan had become a “centre point where terrorists of all kinds are being nurtured”. He said that around 2,500 terrorists, who were neither Afghans nor Pakistanis, had recently reached Afghanistan from Syria. The military spokesperson also said that the Afghan Taliban, “which is now the mother organisation,” had started organising the TTP according to its organisational structure. The DG ISPR added that they also trained and directed the terror outfit. Moreover, the Afghan Taliban built a “fake” narrative, boasting that they forced the US and international coalition forces to flee Afghanistan. “On the basis of that, they start further polluting the minds of youngsters, the youth and religious-minded people. They present themselves as the flag-bearers of Islam and increase their recruitment.” “But if you analyse the matter, you will realise that they did not make them [coalition forces and the US] flee. There were other reasons for it.” The DG ISPR also spoke about the war economy in this regard. He referred to a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which he said mentioned that around $144 billion was pumped into the reconstruction of Afghanistan. “When the [supply of] that money stopped, to continue running the war economy, they [Afghan Taliban] spread the war in the form of terrorism across the entire region. They find new patrons and financial sponsors, with the biggest patron for terrorism in Pakistan being India,” he said. The DG ISPR added that India was using the Afghan Taliban as proxies and providing them with financial and other assistance. “So the base of operations is being provided in Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and India’s money and patronage [is available].” The military spokesperson added that the Afghan Taliban were taking the assistance of sponsors from elsewhere too — wherever they were able to find them — to run the war economy. The military spokesperson elaborated that modern US equipment worth $7.2bn was left behind in Afghanistan. It included night-vision devices, high-powered sniper rifles, body armour and other personal protection equipment, M-4 and M-16 assault rifles — “the best of weapons and ammunition”. This equipment was “available to the Afghan Taliban, in the black market, to all these terrorist organisations”. Moreover, the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 began “internally facilitating terrorists” and decided to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan.” This was seemingly a reference to talks held between the then-Pakistan government and the TTP. The DG ISPR went on to say that “once you give them terrorists so much space and so much wherewithal, you see a rise in terror incidents.” By 2023, he added, that state began standing against them. Lieutenant General Chaudhry referred to a speech by the army chief following a blast in a mosque in Police Lines, Peshawar, in 2023, adding that on that occasion, the army chief gave clarity on terrorism. “Entire Pakistan has that clarity now.” Further elaborating on this “clarity,” he used strong language, saying that terrorists had no religious association; they had to be eliminated, and action had to be taken against them. “But it takes time. Because if you have to fight them, you have to equip yourself, train yourself, adopt the right technology, build the narrative, and take the nation along. “You saw this last year, which I said was a consequential and landmark year, when the tide started turning.” The military spokesperson acknowledged that questions were also raised about the large number of terror incidents: 5,397 in 2025. “Yes, this is a big number. Why? Because we are engaging them everywhere. We are conducting 75,000 IBOs, 206 per day, and we are taking them on.“ “By ‘we,’ I mean myself, you, and everyone in Pakistan. We have absolute clarity that we have to win this fight, not by appeasement, but by force and strength. There are a few things in life worth fighting for, where fighting is not only justified but necessary, and there is no alternative.” He said that when terrorism has reared its head in other countries, it has destroyed states. “But your state, your law enforcement agencies, and your army are fighting on a daily basis.” Terrorism surge after May conflict Referring to a chart, he said it could be deduced from the data that after Pakistan defeated India during a four-day conflict in May 2025, terrorism surged. After its defeat, “Indians immediately sought to influence non-state actors.” Afghanistan served as the base of operations for those incidents, he said, adding that Pakistan repeatedly urged Kabul to end cross-border terrorism. “And then we carried out strikes on terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border in October, not targeting the Afghan Taliban or their posts. And what did the Afghan Taliban regime do, which is acting as a proxy and a base of operations for Indians? They attacked Pakistani posts, coming in direct support of the terrorists.“ “So the state of Pakistan did what was necessary. Dozens of Afghan posts were obliterated within hours, and a hard message was sent.” The DG ISPR said that posts were obliterated not just at the border but also inside Afghanistan. He added that the border was closed after that, and terror incidents and the facilitation of terrorists declined. “The number of terrorists killed in the last three months after the border was closed in October rose to 276 per month. There are signs here for those who can understand.” He said parallels had been drawn between Pakistan‘s actions in October last year and India’s in May 2025. “Those drawing the parallel are trying to spin a narrative,” he said. He added, “In May 2025, India targeted Pakistani citizens; Pakistan, however, did not target Afghans in October.” “We targeted our own citizens who were present there and involved in terrorism in Pakistan. They have training centres there. “We knew TTP was present there. Did we target TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan)? No, we did not. “Only the state of Pakistan has the right to punish or reward its citizens in accordance with the law and Constitution of Pakistan. Who is India to cause harm to any Pakistani citizen?” He again asserted that in the October strikes, Pakistan’s military targeted the TTP. The DG ISPR said Pakistan had been pressing the Afghan Taliban for the constitution of a verifiable mechanism, adding that Pakistan had evidence of where and to whom the Afghan Taliban had been providing refuge. Stressing the difference between India‘s and Pakistan’s cross-border strikes, he said whoever tried to point out similarities between the two developments was lying. They were trying to deceive the people, spinning a misleading narrative, the DG ISPR said. Listing 10 “major” incidents of terrorism in Pakistan in 2025, he said: “And who are involved in all of these high-impact [terror incidents]? They are all Afghans.” The DG ISPR said all 78 terrorists involved in the 10 major incidents were killed. “None of them went back alive, and 60 civilians were martyred in those incidents. So the narrative they create that it is the military’s fight [is false]. This is the fight of the people. […] If we and you did not stand up against them, they would blow themselves up in your homes, markets, offices, schools, and streets until you adopt their perverted ideology.” After playing “confessional statements by some terrorists,” he said that 16 of the terrorists killed in 2025 could be clearly identified as high-value targets. They included Amjad Ali, who was the second-in-command in the shura of the TTP. He then asked his audience to rise from their seats, and those in uniform to salute, to pay tribute to the “martyrs,” including the people of Pakistan and personnel of the police, armed forces, and Federal Constabulary, who had lost their lives in terror incidents. Three main pillars of counter-terrorism Following that, the DG ISPR said there were three main pillars of the fight against terrorism. Essentially, it was intelligence-based, he said, but there were three main pillars of its final manifestation on the ground. The first among these pillars was the engagements on the Pak-Afghan border, the second was offensive actions by small teams, and the third was the technical surveillance and engagements, he explained. “These are the three pillars that are based on intelligence.” Speaking about technical surveillance and engagement, he said a narrative was created that Pakistan’s military was using drones. But in fact, it was the terrorists who began using those armed quadcopters, he said, adding that 405 quadcopter attacks by the terrorists were reported from KP alone during the year. “Their patron — India — provides them with funds, technical inventory and other assistance. So they have now started going into this armed quadcopter business. They also have a special wing for quadcopters in their organisations. “They also use mosques, public places and houses as human shields.” He explained that law enforcement bodies, including police and armed forces, were using drones only for technical surveillance. The military’s spokesperson mentioned that even the KP government had provided law enforcement bodies with quadcopters, as terrorists had been using them. He added that law enforcement did not use quadcopters in any built-up or populated area and ensured that there was no collateral damage. “It is important to brief you on this as a false narrative is being spun regarding this,” he remarked. “We use it with care, and your army does not cause any collateral damage. We hit only terrorists and their facilitators.” He said the army was not only engaged in kinetic action when it came to countering terrorism. It was also taking measures pertaining to “communication, engagement and social manoeuvre“, he said. “In our view, this is even more important than killing the terrorists,” he said as videos of the military’s engagement with the public played in the background. “And the narrative they create that there is a law and order situation, there is a gap between the public and the state — absolutely not. “I say with great pride that Pakistan’s people and the state are together.” He said the people of Pakistan now had clarity on what Fitna-al-Khawari j and Fitna-al-Hindustan were, on the India-Afghan Taliban terrorism nexus, on the other external sponsors of terrorism, on the international acknowledgement and acceptance of Pakistan’s stance on terrorism and on internal facilitators — most of whom were found in politics — of terrorism. A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. India-Afghan Taliban nexus Speaking about the India-Afghan Taliban nexus, he also played various clips of the Indian media as a portrayal of the “collusion”. In this connection, he also mentioned those who “promoted terrorism under the guise of human rights and democracy.” He specifically cited a professor from the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, who, the DG ISPR said, had confessed to involvement in terrorism. The military spokesperson said the professor was defended by people in Pakistan and abroad and showed social media posts by various users, including freelance journalist Kiyya Baloch, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Haazir. He then said that the Afghan Taliban was not a government but a group that had occupied Afghanistan, under whose patronage more than a dozen terrorist organisations had been operating. “Everyone knows this but the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government,” he said, following which a video of KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was played. In the video, Afridi was speaking in Pashto, and the DG ISPR quoted him as asking why other countries were not facing the issue of terrorism from Afghan soil. He then pointed out that other countries, too, were facing the issue, adding that a false narrative was being spun. The DG ISPR also rejected the impression that the fight against terrorism was being carried out in the pursuit of “dollars and minerals”. A clip of PTI leader Asad Qaiser was also played, who rejected military operations in KP. On this, the DG ISPR explained that the army was a federal force and worked under the instructions of the federal government. “We are constitutionally bound to ensure Pakistan’s territorial integrity and security. “No one can allow you to hand over your areas to terrorists for your politics and to facilitate whosoever.” Giving the example of ANP being targeted by terrorists after the party voiced opposition to terrorism, the DG ISPR, without naming the PTI, said: “They are saying that they are not ready to die. That they will not stand up. That they will join them (terrorists).“ Again without naming the PTI, he raised the question of why terrorists had not ever targeted the party. Then, showing a news report about “KP seeking Afghan help for negotiations”, the DG ISPR remarked: “What policy of appeasement is this in which you are begging Kabul?” “Their narrative also came out in the open in 2025.” Then, coming back to the revised NAP, he said the kinetic action detailed under it was already being taken by security forces. The rest of the provisions under the plan had to be fulfilled by society, political parties and provincial, federal and district governments, not the army. “On this, what we feel is that there is a reinvigoration under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.” He said a case study regarding this was about how the plan was being implemented in Balochistan. And “we should be very proud” of it, he added. “The credit must go to the chief minister and the government of Balochistan. What they have done is — and they will soon provide you with a comprehensive and final document — they have constituted district-level coordination committees, which include local MPAs, DC, DPO, and representatives of the army and intelligence [agencies]. “So the devolution sense in a real sense is reaching the districts of Balochistan through these district coordination committees.” The DG ISPR shared that 472 meetings had been held of these committees between February and November 2025, since their constitution. “Funds of Rs23bn by the Balochistan government and Rs8bn by the federal government have been made available to each committee at the district level,” he said, adding that locals were included in the committees and identified projects that needed to be executed. He said 127 projects have been completed, and 949 had been planned under this plan. Moreover, 54,000 social activities and engagements had been carried out under this plan, in which government and law enforcement functionaries, army representatives and political functionaries engage with the people. He said the Balochistan government was expeditiously working on this “NAP Balochistan”, further stating that the distinction between category-A and category-B areas in Balochistan had ended. “By law, the government of Balochistan has converted everything into Cat-A, which means that now there is a Balochistan police mandate all across Balochistan. “This will have far-reaching consequences. This is again part of efforts to combat terrorism at the ground level and terror-crime nexus at the grassroots level.” He said the Balochistan’s government had allocated Rs5bn separately for training the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department as part of this. The DG ISPR said the authorities had managed to curb the smuggling of Iranian oil in Balochistan in a bid to combat the political-terror-criminal nexus. He also highlighted that the high number of pending terrorism cases in courts in KP and the low conviction rate as other reasons behind the failure to eradicate terrorism from the province. Moreover, the military’s spokesperson said two more areas that were being addressed under the revised NAP were narcotics — as it was connected to terrorism — and illegal weapons. In both areas, he said the conviction rate was low. A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. “It is not the job of the army, but it has a direct bearing on our counter-terrorism efforts.” Afghan repatriation Gen Chaudhry said another important facet of the revised NAP was the repatriation of Afghans. He said Punjab had just one Afghan refugee camp that had been cleared and similarly, all 10 refugee camps in Balochistan had also been cleared. In contrast, of the 43 refugee camps in KP, just five had been cleared, he said. The DG ISPR said that of around 150,000 refugees repatriated from KP, 1.2 per cent had been “deported”. Deportation “means that an individual had been checked and found to be illegally [staying]. [Deportation] provides the impetus for others to leave willingly”. “In other provinces, the percentage of deportation is much higher. That means law enforcement agencies are not being given a freehand there (KP). […] The people and law enforcement bodies in KP want [repatriation of Afghans], but why are they not being utilised for this?” he said. The DG ISPR said a Pakistan Land Port Authority had been established, which would contribute to NAP’s reinvigoration. The body would facilitate coordination among agencies operating at land ports, he explained. He said the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre had also been established and termed it a “fusion of multiple agencies in one place”. He said a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi recently, for which the “fusion of intelligence” happened at NIFTAC and provincial centres associated with the body. He ended his briefing, asserting that the fight against terrorism would continue “with the singularity of purpose and singularity of narrative”. “Those in uniform and those not in uniform have to fight together and win this fight. And no power in the world can stop us from winning this fight.” ‘Afghan border closure more beneficial than a loss’ When a journalist asked whether Pakistan was ready for a full-fledged war after availing multiple other options in recent months but “getting nothing out of it,” the DG ISPR disputed the phrasing. He noted that the ratio of terrorists killed to people martyred was now 2:1, up from 1:3 in 2021, and that Pakistan’s stance was being acknowledged globally. “Pakistan was the first to say, two years ago, that attention needed to be paid to Afghanistan, where terrorists from across the world have gathered. Now, a United Nations report states that there are 20 regional terrorist organisations there.” Gen Chaudhry further said, “We will trace them and their facilitators. No one should have any doubt about Pakistan’s resolve—its public, its armed forces, and its political and military leadership.” Asked about the future of the Pak-Afghan border , the DG ISPR noted that the state’s top-most priority was the security and territorial integrity of Pakistan. He stressed that the border had been closed for a reason, which had also been communicated to Kabul. About Pakistani students in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said the state will do whatever is necessary for their protection. At another point, when asked about Afghanistan’s demand for a separate trade pact to reopen the border, the DG ISPR stated that the border closure only had “advantages” for Pakistan and no losses, as terrorism was permeating through it. Asked what the “long-term solution” for Afghanistan was, the DG ISPR said, “We will play all the cards, and we will engage with them where we have to in a hard manner. Where we have to engage them diplomatically, we will do that as well.” Asked if there was any hope of a change in Afghanistan’s attitude due to the recent joint statement by Pakistan and China , the DG ISPR said Islamabad and Beijing “see in the same way on regional terrorism“, and therefore cooperation in that domain is maintained. He said there was consensus in the entire region that Afghanistan had become the centre of terrorism. On whether a regime-change operation in Afghanistan, similar to the recent operation in Venezuela , would be in Pakistan’s favour, the DG ISPR said it was for Afghans to decide. “We have to take care of our country. That is enough for us.” On Pakistan’s future stance on such a development, Gen Chaudhry said the state would “curate its policy based on the circumstances at that time” and stressed that the foreign ministry takes the lead in such matters. Asked about who was supporting the IS-KP terrorists in Pakistan, as the group and the Afghan Taliban were enemies, the DG ISPR questioned who termed them as each other’s enemies. The DG ISPR asserted that terrorists have no ideology, whether it is the Daesh, Al Qaeda, TTP, FAK, FAH, or ETIM. “They have no nationality, humanity or ethnicity,” Gen Chaudhry said. “They all have one father — the Afghan Taliban. About them killing each other, you have been covering for a long time that one faction kills another.” “As far as Pakistan is concerned, there is no shade or colour of any sort of terrorist. We have no space or sympathy for any terrorist. I have already said that there is only one type of good terrorist: a dead terrorist,” the DG ISPR stated. He stressed that the nation has to fight the war of narratives, technology, and intelligence. He quipped that terrorists were “baffled” by Pakistan continuing to move forward despite various militant groups thrown in the mix, along with sectarian strife and internal political facilitators. Asked if Pakistan would inevitably carry out more strikes against the TTP in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR highlighted that in October 2025, Pakistan only carried out strikes “at the Pak-Afghan border area, on the terrorists that were infiltrating into Pakistan and those who were planning to go across into Pakistan and the places they were being organised”. He stressed that it was the TTP, who were Pakistani citizens, who were struck. Gen Chaudhry noted that it was the Afghan Taliban who struck the Pakistani posts then, which gave Pakistan the “ full right to respond ” as its territorial integrity was attacked. Questioned whether Pakistan had given the Afghan Taliban legitimacy by holding talks with them in Doha and Istanbul last year, the DG ISPR answered that they are the de facto rulers in Afghanistan. He pointed out that talks have been held during the entire period from 2021 to 2025, so there was “nothing new” about that now. “Who else will you speak with?” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that since 2021, high-level delegation visits have taken place, 225 border flag meetings have occurred, 836 protest letters have been written, and 13 demarches have been issued to the same Afghan Taliban. Issues in KP Asked whether there was any hope of the federal government taking action to remove the hindrances in KP, such as by imposing governor’s rule, the DG ISPR said these decisions were up to the political leadership to decide. “This is for them to decide. They have to see multiple things. A soldier thinks in black and white [but] a politician thinks in multiple shades.” “Our job is to separate the truth and the lies. We call a spade a spade,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that the current counter-terrorism narrative of declaring terrorists Khariji began in 2023. On whether the military was willing to hold talks with KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the DG ISPR said dialogue was for the government to have. Asked at another point what the solution to the lack of political will in KP was, the DG ISPR said politicians had to resolve those issues. “We are a democratic country. There is a parliamentary democratic system, which has the solution to this.” The military spokesman asserted, “Our job is to give the state and the public our perspective based on facts and cold logic. We have no emotions in this.” The military spokesperson termed the field marshal the “source of the clarity” of not holding any talks with the terrorists or giving them any space, and instead fighting them as per God’s directives. “The truth will come out if someone has personal vested interests and does not want to obtain that clarity.” On the KP government‘s decision to abolish the Action in Aid of Civil Power Ordinance and the army‘s plan of action for military operations, the DG ISPR said under Article 245, the armed forces were to defend Pakistan as per the federal government’s directives. “The validity of any direction issued by the federal government under Clause 1 shall not be called in question in any court,” he quoted Article 245 as saying. On how the military would launch any operation or conduct IBOs in KP when there was a difference of opinion with its provincial leadership, the military spokesperson pointed out that “operations” were continuing despite the KP CM saying they would not allow kinetic actions. “Those who say we will not allow [operations], are their personalities or statements above Pakistan’s sovereignty?” he asked rhetorically. “This is a war of our sovereignty. This is Pakistan’s war. No personality or politics is above Pakistan,” he asserted. ‘Cannot blame institution for certain persons’ acts’ Responding to a query about the military leadership’s involvement in the 2021 “rehabilitation” policy and their accountability, and whether calling out only the political leadership would be “selective justice”, the DG ISPR rebutted that the military leadership had input in the decision. “We have a political narrative imposed on us wherein powers are taken in full but not the responsibility. The method to it is saying ‘we were powerless’. The government has the authority,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that both the current government and its predecessor had authority. The military spokesman further said that some institutions were “not as empowered as they should be because of the politicisation that has crept into them over time”. “We repeatedly say not to impose any politics on us […] All political parties, political leaders and political ideologies, ethnicities, communities, religions, sects are equal for us as long as they are Pakistani.” The DG ISPR, without taking names, alluded to Imran Khan and said he was “running his party like a dictator” and added that he was insistent on holding talks with the Afghan regime. He quipped that he [Imran] was so empowered that he had even declared the then-army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa as “father of the nation”, a title that is reserved for Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Gen Chaudhry added that then-intelligence chief — referring to Faiz Hameed — was “used for politics”. “You cannot put this [blame] on the institution; it was a field of characters.”",
      "title": "DG ISPR says Afghans involved in major terrorist incidents in Pakistan in 2025",
      "summary": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on Tuesday that Afghans were involved in major “high-impact” terror incidents in Pakistan in 2025. At the outset of the press conference, the military’s spokesperson said that the purpose of the briefing was to give a comprehensive overview of counter-terrorism measures taken in the past year. This “is the only purpose of this press conference, and I would request that we remain focused on counter-terrorism as terrorism is the biggest threat that is being faced by the state of Pakistan,” he added. The DG ISPR said 2025 was a “landmark and consequential year in our fight against terrorism”, adding there were four reasons behind this conclusion. He maintained that the fight against terrorism concerned the entire nation and had been ongoing for more than two decades. The DG ISPR further stated that the past year witnessed “unprecedented intensity in counter-terrorism efforts.” In 2025, he continued, the state of Pakistan, as well as the people, gained “complete clarity on terrorism”. “The state already had this clarity, which permeated slowly and gradually down[ward] that these terrorists are khawarij [and] they have no relation with Islam. They are Fitna-al-Hindustan and have no relation with Pakistan or [the people of] Balochistan,” he elaborated. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and it uses Fitna-al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. Lieutenant General Chaudhry further highlighted that in 2025, the world acknowledged Pakistan’s stance and narrative regarding terrorism, particularly Afghanistan becoming a “base for terrorist operations”. Moreover, he added that the past year also demonstrated “how the National Action Plan (NAP) was reinvigorated and how it was being implemented”. In this connection, he also mentioned that the vision for Azm-i-Istehkam — a counter-terrorism operation launched by the military in 2024 — was drawn from the revised NAP, and that all political parties and segments of society had reached a consensus on the necessity of implementing the NAP to eliminate terrorism. He acknowledged, however, that “there are still deficiencies, and there is a lot of room for improvement” in the implementation of the NAP. After outlining these four factors as the reasons behind declaring 2025 a “landmark and consequential year” in counter-terrorism, the DG ISPR went on to discuss them in detail. .A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. 75,175 IBOs in 2025 Sharing data, the military spokesperson said law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in 2025. “Which comes down to 206 IBOs per day,” he said. Breaking it down, he noted that 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan last year, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas. Moreover, 2,597 terrorists were killed in Pakistan in 2025, the DG ISPR said. Among them, 1,800 were killed in KP, 784 in Balochistan, and 10 in other areas. In 2025, he continued, 1,235 law enforcement personnel and civilians were martyred in the fight against terrorism. Sharing data about suicide bombing incidents, he said a total of 27 had taken place in 2025. Of these, 16 occurred in KP, 10 in Balochistan, and one in Islamabad, at the judicial complex. “Out of them, two [involved] female suicide bombers.” In light of these facts and figures, he said, the question that came to mind was why the majority of terror incidents took place in KP. “The primary reason for this is the politically conducive environment provided [to terrorists], and the political-terror nexus that is flourishing in the province,” he said. The DG ISPR highlighted that data show terrorism began to rise in 2021. A total of 193 terrorists were killed that year compared to 592 law enforcement personnel who were martyred, a ratio of 1:3, he added. Moving to 2025, he pointed out that 2,597 terrorists were killed last year, while 1,235 law enforcement personnel were martyred. This translated to a ratio of 2:1, he added. “But more importantly, what happened in 2021 that caused terrorism to rise?” he questioned, and he elaborated on the reasons behind this development. The DG ISPR explained that there was a change in Afghanistan in 2021 following the Doha Agreement. “An armed group, the Afghan Taliban, sat down with the US and international partners and entered into an agreement. Under the agreement, they made three commitments — that they will form an inclusive government in Afghanistan, use of Afghan soil for terrorism will not be allowed and women will be given rights [in Afghanistan],” the DG ISPR recalled. But were the commitments fulfilled, the military spokesperson questioned. “They were not. Is there a government there? There is no government there. They [just] call themselves interim Afghan government […] Is there an inclusive government there? No, there is not.” “Has terrorism been eradicated [from Afghanistan]? Contrarily, Afghanistan has become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors. Terrorists of different creeds operate from there. So that is what started happening in 2021.” Naming various terror outfits that he said were operating from Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said Afghanistan had become a “centre point where terrorists of all kinds are being nurtured”. He said that around 2,500 terrorists, who were neither Afghans nor Pakistanis, had recently reached Afghanistan from Syria. The military spokesperson also said that the Afghan Taliban, “which is now the mother organisation,” had started organising the TTP according to its organisational structure. The DG ISPR added that they also trained and directed the terror outfit. Moreover, the Afghan Taliban built a “fake” narrative, boasting that they forced the US and international coalition forces to flee Afghanistan. “On the basis of that, they start further polluting the minds of youngsters, the youth and religious-minded people. They present themselves as the flag-bearers of Islam and increase their recruitment.” “But if you analyse the matter, you will realise that they did not make them [coalition forces and the US] flee. There were other reasons for it.” The DG ISPR also spoke about the war economy in this regard. He referred to a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which he said mentioned that around $144 billion was pumped into the reconstruction of Afghanistan. “When the [supply of] that money stopped, to continue running the war economy, they [Afghan Taliban] spread the war in the form of terrorism across the entire region. They find new patrons and financial sponsors, with the biggest patron for terrorism in Pakistan being India,” he said. The DG ISPR added that India was using the Afghan Taliban as proxies and providing them with financial and other assistance. “So the base of operations is being provided in Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and India’s money and patronage [is available].” The military spokesperson added that the Afghan Taliban were taking the assistance of sponsors from elsewhere too — wherever they were able to find them — to run the war economy. The military spokesperson elaborated that modern US equipment worth $7.2bn was left behind in Afghanistan. It included night-vision devices, high-powered sniper rifles, body armour and other personal protection equipment, M-4 and M-16 assault rifles — “the best of weapons and ammunition”. This equipment was “available to the Afghan Taliban, in the black market, to all these terrorist organisations”. Moreover, the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 began “internally facilitating terrorists” and decided to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan.” This was seemingly a reference to talks held between the then-Pakistan government and the TTP. The DG ISPR went on to say that “once you give them terrorists so much space and so much wherewithal, you see a rise in terror incidents.” By 2023, he added, that state began standing against them. Lieutenant General Chaudhry referred to a speech by the army chief following a blast in a mosque in Police Lines, Peshawar, in 2023, adding that on that occasion, the army chief gave clarity on terrorism. “Entire Pakistan has that clarity now.” Further elaborating on this “clarity,” he used strong language, saying that terrorists had no religious association; they had to be eliminated, and action had to be taken against them. “But it takes time. Because if you have to fight them, you have to equip yourself, train yourself, adopt the right technology, build the narrative, and take the nation along. “You saw this last year, which I said was a consequential and landmark year, when the tide started turning.” The military spokesperson acknowledged that questions were also raised about the large number of terror incidents: 5,397 in 2025. “Yes, this is a big number. Why? Because we are engaging them everywhere. We are conducting 75,000 IBOs, 206 per day, and we are taking them on.“ “By ‘we,’ I mean myself, you, and everyone in Pakistan. We have absolute clarity that we have to win this fight, not by appeasement, but by force and strength. There are a few things in life worth fighting for, where fighting is not only justified but necessary, and there is no alternative.” He said that when terrorism has reared its head in other countries, it has destroyed states. “But your state, your law enforcement agencies, and your army are fighting on a daily basis.” Terrorism surge after May conflict Referring to a chart, he said it could be deduced from the data that after Pakistan defeated India during a four-day conflict in May 2025, terrorism surged. After its defeat, “Indians immediately sought to influence non-state actors.” Afghanistan served as the base of operations for those incidents, he said, adding that Pakistan repeatedly urged Kabul to end cross-border terrorism. “And then we carried out strikes on terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border in October, not targeting the Afghan Taliban or their posts. And what did the Afghan Taliban regime do, which is acting as a proxy and a base of operations for Indians? They attacked Pakistani posts, coming in direct support of the terrorists.“ “So the state of Pakistan did what was necessary. Dozens of Afghan posts were obliterated within hours, and a hard message was sent.” The DG ISPR said that posts were obliterated not just at the border but also inside Afghanistan. He added that the border was closed after that, and terror incidents and the facilitation of terrorists declined. “The number of terrorists killed in the last three months after the border was closed in October rose to 276 per month. There are signs here for those who can understand.” He said parallels had been drawn between Pakistan‘s actions in October last year and India’s in May 2025. “Those drawing the parallel are trying to spin a narrative,” he said. He added, “In May 2025, India targeted Pakistani citizens; Pakistan, however, did not target Afghans in October.” “We targeted our own citizens who were present there and involved in terrorism in Pakistan. They have training centres there. “We knew TTP was present there. Did we target TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan)? No, we did not. “Only the state of Pakistan has the right to punish or reward its citizens in accordance with the law and Constitution of Pakistan. Who is India to cause harm to any Pakistani citizen?” He again asserted that in the October strikes, Pakistan’s military targeted the TTP. The DG ISPR said Pakistan had been pressing the Afghan Taliban for the constitution of a verifiable mechanism, adding that Pakistan had evidence of where and to whom the Afghan Taliban had been providing refuge. Stressing the difference between India‘s and Pakistan’s cross-border strikes, he said whoever tried to point out similarities between the two developments was lying. They were trying to deceive the people, spinning a misleading narrative, the DG ISPR said. Listing 10 “major” incidents of terrorism in Pakistan in 2025, he said: “And who are involved in all of these high-impact [terror incidents]? They are all Afghans.” The DG ISPR said all 78 terrorists involved in the 10 major incidents were killed. “None of them went back alive, and 60 civilians were martyred in those incidents. So the narrative they create that it is the military’s fight [is false]. This is the fight of the people. […] If we and you did not stand up against them, they would blow themselves up in your homes, markets, offices, schools, and streets until you adopt their perverted ideology.” After playing “confessional statements by some terrorists,” he said that 16 of the terrorists killed in 2025 could be clearly identified as high-value targets. They included Amjad Ali, who was the second-in-command in the shura of the TTP. He then asked his audience to rise from their seats, and those in uniform to salute, to pay tribute to the “martyrs,” including the people of Pakistan and personnel of the police, armed forces, and Federal Constabulary, who had lost their lives in terror incidents. Three main pillars of counter-terrorism Following that, the DG ISPR said there were three main pillars of the fight against terrorism. Essentially, it was intelligence-based, he said, but there were three main pillars of its final manifestation on the ground. The first among these pillars was the engagements on the Pak-Afghan border, the second was offensive actions by small teams, and the third was the technical surveillance and engagements, he explained. “These are the three pillars that are based on intelligence.” Speaking about technical surveillance and engagement, he said a narrative was created that Pakistan’s military was using drones. But in fact, it was the terrorists who began using those armed quadcopters, he said, adding that 405 quadcopter attacks by the terrorists were reported from KP alone during the year. “Their patron — India — provides them with funds, technical inventory and other assistance. So they have now started going into this armed quadcopter business. They also have a special wing for quadcopters in their organisations. “They also use mosques, public places and houses as human shields.” He explained that law enforcement bodies, including police and armed forces, were using drones only for technical surveillance. The military’s spokesperson mentioned that even the KP government had provided law enforcement bodies with quadcopters, as terrorists had been using them. He added that law enforcement did not use quadcopters in any built-up or populated area and ensured that there was no collateral damage. “It is important to brief you on this as a false narrative is being spun regarding this,” he remarked. “We use it with care, and your army does not cause any collateral damage. We hit only terrorists and their facilitators.” He said the army was not only engaged in kinetic action when it came to countering terrorism. It was also taking measures pertaining to “communication, engagement and social manoeuvre“, he said. “In our view, this is even more important than killing the terrorists,” he said as videos of the military’s engagement with the public played in the background. “And the narrative they create that there is a law and order situation, there is a gap between the public and the state — absolutely not. “I say with great pride that Pakistan’s people and the state are together.” He said the people of Pakistan now had clarity on what Fitna-al-Khawari j and Fitna-al-Hindustan were, on the India-Afghan Taliban terrorism nexus, on the other external sponsors of terrorism, on the international acknowledgement and acceptance of Pakistan’s stance on terrorism and on internal facilitators — most of whom were found in politics — of terrorism. A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. India-Afghan Taliban nexus Speaking about the India-Afghan Taliban nexus, he also played various clips of the Indian media as a portrayal of the “collusion”. In this connection, he also mentioned those who “promoted terrorism under the guise of human rights and democracy.” He specifically cited a professor from the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, who, the DG ISPR said, had confessed to involvement in terrorism. The military spokesperson said the professor was defended by people in Pakistan and abroad and showed social media posts by various users, including freelance journalist Kiyya Baloch, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Haazir. He then said that the Afghan Taliban was not a government but a group that had occupied Afghanistan, under whose patronage more than a dozen terrorist organisations had been operating. “Everyone knows this but the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government,” he said, following which a video of KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was played. In the video, Afridi was speaking in Pashto, and the DG ISPR quoted him as asking why other countries were not facing the issue of terrorism from Afghan soil. He then pointed out that other countries, too, were facing the issue, adding that a false narrative was being spun. The DG ISPR also rejected the impression that the fight against terrorism was being carried out in the pursuit of “dollars and minerals”. A clip of PTI leader Asad Qaiser was also played, who rejected military operations in KP. On this, the DG ISPR explained that the army was a federal force and worked under the instructions of the federal government. “We are constitutionally bound to ensure Pakistan’s territorial integrity and security. “No one can allow you to hand over your areas to terrorists for your politics and to facilitate whosoever.” Giving the example of ANP being targeted by terrorists after the party voiced opposition to terrorism, the DG ISPR, without naming the PTI, said: “They are saying that they are not ready to die. That they will not stand up. That they will join them (terrorists).“ Again without naming the PTI, he raised the question of why terrorists had not ever targeted the party. Then, showing a news report about “KP seeking Afghan help for negotiations”, the DG ISPR remarked: “What policy of appeasement is this in which you are begging Kabul?” “Their narrative also came out in the open in 2025.” Then, coming back to the revised NAP, he said the kinetic action detailed under it was already being taken by security forces. The rest of the provisions under the plan had to be fulfilled by society, political parties and provincial, federal and district governments, not the army. “On this, what we feel is that there is a reinvigoration under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.” He said a case study regarding this was about how the plan was being implemented in Balochistan. And “we should be very proud” of it, he added. “The credit must go to the chief minister and the government of Balochistan. What they have done is — and they will soon provide you with a comprehensive and final document — they have constituted district-level coordination committees, which include local MPAs, DC, DPO, and representatives of the army and intelligence [agencies]. “So the devolution sense in a real sense is reaching the districts of Balochistan through these district coordination committees.” The DG ISPR shared that 472 meetings had been held of these committees between February and November 2025, since their constitution. “Funds of Rs23bn by the Balochistan government and Rs8bn by the federal government have been made available to each committee at the district level,” he said, adding that locals were included in the committees and identified projects that needed to be executed. He said 127 projects have been completed, and 949 had been planned under this plan. Moreover, 54,000 social activities and engagements had been carried out under this plan, in which government and law enforcement functionaries, army representatives and political functionaries engage with the people. He said the Balochistan government was expeditiously working on this “NAP Balochistan”, further stating that the distinction between category-A and category-B areas in Balochistan had ended. “By law, the government of Balochistan has converted everything into Cat-A, which means that now there is a Balochistan police mandate all across Balochistan. “This will have far-reaching consequences. This is again part of efforts to combat terrorism at the ground level and terror-crime nexus at the grassroots level.” He said the Balochistan’s government had allocated Rs5bn separately for training the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department as part of this. The DG ISPR said the authorities had managed to curb the smuggling of Iranian oil in Balochistan in a bid to combat the political-terror-criminal nexus. He also highlighted that the high number of pending terrorism cases in courts in KP and the low conviction rate as other reasons behind the failure to eradicate terrorism from the province. Moreover, the military’s spokesperson said two more areas that were being addressed under the revised NAP were narcotics — as it was connected to terrorism — and illegal weapons. In both areas, he said the conviction rate was low. A screengrab from the presentation played at the DG ISPR’s press conference on January 6. “It is not the job of the army, but it has a direct bearing on our counter-terrorism efforts.” Afghan repatriation Gen Chaudhry said another important facet of the revised NAP was the repatriation of Afghans. He said Punjab had just one Afghan refugee camp that had been cleared and similarly, all 10 refugee camps in Balochistan had also been cleared. In contrast, of the 43 refugee camps in KP, just five had been cleared, he said. The DG ISPR said that of around 150,000 refugees repatriated from KP, 1.2 per cent had been “deported”. Deportation “means that an individual had been checked and found to be illegally [staying]. [Deportation] provides the impetus for others to leave willingly”. “In other provinces, the percentage of deportation is much higher. That means law enforcement agencies are not being given a freehand there (KP). […] The people and law enforcement bodies in KP want [repatriation of Afghans], but why are they not being utilised for this?” he said. The DG ISPR said a Pakistan Land Port Authority had been established, which would contribute to NAP’s reinvigoration. The body would facilitate coordination among agencies operating at land ports, he explained. He said the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre had also been established and termed it a “fusion of multiple agencies in one place”. He said a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi recently, for which the “fusion of intelligence” happened at NIFTAC and provincial centres associated with the body. He ended his briefing, asserting that the fight against terrorism would continue “with the singularity of purpose and singularity of narrative”. “Those in uniform and those not in uniform have to fight together and win this fight. And no power in the world can stop us from winning this fight.” ‘Afghan border closure more beneficial than a loss’ When a journalist asked whether Pakistan was ready for a full-fledged war after availing multiple other options in recent months but “getting nothing out of it,” the DG ISPR disputed the phrasing. He noted that the ratio of terrorists killed to people martyred was now 2:1, up from 1:3 in 2021, and that Pakistan’s stance was being acknowledged globally. “Pakistan was the first to say, two years ago, that attention needed to be paid to Afghanistan, where terrorists from across the world have gathered. Now, a United Nations report states that there are 20 regional terrorist organisations there.” Gen Chaudhry further said, “We will trace them and their facilitators. No one should have any doubt about Pakistan’s resolve—its public, its armed forces, and its political and military leadership.” Asked about the future of the Pak-Afghan border , the DG ISPR noted that the state’s top-most priority was the security and territorial integrity of Pakistan. He stressed that the border had been closed for a reason, which had also been communicated to Kabul. About Pakistani students in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said the state will do whatever is necessary for their protection. At another point, when asked about Afghanistan’s demand for a separate trade pact to reopen the border, the DG ISPR stated that the border closure only had “advantages” for Pakistan and no losses, as terrorism was permeating through it. Asked what the “long-term solution” for Afghanistan was, the DG ISPR said, “We will play all the cards, and we will engage with them where we have to in a hard manner. Where we have to engage them diplomatically, we will do that as well.” Asked if there was any hope of a change in Afghanistan’s attitude due to the recent joint statement by Pakistan and China , the DG ISPR said Islamabad and Beijing “see in the same way on regional terrorism“, and therefore cooperation in that domain is maintained. He said there was consensus in the entire region that Afghanistan had become the centre of terrorism. On whether a regime-change operation in Afghanistan, similar to the recent operation in Venezuela , would be in Pakistan’s favour, the DG ISPR said it was for Afghans to decide. “We have to take care of our country. That is enough for us.” On Pakistan’s future stance on such a development, Gen Chaudhry said the state would “curate its policy based on the circumstances at that time” and stressed that the foreign ministry takes the lead in such matters. Asked about who was supporting the IS-KP terrorists in Pakistan, as the group and the Afghan Taliban were enemies, the DG ISPR questioned who termed them as each other’s enemies. The DG ISPR asserted that terrorists have no ideology, whether it is the Daesh, Al Qaeda, TTP, FAK, FAH, or ETIM. “They have no nationality, humanity or ethnicity,” Gen Chaudhry said. “They all have one father — the Afghan Taliban. About them killing each other, you have been covering for a long time that one faction kills another.” “As far as Pakistan is concerned, there is no shade or colour of any sort of terrorist. We have no space or sympathy for any terrorist. I have already said that there is only one type of good terrorist: a dead terrorist,” the DG ISPR stated. He stressed that the nation has to fight the war of narratives, technology, and intelligence. He quipped that terrorists were “baffled” by Pakistan continuing to move forward despite various militant groups thrown in the mix, along with sectarian strife and internal political facilitators. Asked if Pakistan would inevitably carry out more strikes against the TTP in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR highlighted that in October 2025, Pakistan only carried out strikes “at the Pak-Afghan border area, on the terrorists that were infiltrating into Pakistan and those who were planning to go across into Pakistan and the places they were being organised”. He stressed that it was the TTP, who were Pakistani citizens, who were struck. Gen Chaudhry noted that it was the Afghan Taliban who struck the Pakistani posts then, which gave Pakistan the “ full right to respond ” as its territorial integrity was attacked. Questioned whether Pakistan had given the Afghan Taliban legitimacy by holding talks with them in Doha and Istanbul last year, the DG ISPR answered that they are the de facto rulers in Afghanistan. He pointed out that talks have been held during the entire period from 2021 to 2025, so there was “nothing new” about that now. “Who else will you speak with?” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that since 2021, high-level delegation visits have taken place, 225 border flag meetings have occurred, 836 protest letters have been written, and 13 demarches have been issued to the same Afghan Taliban. Issues in KP Asked whether there was any hope of the federal government taking action to remove the hindrances in KP, such as by imposing governor’s rule, the DG ISPR said these decisions were up to the political leadership to decide. “This is for them to decide. They have to see multiple things. A soldier thinks in black and white [but] a politician thinks in multiple shades.” “Our job is to separate the truth and the lies. We call a spade a spade,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that the current counter-terrorism narrative of declaring terrorists Khariji began in 2023. On whether the military was willing to hold talks with KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the DG ISPR said dialogue was for the government to have. Asked at another point what the solution to the lack of political will in KP was, the DG ISPR said politicians had to resolve those issues. “We are a democratic country. There is a parliamentary democratic system, which has the solution to this.” The military spokesman asserted, “Our job is to give the state and the public our perspective based on facts and cold logic. We have no emotions in this.” The military spokesperson termed the field marshal the “source of the clarity” of not holding any talks with the terrorists or giving them any space, and instead fighting them as per God’s directives. “The truth will come out if someone has personal vested interests and does not want to obtain that clarity.” On the KP government‘s decision to abolish the Action in Aid of Civil Power Ordinance and the army‘s plan of action for military operations, the DG ISPR said under Article 245, the armed forces were to defend Pakistan as per the federal government’s directives. “The validity of any direction issued by the federal government under Clause 1 shall not be called in question in any court,” he quoted Article 245 as saying. On how the military would launch any operation or conduct IBOs in KP when there was a difference of opinion with its provincial leadership, the military spokesperson pointed out that “operations” were continuing despite the KP CM saying they would not allow kinetic actions. “Those who say we will not allow [operations], are their personalities or statements above Pakistan’s sovereignty?” he asked rhetorically. “This is a war of our sovereignty. This is Pakistan’s war. No personality or politics is above Pakistan,” he asserted. ‘Cannot blame institution for certain persons’ acts’ Responding to a query about the military leadership’s involvement in the 2021 “rehabilitation” policy and their accountability, and whether calling out only the political leadership would be “selective justice”, the DG ISPR rebutted that the military leadership had input in the decision. “We have a political narrative imposed on us wherein powers are taken in full but not the responsibility. The method to it is saying ‘we were powerless’. The government has the authority,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that both the current government and its predecessor had authority. The military spokesman further said that some institutions were “not as empowered as they should be because of the politicisation that has crept into them over time”. “We repeatedly say not to impose any politics on us […] All political parties, political leaders and political ideologies, ethnicities, communities, religions, sects are equal for us as long as they are Pakistani.” The DG ISPR, without taking names, alluded to Imran Khan and said he was “running his party like a dictator” and added that he was insistent on holding talks with the Afghan regime. He quipped that he [Imran] was so empowered that he had even declared the then-army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa as “father of the nation”, a title that is reserved for Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Gen Chaudhry added that then-intelligence chief — referring to Faiz Hameed — was “used for politics”. “You cannot put this [blame] on the institution; it was a field of characters.”",

      "summary_orig": "Icy temperatures plunged swathes of Europe into a second day of travel chaos on Tuesday, with weather-related accidents causing six deaths from the continent’s bitterest cold snap this winter so far. Five of those deaths since the mercury dropped on Monday were in France alone, while a woman died in Bosnia as heavy snow and rain sparked floods and power outages across the Balkans. Paris’s two airports, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly, were to cancel many flights early Wednesday to allow ground crews to clear snow from runways and de-ice planes. Forty percent of flights at Charles de Gaulle were to be scrapped, and 25 per cent at Orly. A person gathers snow following a short snow shower in Parliament Square, in London, Britain on January 6, 2026. —Reuters In Britain, the mercury plunged to -12.5C overnight Monday-Tuesday in Norfolk, eastern England, while temperatures below -10C across the Netherlands brought trains to a standstill on Tuesday morning. “Last night was the coldest night of the winter so far,” Britain’s Met Office said, with nearly all of the United Kingdom on alert for snow and ice and more snowfall expected. With the chill making roads perilous, three people died in accidents linked to black ice in southwestern France on Monday morning, authorities said, while a taxi driver died in hospital on Monday night after veering into the Marne river in the Paris region. His passenger was still being treated for hypothermia, according to a police source. Another driver also lost his life east of Paris on Monday after a collision with a heavy goods vehicle. Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, the Netherlands’ main flight hub, meanwhile, saw a second day of weather-driven cancellations on Tuesday, with more than 400 flights grounded and travellers facing huge queues at the airline counters. Trains from the Dutch national railway operator NS only began rolling again after 3:00pm PKT, with services limited afterwards. But planes got off the ground again from Liverpool in northwest England and Aberdeen in northeast Scotland, after the cold had forced both airports to close on Monday. ‘Like climbing Mont Blanc’ After nearly 40 centimetres (16 inches) of snow fell in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo at the weekend, a woman died in hospital after being hit by a tree that collapsed under the weight of the snow on Monday, according to the police. Dozens of villages across neighbouring Serbia were left without power in the wake of the snowfall, while downpours caused several rivers to overflow in Bosnia and forced the evacuation of dozens of homes in Albania. People are seen on the frozen lake “Klostersee” close to Seeon Abbey in Seeon, southern Germany, on January 6, 2026. —AFP More than 300 schools were shut in Scotland on Tuesday, the national BBC broadcaster reported, with Scottish train services also severely disrupted. “Tuesday will bring more severe snow and ice to the north of Scotland — and with it, continued travel disruption and risks to people and communities,” Scottish transport minister Fiona Hyslop warned late on Monday. “It’s important that people plan ahead, consider their travel plans and work from home if that’s an option.” Several smaller French airports were closed on Tuesday, according to the transport ministry. In the French capital, Monday’s snowfall had settled overnight across much of Paris’s pavements, with pedestrians forced to navigate treacherously icy streets. Tour guide Valeria Pitchouguina said the sight of Paris snowed under was “truly extraordinary”, but the ice was complicating efforts to shepherd her groups up the steep stepsto the picture-postcard district of Montmartre. “When it’s like that and snowy and icy, it’s something else, it’s less like climbing Montmartre and more like climbing Mont Blanc,” Pitchouguina told AFPTV . Hungary meanwhile also braced for a second day of fresh snowfall Tuesday, with some roads and railways already impassable, especially in the northeast. Construction and Transport Minister Janos Lazar urged Hungarians to only head out “if absolutely necessary”.",

People are seen on the frozen lake “Klostersee” close to Seeon Abbey in Seeon, southern Germany, on January 6, 2026. —AFP More than 300 schools were shut in Scotland on Tuesday, the national BBC broadcaster reported, with Scottish train services also severely disrupted. “Tuesday will bring more severe snow and ice to the north of Scotland — and with it, continued travel disruption and risks to people and communities,” Scottish transport minister Fiona Hyslop warned late on Monday. “It’s important that people plan ahead, consider their travel plans and work from home if that’s an option.” Several smaller French airports were closed on Tuesday, according to the transport ministry. In the French capital, Monday’s snowfall had settled overnight across much of Paris’s pavements, with pedestrians forced to navigate treacherously icy streets. Tour guide Valeria Pitchouguina said the sight of Paris snowed under was “truly extraordinary”, but the ice was complicating efforts to shepherd her groups up the steep stepsto the picture-postcard district of Montmartre. “When it’s like that and snowy and icy, it’s something else, it’s less like climbing Montmartre and more like climbing Mont Blanc,” Pitchouguina told AFPTV . Hungary meanwhile also braced for a second day of fresh snowfall Tuesday, with some roads and railways already impassable, especially in the northeast. Construction and Transport Minister Janos Lazar urged Hungarians to only head out “if absolutely necessary”.",

      "summary": "Icy temperatures plunged swathes of Europe into a second day of travel chaos on Tuesday, with weather-related accidents causing six deaths from the continent’s bitterest cold snap this winter so far. Five of those deaths since the mercury dropped on Monday were in France alone, while a woman died in Bosnia as heavy snow and rain sparked floods and power outages across the Balkans. Paris’s two airports, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly, were to cancel many flights early Wednesday to allow ground crews to clear snow from runways and de-ice planes. Forty percent of flights at Charles de Gaulle were to be scrapped, and 25 per cent at Orly. A person gathers snow following a short snow shower in Parliament Square, in London, Britain on January 6, 2026. —Reuters In Britain, the mercury plunged to -12.5C overnight Monday-Tuesday in Norfolk, eastern England, while temperatures below -10C across the Netherlands brought trains to a standstill on Tuesday morning. “Last night was the coldest night of the winter so far,” Britain’s Met Office said, with nearly all of the United Kingdom on alert for snow and ice and more snowfall expected. With the chill making roads perilous, three people died in accidents linked to black ice in southwestern France on Monday morning, authorities said, while a taxi driver died in hospital on Monday night after veering into the Marne river in the Paris region. His passenger was still being treated for hypothermia, according to a police source. Another driver also lost his life east of Paris on Monday after a collision with a heavy goods vehicle. Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, the Netherlands’ main flight hub, meanwhile, saw a second day of weather-driven cancellations on Tuesday, with more than 400 flights grounded and travellers facing huge queues at the airline counters. Trains from the Dutch national railway operator NS only began rolling again after 3:00pm PKT, with services limited afterwards.

      "summary_orig": "The Israeli foreign minister arrived in Somaliland on Tuesday in a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa. Israel announced last month it was officially recognising Somaliland , a first for the self-proclaimed republic since it declared independence from Somalia in 1991. Somaliland enjoys a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, whose delegation was welcomed at the airport by senior government officials, said recognising Somaliland had been “the moral thing to do”. Somaliland President Abdirahman Abdullahi Mohamed praised Israel’s “courageous” decision, and said it would open up great economic and development opportunities. “It promotes the strategic interest partnership of the two countries,” he said in a joint press conference. Somalia reacted furiously to news of the visit, labelling it an “illegal” and “unauthorised incursion”. In a statement, Somalia’s foreign ministry said it “reserves the right to take all appropriate diplomatic and legal measures… to safeguard its sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity”. A special meeting of the African Union Peace and Security Council on Tuesday condemned “in the strongest terms” the recognition by Israel and called for its “immediate revocation”. During the Israeli delegation’s short stay, sources said roads were blocked, with civilian movements restricted. Following Israel’s recognition, militant group Al-Shabaab — which has fought the Somali government for around two decades — said they would fight any attempt by Israel to use Somaliland as a base. ‘Threat’ to stability Analysts say the deal with Somaliland could provide Israel with better access to the Red Sea, enabling it to hit Houthi rebels in Yemen. Somaliland’s location alongside one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes has made it a key partner for foreign countries. Israel’s recognition was supported by the United States, but criticised by Egypt, Turkey, the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council and the Saudi-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The European Union insisted Somalia’s sovereignty should be respected. Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud called the Israeli decision a “threat” to stability in the already volatile Horn of Africa. In an interview with Al Jazeera, he said Somaliland had accepted three conditions from Israel: the resettlement of Palestinians, the establishment of a military base on the Gulf of Aden, and joining the Abraham Accords to normalise ties with Israel. Somaliland’s foreign ministry denied the first two conditions. Somaliland has experienced greater stability than the rest of insurgency-hit Somalia. It was briefly a recognised state in June 1960 when it gained independence from Britain, but voluntarily united with Italian-administered Somalia days later. Somaliland’s leaders say that the union was never formally ratified and became void when the Somali state effectively collapsed in 1991. 20 nations, OIC reject Israel’s recognition of Somaliland In December Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in rejecting Israel‘s recognition of self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”. The statement also registered the countries’ rejection of any “potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land”. The joint statement was issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Iran, Iraq Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye, Yemen and the OIC.",

Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud called the Israeli decision a “threat” to stability in the already volatile Horn of Africa. In an interview with Al Jazeera, he said Somaliland had accepted three conditions from Israel: the resettlement of Palestinians, the establishment of a military base on the Gulf of Aden, and joining the Abraham Accords to normalise ties with Israel. Somaliland’s foreign ministry denied the first two conditions. Somaliland has experienced greater stability than the rest of insurgency-hit Somalia. It was briefly a recognised state in June 1960 when it gained independence from Britain, but voluntarily united with Italian-administered Somalia days later. Somaliland’s leaders say that the union was never formally ratified and became void when the Somali state effectively collapsed in 1991. 20 nations, OIC reject Israel’s recognition of Somaliland In December Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in rejecting Israel‘s recognition of self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”. The statement also registered the countries’ rejection of any “potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land”. The joint statement was issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Iran, Iraq Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye, Yemen and the OIC.",
