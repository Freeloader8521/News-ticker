The EU marked a symbolic shift in its approach to Iran’s leadership on Thursday by designating the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, following what turned out to be one of the country’s deadliest crackdowns of protests since its establishment in 1979. “By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards … the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot and once again made a decision against the interests of their people by blindly obeying the Americans,” Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told his fellow MPs, all wearing Revolutionary Guards uniforms in support of the elite force. “According to Article 7 of the law on countermeasures against the designation of the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, the armies of European countries are considered terrorist groups.” Qalibaf added that the national security parliamentary commission would deliberate on the expulsion of EU countries’ military attaches and follow up on the issue with the foreign ministry. Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the IRGC have great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces.",

      "summary_orig": "UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan figured prominently in warnings sounded at the United Nations this week about the growing spillover of terrorist threats from Afghanistan, with both China and the UN chief expressing concern over militant violence affecting the country. Addressing a high-level briefing on the Counter-Terrorism Early Warning Network for Central Asia on Friday, Chinese Ambassador to the UN Sun Lei said that while the Central Asia region remained broadly stable, it continued to be affected by cross-border terrorism. “Currently, the Central Asia region remains generally stable, yet is still deeply affected by the spillover effect of terrorist threats,” he said, citing recent attacks in Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan that “deserve our high vigilance”. Emphasising Pakistan’s long-standing concerns , the Chinese envoy called for closer cooperation with Kabul. “We need to strengthen engagement and cooperation with Afghanistan to prevent it from once again becoming a safe haven for terrorist organisations, and to jointly prevent and address the return of foreign terrorist fighters,” he said. Beijing calls for cooperation with Kabul to stop militants using Afghan soil; Guterres flags TTP threat under Taliban regime Ambassador Sun also underlined the importance of development in countering extremism. “At the same time, it is imperative to accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to eliminate the root causes of terrorism,” he said. UN concerns A day earlier, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres raised similar concerns at a briefing in New York. He said the UN remained committed to four key objectives in Afghanistan, while voicing frustration over the Taliban’s failure to make progress on inclusivity, human rights and regional security. “We need to make sure that Afghan institutions are truly inclusive, that all ethnic groups are represented and that all sectors of society are represented,” he said, calling this “a basic condition for the consolidation of peace”. On women’s rights, the UN chief expressed concern over restrictions limiting women’s ability to work. “[UN Undersecretary General] Rosemary DiCarlo managed to guarantee the possibility for our female staff to work in the field, but not in our headquarters, and we are very frustrated by that.” He described the Taliban’s failure to meet the expectations of the international community as “unacceptable”. Turning to security, Guterres highlighted the threat posed by groups operating from Afghan soil. “Another aspect is the need to make sure that no terrorist organisations can operate from Afghanistan into other countries. We are particularly concerned about what has happened with the Pakistani Taliban [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan] and the support they might receive.” He added that the UN had seen meaningful progress on drug trafficking since the Taliban’s return, but lamented the lack of improvement on other fronts. “In relation to the three other aspects, we have frustration, because we do not see our legitimate concerns making the progress that is essential.” Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in terrorist incidents in recent years, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, with officials linking much of the violence to cross-border infiltration from Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021. Analysts say the resurgent TTP and allied groups have increased attacks inside Pakistan while allegedly enjoying safe havens across the Afghan border. Islamabad has consistently urged the international community to press Kabul to prevent its territory from being used by militants targeting Pakistan, arguing that regional and global security remain directly tied to stability in Afghanistan.

      "summary_orig": "THE latest blunder by the hybrid government in taking imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan to hospital for the treatment of a critical eye problem surreptitiously — without even informing his family or his personal physicians — can only be blamed on the PTI founder himself. Indeed, the responsibility rests squarely on his shoulders, because, if it weren’t for fear of his supporters converging on the hospital in droves, why would the authorities have kept something secret that would have come out in the open within days? Even after spending 32 months in prison since his arrest in the Toshakhana case, followed by his conviction, Mr Khan’s popularity has not waned nor has his cutting, effective narrative been blunted. So, the prisoner has made his captors themselves captives of fear. He is wielding influence and power way beyond the confines of his cell. And I say this when I have never voted for him or his party; and when I liked Imran Khan far more as an iconic cricketer and anti-cancer crusader than as a politician with traits defined by a populist rhetoric and disdain for opinions that differ from his own. Even a man committed to a fitness programme will show signs of wear and tear after a demanding sporting life. For example, as far as the media is concerned, Imran Khan’s government did exactly what the incumbents are doing. The media, as this newspaper knows well, was punished for merely reporting on the facts, articulating people’s aspirations and issues and calling out those at the helm for overstepping legal and constitutional boundaries when they did. His tenure in office with his intel chief (now a court-martialled former three-star) as his enforcer, was a nightmare for media houses as well as media professionals with all kinds of oppression unleashed against journalists as well as their employers for not toeing the line — ie, for coverage that was seen as out of line. And his disdain for the Constitution and the rule of law was evident from his conduct when, after falling out with his benefactors, he faced the certainty of being ousted in an establishment-backed no-confidence vote. He advised his party man, the president, to dissolve the Assembly. Even a judiciary which was largely seen as sympathetic to him could not digest the move and restored the Assembly and resurrected the no-trust vote. He blamed a ‘foreign (US) conspiracy’ for his ouster from office in April 2022. His supporters, in the eyes of whom he can do no wrong, lapped it up and his narrative snowballed into a firm belief among millions that he’d been horribly wronged. When his establishment backers of the time were building him up as a viable choice through the media in the first half of the last decade and many media houses gave him endless airtime, he rode the crest of the popularity wave. But side by side, he built a formidable social media machine. Now when the shoe is on the other foot and most of the media has fallen in line and remains largely unsympathetic to the PTI cause, the founder remains unaffected as his message and narrative reaches all his supporters through social media and other means. This is what has led to him being kept incommunicado, with family (consisting mainly of his sisters) ‘visits’, as per the jail manual, and party leaders barred for weeks on end because they are seen as the source through which his messages, often stripped of any niceties, reach his US-based social media team that runs his handle and amplifies the messages. To be honest, these messages so far have not proved effective in mobilising his support base to pour out into the streets to demand his freedom. But yes, the language used is often so bitter and severe — perhaps, because like many other Pakistanis, he believes he was cheated out of an election win in 2024 — that it probably irks those who wield power today. So by restricting his visitors the conduit for his messages is also blocked. Whether those moves and countermoves are legitimate is a debate for another time but there can be no question that denying he was taken to hospital for a procedure for nearly a week before admitting the truth shows the hybrid set-up in a very poor light. Even with a rudimentary knowledge of medical issues, I can say that anything to do with the eye is a very serious issue and needs addressing promptly because it can imperil one’s vision. No matter how hard the state may have now decided to be, this is taking things to ludicrous levels. The former iconic sports star is super fit no doubt, even at 73. Government ministers say he has been given exercise machines in prison and uses them regularly. But even a man committed to a fitness programme like him will show signs of wear and tear after a demanding sporting life. He deserves to be looked after well and by physicians of his choice. As far as I know, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust Hospital’s top executives and respected physicians Dr Asim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan have never been the source of any leak of Imran Khan’s political messages when they have seen him in their professional capacity. One blunder should not lead to a series of blunders. He is a former prime minister, a popular leader, and a national icon. Whatever hurt and offence his messages may cause, that should not be an obstacle to him receiving the best possible treatment by doctors he has faith in and trusts; his personal physicians’ visit ought to be facilitated. No point in waiting for Feb 8 to pass when he has called for mass protests. Every day counts if you don’t want to lose the narratives war.

      "summary_orig": "THE seemingly coordinated terrorist attacks across Balochistan on Saturday reinforce the fact that the state must confront the menace of terrorist violence in the province firmly. As per security sources and official media, terrorists belonging to Fitna al-Hindustan , the term the state uses for Baloch separatists, struck at least 12 cities and towns in the province, including Quetta. A large number of terrorists were killed by the security forces. Security men and civilians have also been martyred in the attacks. The sophistication of the strikes indicates that the militants had received training, and backs the state’s suspicions that hostile actors in the region are stirring up trouble in Balochistan. Yet it is also a matter of concern that the terrorists were able to hit such a large number of towns, including the provincial capital, which is supposed to be well-protected. The seriousness of the situation can be gauged from the federal interior minister’s dash to Balochistan to take stock of the situation. Were it not for the sacrifices of the police and security forces, the terrorists could have succeeded in causing greater havoc. Unfortunately, this pattern of violence in Balochistan is not new. Last year’s assault targeting the Jaffar Express , as well as a similar coordinated terror campaign in August 2024, shows that despite the state’s counterterrorism efforts, the problem of militancy remains unresolved in this troubled province. As per one think tank, there were over 250 terrorist attacks in Balochistan last year, causing over 400 fatalities. Along with KP, the province is the hardest hit by terrorist violence in the country. This atmosphere of violence and uncertainty exacerbates the socioeconomic woes of Balochistan, and slows development. While the immediate focus should be on sanitisation operations so that all affected areas are declared safe, the administration must think long term in order to bring lasting peace to Balochistan. Firstly, no ideology can justify the murder of innocent people — women and children were also reportedly martyred in Saturday’s attacks — therefore, the state must neutralise all those violent actors responsible for these atrocities. In the past, Baloch terrorists have also indulged in brutal slayings of ‘non-locals.’ Moreover, the links of the terrorist groups with hostile foreign actors need to be broken, and greater vigilance is needed at the country’s borders to prevent terrorists from entering the country. But while the kinetic element is essential, long-term peace can only come about through a full and unhindered political process in the province. Those estranged elements that renounce violence and pledge to respect the Constitution should be engaged by the rulers. Also, until Balochistan’s natural wealth reaches its people, and alleviates their poverty and suffering, hostile actors will continue to exploit the situation. Published in Dawn, February 1st, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Palestinian territory’s civil defence agency says victims include children • Bloodshed comes after Tel Aviv announced it would reopen Rafah crossing today for ‘limited movement of people’ GAZA CITY: Israeli air strikes killed 32 people including children in Gaza on Saturday, according to the Palestinian territory’s civil defence agency. Despite a US-brokered truce entering its second phase earlier this month, violence in the Palestinian territory has continued, with both Israel and Hamas accusing each other of violating the agreement. The latest bloodshed comes after Israel announced it would reopen the crucial Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Sunday (today) for the “limited movement of people”. “The death toll since dawn today has risen to 32, most of them children and women,” said the civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under the Hamas authority, updating an earlier toll of 28. “Residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station were targeted, resulting in this humanitarian catastrophe,” agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said in the statement. A unit in an apartment building of Gaza City’s Rimal neighbourhood was left entirely destroyed, and blood spatters from its occupants were visible on the street below, an AFP journalist reported. “Three girls died while they were sleeping. We found their bodies in the street”, Samer al-Atbash, a relative of the family, told AFP. “What truce are you talking about? Everyone is deceiving everyone else,” added Nael al-Atbash, another relative. One strike hit the police station in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City, the territory’s largest urban centre. Gaza’s general police directorate said seven people were killed in that attack, while Bassal said the dead included four women police officers. “The killed included police officers and personnel as well as civilians who were present at the station at the time,” the directorate said. Ceasefire violations About a dozen first responders rushed to the devastated building and pulled bodies from the rubble, according to an AFP journalist. Another Israeli attack hit a shelter in Al-Mawasi, an area of south Gaza where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians live in tents and makeshift shelters, an AFP journalist reported. Large plumes of smoke rose above the thousands of densely pitched tents. The number of casualties from this strike was still not known. Although people have been killed almost daily in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire on Oct 10, Saturday’s toll was particularly high. Israel’s military said that the air strikes were retaliation for an incident on Friday in which eight Palestinian fighters exited a tunnel in the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza, which it said violated the fragile ceasefire. It claimed that it targeted commanders and sites belonging to Hamas and its ally, Islamic Jihad. Hamas in a statement condemned Saturday’s strikes as “a brutal crime”. The health ministry, which operates under the Hamas authority, has said Israeli attacks have killed at least 509 people in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect. Rafah reopening Media restrictions and limited access in Gaza left journalists unable to independently verify casualty figures or freely cover the violence. Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, condemned Israel’s “repeated violations” of the truce and demanded all parties “exercise the utmost restraint” ahead of Sunday’s reopening of Rafah crossing. Israel has said reopening of the Rafah crossing will only allow the “limited movement of people”. The reopening is a key element in the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.

      "summary_orig": "• Interior minister, Balochistan CM reaffirm resolve against terrorism • Akhtar Mengal says he has ‘never seen such a dangerous situation’ QUETTA: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday held India responsible for a spate of attacks in Balochistan, stressing that authorities would go after every single one of those involved, while an opposition leader warned that the situation in the region had spiralled “completely out of control”. Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists. “We will expose them in the world — the face with which they meet the world and the face with which they support terrorists.” Mr Naqvi said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and devising strategies. CM Bugti expressed gratitude to Mr Naqvi for rushing to Quetta. “We chaired a high-level security meeting and visited the injured at the Combined Military Hospital,” he said. “In terms of the incident itself, information has yet to come, but I want to say that the operation is pretty much over,” he said. He lauded law enforcement and security personnel for their response to the attacks. Earlier, the interior minister and CM Bugti attended funeral prayers for the martyred personnel and visited Police Lines to meet the bereaved families in Quetta. They reaffirmed that the resolve of the people and the state against terrorism remained unshakable. “The people and security forces of Balochistan are brave and courageous,” an official statement quoted Mr Naqvi as saying. “Our soldiers took comprehensive and effective action against terrorists. The sacrifices of martyrs cannot be forgotten, and the nation salutes them.” Addressing the families, CM Bugti vowed that “every drop of the martyrs’ blood would be avenged” and urged them to remain steadfast and patient. He emphasised that the people of Balochistan owed a debt to their sacrifice. Situation ‘out of control’ Sardar Akhtar Mengal, president of his faction of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) and a former chief minister, offered a sharp contrast to the government’s assurances. “I have never seen such a dangerous situation in my entire life,” Mr Mengal said in a statement posted on the social media platform X. Mr Mengal, a member of the National Assembly, stated with “full conviction” that no tribal chief could enter his own area without fear of militant attacks. He called this a reality that should deeply alarm everyone, stressing that the security situation was “completely out of control”. He added: “We take no pleasure in seeing our land burn.” The BNP-M chief attributed the crisis to “hatred, oppression and the misuse of power” that, he said, had continued over the past three years. He argued that instead of heeding warnings, the government had funded propaganda against those trying to resolve the province’s issues. “If the government were to stop funding private media channels to propagate against him and others genuinely striving to address Balochistan’s issues, it could help foster at least a modest sense of security,” he said. “Everyone knew this day would come, but no one chose to listen,” Mr Mengal said, criticising federal institutions for “blindly” repeating the narrative that no problem existed.

He added: “We take no pleasure in seeing our land burn.” The BNP-M chief attributed the crisis to “hatred, oppression and the misuse of power” that, he said, had continued over the past three years. He argued that instead of heeding warnings, the government had funded propaganda against those trying to resolve the province’s issues. “If the government were to stop funding private media channels to propagate against him and others genuinely striving to address Balochistan’s issues, it could help foster at least a modest sense of security,” he said. “Everyone knew this day would come, but no one chose to listen,” Mr Mengal said, criticising federal institutions for “blindly” repeating the narrative that no problem existed.

      "summary": "• Interior minister, Balochistan CM reaffirm resolve against terrorism • Akhtar Mengal says he has ‘never seen such a dangerous situation’ QUETTA: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday held India responsible for a spate of attacks in Balochistan, stressing that authorities would go after every single one of those involved, while an opposition leader warned that the situation in the region had spiralled “completely out of control”. Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists. “We will expose them in the world — the face with which they meet the world and the face with which they support terrorists.” Mr Naqvi said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and devising strategies. CM Bugti expressed gratitude to Mr Naqvi for rushing to Quetta. “We chaired a high-level security meeting and visited the injured at the Combined Military Hospital,” he said. “In terms of the incident itself, information has yet to come, but I want to say that the operation is pretty much over,” he said. He lauded law enforcement and security personnel for their response to the attacks. Earlier, the interior minister and CM Bugti attended funeral prayers for the martyred personnel and visited Police Lines to meet the bereaved families in Quetta. They reaffirmed that the resolve of the people and the state against terrorism remained unshakable. “The people and security forces of Balochistan are brave and courageous,” an official statement quoted Mr Naqvi as saying. “Our soldiers took comprehensive and effective action against terrorists. The sacrifices of martyrs cannot be forgotten, and the nation salutes them.” Addressing the families, CM Bugti vowed that “every drop of the martyrs’ blood would be avenged” and urged them to remain steadfast and patient. He emphasised that the people of Balochistan owed a debt to their sacrifice. Situation ‘out of control’ Sardar Akhtar Mengal, president of his faction of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) and a former chief minister, offered a sharp contrast to the government’s assurances. “I have never seen such a dangerous situation in my entire life,” Mr Mengal said in a statement posted on the social media platform X. Mr Mengal, a member of the National Assembly, stated with “full conviction” that no tribal chief could enter his own area without fear of militant attacks. He called this a reality that should deeply alarm everyone, stressing that the security situation was “completely out of control”.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: While maintaining the price of petrol for the next fortnight, the government has increased the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs11.30 per litre. The announcement by the Petroleum Division said the new prices had been set on the recommendations of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra). The price of HSD for the next fortnight, up to Feb 15, has been fixed at Rs268.38 per litre, compared to Rs257.08 during the previous 15 days. The increase has been made due “to higher crude oil prices over the past week amid regional tensions and an order by the US president to deploy a US Navy strike group to the Persian Gulf”. This development alone pushed up HSD prices in Arab and other international markets. As HSD is a key fuel for the industrial and business sectors and is widely used by trucks, buses and large generators, a strong reaction from the business community is expected over the Rs11.30 per litre increase. The price of petrol, consumed mainly by cars, mot­orcycles and small generators, has been kept unc­h­anged at Rs253.17 per litre. Due to the rise in HSD prices, jet fuel rates have also been increased slightly for the next fortnight. Meanwhile, despite the politically tense global environment, the US Energy Information Administration has forecast Brent crude prices to average lower in 2026 and 2027, driven by global production exceeding demand. International analysts have predicted that global production of liquid fuels will increase by 1.4 million barrels per day in 2026 due to higher production. LPG Ogra has also notified new prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for the month of February, showing an increase due to higher winter demand in global markets. The LPG consumer price has been increased by Rs6.37 per kg to Rs226.05 per kg for February, compared to Rs219.67 in January. The LPG producer price is linked to the Saudi Aramco contract price and the dollar exchange rate. Compared to the previous month, the Saudi Aramco contract price has increased by 3.83 per cent, while the average dollar exchange rate has declined marginally by 0.14pc, resulting in an increase of Rs75.71 per 11.8kg cylinder.

      "summary_orig": "Iranian army chief Amir Hatami on Saturday warned the United States and Israel against an attack, saying his country’s forces were on high alert following Washington’s heavy military deployments in the Gulf. He also insisted the Islamic republic’s nuclear expertise could not be eliminated, after Trump said he expected Tehran to seek a deal to avoid US strikes. “If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime (Israel),” Hatami said, according to the official IRNA news agency. He noted that Iran’s armed forces were “at full defensive and military readiness”. Washington sent a naval strike group to the Middle East led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, with Trump threatening to intervene militarily after a deadly crackdown by Iranian authorities on two weeks of anti-government protests. The deployment has raised fears of a possible direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies — notably Israel — in the event of an attack. On Friday, Trump said he predicted that Iran would seek to negotiate a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face American military action. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that Tehran was ready for nuclear talks, but its missiles and defence “will never be negotiated”. ‘Cannot be eliminated’ The US carried out strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites in June when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against its regional foe. Israeli attacks also hit military sites across the country and killed senior officers and top nuclear scientists. But Hatami on Saturday insisted that Iran’s nuclear technology “cannot be eliminated, even if scientists and sons of this nation are martyred”. On Friday, US Central Command (Centcom) said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would conduct “a two-day live-fire naval exercise” in the Strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies. In a statement , Centcom warned the IRGC against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”. The United States designated the IRGC a terrorist organisation in 2019, a move the European Union followed on Thursday. The EU decision drew angry reactions from Tehran, which vowed to reciprocate. Deadly crackdown Nationwide protests against the rising cost of living erupted in Iran on December 28, before turning into a broader anti-government movement that peaked on January 8 and 9. Iranian authorities have said the protests began peacefully before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, blaming the United States and Israel for fomenting the unrest. The official death toll from the authorities stands at 3,117. The protests have since subsided . On Saturday, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances after the demonstrations. “We must work with the people and for the people and serve the people as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said in a speech broadcast on state TV. “If we act justly, the people will see it and will accept it, and under such conditions, no power can cripple a government, a society, or a nation that acts justly, fairly, and on the basis of rights.” On Saturday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei visited the shrine of Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, in southern Tehran. In a video carried by his official website, Khamenei offered prayers at the shrine on the occasion of 10-day celebrations marking the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

      "title_orig": "Imran’s procedure completed ‘smoothly’, vitals remained ‘stable’: Pims executive director",
      "summary_orig": "The executive director of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, revealed early on Saturday that the eye procedure of incarcerated former premier Imran Khan was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention. The video statement by the hospital’s head comes after the PTI approached the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking its assistance in arranging a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians, with the help of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP). Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had earlier confirmed that Imran underwent a “20-minute” medical procedure for an eye ailment on the night of January 24 at Pims in Islamabad. “It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes. During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions and follow-up advice and documents,” said Sikander. The doctor said the former premier, aged 74, complained of “reduced vision in his right eye”, adding that a “qualified ophthalmologist” from the hospital conducted a “complete eye assessment at Adiala jail”. Sikander elaborated that the doctor dispatched to the prison conducted “strict lab examination, [ocular] endoscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, essential laboratory tests and OCT of the retina”. He added that based on the initial assessment, the diagnosis of right central vein occlusion was made and a hospital-based treatment was recommended. “Accordingly, Mr Niazi was brought to Pims on the night of last Saturday, Sunday for the advised procedure.” The head of the hospital said Imran, after arrival at Pims, was “explained in full” about the procedure. “Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure. The procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocol and monitoring,” said Dr Sikander. Imran’s eye condition and ‘secret transfer’ to Pims On January 28, the PTI had raised concerns about Imran’s health, saying it had learned through credible reports that he had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, which could cause permanent eyesight damage if not treated promptly. The party had alleged that the jail administration was insisting that the treatment be provided inside the prison, contrary to a medical expert’s advice to take him to a hospital. The next day, a report , quoting a senior doctor at Pims, said Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on the night of January 24 for a medical procedure, which was “completed when the time reached in the A.M.”. The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims. On Thursday, the information minister confirmed that the PTI founder underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment at Pims on the night of January 24. He said it was a “20-minute” procedure and that the ex-premier was “absolutely healthy”. Subsequently, the PTI condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians. The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also termed Imran’s transfer to the hospital without the knowledge of his family and personal physicians a “criminal negligence”. Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who had earlier raised doubts about his brother’s ailment, reiterated concerns that his family and lawyers were not being kept informed and demanded that his medical reports be made public. Then on Friday, the PTI staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court, following which it said the ex-premier’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.",

The State Department said it green-lighted a $3.8-billion sale of 30 Apache attack helicopters to Israel, which has agreed to a fragile ceasefire in Gaza. “The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,” the State Department said in a statement. “This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” it said. Also in the package was a $1.8 billion sale of joint light tactical vehicles. The United States sends billions of dollars worth of military supplies per year to Israel, largely in aid rather than sales. Israel and Hamas reached a US-backed ceasefire in October that largely paused two years of war. Tensions are high elsewhere in the region as the United States deploys a major military contingent in waters near Iran. The State Department also approved a $9-billion sale to Saudi Arabia for 730 Patriot missiles, which are used to defend against incoming attacks. Israel last year carried out a major bombing campaign against nuclear and other military sites in Iran. Iran has faced growing pressure after major protests against the clerical state, which has responded by killing thousands of protesters. Saudi Arabia has voiced caution about an attack on Iran as Gulf monarchies fear instability that could jeopardise their reputation as business havens. The Trump administration has said that the Gaza ceasefire is now in its second phase, with a focus on disarming Hamas. Earlier in November, US President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia was being designated as a “ major, non-Nato ally ”. The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments. The White House also announced the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Kingdom, however, the jets will be less advanced than those operated by Israel, in line with a US law that guarantees Israel’s military edge in the region.",
