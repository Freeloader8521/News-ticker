      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Wednesday blamed statements by the PTI-led provincial government for the recent evacuation of residents from Tirah Valley in Khyber district. The federal and provincial governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists. Speaking to reporters in Khyber’s Bara tehsil — where families displaced from Tirah have arrived — Kundi noted that while there is usually around 20 per cent “migration” during winters, it was 50 to 60pc this year. “It is 50 to 60pc this time because statements were repeatedly made that perhaps an operation will be conducted in Tirah, so people vacated.” “In my opinion, people are suffering today due to the failure and weakness of our province’s government.” The governor noted that the KP government issued a “barrage of statements and compelled these people to leave the area,” adding that the residents realised the situation was different when they reached Bara. He noted that, usually, people do not live in “tent villages” after evacuating during winters, but stay in the homes of host families. Kundi stressed that whenever a military operation is planned, official statements are issued and necessary preparations are made. KP Opposition Leader Ibadullah Khan, who belongs to the PML-N, also accompanied the governor on his visit to Bara. Speaking to reporters alongside Kundi, Ibadullah said their Bara visit aimed to meet the people who had come from Tirah and “see the ground situation” and the issues faced by the area residents. “This is our duty, these are our people,” he said. “Unfortunately, the person who has government in this province is playing politics on everything,” the PML-N MPA said, referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. He stressed that “certain topics” should not be politicised. ‘Come, let’s sit with Centre’ Kundi also extended an offer to CM Afridi for dialogue with the federal government to resolve various issues. Noting that the PPP was an ally of the PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre, Kundi said: “Therefore, we have always suggested to them that if they have any issue with the Centre, they should make a committee or a jirga and we are ready to accompany you.” The governor lamented that the PTI was willing to “hold jirgas with militants but was not ready to convene a jirga or sit with Punjab or the Centre”. “They are ready to work with the country’s enemies but not those who work for the country’s stability. “[…] If there is anything under the Centre’s responsibility, we are ready to play our role, but the provincial government should bring forth its case.” The governor noted that the law and order situation in Dera Ismail Khan, as well as the southern and merged districts of KP, was “not that good,” adding that security personnel and residents were making sacrifices. “Come, let’s sit with Centre, with security agencies to bring peace in the province, as well as development and prosperity,” the governor reiterated. Noting that the KP CM hailed from the merged districts, the governor said he should “provide a solution for the injustices that he says people there have faced in the past”. “I will again ask my province’s government to come to its senses. Leave aside Qaidi No.804 — he will come out of jail after facing punishment for his acts.” Kundi went on to quip that the PTI had the option to “form two parties”, one for its “ Tehreek-i-Intishaar ” (incitement movement) and the other to run KP. He also noted CM Afridi’s frequent visits outside KP, including to Rawalpindi , Lahore and Karachi . “If you have a mandate — however you got it — you should work for your province’s development,” the governor said, adding that people often requested facilitation for their medical treatment in Sindh and other places. He noted that Ibadullah and other opposition lawmakers informed CM Afridi of various issues “daily, but he remains unmoved”. Kundi asked the chief minister to fix KP’s governance and take steps for peace in the province. PTI concocting narrative to hide its corruption in Tirah funds: Tallal Chaudhry Separately, in a televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry claimed that the PTI-led KP government was concocting a narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation. “The army’s name is being taken to hide their performance, incompetence, lack of capibility and their corruption in the Rs4bn dedicated for Tirah Valley,” Chaudhry said. Echoing the Centre’s clarifications issued in the past few days, the state minister asserted that no document or notification issued in the matter mentioned the federal government or the armed forces. “As soon as ppl were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they (KP govt) were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it.” Chaudhry asserted: “Whenever an operation would be planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard. “Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.” However, the interior official added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP) . Highlighting that the current NAP was revised in 2021 under the PTI government, Chaudhry said the KP government was “fully a part of it”. “Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted. The PML-N leader remarked the “issue is that they want to do it but they are scared”. “You want to do it and even attempt to, are fully onboard the National Action Plan, but are also scared and hide.” The state minister contended that the KP government was “concocting a narrative based on lies” to create a political narrative, collect votes, hide its corruption and divert attention from its performance. Noting that Rs14bn were recovered from a “truck driver’s account” in the Kohistan graft case, Chaudhry alleged there was a “similar scandal in Tirah” involving the Rs4bn allocated. More to follow",

      "summary_orig": "Seconds after an attacker sprayed US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar with an unidentified liquid at a Minnesota meeting, she confronted the man and then defiantly went on to finish her comments, AFP journalists saw. The Somali-born US lawmaker, a constant target of US President Donald Trump’s attacks, had just called for the president’s homeland security chief to resign in the wake of immigration agents killing two US citizens in a matter of weeks. The attacker, identified by police as 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak, managed to spray Omar before he was tackled and removed from the Tuesday meeting in Minneapolis. She was unharmed, police said. Yet before he was even grabbed, Omar stepped rapidly toward the attacker with her fist raised. The lawmaker then went on to urge the crowd to settle down and listen to herremarks. “Here is the reality that people like this ugly man don’t understand — we are Minnesota strong and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us,” Omar said to the meeting of constituents. Authorities have not reported what may have motivated the attacker, but the incident comes as Minneapolis is in a running confrontation with Trump’s aggressive deportation campaign . Ahead of the incident, Omar’s constituents raised issues with her as eclectic as trash collections and the plight of North Minneapolis, alongside fears over the sweeping immigration operations that have sparked large protests . Just as she called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the attacker jumped to his feet from the front row of seats in the meeting room. He then appeared to spray the contents of his syringe, prompting complaints about a foul smell, AFP correspondents witnessed. Two men quickly tackled the assailant, sparking calls of “Nazis out” as he was led from the room. Stunned onlookers gasped and recoiled as the drama unfolded against an already tense backdrop in Minnesota as its targeted by Trump’s immigration operation. Omar has accused Trump of turning Minneapolis into a “war zone”, while he has accused her of corruption without evidence. ‘Not about him’ “It’s not about him, Ilhan,” said one bystander, seeking to encourage Omar, an outspoken Trump critic, to continue. Undeterred, Omar proclaimed, “Please don’t let them have the show.” The suspect was arrested on suspicion of third-degree assault, according to police. An investigation was underway. One witness said they asked themselves, “Is this really happening?” “He could have done something else,” he told AFP . Questions will be asked about security arrangements at the event with members of the public checked by staff, but members of the press allowed in without scrutiny. After the event, Omar, the first Somali-American representative, posted on X, “I’m OK.” “I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from doing my work,” she wrote.",

      "summary_orig": "Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran, state news agency SPA reported on Tuesday. In a phone call with Pezeshkian, the crown prince affirmed his country’s support for any “efforts that would resolve differences through dialogue” to bolster security and stability in the region. Earlier, Iranian media reported that Pezeshkian told bin Salman that Tehran welcomes any process , within the framework of international law, that prevents war. The statement by the Saudi de facto ruler follows a similar statement by the United Arab Emirates that it would not allow any military action against Iran using its airspace or territorial waters. Uncertainty over the possibility of military action in Iran has lingered after US President Donald Trump said last week that an “armada” was heading toward the country but that he hoped he would not have to use it. Trump said on Tuesday another US “armada” was floating towards Iran and he hoped that Tehran would make a deal with Washington. “There is another beautiful armada floating beautifully towards Iran right now,” Trump said in a speech. “I hope they make a deal.” Trump’s warnings to Tehran were against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme, but the countrywide demonstrations have since abated. A US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East, two US officials told Reuters on Monday, expanding Trump’s capabilities to defend US forces, or potentially take military action against Iran. Iran has been embroiled in protests during which rights groups say security forces killed thousands of people, including bystanders. The rights groups describe the unrest as the biggest crackdown since the Iranian leadership took power in the 1979 revolution .

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: Even though the federal and provincial governments are locked in a blame game over displacement from the restive Tirah valley, officials estimate that around 80-85pc of all residents have been evacuated so far. Inclement weather continues to hold up the evacuation process, which has been temporarily halted. Those who had already left their homes and became stranded due to snow storms have also finally reached Bara after two days of hectic rescue operations. Heavy snowfall and the slow pace of registration at multiple locations along the 110-kilometre road from Tirah to Bara has multiplied the miseries of displaced families, with most spending sleepless nights on the road in severe cold. District administration officials told Dawn that though the exact number of families who arrived in Bara was not yet known, but by Tuesday, they estimated that only around 15pc were yet to be evacuated. Evacuation process still on hold amid inclement weather; authorities increase number of registration centres at Bara to facilitate the displaced They said the final date for evacuation had been extended after heavy snowfall and the remaining families were told to stay back till weather improves, though no exact completion date was given. Officials explained that the relaxation was given in light of weather-related hurdles, as it was imperative to give the Tirah people some ‘space’ prior to the restart of their final evacuation after an improvement in weather condition. Dawn has also learnt that families still stranded in their homes due to the suspension of the evacuation process are facing an acute shortage of edibles, as authorities were not allowing anyone into the valley. In Bara, local tribal elders, former parliamentarians and political party representatives blamed both governments for forcing families to vacate their houses to pave the way for yet another military operation. Demanding an immediate halt to the ongoing ‘inhuman’ treatment’ of displaced families, Hamidullah Jan Afridi, a former MNA, sought transparency in the registration process, and called for honouring all commitments made with the 24-member jirga of Tirah elders prior to the start of displacement. He also demanded stopping of political interference in the registration process and due compensation against all losses the people of Tirah had incurred during their displacement. Hashim Khan Afridi, president of the Bara Siyasi Ittehad, insisted the decision about the military operation and ‘forced displacement’ was jointly taken by federal and KP governments after holding a series of consultations with local tribal elders. He also demanded an open audit of all funds released in the name of Tirah IDPs and sharing required data with people of both Tirah and Bara. Registration process The district administration has also increased the number of registration centers in Bara to expedite the process and make it more transparent. Officials said that alongside the Paindi Cheena centre, four new centres had been made operational in Alamgudar, Bar Qambarkhel, Malakdin Khel and Qambarabad localities of Bara. They said that separate desks for female registration were established at all centres, as many displaced families had complained that the women had to be herded into the same centres as men, which they considered against their culture and traditions. Officials said that along with district administration officials, local tribal elders, bank staff and staff of a mobile phone company were deputed at all centres for instant verification and issuance of SIM cards to Tirah families. They said previous polio vaccination records would also be used for verification of genuine IDPs with timely provision of basic necessities. Sources in Bara informed that a majority of newly arrived families from Tirah were staying with relatives in different parts of Bara, with some having second homes while a limited number went to Peshawar suburbs where they own houses. Authorities also started registration of hundreds of Zakhakhel families at Paindi Cheena after reaching understanding with Nadra staff. The Zakhakhel families were earlier denied registration on the pretext they had acquired CNICs from Landi Kotal tehsil and are not actual residents of Tirah. Published in Dawn, January 28th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Achakzai keeps mum, Gohar says parliamentary party to make decision • Dogar ties all decisions to meeting with Imran • Analysts believe PTI founder may decide the matter after Feb 8 protest ISLAMABAD: Days after the appointment of leader of the opposition in both the Senate and the National Assembly , the main opposition party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), is seriously considering rejoining the standing committees of parliament, a move that remains contingent on the consent of its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan. A majority of PTI leaders are said to be keen to regain the chairmanship of standing committees, particularly the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), in order to “resist” what they describe as controversial decisions and policies of the government. As the final decision to rejoin the committees rests with Mr Khan, political analysts believe he is likely to decide on the matter after the PTI’s countrywide protest scheduled for Feb 8. PTI previously held the chairmanship of more than a dozen standing committees in the National Assembly and five in the Senate, besides participating in several others. However, on the directives of its founder, the party withdrew from all standing committees in both houses of parliament in August last year. It has been learnt that a majority of PTI legislators now believe the party should not have exited the standing committees, as doing so allowed the government to function without effective parliamentary scrutiny. They believe Mr Khan’s decision ceded crucial ground to the ruling coalition. Talking to Dawn , a senior PTI leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said many key party decisions were pending and linked to a meeting between the jailed PTI founder, party legislators and his sisters. “The government should arrange a meeting between Imran Khan and party legislators so that he can be convinced that we must rejoin the standing committees,” he said. He added that relinquishing the chairmanship of the PAC was not a sagacious decision, as the party had used the forum effectively to expose alleged wrongdoing by the government. The PTI leader said that, besides the PAC, the party should not have vacated three other important committees — finance, law and justice, and human rights. He recalled that when PTI workers and members of the Punjab Assembly were recently maltreated by the police, the matter was taken up by a privilege committee. “On the other hand, PTI parliamentarians are often humiliated and manhandled by the police, but they cannot take such matters to the privilege committees of the Senate and the National Assembly,” he said. All decisions linked to jail meeting PTI Chief Whip Aamir Dogar, while talking to Dawn , agreed that all pending party decisions were linked to a meeting between Imran Khan and party leaders in jail. The newly-appointed leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, Mehmood Achakzai, shortly after his maiden speech in the house, declined to comment on the possibility of PTI’s return to the standing committees. However, PTI acting chairman Barrister Gohar Ali said the decision regarding rejoining the standing committees would be taken by the party’s parliamentary committee. According to observers, Mr Khan’s decision to exit the standing committees mirrored his move in 2022, when he opted to quit parliament following the no-confidence vote instead of positioning PTI as a “heavyweight opposition” after his ouster from power. They believe the decision to withdraw from the committees did not create any vacuum in parliament. The absence of three or four PTI lawmakers from a committee did not affect the quorum, which requires the presence of one-fourth of the total members. Moreover, the departure made little practical difference, as members from the treasury benches replaced PTI representatives. In effect, PTI remained the sole loser in the entire episode. Courage to disagree Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who heads the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat), said PTI leaders were effectively helpless, even if they favoured a return to the committees, as the authority to decide rested solely with Mr Khan. He noted that most PTI leaders lacked the courage to even disagree with Mr Khan’s position as they wished to remain in his good books. Mr Mehboob was of the opinion that Mr Khan would first assess the outcome of PTI’s Feb 8 countrywide protest and then decide on the issue of standing committees. He said democracy required PTI to return to the committees and play an effective role. However, he added, Mr Khan remained the final authority. “A lack of opposition representation in these important committees negatively impacts the quality of parliamentary proceedings,” he said. Calling the situation ironic, the Pildat chief said PTI’s decision to leave all standing committees, including the PAC, echoed its earlier move to quit the National Assembly and relinquish governments in provinces. Meanwhile, a source in the National Assembly Secretariat said NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had advised PTI on several occasions to return to the committees and that any such move by the party would be welcomed by the secretariat.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Australia on Tuesday discussed the possibility of an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) for structured, long-term cooperation in Pakistan’s mining and mineral sector. The IGA between the two sides was proposed by Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik here during his meeting with the new Australian High Commissioner (AHC) to Pakistan, Timothy Kane. It builds on a July 2025 Australian proposal made through former AHC Neil Hawkins for collaboration between Australian universities, mining firms, and Pakistani institutions to provide specialised training programmes in modern mining techniques and services and enhance local expertise and support Pakistan’s mining sector development. An official statement said the new AHC Kane and the petroleum minister discussed avenues for enhanced bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors. The minister welcomed the strong interest of Australian companies in Pakistan’s mining sector and highlighted the country’s immense untapped mineral potential, particularly in the Tethyan Belt. “He proposed the possibility of an IGA between Pakistan and Australia to promote structured and long-term cooperation in the mining sector,” the statement said. Discuss possibility of long-term cooperation agreement to tap country’s vast mineral potential Australia had been operating in Pakistan’s mineral and natural resources sector, almost in all resource-rich regions, including Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, mostly in research and exploration and identified critical reserves in copper, gold, coal, zinc and other precious resources, including oil and gas. Australian BHP Billiton’s joint venture with the Geological Survey of Pakistan had led to the discovery of the multi-billion dollar Reko Diq copper-gold deposits, now being developed for commercial production by Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada. BHP had left Pakistan under its global restructuring almost two decades ago. Mr Malik briefed the new envoy about the government’s efforts to develop and formalise the gemstones sector to unleash its true potential for value addition, exports, and employment generation. The AHC reiterated that Australian companies were already actively involved in the Reko Diq project, and additional Australian firms had shown keen interest in joining the project. He said the Australian companies would be encouraged to participate in the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum (PMIF), expressing hope for a strong Australian presence at the event. The diplomat highlighted the growing global importance of copper and gold for the energy transition, adding that Pakistan’s mining sector had attracted significant international attention. He also expressed “optimism for collaboration in the gemstones sector through knowledge exchange, training, and technical assistance”, the statement said. The two sides also discussed the recent visit of the petroleum minister to Australia for the International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC) and the fruitful discussions with leading and junior Australian mining companies on investment and cooperation opportunities in Pakistan’s minerals sector. The two sides agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the mining and gemstone sectors for mutual benefit. The presence of mineral deposits in the Reko Diq area was identified by the Geological Survey of Pakistan in the early 1990s in collaboration with BHP Billiton of Australia. Later in 2000, Tethyan Corporation (TCC) of Australia took over the project from BHP and invested $30 million by raising funds through an international listing and drilled over 75,000 meters to prove the reserves. The TCC was subsequently taken over by two of the world’s largest copper and gold mining firms — Antofagasta of Chile and Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada for A$158 million ($130m) at the time. The agreement between Pakistan and the two mining firms signed in the Musharraf era ran into trouble, leading to international arbitration followed by an out-of-court settlement for penalties and project revival. In the process, the Reko Diq project production, due in 2010, was delayed by at least 15 years. It was announced at the time of discovery by GSP and BHP that the Reko Diq mining area had proven estimated reserves of two billion tonnes of copper and 20 million ounces of gold, valued at $65bn at the time. The recent feasibility studies completed by Barrick have also established that the project would have a 45 million tonnes of throughput per annum (Mpta) for the first five years and then 90 Mpta for the following 32 years of the second phase. Based on existing reserves, the Reko Diq project is expected to yield production of 13.1m tonnes of copper and 17.9m ounces of gold over the life of the mine (100pc basis), according to state-run Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL), one of the shareholders. The feasibility study has also confirmed a lucrative 25pc rate of return on investment on one of the biggest copper-gold projects. Under the updated feasibility study, Phase 1 is planned to process 45m tonnes of mill-feed annually (Mtpa) from 2028. Previously, it was estimated to be close to 40m tonnes. By 2034, Phase 2 is planned to double the processing capacity to 90Mtpa. Published in Dawn, January 28th, 2026",

The feasibility study has also confirmed a lucrative 25pc rate of return on investment on one of the biggest copper-gold projects. Under the updated feasibility study, Phase 1 is planned to process 45m tonnes of mill-feed annually (Mtpa) from 2028. Previously, it was estimated to be close to 40m tonnes. By 2034, Phase 2 is planned to double the processing capacity to 90Mtpa. Published in Dawn, January 28th, 2026",
