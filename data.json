      "summary_orig": "Hunger as policy The death trap It starts with the body eating itself, consuming all the energy stored in its nooks and crannies. Then begins the shedding: weight, hair, skin, muscles, colour, sanity. And finally, when months pass, all that remains are shadows of a self that once was. Slowly, the heart and liver stop functioning, and soon after, death descends. This is the story of two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who have been stripped of food, water, shelter, dignity and a future. It is a story that started well before the onslaught began on Oct 7, 2023, following the Hamas attack on Israel. In the two years since, the Israeli military has pretty much flattened Gaza, killing almost 70,000 people, injuring and maiming thousands of others and displacing hundreds of thousands. But some in Gaza consider the deceased lucky — at least they don’t have to witness their loved ones slowly starve to death. While the signs started showing way back, officially, a famine was declared in the enclave on August 22 this year. According to the Integrated Security Phase Classification (IPC) — a standardised global system for analysing and classifying the severity of acute and chronic food insecurity and acute malnutrition — more than half a million Palestinians are trapped, starving to death, in the Strip. Palestinian mother Amira Muteir holds her five-month-old baby Ammar, whom she says is wasting away from malnutrition, in Gaza City, August 5, 2025. — Reuters The declaration was news, but no surprise. For the past two years, the world has witnessed in real time this famine unfold on their mobile and television screens. International human rights bodies had been warning of it for months; resolutions were passed , letters were written , and condemnations were issued. Yet, as hundreds of desperate Palestinians starved to death, the world looked on — some with agonising helplessness, others out of brutal indifference. As of October 1, at least 455 Palestinians have died of starvation. While most of these deaths are among children and infants, older people are increasingly succumbing to the hunger that Israel has imposed on Gaza. Aid agencies have warned that the meagre amount of aid Tel Aviv is allowing into the enclave will only worsen conditions in the Strip. “People are literally falling dead from hunger in the streets,” said Hany Abufayez, a writer based in Gaza who specialises in social and political issues. Once a successful businessman, the father of six — four boys and two girls — lost everything in the war. His only asset now is his family; their safety is his top priority. Under international law, access to food is a “fundamental human right”. But in Gaza, this right has become a choice: death by starvation or death by bombs. “Either we die of hunger in the tents or risk going out in search of food amid killings, bombings and sniper fire,” said Abyfayez. His nephew, Fayez Jamal Abu Akar, paid the price: “he went out to fetch food. He was shot in the head, abdomen and leg.” Stages of starvation By definition, starvation is suffering or death caused by the lack of food. It occurs over three stages: the first starts as early as a skipped meal, the second comes with a prolonged period of fasting when the body relies on stored fats for energy, and the third and fatal stage is when these fat reserves are depleted. The body consequently turns to bones and muscles for energy. Displaced Palestinian mother Samah Matar holds her malnourished son, Ameer, who suffers from cerebral palsy, as her other son Youssef, also malnourished and suffering from cerebral palsy, lies on a mattress at a school in Gaza City. — Reuters “Starvation is one of the most barbaric ways to kill someone,” said Dr Fyeza Jehan, professor and chairperson of the Department of Paediatrics & Child Health at the Aga Khan University in Karachi. “It is not sudden … it is prolonged, you are constantly conscious of it, and it is intended to maximise suffering.” Chronic starvation, the doctor explained, is like the body cannibalising itself. Without access to food, the stomach contracts, leading to severe hunger pangs that occur as the body utilises all of its glycogen stores — the stored form of glucose, primarily located in the liver and skeletal muscles. In adults, the process can last 48 hours, while in children, it is accelerated and can last up to a day. After two to three days without food, the hunger vanishes, leaving the body behind in what is called the survival mode, and as it happens, the body goes frigid. “It feels like there is no life left in you,” Dr Fyeza said. In a child, this can manifest as a boy or a girl with dull eyes who doesn’t play or talk anymore. For toddlers or infants, their cries dim or just stop altogether. When weeks pass, these effects worsen in the form of lost weight, thin skin, shrinking muscles, hallucinations and a weak immune system in adults. In these circumstances, even a common cold can lead to severe infections. In children, prolonged starvation eats up all the fat and protein in their bodies, leaving them with oedema — swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body’s tissues, often affecting the legs, ankles, and feet. Physically, the child loses all colour and embodies a shrunken leaf. At this stage, any infection can cause death. For Gaza’s children, the signs Dr Fyeza pointed out fit like a glove. Dr Wesam Amir, a Palestinian medic who left the enclave for safety last year, cannot forget those dull eyes, once sparkling with life and light. “Instead of running around, they now search for a place to lie on; instead of toys, they now ask for bread; many have forgotten what it is like to eat a full meal.” “Their cries echo in my ears even today … and it breaks me every single time,” he sighed. Dr Wesam recalled the wails of an infant in the neighbourhood where he lived. “The mother couldn’t breastfeed … she was malnourished herself. Her baby would cry with hunger for hours, but there was nothing that could be fed, not even formula milk.” As months pass without adequate food, a starving adult may still be able to survive. But they are merely a shadow of their former selves; all that remains are bones and skin. Eventually, the heart and liver begin to fail, and the body’s tissues break down. Death is not far away. Children, on the other hand, rarely ever reach this stage. Their fragile bodies rapidly deteriorate, becoming susceptible to diarrhoea, pneumonia and sepsis. At three weeks, the process of starvation reaches its catastrophic phase, where children get lesions on their eyes and go blind, their hair falls out, and their organs shut down. “Unable to move, speak or cry out, they draw their last breath,” said Rachael Cummings, humanitarian director at Save the Children. She highlighted that data compiled by the organisation for July showed cases of acute malnutrition in children under the age of five at their clinics across Gaza surged tenfold during the four months of total siege. Sham Qadeh, a 22-month-old Palestinian girl suffering from severe malnutrition and an enlarged liver, is pictured with her mom in a makeshift tent on June 28 in Khan Younis, Gaza. — Anadolu Agency Of the 3,533 children screened for malnutrition during the first half of July, 259 were admitted for treatment (7pc) compared to 28 (1pc) in March. The number of children admitted for treatment of malnutrition in the first two weeks of July was close to the total for the whole of June, a trend that is dangerous and unprecedented. “There is a clear correlation here with the start of the total siege at the beginning of March and its knock-on impacts.” When it comes to grown-ups, research suggests that a healthy adult can survive without food for between one to two months. However, there are no healthy adults in Gaza today — two years of aid being blocked intermittently by Israel has deprived them of conditions indispensable for survival, essentially rendering people in the enclave vulnerable to malnutrition and a host of infectious diseases . “Imagine that 99 per cent of people here have not eaten a meal containing meat or eggs in over a year or six months,” Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza, told Dawn.com . His family is very much a part of this percentage. Shama’s son, Mohammed, especially requires the nutrients. He fractured his right leg during the Israeli bombing of the beachfront Al-Baqa cafe in Gaza City on June 30, in which the military used a 500lb bomb — a powerful and indiscriminate weapon that generates a massive blast wave and scatters shrapnel over a wide area. “He needs nutritious foods, like meat and eggs, to recover and walk again,” the father said. “But we struggle to provide him with even basic food. The available food consists mainly of canned goods such as fava and kidney beans, peas, some bread, cheese, and a very limited amount of vegetables,” he rued. But meals in Gaza are no longer about nutrition or flavour; they are now only meant to quell the hunger pangs. Most families survive on one meal a day. As per the recent IPC report, July 2025 was consistent with the exponential rise in acute malnutrition across Gaza. It found that at least 1 in 5 households in the enclave are facing an extreme shortage in their consumption of food, roughly 1 in 3 children or more are acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people are dying daily because of outright starvation or the combination of malnutrition and disease. It further reported that in the Gaza governorate, 15pc of households said they have resorted to scavenging through bins for food, adding that at certain points over the past 23 months, people were forced to eat leaves to survive, or scraps that even rats wouldn’t want to eat. “Breakfast is often a cup of water and, if you are lucky, a piece of stale bread,” described Dr Wesam. “The main meal of the day is usually a thin rice soup made with lots of water and a handful of grains. On other days, it is plain rice with a pinch of salt.” A dish like eggplant stew, he continued, has become a luxury — unseen in months. “My grandmother-in-law has health conditions that require a special diet, but we can’t provide it. She is so frail, yet she often gives a portion of her food to the children, pretending she isn’t hungry,” he added. Psychological toll Beyond the toll and hunger is something grave — it is the erosion of dignity and future potential and the long-term psychological trauma that will haunt generations of Palestinians to come. “There is … a multi-generational societal impact. The trauma, sense of degradation and humiliation that accompany the experience of famine lives on in the memories of people,” said Alex de Waal, one of the world’s leading experts on famine, in an interview with Anadolu Agency , while comparing starvation in Gaza with the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s, which left a lingering silence and chafed pain for over a century. “I fear that in the case of Gaza, this sense of trauma, degradation, humiliation, dehumanisation will mean that this is a wound that … will take generations to heal,” he added. The Palestinian spread, once a symbol of pride for Gaza, was reduced by Israel to stale bread and thin rice soup made of a handful of grains — that too require begging — and dirty water. Some families look at old photos of meals on their phones just to remember what it used to feel like to have a full table and a fuller stomach. “Managing feels too generous. People aren’t managing; they are barely surviving,” said Dr Wesam. And this affects not just their bodies, but also their behaviours, which become contrary to normal survival instincts, both in adults and children. For babies born in Gaza during the last several months, food is a foreign concept, as many of them have never tasted a hearty meal. This doesn’t just impact them but also helpless mothers, who are malnourished themselves. “In Nasser, the hospital corridors are lined with women who have just given birth. In six missions to Gaza, I have never seen it like this — new mothers and vulnerable newborns lying on the floor,” said UNICEF spokesperson James Elder. “Three premature babies share a single oxygen source — each breathing for 20 minutes, before giving way to the next. A premature baby, Nada, who was in intensive care for 21 days, is discharged and now waits outside, lying on the corridor floor with her mother. Nada weighs two kilograms, less than half of what she should weigh,” he added. This hunger, visible across Gaza, is also preventing injured Palestinians from recovering fully, as two years of war and starvation have taken a toll on their immune systems. And contrary to popular belief, refeeding, as Dr Fyeza pointed out, is not the solution. “At this time, even if aid enters Gaza, the damage has already been done,” she lamented. Palestinians in the enclave are now at risk of the refeeding syndrome — a metabolic disturbance which occurs as a result of the reintroduction of nutrition in people who are starved, severely malnourished, or metabolically stressed because of severe illness. If food is introduced too quickly, the doctor explained, it can cause serious complications such as an electrolyte imbalance. This happens because of the ways our bodies change when they are deprived of nutrients. When we begin refeeding, they have to change back, but they may not have the resources they need. “As the body starves, it makes adaptations to maintain life as long as possible. These adaptations mean that if a severely malnourished person suddenly consumes a large amount of food, it may actually kill them,” the IPC report highlighted. Instead, food needs to be introduced gradually and under medical supervision to ensure that this unfortunate consequence does not happen. “Even if the food comes back, all the effects, especially those on children and their brain development, cannot be undone,” Dr Fyeza said. When the body experiences repeated cycles of undernutrition, it causes chronic health problems. In adults, they manifest in the form of heart diseases and diabetes. Yazan, a malnourished 2-year-old, stands in his family’s damaged home in the Al-Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City on July 23. — AFP It is, however, the children who suffer the biggest loss. Those who survive will be more susceptible to anaemia, stunting, and poor immunity. Similarly, babies born to mothers who are malnourished are more likely to be smaller, less healthy, and at higher risk of malnutrition themselves. But most of all, this is an entire generation growing up with less capacity, whether it is physical or cognitive. “The impacts of famine often ripple across generations: children who survive may face lifelong health and developmental challenges, and their own children may inherit increased vulnerability,” said Rachael of Save the Children. “The physical, mental, and social harms of famine are not only devastating in the moment, but they also shape families, communities, and futures for decades.” “Children in Gaza are systematically being starved to death. This is a deliberate policy. This is starvation as a method of war in its starkest terms.” What begins as hunger does not end with it — it seeps into memory, body, even the bloodline. In Gaza, starvation has become a legacy written into the next generation. Hunger as policy “They need to starve […] the moment it becomes hard for them, it will also be hard for Hamas. There is no problem bombing fuel and food reserves,” Israeli Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said , days before a famine was declared in Gaza. Before him, far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also thundered : “Not even a single grain of wheat will enter the Gaza Strip.” “[…] we should bomb all their generators. If our hostages don’t have electricity, let them have no electricity … we need to explain to him [President Trump] that this aid goes to Hamas, and Hamas are Nazis, and they shouldn’t be given a single grain of food. Not only [should we] not give them, but [we should] bomb all of their food reserves,” Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir posted on X on March 3, 2025. It is no longer a secret that Tel Aviv is deliberately starving Palestinians, not just since October 2023, but as a systematic policy for almost two decades now. The question is how. After Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel placed restrictions on everything entering the enclave through crossings controlled by its military. “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” Dov Weisglass, a senior adviser to the then Israeli prime minister had said back then. Henceforth, Israel began to carefully calculate the amount of food Gaza precisely needed, allowing just that into the enclave. According to files released by the defence ministry two years later, the food calculation had applied the average daily requirement of 2,279 calories per person. An average adult needs 2,500kcal a day. Even before October 2023, 1.2 million of Gaza’s 2.2 million population was estimated to be facing acute food insecurity, and over 80pc were reliant on humanitarian aid, the Human Rights Watch noted in a report . Today, Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls aid shipments to Gaza, appears to be following the same policy. The agency’s records show that 319,926 tonnes of aid were allowed into the enclave between March and September, which is insufficient to meet the starving territory’s needs. As per the World Food Programme, Gaza needs more than 62,000 metric tonnes of food every month to cover basic humanitarian needs for its population. Even if every bag of flour or can of beans were handed out equitably, starvation and hunger in Gaza were inevitable. In March and April, after Israel resumed attacks on Gaza following the ceasefire violation, the enclave was under a total siege, with no food allowed to enter. By May, Netanyahu succumbed to growing international pressure and allowed only a trickle of aid to enter the Strip, which didn’t prevent but delayed the famine. Between May and July, a meagre 116,030 tonnes of aid entered Gaza; one-third of the required food never reached the territory. By August, a famine was officially declared. And all of this happened as hundreds of trucks, carrying humanitarian aid sufficient to feed Gaza for three months, waited a few kilometres from the Strip, awaiting Israeli approvals. “Just outside Gaza, in warehouses — and even within the territory itself — tonnes of food, clean water, medical supplies, shelter items and fuel sit untouched with humanitarian organisations blocked from accessing or delivering them,” said Rachael Cummings of Save the Children. “The Government of Israel’s restrictions, delays, and fragmentation under its total siege have created chaos, starvation, and death.” A woman carries empty cardboard boxes as Palestinians receive aid supplies from the US-backed GHF, in the central Gaza Strip, on August 1, 2025 — Reuters Like a hawk eyeing its prey, Israel has exercised complete control over the aid entering Gaza ever since the beginning of its onslaught on the Strip. A recent analysis of food availability, conducted by the IPC, showed that from October 2023 to December 2024, there was a considerable caloric deficit in the enclave, as only 1,640kcals per person were available every day. By May 2025, this number fell to just 1,400 calories or “67pc of what a human body needs to survive”. “Before the war, Gaza was receiving about 500 aid trucks daily,” Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson of the Palestine Red Crescent, told Dawn.com . “But the trucks entering the enclave now are in mere dozens, which does not even scratch the surface of its needs.” “It is a drop in the ocean.” According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, after the resumption of hostilities in March, only 35pc of 1,445 humanitarian missions were facilitated by Israeli authorities, while 810 were impeded or denied. Israel’s recent changes in its policies, requiring all humanitarian trucks to be accompanied by its security escorts, have further impacted humanitarian logistical operations. The lack of escort capacity has already caused suspensions on some humanitarian supply corridors, while previously authorised items such as nutrition, health, hygiene and water treatment aid face longer delays than food items, noted the IPC report. Even if aid trucks do manage to cross the rigidly guarded Gaza border, what they carry is rarely ever sufficient to meet the needs of Palestinians. “The goods that come through the crossing are very limited,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a human rights activist and writer in the enclave. “For example, meat of any kind is not allowed in. The reliance remains on canned foods, legumes and cheese.” “We went through a period where we didn’t have flour or bread … we had to eat rice instead, and we rationed bread carefully to keep some for the next day. At first, breakfast might have been za’atr and olive oil, but even those ran out, so we depended mainly on fava beans,” she recalled. Other times, the trucks are hijacked and looted or seized by criminal groups supported by Israel to break down civil order in the Strip and prevent aid deliveries, Nour added. While Palestinians always knew who funded these gangs, mounting evidence has recently surfaced, laying bare Israel’s glaring role in mobilising criminals in Gaza. On June 5, Netanyahu admitted : “The government has activated powerful local clans in the enclave on the advice of security officials.” Earlier, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that sources in Gaza claimed one such group Bibi referred to consisted of roughly 100 armed men operating with the implicit support of the Israeli military. The New Humanitarian, a not-for-profit newsroom, described the gangs as “big and very dangerous”. They are especially located in areas where aid is entering or being distributed. “They loot UN trucks, selling the goods at inflated rates — or sometimes the food just disappears altogether … they also steal food directly from other people who risk their lives to get aid from distribution centres.” What these gangs steal is sold into the market at exorbitant rates; sugar now costs 300 times more than it did before the war, same is the case with flour and beans. As per the IPC report released in August, July food prices in Gaza increased by 25pc to as much as 9,900pc compared to the February ceasefire levels, and by 233pc to 15,285pc compared to the pre-war prices. The highest fluctuations were seen in wheat flour — which has become both a bane and boon for Palestinians — up to $30 in June and coming back down to around $15 in July. A displaced Palestinian woman cooks amid ongoing food shortages in Gaza on July 28. — Reuters Qusay Qasem, 22, is among the thousands of Palestinians for whom fetching bread has become a fatal exercise. A resident of North Gaza, which has been declared a combat zone, he has to risk his life every day to secure a piece of bread. But the markets, now merely a remnant of what they used to be before the war, are nearly inaccessible. The IPC has found that Palestinians face extreme challenges reaching markets across the Strip, with 82pc of households in Deir al-Balah Governorate, 76pc in Khan Younis Governorate, 72pc in Gaza Governorate and 66pc in North Gaza Governorate unable to reach markets. “Instead, I head to aid distribution centres, where bullets pour down on us,” Qasem told Dawn.com . “I have escaped death several times. Yet, I return alive each time because I know my family is waiting for that one sack of flour, that one loaf of bread.” Bakeries, previously a reliable source of food — particularly bread — for a majority of Palestinians like Qasem, have remained closed since April 2025. Most of them have been bombed, and the undamaged ones are out of reach. Of the 29 bakeries in Gaza, 13 are now in evacuation and militarised zones, while none of the previous bakeries in North Gaza, Rafah, and Khan Younis are accessible due to the movement restrictions imposed by Israel. Before the war, many Gazans relied on the enclave’s fertile lands for sustenance and livelihood. But two exhausting years of Israeli aggression have snatched that. All that remains is rubble, dust and despair. According to an assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, Gaza’s agrifood system faces a near-total collapse. About 86pc of cropland has been damaged, with over 91pc land inaccessible to farmers and only 1.5pc of arable land in use. Agriculture previously supplied most of the Strip’s fresh vegetables, eggs and milk. In fact, some of its top exports included strawberries, dates, olives, and flowers. A similar situation persists with livestock, most of which have been killed; only 26pc of sheep and 34pc of goats remain, ceasing the commercial production of poultry, cattle and dairy. With the Israeli ban on access to the sea — the beach that was once a source of solace, laughter and barbeques — over 72pc of fishing assets, including boats, aquaculture, farms and cold storage have been destroyed. With its 24-month-long aggression in Gaza, Israel has systematically robbed the enclave of its ability to feed itself, forcing Palestinians to now depend almost entirely on irregular food aid and imports. This is not just an erasure of life, but also dignity. And the FAO agrees, explicitly describing Gaza’s crisis as an “entirely man-made catastrophe, driven by access restrictions and bombardment rather than natural causes”. Families like that of Nour, who still have some financial stability enabling to purchase food, also face massive hindrances in terms of preparation because of the complete lack of fuel and gas — the latter hasn’t entered the enclave since February 2025. As a result, Gazans must now rely on burning rubbish to light their stoves. “Staple foods such as lentils and wheat flour, if poorly cooked, are not well digested by the body, reducing its ability to fully absorb and use the nutrients,” the FAO told Dawn.com . Thus, even for households that can sporadically access food, they often lack the means to safely prepare it. In addition to this, the IPC report highlighted that basic cooking implements continue to be in short supply due to the constant displacement of populations. Nearly 800,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the end of the ceasefire on March 18, with almost 350,000 since the escalation of May 15 alone. Most of the population has been displaced multiple times across Gaza Governorate, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. Across these governorates, around 20pc or more of the population has been displaced three to six times, with at least 4pc across all three areas displaced seven or more times. Map by OCHA, October 1, 2025 Continued and frequent displacement erodes household capacity to cope as essential assets such as shelter materials, storage items, water, and food may be lost along the journey, especially given the limited notice that people have to evacuate or relocate from approaching hostilities, the report noted. Before the war, Hani Abufayez was recognised across Gaza as a successful businessman. He ran a consulting office and lived in a villa with his family of eight. Today, he lives in a tent after being displaced not once but at least thrice. “I survive on very little money … my fears grow with each passing day. I fear my family and I could be killed at any moment, or die of hunger.” “The reality is that Israel has turned Gaza into a death zone where there is no place for life anymore.” It didn’t just rain down bombs on the enclave, but also ran a planned campaign there, using “food and aid as a weapon to humiliate, weaken, displace and kill Palestinians”. Systems breakdown The dismantling of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees was a part of this campaign. For decades, Palestinians have relied on the organisation for aid. “It is the only agency with real experience in humanitarian relief,” said Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza. “I am considered a part of the third generation of the Nakba of 1948. I completed my primary and preparatory education in UNRWA schools. I grew up witnessing the agency providing its services to refugees in various fields. I completed my studies, and throughout my long career in the field of human rights, there was continuous coordination between us and UNRWA,” he reminisced. The UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly on December 8, 1949, to provide basic support, including food, healthcare and education to Palestinian refugees, who were displaced during the Nakba. It supports about six million Palestinian refugees, residing both within and outside Palestine, and provides direct services such as schools, health centres and other social services. Before Israel launched its offensive in Gaza, about a million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were sheltering in UNRWA schools, clinics and other buildings run by the agency. Meanwhile, nearly the entire population of the Strip relied on it for basic necessities, including food, water and hygiene. “It was our lifeline, both before the war and especially after Oct 7, 2023,” emphasised Shama. But just the way it did with everything else, Israel deprived Palestinians of this support as well. On January 30, Tel Aviv banned the UNRWA, months after the Israeli parliament passed two bills : one, barring the agency from activity within Israel and the second banning Israeli authorities from any contact with it, essentially breaking a 1967 treaty that allowed the agency to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control. The action was taken after Israel accused 18 UNRWA employees of participating in the Oct 7 attack on Israel. Subsequently, a probe was launched by the UN, which found that nine workers of the agency “may have” been involved in the attack and no longer work for it. But UNRWA has maintained that Israel never presented any evidence supporting its allegations, adding that it regularly provided Tel Aviv with a full list of its staff members. The agency has also accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, pressurising them into making false confessions about ties with Hamas. But Netanyahu and his government were adamant on dismantling UNRWA, something they have been advocating for a long time. Israel claims that the UN body “perpetuated” the issue of Palestinian refugees because it allows Palestinians to transfer refugee status across generations, which Tel Aviv refuses to accept. It is also not a mere coincidence that Israel’s allegations came the same day the International Court of Justice ordered it to prevent genocidal acts and scale up aid to Gaza. Soon after the Israeli allegations were aired, the US became the first country to announce the suspension of funding to the agency. Canada, Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, Japan, Austria and Romania soon followed. What happened next looks like this: Israel made UNRWA vacate all premises in occupied East Jerusalem, cease its operations by Jan 30, and cut short the validity of all visas for UNRWA’s international staff. Basically, the agency was evicted . “Stopping the UNRWA’s work and placing obstacles in the way of its continued presence in Palestine — especially in Gaza — is effectively a death sentence for large numbers of refugees who have lost everything, including the ability to secure food,” said Shama. A month later, in February 2025, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — backed by the very powers accused of engineering the starvation — was born. It promised relief. What it delivered, many in Gaza say, was something else entirely. The death trap Dr Sami Alastal, a writer and political analyst based in Gaza, has lost 20 kilos since October 7, 2023. “We do not have any food, and if it is available, it is in very small quantities,” he rued. Yet, he refuses to visit the GHF aid distribution centres. “It is a scam,” he said. “It is a killing and torture squad disguised as a humanitarian organisation.” Dr Sami’s sentiments were echoed by a majority of Palestinians Dawn.com spoke to, who, despite the catastrophic levels of starvation and hunger in the enclave, refuse to visit the GHF-run stations. They see the distribution process as “humiliating to our humanity and dignity”. “We live near the Netzarim area, from where we see people heading to aid distribution sites,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a Palestinian human rights activist. “The process of entry and aid distribution is manipulated by the [Israeli] occupation to create chaos, and so for us it is unacceptable.” She shared how these aid distribution sites were located in areas described as “execution grounds” for civilians. “I heard about the crimes in Netzarim on television, watched them unfold from my house, but never went there myself.” Qusay Qasem, who has no choice but to visit the GHF centres, calls them traps. “It is akin to walking into your death … at any time, the Israeli military starts indiscriminately firing at us, there are bullets everywhere,” he recalled. “I have seen fellow aid seekers fall dead or wounded as I duck to the ground.” But even as bullets rain down on him, the 22-year-old Palestinian strives to reach the gates of the centre, his family’s shrunken faces flashing before his eyes. “I have to do it; they wait for a single piece of bread all day.” A displaced Palestinian girl takes a sip of lentil soup that she received at a food distribution point in Gaza City on July 25. — AFP This is exactly how Israel plays its game — it’s either death from guns or death from hunger. Here is how it is done: The journey begins hours before the aid site is set to open, often in early morning hours. The aid seekers are only allowed to bring their vehicles up to a certain point, which is at least 1.5km (a 12-20 minute walk) from the centre, and then cover the remaining distance on foot. This means that once — and if — they manage to secure sacks or boxes of aid, it must be carried back on foot. As the crowd keeps getting bigger, everyone is glued to their spots — unflinching for fear of losing out — waiting for the go-ahead signal, usually the buzz of drones. As soon as the signal rings through the now flattened Gaza, the walk begins, and, with that, the fear of death fills the air. “These centres are heavily guarded by the Israeli military, who encircle them with sniper nests, tanks and drones,” said Khalil Abu Shama. “The Israeli military monitors the movement of the crowd, sometimes opening fire even before the go-ahead signal.” “Every day between 10 and 50 civilians are killed without any clear explanation as to why, except that the occupation wants to slaughter as many people as possible in Gaza,” he added. On July 19, Israel killed at least 32 Gazans seeking aid near Rafah. According to an eyewitness, the shooting took place near a GHF aid distribution centre, adding that gunfire erupted from soldiers and tanks “as if they were in a battle with us”. Doctors who treated the wounded said they had severe gunshot wounds to the head and torso. The Israeli military, on the other hand, failed to provide any reason for the live fire. This is not something new for the Israeli military. They have been targeting aid coming into Gaza since the first month of the war. From October 2023 to 2024, Forensic Architecture has documented more than 322 attacks on aid, including workers and civilians, as well as 22 attacks on convoys transporting aid. Separately, during March and August this year, 64 incidents of the Israeli army opening fire on aid seekers were reported, of which 25 were around GHF centres, 19 in proximity to aid routes and seven during aid diversion. The vast majority of these shootings weren’t merely a mistake or misunderstanding. A report by Israeli newspaper Haaretz found that Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at unarmed Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza after being “ordered” to do so by their commanders. “We fire machine guns from tanks and throw grenades,” it quoted one soldier as saying. Another soldier said that between “one and five people were killed every day” where he was stationed in Gaza. “It’s a killing field,” he added. One of the authors of the Haaretz report, in an interview with Al Jazeera , said that the Israeli military’s orders to open fire on civilians were part of a method to “control” the aid seekers. “It’s actually a practice of … controlling the crowd by fire, like if you wanted the crowd to run off [from] a place, you shoot them at them, even though you know they are unarmed … You use fire to move people from one point to another,” Nir Hasson said. It almost translates to making Palestinians move to the tune of Israeli gunshots — not just a violation of their humanity but also of their dignity. “It is deliberate … Israel uses food as a tool of pressure,” Nour, the Palestinian human rights activist, pointed out. Meanwhile, Dr Alastal said: “Israel is using the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to establish a military model of aid distribution wherein food is used as a weapon of war.” The same was also highlighted in the Forensic Architecture report. It explained how, for years, aid in Gaza was distributed through experienced humanitarian organisations such as the UNRWA, equipped to meet the needs of the enclave’s population. But after the war, just like every living thing in the Gaza Strip, these agencies too came under attack. Between March 2 and May 29, 2025, no aid was allowed to enter Gaza. During this period, Israel attacked aid warehouses and community kitchens, exacerbating the conditions of starvation. When aid trucks were finally permitted to re-enter Gaza at the end of May, ending the nearly three-month blockade, efforts to deliver supplies to warehouses faced significant challenges. To make matters worse, Cogat announced in July that Israel will gradually permit the entry of goods into the Strip under a new “private commercial sector” mechanism, in a bid to “increase the volume” of aid, while reducing reliance on aid collection by the UN and other international organisations. Palestinians gather for aid in Beit Lahia, Gaza, on June 17. — Reuters Simply put, Israel wanted complete control over the enclave. And this is how it was able to weaponise food distribution, ergo: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Per the FA’s findings, the previous UN-led distribution network in Gaza operated nearly 400 sites, whereas the GHF has only four of what it calls “mega sites”, a majority of which are located in the south, which the UN says is an attempt to relocate Palestinians from the north and depopulate it. “The military model dismantles the social fabric. In restricting the reach of any form of aid administration to the confines of the four ration stations, this model designates the remainder of the territory as something akin to a governance wilderness. “In this ungoverned territory, Israel promotes the lawlessness of criminal gangs and proxy forces. The attacks on aid workers, health workers, and community leaders are part of this,” the report noted. A method of war In this war, hunger is not incidental — and aid, under the GHF, is not compassionate. A report by the Jewish Voice for Peace lays it bare: from day one, GHF aid sites became kill-zones; “shoot at the crowds to communicate” were the instructions; distribution was concentrated in militarised zones and managed under Israeli oversight. This is aid designed to humiliate, corral, and control. And so we arrive at the darkest logic: to deliver bread is to own life. Gaza’s hunger cannot be undone by more trucks or rations — it must be undone by undoing the system that made hunger the weapon in the first place. Palestinians wait for food that was distributed by a charity organization in Gaza City on July 25. — Aandolu Agency Starvation in Gaza is not a byproduct of war — it is the method. This isn’t just the story of the last two years — the policy and actions go back two decades. What began as a blockade of goods has become a blockade of existence. Israel has built a system where food is not distributed but dispensed; where hunger is not a crisis to be solved but a condition to be managed. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the clearest example of this — aid designed not to relieve suffering but to regulate it. Every grain of wheat, every loaf of bread, is counted, rationed, and handed out under watchtowers and rifles. And still, the Palestinians resist. They refuse to let the act of eating become a performance of gratitude. In their hunger, they assert the one thing Israel cannot occupy — their humanity. In Gaza today, starvation has a geography, a policy, and an administration. It has checkpoints and drones, and waiting lines. It has signatures and seals. And that is the real tragedy — that the world has watched hunger become a bureaucracy. History will remember this war not just for the bombs that fell, but for the bread that didn’t.",

      "summary_en": "Hunger as policy The death trap It starts with the body eating itself, consuming all the energy stored in its nooks and crannies. Then begins the shedding: weight, hair, skin, muscles, colour, sanity. And finally, when months pass, all that remains are shadows of a self that once was. Slowly, the heart and liver stop functioning, and soon after, death descends. This is the story of two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who have been stripped of food, water, shelter, dignity and a future. It is a story that started well before the onslaught began on Oct 7, 2023, following the Hamas attack on Israel. In the two years since, the Israeli military has pretty much flattened Gaza, killing almost 70,000 people, injuring and maiming thousands of others and displacing hundreds of thousands. But some in Gaza consider the deceased lucky — at least they don’t have to witness their loved ones slowly starve to death. While the signs started showing way back, officially, a famine was declared in the enclave on August 22 this year. According to the Integrated Security Phase Classification (IPC) — a standardised global system for analysing and classifying the severity of acute and chronic food insecurity and acute malnutrition — more than half a million Palestinians are trapped, starving to death, in the Strip. Palestinian mother Amira Muteir holds her five-month-old baby Ammar, whom she says is wasting away from malnutrition, in Gaza City, August 5, 2025. — Reuters The declaration was news, but no surprise. For the past two years, the world has witnessed in real time this famine unfold on their mobile and television screens. International human rights bodies had been warning of it for months; resolutions were passed , letters were written , and condemnations were issued. Yet, as hundreds of desperate Palestinians starved to death, the world looked on — some with agonising helplessness, others out of brutal indifference. As of October 1, at least 455 Palestinians have died of starvation. While most of these deaths are among children and infants, older people are increasingly succumbing to the hunger that Israel has imposed on Gaza. Aid agencies have warned that the meagre amount of aid Tel Aviv is allowing into the enclave will only worsen conditions in the Strip. “People are literally falling dead from hunger in the streets,” said Hany Abufayez, a writer based in Gaza who specialises in social and political issues. Once a successful businessman, the father of six — four boys and two girls — lost everything in the war. His only asset now is his family; their safety is his top priority. Under international law, access to food is a “fundamental human right”. But in Gaza, this right has become a choice: death by starvation or death by bombs. “Either we die of hunger in the tents or risk going out in search of food amid killings, bombings and sniper fire,” said Abyfayez. His nephew, Fayez Jamal Abu Akar, paid the price: “he went out to fetch food. He was shot in the head, abdomen and leg.” Stages of starvation By definition, starvation is suffering or death caused by the lack of food. It occurs over three stages: the first starts as early as a skipped meal, the second comes with a prolonged period of fasting when the body relies on stored fats for energy, and the third and fatal stage is when these fat reserves are depleted. The body consequently turns to bones and muscles for energy. Displaced Palestinian mother Samah Matar holds her malnourished son, Ameer, who suffers from cerebral palsy, as her other son Youssef, also malnourished and suffering from cerebral palsy, lies on a mattress at a school in Gaza City. — Reuters “Starvation is one of the most barbaric ways to kill someone,” said Dr Fyeza Jehan, professor and chairperson of the Department of Paediatrics & Child Health at the Aga Khan University in Karachi. “It is not sudden … it is prolonged, you are constantly conscious of it, and it is intended to maximise suffering.” Chronic starvation, the doctor explained, is like the body cannibalising itself. Without access to food, the stomach contracts, leading to severe hunger pangs that occur as the body utilises all of its glycogen stores — the stored form of glucose, primarily located in the liver and skeletal muscles. In adults, the process can last 48 hours, while in children, it is accelerated and can last up to a day. After two to three days without food, the hunger vanishes, leaving the body behind in what is called the survival mode, and as it happens, the body goes frigid. “It feels like there is no life left in you,” Dr Fyeza said. In a child, this can manifest as a boy or a girl with dull eyes who doesn’t play or talk anymore. For toddlers or infants, their cries dim or just stop altogether. When weeks pass, these effects worsen in the form of lost weight, thin skin, shrinking muscles, hallucinations and a weak immune system in adults. In these circumstances, even a common cold can lead to severe infections. In children, prolonged starvation eats up all the fat and protein in their bodies, leaving them with oedema — swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body’s tissues, often affecting the legs, ankles, and feet. Physically, the child loses all colour and embodies a shrunken leaf. At this stage, any infection can cause death. For Gaza’s children, the signs Dr Fyeza pointed out fit like a glove. Dr Wesam Amir, a Palestinian medic who left the enclave for safety last year, cannot forget those dull eyes, once sparkling with life and light. “Instead of running around, they now search for a place to lie on; instead of toys, they now ask for bread; many have forgotten what it is like to eat a full meal.” “Their cries echo in my ears even today … and it breaks me every single time,” he sighed. Dr Wesam recalled the wails of an infant in the neighbourhood where he lived. “The mother couldn’t breastfeed … she was malnourished herself. Her baby would cry with hunger for hours, but there was nothing that could be fed, not even formula milk.” As months pass without adequate food, a starving adult may still be able to survive. But they are merely a shadow of their former selves; all that remains are bones and skin. Eventually, the heart and liver begin to fail, and the body’s tissues break down. Death is not far away. Children, on the other hand, rarely ever reach this stage. Their fragile bodies rapidly deteriorate, becoming susceptible to diarrhoea, pneumonia and sepsis. At three weeks, the process of starvation reaches its catastrophic phase, where children get lesions on their eyes and go blind, their hair falls out, and their organs shut down. “Unable to move, speak or cry out, they draw their last breath,” said Rachael Cummings, humanitarian director at Save the Children. She highlighted that data compiled by the organisation for July showed cases of acute malnutrition in children under the age of five at their clinics across Gaza surged tenfold during the four months of total siege. Sham Qadeh, a 22-month-old Palestinian girl suffering from severe malnutrition and an enlarged liver, is pictured with her mom in a makeshift tent on June 28 in Khan Younis, Gaza. — Anadolu Agency Of the 3,533 children screened for malnutrition during the first half of July, 259 were admitted for treatment (7pc) compared to 28 (1pc) in March. The number of children admitted for treatment of malnutrition in the first two weeks of July was close to the total for the whole of June, a trend that is dangerous and unprecedented. “There is a clear correlation here with the start of the total siege at the beginning of March and its knock-on impacts.” When it comes to grown-ups, research suggests that a healthy adult can survive without food for between one to two months. However, there are no healthy adults in Gaza today — two years of aid being blocked intermittently by Israel has deprived them of conditions indispensable for survival, essentially rendering people in the enclave vulnerable to malnutrition and a host of infectious diseases . “Imagine that 99 per cent of people here have not eaten a meal containing meat or eggs in over a year or six months,” Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza, told Dawn.com . His family is very much a part of this percentage. Shama’s son, Mohammed, especially requires the nutrients. He fractured his right leg during the Israeli bombing of the beachfront Al-Baqa cafe in Gaza City on June 30, in which the military used a 500lb bomb — a powerful and indiscriminate weapon that generates a massive blast wave and scatters shrapnel over a wide area. “He needs nutritious foods, like meat and eggs, to recover and walk again,” the father said. “But we struggle to provide him with even basic food. The available food consists mainly of canned goods such as fava and kidney beans, peas, some bread, cheese, and a very limited amount of vegetables,” he rued. But meals in Gaza are no longer about nutrition or flavour; they are now only meant to quell the hunger pangs. Most families survive on one meal a day. As per the recent IPC report, July 2025 was consistent with the exponential rise in acute malnutrition across Gaza. It found that at least 1 in 5 households in the enclave are facing an extreme shortage in their consumption of food, roughly 1 in 3 children or more are acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people are dying daily because of outright starvation or the combination of malnutrition and disease. It further reported that in the Gaza governorate, 15pc of households said they have resorted to scavenging through bins for food, adding that at certain points over the past 23 months, people were forced to eat leaves to survive, or scraps that even rats wouldn’t want to eat. “Breakfast is often a cup of water and, if you are lucky, a piece of stale bread,” described Dr Wesam. “The main meal of the day is usually a thin rice soup made with lots of water and a handful of grains. On other days, it is plain rice with a pinch of salt.” A dish like eggplant stew, he continued, has become a luxury — unseen in months. “My grandmother-in-law has health conditions that require a special diet, but we can’t provide it. She is so frail, yet she often gives a portion of her food to the children, pretending she isn’t hungry,” he added. Psychological toll Beyond the toll and hunger is something grave — it is the erosion of dignity and future potential and the long-term psychological trauma that will haunt generations of Palestinians to come. “There is … a multi-generational societal impact. The trauma, sense of degradation and humiliation that accompany the experience of famine lives on in the memories of people,” said Alex de Waal, one of the world’s leading experts on famine, in an interview with Anadolu Agency , while comparing starvation in Gaza with the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s, which left a lingering silence and chafed pain for over a century. “I fear that in the case of Gaza, this sense of trauma, degradation, humiliation, dehumanisation will mean that this is a wound that … will take generations to heal,” he added. The Palestinian spread, once a symbol of pride for Gaza, was reduced by Israel to stale bread and thin rice soup made of a handful of grains — that too require begging — and dirty water. Some families look at old photos of meals on their phones just to remember what it used to feel like to have a full table and a fuller stomach. “Managing feels too generous. People aren’t managing; they are barely surviving,” said Dr Wesam. And this affects not just their bodies, but also their behaviours, which become contrary to normal survival instincts, both in adults and children. For babies born in Gaza during the last several months, food is a foreign concept, as many of them have never tasted a hearty meal. This doesn’t just impact them but also helpless mothers, who are malnourished themselves. “In Nasser, the hospital corridors are lined with women who have just given birth. In six missions to Gaza, I have never seen it like this — new mothers and vulnerable newborns lying on the floor,” said UNICEF spokesperson James Elder. “Three premature babies share a single oxygen source — each breathing for 20 minutes, before giving way to the next. A premature baby, Nada, who was in intensive care for 21 days, is discharged and now waits outside, lying on the corridor floor with her mother. Nada weighs two kilograms, less than half of what she should weigh,” he added. This hunger, visible across Gaza, is also preventing injured Palestinians from recovering fully, as two years of war and starvation have taken a toll on their immune systems. And contrary to popular belief, refeeding, as Dr Fyeza pointed out, is not the solution. “At this time, even if aid enters Gaza, the damage has already been done,” she lamented. Palestinians in the enclave are now at risk of the refeeding syndrome — a metabolic disturbance which occurs as a result of the reintroduction of nutrition in people who are starved, severely malnourished, or metabolically stressed because of severe illness. If food is introduced too quickly, the doctor explained, it can cause serious complications such as an electrolyte imbalance. This happens because of the ways our bodies change when they are deprived of nutrients. When we begin refeeding, they have to change back, but they may not have the resources they need. “As the body starves, it makes adaptations to maintain life as long as possible. These adaptations mean that if a severely malnourished person suddenly consumes a large amount of food, it may actually kill them,” the IPC report highlighted. Instead, food needs to be introduced gradually and under medical supervision to ensure that this unfortunate consequence does not happen. “Even if the food comes back, all the effects, especially those on children and their brain development, cannot be undone,” Dr Fyeza said. When the body experiences repeated cycles of undernutrition, it causes chronic health problems. In adults, they manifest in the form of heart diseases and diabetes. Yazan, a malnourished 2-year-old, stands in his family’s damaged home in the Al-Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City on July 23. — AFP It is, however, the children who suffer the biggest loss. Those who survive will be more susceptible to anaemia, stunting, and poor immunity. Similarly, babies born to mothers who are malnourished are more likely to be smaller, less healthy, and at higher risk of malnutrition themselves. But most of all, this is an entire generation growing up with less capacity, whether it is physical or cognitive. “The impacts of famine often ripple across generations: children who survive may face lifelong health and developmental challenges, and their own children may inherit increased vulnerability,” said Rachael of Save the Children. “The physical, mental, and social harms of famine are not only devastating in the moment, but they also shape families, communities, and futures for decades.” “Children in Gaza are systematically being starved to death. This is a deliberate policy. This is starvation as a method of war in its starkest terms.” What begins as hunger does not end with it — it seeps into memory, body, even the bloodline. In Gaza, starvation has become a legacy written into the next generation. Hunger as policy “They need to starve […] the moment it becomes hard for them, it will also be hard for Hamas. There is no problem bombing fuel and food reserves,” Israeli Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said , days before a famine was declared in Gaza. Before him, far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also thundered : “Not even a single grain of wheat will enter the Gaza Strip.” “[…] we should bomb all their generators. If our hostages don’t have electricity, let them have no electricity … we need to explain to him [President Trump] that this aid goes to Hamas, and Hamas are Nazis, and they shouldn’t be given a single grain of food. Not only [should we] not give them, but [we should] bomb all of their food reserves,” Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir posted on X on March 3, 2025. It is no longer a secret that Tel Aviv is deliberately starving Palestinians, not just since October 2023, but as a systematic policy for almost two decades now. The question is how. After Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel placed restrictions on everything entering the enclave through crossings controlled by its military. “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” Dov Weisglass, a senior adviser to the then Israeli prime minister had said back then. Henceforth, Israel began to carefully calculate the amount of food Gaza precisely needed, allowing just that into the enclave. According to files released by the defence ministry two years later, the food calculation had applied the average daily requirement of 2,279 calories per person. An average adult needs 2,500kcal a day. Even before October 2023, 1.2 million of Gaza’s 2.2 million population was estimated to be facing acute food insecurity, and over 80pc were reliant on humanitarian aid, the Human Rights Watch noted in a report . Today, Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls aid shipments to Gaza, appears to be following the same policy. The agency’s records show that 319,926 tonnes of aid were allowed into the enclave between March and September, which is insufficient to meet the starving territory’s needs. As per the World Food Programme, Gaza needs more than 62,000 metric tonnes of food every month to cover basic humanitarian needs for its population. Even if every bag of flour or can of beans were handed out equitably, starvation and hunger in Gaza were inevitable. In March and April, after Israel resumed attacks on Gaza following the ceasefire violation, the enclave was under a total siege, with no food allowed to enter. By May, Netanyahu succumbed to growing international pressure and allowed only a trickle of aid to enter the Strip, which didn’t prevent but delayed the famine. Between May and July, a meagre 116,030 tonnes of aid entered Gaza; one-third of the required food never reached the territory. By August, a famine was officially declared. And all of this happened as hundreds of trucks, carrying humanitarian aid sufficient to feed Gaza for three months, waited a few kilometres from the Strip, awaiting Israeli approvals. “Just outside Gaza, in warehouses — and even within the territory itself — tonnes of food, clean water, medical supplies, shelter items and fuel sit untouched with humanitarian organisations blocked from accessing or delivering them,” said Rachael Cummings of Save the Children. “The Government of Israel’s restrictions, delays, and fragmentation under its total siege have created chaos, starvation, and death.” A woman carries empty cardboard boxes as Palestinians receive aid supplies from the US-backed GHF, in the central Gaza Strip, on August 1, 2025 — Reuters Like a hawk eyeing its prey, Israel has exercised complete control over the aid entering Gaza ever since the beginning of its onslaught on the Strip. A recent analysis of food availability, conducted by the IPC, showed that from October 2023 to December 2024, there was a considerable caloric deficit in the enclave, as only 1,640kcals per person were available every day. By May 2025, this number fell to just 1,400 calories or “67pc of what a human body needs to survive”. “Before the war, Gaza was receiving about 500 aid trucks daily,” Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson of the Palestine Red Crescent, told Dawn.com . “But the trucks entering the enclave now are in mere dozens, which does not even scratch the surface of its needs.” “It is a drop in the ocean.” According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, after the resumption of hostilities in March, only 35pc of 1,445 humanitarian missions were facilitated by Israeli authorities, while 810 were impeded or denied. Israel’s recent changes in its policies, requiring all humanitarian trucks to be accompanied by its security escorts, have further impacted humanitarian logistical operations. The lack of escort capacity has already caused suspensions on some humanitarian supply corridors, while previously authorised items such as nutrition, health, hygiene and water treatment aid face longer delays than food items, noted the IPC report. Even if aid trucks do manage to cross the rigidly guarded Gaza border, what they carry is rarely ever sufficient to meet the needs of Palestinians. “The goods that come through the crossing are very limited,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a human rights activist and writer in the enclave. “For example, meat of any kind is not allowed in. The reliance remains on canned foods, legumes and cheese.” “We went through a period where we didn’t have flour or bread … we had to eat rice instead, and we rationed bread carefully to keep some for the next day. At first, breakfast might have been za’atr and olive oil, but even those ran out, so we depended mainly on fava beans,” she recalled. Other times, the trucks are hijacked and looted or seized by criminal groups supported by Israel to break down civil order in the Strip and prevent aid deliveries, Nour added. While Palestinians always knew who funded these gangs, mounting evidence has recently surfaced, laying bare Israel’s glaring role in mobilising criminals in Gaza. On June 5, Netanyahu admitted : “The government has activated powerful local clans in the enclave on the advice of security officials.” Earlier, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that sources in Gaza claimed one such group Bibi referred to consisted of roughly 100 armed men operating with the implicit support of the Israeli military. The New Humanitarian, a not-for-profit newsroom, described the gangs as “big and very dangerous”. They are especially located in areas where aid is entering or being distributed. “They loot UN trucks, selling the goods at inflated rates — or sometimes the food just disappears altogether … they also steal food directly from other people who risk their lives to get aid from distribution centres.” What these gangs steal is sold into the market at exorbitant rates; sugar now costs 300 times more than it did before the war, same is the case with flour and beans. As per the IPC report released in August, July food prices in Gaza increased by 25pc to as much as 9,900pc compared to the February ceasefire levels, and by 233pc to 15,285pc compared to the pre-war prices. The highest fluctuations were seen in wheat flour — which has become both a bane and boon for Palestinians — up to $30 in June and coming back down to around $15 in July. A displaced Palestinian woman cooks amid ongoing food shortages in Gaza on July 28. — Reuters Qusay Qasem, 22, is among the thousands of Palestinians for whom fetching bread has become a fatal exercise. A resident of North Gaza, which has been declared a combat zone, he has to risk his life every day to secure a piece of bread. But the markets, now merely a remnant of what they used to be before the war, are nearly inaccessible. The IPC has found that Palestinians face extreme challenges reaching markets across the Strip, with 82pc of households in Deir al-Balah Governorate, 76pc in Khan Younis Governorate, 72pc in Gaza Governorate and 66pc in North Gaza Governorate unable to reach markets. “Instead, I head to aid distribution centres, where bullets pour down on us,” Qasem told Dawn.com . “I have escaped death several times. Yet, I return alive each time because I know my family is waiting for that one sack of flour, that one loaf of bread.” Bakeries, previously a reliable source of food — particularly bread — for a majority of Palestinians like Qasem, have remained closed since April 2025. Most of them have been bombed, and the undamaged ones are out of reach. Of the 29 bakeries in Gaza, 13 are now in evacuation and militarised zones, while none of the previous bakeries in North Gaza, Rafah, and Khan Younis are accessible due to the movement restrictions imposed by Israel. Before the war, many Gazans relied on the enclave’s fertile lands for sustenance and livelihood. But two exhausting years of Israeli aggression have snatched that. All that remains is rubble, dust and despair. According to an assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, Gaza’s agrifood system faces a near-total collapse. About 86pc of cropland has been damaged, with over 91pc land inaccessible to farmers and only 1.5pc of arable land in use. Agriculture previously supplied most of the Strip’s fresh vegetables, eggs and milk. In fact, some of its top exports included strawberries, dates, olives, and flowers. A similar situation persists with livestock, most of which have been killed; only 26pc of sheep and 34pc of goats remain, ceasing the commercial production of poultry, cattle and dairy. With the Israeli ban on access to the sea — the beach that was once a source of solace, laughter and barbeques — over 72pc of fishing assets, including boats, aquaculture, farms and cold storage have been destroyed. With its 24-month-long aggression in Gaza, Israel has systematically robbed the enclave of its ability to feed itself, forcing Palestinians to now depend almost entirely on irregular food aid and imports. This is not just an erasure of life, but also dignity. And the FAO agrees, explicitly describing Gaza’s crisis as an “entirely man-made catastrophe, driven by access restrictions and bombardment rather than natural causes”. Families like that of Nour, who still have some financial stability enabling to purchase food, also face massive hindrances in terms of preparation because of the complete lack of fuel and gas — the latter hasn’t entered the enclave since February 2025. As a result, Gazans must now rely on burning rubbish to light their stoves. “Staple foods such as lentils and wheat flour, if poorly cooked, are not well digested by the body, reducing its ability to fully absorb and use the nutrients,” the FAO told Dawn.com . Thus, even for households that can sporadically access food, they often lack the means to safely prepare it. In addition to this, the IPC report highlighted that basic cooking implements continue to be in short supply due to the constant displacement of populations. Nearly 800,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the end of the ceasefire on March 18, with almost 350,000 since the escalation of May 15 alone. Most of the population has been displaced multiple times across Gaza Governorate, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. Across these governorates, around 20pc or more of the population has been displaced three to six times, with at least 4pc across all three areas displaced seven or more times. Map by OCHA, October 1, 2025 Continued and frequent displacement erodes household capacity to cope as essential assets such as shelter materials, storage items, water, and food may be lost along the journey, especially given the limited notice that people have to evacuate or relocate from approaching hostilities, the report noted. Before the war, Hani Abufayez was recognised across Gaza as a successful businessman. He ran a consulting office and lived in a villa with his family of eight. Today, he lives in a tent after being displaced not once but at least thrice. “I survive on very little money … my fears grow with each passing day. I fear my family and I could be killed at any moment, or die of hunger.” “The reality is that Israel has turned Gaza into a death zone where there is no place for life anymore.” It didn’t just rain down bombs on the enclave, but also ran a planned campaign there, using “food and aid as a weapon to humiliate, weaken, displace and kill Palestinians”. Systems breakdown The dismantling of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees was a part of this campaign. For decades, Palestinians have relied on the organisation for aid. “It is the only agency with real experience in humanitarian relief,” said Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza. “I am considered a part of the third generation of the Nakba of 1948. I completed my primary and preparatory education in UNRWA schools. I grew up witnessing the agency providing its services to refugees in various fields. I completed my studies, and throughout my long career in the field of human rights, there was continuous coordination between us and UNRWA,” he reminisced. The UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly on December 8, 1949, to provide basic support, including food, healthcare and education to Palestinian refugees, who were displaced during the Nakba. It supports about six million Palestinian refugees, residing both within and outside Palestine, and provides direct services such as schools, health centres and other social services. Before Israel launched its offensive in Gaza, about a million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were sheltering in UNRWA schools, clinics and other buildings run by the agency. Meanwhile, nearly the entire population of the Strip relied on it for basic necessities, including food, water and hygiene. “It was our lifeline, both before the war and especially after Oct 7, 2023,” emphasised Shama. But just the way it did with everything else, Israel deprived Palestinians of this support as well. On January 30, Tel Aviv banned the UNRWA, months after the Israeli parliament passed two bills : one, barring the agency from activity within Israel and the second banning Israeli authorities from any contact with it, essentially breaking a 1967 treaty that allowed the agency to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control. The action was taken after Israel accused 18 UNRWA employees of participating in the Oct 7 attack on Israel. Subsequently, a probe was launched by the UN, which found that nine workers of the agency “may have” been involved in the attack and no longer work for it. But UNRWA has maintained that Israel never presented any evidence supporting its allegations, adding that it regularly provided Tel Aviv with a full list of its staff members. The agency has also accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, pressurising them into making false confessions about ties with Hamas. But Netanyahu and his government were adamant on dismantling UNRWA, something they have been advocating for a long time. Israel claims that the UN body “perpetuated” the issue of Palestinian refugees because it allows Palestinians to transfer refugee status across generations, which Tel Aviv refuses to accept. It is also not a mere coincidence that Israel’s allegations came the same day the International Court of Justice ordered it to prevent genocidal acts and scale up aid to Gaza. Soon after the Israeli allegations were aired, the US became the first country to announce the suspension of funding to the agency. Canada, Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, Japan, Austria and Romania soon followed. What happened next looks like this: Israel made UNRWA vacate all premises in occupied East Jerusalem, cease its operations by Jan 30, and cut short the validity of all visas for UNRWA’s international staff. Basically, the agency was evicted . “Stopping the UNRWA’s work and placing obstacles in the way of its continued presence in Palestine — especially in Gaza — is effectively a death sentence for large numbers of refugees who have lost everything, including the ability to secure food,” said Shama. A month later, in February 2025, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — backed by the very powers accused of engineering the starvation — was born. It promised relief. What it delivered, many in Gaza say, was something else entirely. The death trap Dr Sami Alastal, a writer and political analyst based in Gaza, has lost 20 kilos since October 7, 2023. “We do not have any food, and if it is available, it is in very small quantities,” he rued. Yet, he refuses to visit the GHF aid distribution centres. “It is a scam,” he said. “It is a killing and torture squad disguised as a humanitarian organisation.” Dr Sami’s sentiments were echoed by a majority of Palestinians Dawn.com spoke to, who, despite the catastrophic levels of starvation and hunger in the enclave, refuse to visit the GHF-run stations. They see the distribution process as “humiliating to our humanity and dignity”. “We live near the Netzarim area, from where we see people heading to aid distribution sites,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a Palestinian human rights activist. “The process of entry and aid distribution is manipulated by the [Israeli] occupation to create chaos, and so for us it is unacceptable.” She shared how these aid distribution sites were located in areas described as “execution grounds” for civilians. “I heard about the crimes in Netzarim on television, watched them unfold from my house, but never went there myself.” Qusay Qasem, who has no choice but to visit the GHF centres, calls them traps. “It is akin to walking into your death … at any time, the Israeli military starts indiscriminately firing at us, there are bullets everywhere,” he recalled. “I have seen fellow aid seekers fall dead or wounded as I duck to the ground.” But even as bullets rain down on him, the 22-year-old Palestinian strives to reach the gates of the centre, his family’s shrunken faces flashing before his eyes. “I have to do it; they wait for a single piece of bread all day.” A displaced Palestinian girl takes a sip of lentil soup that she received at a food distribution point in Gaza City on July 25. — AFP This is exactly how Israel plays its game — it’s either death from guns or death from hunger. Here is how it is done: The journey begins hours before the aid site is set to open, often in early morning hours. The aid seekers are only allowed to bring their vehicles up to a certain point, which is at least 1.5km (a 12-20 minute walk) from the centre, and then cover the remaining distance on foot. This means that once — and if — they manage to secure sacks or boxes of aid, it must be carried back on foot. As the crowd keeps getting bigger, everyone is glued to their spots — unflinching for fear of losing out — waiting for the go-ahead signal, usually the buzz of drones. As soon as the signal rings through the now flattened Gaza, the walk begins, and, with that, the fear of death fills the air. “These centres are heavily guarded by the Israeli military, who encircle them with sniper nests, tanks and drones,” said Khalil Abu Shama. “The Israeli military monitors the movement of the crowd, sometimes opening fire even before the go-ahead signal.” “Every day between 10 and 50 civilians are killed without any clear explanation as to why, except that the occupation wants to slaughter as many people as possible in Gaza,” he added. On July 19, Israel killed at least 32 Gazans seeking aid near Rafah. According to an eyewitness, the shooting took place near a GHF aid distribution centre, adding that gunfire erupted from soldiers and tanks “as if they were in a battle with us”. Doctors who treated the wounded said they had severe gunshot wounds to the head and torso. The Israeli military, on the other hand, failed to provide any reason for the live fire. This is not something new for the Israeli military. They have been targeting aid coming into Gaza since the first month of the war. From October 2023 to 2024, Forensic Architecture has documented more than 322 attacks on aid, including workers and civilians, as well as 22 attacks on convoys transporting aid. Separately, during March and August this year, 64 incidents of the Israeli army opening fire on aid seekers were reported, of which 25 were around GHF centres, 19 in proximity to aid routes and seven during aid diversion. The vast majority of these shootings weren’t merely a mistake or misunderstanding. A report by Israeli newspaper Haaretz found that Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at unarmed Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza after being “ordered” to do so by their commanders. “We fire machine guns from tanks and throw grenades,” it quoted one soldier as saying. Another soldier said that between “one and five people were killed every day” where he was stationed in Gaza. “It’s a killing field,” he added. One of the authors of the Haaretz report, in an interview with Al Jazeera , said that the Israeli military’s orders to open fire on civilians were part of a method to “control” the aid seekers. “It’s actually a practice of … controlling the crowd by fire, like if you wanted the crowd to run off [from] a place, you shoot them at them, even though you know they are unarmed … You use fire to move people from one point to another,” Nir Hasson said. It almost translates to making Palestinians move to the tune of Israeli gunshots — not just a violation of their humanity but also of their dignity. “It is deliberate … Israel uses food as a tool of pressure,” Nour, the Palestinian human rights activist, pointed out. Meanwhile, Dr Alastal said: “Israel is using the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to establish a military model of aid distribution wherein food is used as a weapon of war.” The same was also highlighted in the Forensic Architecture report. It explained how, for years, aid in Gaza was distributed through experienced humanitarian organisations such as the UNRWA, equipped to meet the needs of the enclave’s population. But after the war, just like every living thing in the Gaza Strip, these agencies too came under attack. Between March 2 and May 29, 2025, no aid was allowed to enter Gaza. During this period, Israel attacked aid warehouses and community kitchens, exacerbating the conditions of starvation. When aid trucks were finally permitted to re-enter Gaza at the end of May, ending the nearly three-month blockade, efforts to deliver supplies to warehouses faced significant challenges. To make matters worse, Cogat announced in July that Israel will gradually permit the entry of goods into the Strip under a new “private commercial sector” mechanism, in a bid to “increase the volume” of aid, while reducing reliance on aid collection by the UN and other international organisations. Palestinians gather for aid in Beit Lahia, Gaza, on June 17. — Reuters Simply put, Israel wanted complete control over the enclave. And this is how it was able to weaponise food distribution, ergo: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Per the FA’s findings, the previous UN-led distribution network in Gaza operated nearly 400 sites, whereas the GHF has only four of what it calls “mega sites”, a majority of which are located in the south, which the UN says is an attempt to relocate Palestinians from the north and depopulate it. “The military model dismantles the social fabric. In restricting the reach of any form of aid administration to the confines of the four ration stations, this model designates the remainder of the territory as something akin to a governance wilderness. “In this ungoverned territory, Israel promotes the lawlessness of criminal gangs and proxy forces. The attacks on aid workers, health workers, and community leaders are part of this,” the report noted. A method of war In this war, hunger is not incidental — and aid, under the GHF, is not compassionate. A report by the Jewish Voice for Peace lays it bare: from day one, GHF aid sites became kill-zones; “shoot at the crowds to communicate” were the instructions; distribution was concentrated in militarised zones and managed under Israeli oversight. This is aid designed to humiliate, corral, and control. And so we arrive at the darkest logic: to deliver bread is to own life. Gaza’s hunger cannot be undone by more trucks or rations — it must be undone by undoing the system that made hunger the weapon in the first place. Palestinians wait for food that was distributed by a charity organization in Gaza City on July 25. — Aandolu Agency Starvation in Gaza is not a byproduct of war — it is the method. This isn’t just the story of the last two years — the policy and actions go back two decades. What began as a blockade of goods has become a blockade of existence. Israel has built a system where food is not distributed but dispensed; where hunger is not a crisis to be solved but a condition to be managed. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the clearest example of this — aid designed not to relieve suffering but to regulate it. Every grain of wheat, every loaf of bread, is counted, rationed, and handed out under watchtowers and rifles. And still, the Palestinians resist. They refuse to let the act of eating become a performance of gratitude. In their hunger, they assert the one thing Israel cannot occupy — their humanity. In Gaza today, starvation has a geography, a policy, and an administration. It has checkpoints and drones, and waiting lines. It has signatures and seals. And that is the real tragedy — that the world has watched hunger become a bureaucracy. History will remember this war not just for the bombs that fell, but for the bread that didn’t.",
      "title": "Genocide 101: Starving Gaza",
      "summary": "Hunger as policy The death trap It starts with the body eating itself, consuming all the energy stored in its nooks and crannies. Then begins the shedding: weight, hair, skin, muscles, colour, sanity. And finally, when months pass, all that remains are shadows of a self that once was. Slowly, the heart and liver stop functioning, and soon after, death descends. This is the story of two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, who have been stripped of food, water, shelter, dignity and a future. It is a story that started well before the onslaught began on Oct 7, 2023, following the Hamas attack on Israel. In the two years since, the Israeli military has pretty much flattened Gaza, killing almost 70,000 people, injuring and maiming thousands of others and displacing hundreds of thousands. But some in Gaza consider the deceased lucky — at least they don’t have to witness their loved ones slowly starve to death. While the signs started showing way back, officially, a famine was declared in the enclave on August 22 this year. According to the Integrated Security Phase Classification (IPC) — a standardised global system for analysing and classifying the severity of acute and chronic food insecurity and acute malnutrition — more than half a million Palestinians are trapped, starving to death, in the Strip. Palestinian mother Amira Muteir holds her five-month-old baby Ammar, whom she says is wasting away from malnutrition, in Gaza City, August 5, 2025. — Reuters The declaration was news, but no surprise. For the past two years, the world has witnessed in real time this famine unfold on their mobile and television screens. International human rights bodies had been warning of it for months; resolutions were passed , letters were written , and condemnations were issued. Yet, as hundreds of desperate Palestinians starved to death, the world looked on — some with agonising helplessness, others out of brutal indifference. As of October 1, at least 455 Palestinians have died of starvation. While most of these deaths are among children and infants, older people are increasingly succumbing to the hunger that Israel has imposed on Gaza. Aid agencies have warned that the meagre amount of aid Tel Aviv is allowing into the enclave will only worsen conditions in the Strip. “People are literally falling dead from hunger in the streets,” said Hany Abufayez, a writer based in Gaza who specialises in social and political issues. Once a successful businessman, the father of six — four boys and two girls — lost everything in the war. His only asset now is his family; their safety is his top priority. Under international law, access to food is a “fundamental human right”. But in Gaza, this right has become a choice: death by starvation or death by bombs. “Either we die of hunger in the tents or risk going out in search of food amid killings, bombings and sniper fire,” said Abyfayez. His nephew, Fayez Jamal Abu Akar, paid the price: “he went out to fetch food. He was shot in the head, abdomen and leg.” Stages of starvation By definition, starvation is suffering or death caused by the lack of food. It occurs over three stages: the first starts as early as a skipped meal, the second comes with a prolonged period of fasting when the body relies on stored fats for energy, and the third and fatal stage is when these fat reserves are depleted. The body consequently turns to bones and muscles for energy. Displaced Palestinian mother Samah Matar holds her malnourished son, Ameer, who suffers from cerebral palsy, as her other son Youssef, also malnourished and suffering from cerebral palsy, lies on a mattress at a school in Gaza City. — Reuters “Starvation is one of the most barbaric ways to kill someone,” said Dr Fyeza Jehan, professor and chairperson of the Department of Paediatrics & Child Health at the Aga Khan University in Karachi. “It is not sudden … it is prolonged, you are constantly conscious of it, and it is intended to maximise suffering.” Chronic starvation, the doctor explained, is like the body cannibalising itself. Without access to food, the stomach contracts, leading to severe hunger pangs that occur as the body utilises all of its glycogen stores — the stored form of glucose, primarily located in the liver and skeletal muscles. In adults, the process can last 48 hours, while in children, it is accelerated and can last up to a day. After two to three days without food, the hunger vanishes, leaving the body behind in what is called the survival mode, and as it happens, the body goes frigid. “It feels like there is no life left in you,” Dr Fyeza said. In a child, this can manifest as a boy or a girl with dull eyes who doesn’t play or talk anymore. For toddlers or infants, their cries dim or just stop altogether. When weeks pass, these effects worsen in the form of lost weight, thin skin, shrinking muscles, hallucinations and a weak immune system in adults. In these circumstances, even a common cold can lead to severe infections. In children, prolonged starvation eats up all the fat and protein in their bodies, leaving them with oedema — swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body’s tissues, often affecting the legs, ankles, and feet. Physically, the child loses all colour and embodies a shrunken leaf. At this stage, any infection can cause death. For Gaza’s children, the signs Dr Fyeza pointed out fit like a glove. Dr Wesam Amir, a Palestinian medic who left the enclave for safety last year, cannot forget those dull eyes, once sparkling with life and light. “Instead of running around, they now search for a place to lie on; instead of toys, they now ask for bread; many have forgotten what it is like to eat a full meal.” “Their cries echo in my ears even today … and it breaks me every single time,” he sighed. Dr Wesam recalled the wails of an infant in the neighbourhood where he lived. “The mother couldn’t breastfeed … she was malnourished herself. Her baby would cry with hunger for hours, but there was nothing that could be fed, not even formula milk.” As months pass without adequate food, a starving adult may still be able to survive. But they are merely a shadow of their former selves; all that remains are bones and skin. Eventually, the heart and liver begin to fail, and the body’s tissues break down. Death is not far away. Children, on the other hand, rarely ever reach this stage. Their fragile bodies rapidly deteriorate, becoming susceptible to diarrhoea, pneumonia and sepsis. At three weeks, the process of starvation reaches its catastrophic phase, where children get lesions on their eyes and go blind, their hair falls out, and their organs shut down. “Unable to move, speak or cry out, they draw their last breath,” said Rachael Cummings, humanitarian director at Save the Children. She highlighted that data compiled by the organisation for July showed cases of acute malnutrition in children under the age of five at their clinics across Gaza surged tenfold during the four months of total siege. Sham Qadeh, a 22-month-old Palestinian girl suffering from severe malnutrition and an enlarged liver, is pictured with her mom in a makeshift tent on June 28 in Khan Younis, Gaza. — Anadolu Agency Of the 3,533 children screened for malnutrition during the first half of July, 259 were admitted for treatment (7pc) compared to 28 (1pc) in March. The number of children admitted for treatment of malnutrition in the first two weeks of July was close to the total for the whole of June, a trend that is dangerous and unprecedented. “There is a clear correlation here with the start of the total siege at the beginning of March and its knock-on impacts.” When it comes to grown-ups, research suggests that a healthy adult can survive without food for between one to two months. However, there are no healthy adults in Gaza today — two years of aid being blocked intermittently by Israel has deprived them of conditions indispensable for survival, essentially rendering people in the enclave vulnerable to malnutrition and a host of infectious diseases . “Imagine that 99 per cent of people here have not eaten a meal containing meat or eggs in over a year or six months,” Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza, told Dawn.com . His family is very much a part of this percentage. Shama’s son, Mohammed, especially requires the nutrients. He fractured his right leg during the Israeli bombing of the beachfront Al-Baqa cafe in Gaza City on June 30, in which the military used a 500lb bomb — a powerful and indiscriminate weapon that generates a massive blast wave and scatters shrapnel over a wide area. “He needs nutritious foods, like meat and eggs, to recover and walk again,” the father said. “But we struggle to provide him with even basic food. The available food consists mainly of canned goods such as fava and kidney beans, peas, some bread, cheese, and a very limited amount of vegetables,” he rued. But meals in Gaza are no longer about nutrition or flavour; they are now only meant to quell the hunger pangs. Most families survive on one meal a day. As per the recent IPC report, July 2025 was consistent with the exponential rise in acute malnutrition across Gaza. It found that at least 1 in 5 households in the enclave are facing an extreme shortage in their consumption of food, roughly 1 in 3 children or more are acutely malnourished, and at least 2 in every 10,000 people are dying daily because of outright starvation or the combination of malnutrition and disease. It further reported that in the Gaza governorate, 15pc of households said they have resorted to scavenging through bins for food, adding that at certain points over the past 23 months, people were forced to eat leaves to survive, or scraps that even rats wouldn’t want to eat. “Breakfast is often a cup of water and, if you are lucky, a piece of stale bread,” described Dr Wesam. “The main meal of the day is usually a thin rice soup made with lots of water and a handful of grains. On other days, it is plain rice with a pinch of salt.” A dish like eggplant stew, he continued, has become a luxury — unseen in months. “My grandmother-in-law has health conditions that require a special diet, but we can’t provide it. She is so frail, yet she often gives a portion of her food to the children, pretending she isn’t hungry,” he added. Psychological toll Beyond the toll and hunger is something grave — it is the erosion of dignity and future potential and the long-term psychological trauma that will haunt generations of Palestinians to come. “There is … a multi-generational societal impact. The trauma, sense of degradation and humiliation that accompany the experience of famine lives on in the memories of people,” said Alex de Waal, one of the world’s leading experts on famine, in an interview with Anadolu Agency , while comparing starvation in Gaza with the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s, which left a lingering silence and chafed pain for over a century. “I fear that in the case of Gaza, this sense of trauma, degradation, humiliation, dehumanisation will mean that this is a wound that … will take generations to heal,” he added. The Palestinian spread, once a symbol of pride for Gaza, was reduced by Israel to stale bread and thin rice soup made of a handful of grains — that too require begging — and dirty water. Some families look at old photos of meals on their phones just to remember what it used to feel like to have a full table and a fuller stomach. “Managing feels too generous. People aren’t managing; they are barely surviving,” said Dr Wesam. And this affects not just their bodies, but also their behaviours, which become contrary to normal survival instincts, both in adults and children. For babies born in Gaza during the last several months, food is a foreign concept, as many of them have never tasted a hearty meal. This doesn’t just impact them but also helpless mothers, who are malnourished themselves. “In Nasser, the hospital corridors are lined with women who have just given birth. In six missions to Gaza, I have never seen it like this — new mothers and vulnerable newborns lying on the floor,” said UNICEF spokesperson James Elder. “Three premature babies share a single oxygen source — each breathing for 20 minutes, before giving way to the next. A premature baby, Nada, who was in intensive care for 21 days, is discharged and now waits outside, lying on the corridor floor with her mother. Nada weighs two kilograms, less than half of what she should weigh,” he added. This hunger, visible across Gaza, is also preventing injured Palestinians from recovering fully, as two years of war and starvation have taken a toll on their immune systems. And contrary to popular belief, refeeding, as Dr Fyeza pointed out, is not the solution. “At this time, even if aid enters Gaza, the damage has already been done,” she lamented. Palestinians in the enclave are now at risk of the refeeding syndrome — a metabolic disturbance which occurs as a result of the reintroduction of nutrition in people who are starved, severely malnourished, or metabolically stressed because of severe illness. If food is introduced too quickly, the doctor explained, it can cause serious complications such as an electrolyte imbalance. This happens because of the ways our bodies change when they are deprived of nutrients. When we begin refeeding, they have to change back, but they may not have the resources they need. “As the body starves, it makes adaptations to maintain life as long as possible. These adaptations mean that if a severely malnourished person suddenly consumes a large amount of food, it may actually kill them,” the IPC report highlighted. Instead, food needs to be introduced gradually and under medical supervision to ensure that this unfortunate consequence does not happen. “Even if the food comes back, all the effects, especially those on children and their brain development, cannot be undone,” Dr Fyeza said. When the body experiences repeated cycles of undernutrition, it causes chronic health problems. In adults, they manifest in the form of heart diseases and diabetes. Yazan, a malnourished 2-year-old, stands in his family’s damaged home in the Al-Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City on July 23. — AFP It is, however, the children who suffer the biggest loss. Those who survive will be more susceptible to anaemia, stunting, and poor immunity. Similarly, babies born to mothers who are malnourished are more likely to be smaller, less healthy, and at higher risk of malnutrition themselves. But most of all, this is an entire generation growing up with less capacity, whether it is physical or cognitive. “The impacts of famine often ripple across generations: children who survive may face lifelong health and developmental challenges, and their own children may inherit increased vulnerability,” said Rachael of Save the Children. “The physical, mental, and social harms of famine are not only devastating in the moment, but they also shape families, communities, and futures for decades.” “Children in Gaza are systematically being starved to death. This is a deliberate policy. This is starvation as a method of war in its starkest terms.” What begins as hunger does not end with it — it seeps into memory, body, even the bloodline. In Gaza, starvation has become a legacy written into the next generation. Hunger as policy “They need to starve […] the moment it becomes hard for them, it will also be hard for Hamas. There is no problem bombing fuel and food reserves,” Israeli Heritage Minister Amichai Eliyahu said , days before a famine was declared in Gaza. Before him, far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also thundered : “Not even a single grain of wheat will enter the Gaza Strip.” “[…] we should bomb all their generators. If our hostages don’t have electricity, let them have no electricity … we need to explain to him [President Trump] that this aid goes to Hamas, and Hamas are Nazis, and they shouldn’t be given a single grain of food. Not only [should we] not give them, but [we should] bomb all of their food reserves,” Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir posted on X on March 3, 2025. It is no longer a secret that Tel Aviv is deliberately starving Palestinians, not just since October 2023, but as a systematic policy for almost two decades now. The question is how. After Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007, Israel placed restrictions on everything entering the enclave through crossings controlled by its military. “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” Dov Weisglass, a senior adviser to the then Israeli prime minister had said back then. Henceforth, Israel began to carefully calculate the amount of food Gaza precisely needed, allowing just that into the enclave. According to files released by the defence ministry two years later, the food calculation had applied the average daily requirement of 2,279 calories per person. An average adult needs 2,500kcal a day. Even before October 2023, 1.2 million of Gaza’s 2.2 million population was estimated to be facing acute food insecurity, and over 80pc were reliant on humanitarian aid, the Human Rights Watch noted in a report . Today, Cogat, the Israeli agency that controls aid shipments to Gaza, appears to be following the same policy. The agency’s records show that 319,926 tonnes of aid were allowed into the enclave between March and September, which is insufficient to meet the starving territory’s needs. As per the World Food Programme, Gaza needs more than 62,000 metric tonnes of food every month to cover basic humanitarian needs for its population. Even if every bag of flour or can of beans were handed out equitably, starvation and hunger in Gaza were inevitable. In March and April, after Israel resumed attacks on Gaza following the ceasefire violation, the enclave was under a total siege, with no food allowed to enter. By May, Netanyahu succumbed to growing international pressure and allowed only a trickle of aid to enter the Strip, which didn’t prevent but delayed the famine. Between May and July, a meagre 116,030 tonnes of aid entered Gaza; one-third of the required food never reached the territory. By August, a famine was officially declared. And all of this happened as hundreds of trucks, carrying humanitarian aid sufficient to feed Gaza for three months, waited a few kilometres from the Strip, awaiting Israeli approvals. “Just outside Gaza, in warehouses — and even within the territory itself — tonnes of food, clean water, medical supplies, shelter items and fuel sit untouched with humanitarian organisations blocked from accessing or delivering them,” said Rachael Cummings of Save the Children. “The Government of Israel’s restrictions, delays, and fragmentation under its total siege have created chaos, starvation, and death.” A woman carries empty cardboard boxes as Palestinians receive aid supplies from the US-backed GHF, in the central Gaza Strip, on August 1, 2025 — Reuters Like a hawk eyeing its prey, Israel has exercised complete control over the aid entering Gaza ever since the beginning of its onslaught on the Strip. A recent analysis of food availability, conducted by the IPC, showed that from October 2023 to December 2024, there was a considerable caloric deficit in the enclave, as only 1,640kcals per person were available every day. By May 2025, this number fell to just 1,400 calories or “67pc of what a human body needs to survive”. “Before the war, Gaza was receiving about 500 aid trucks daily,” Nebal Farsakh, spokesperson of the Palestine Red Crescent, told Dawn.com . “But the trucks entering the enclave now are in mere dozens, which does not even scratch the surface of its needs.” “It is a drop in the ocean.” According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, after the resumption of hostilities in March, only 35pc of 1,445 humanitarian missions were facilitated by Israeli authorities, while 810 were impeded or denied. Israel’s recent changes in its policies, requiring all humanitarian trucks to be accompanied by its security escorts, have further impacted humanitarian logistical operations. The lack of escort capacity has already caused suspensions on some humanitarian supply corridors, while previously authorised items such as nutrition, health, hygiene and water treatment aid face longer delays than food items, noted the IPC report. Even if aid trucks do manage to cross the rigidly guarded Gaza border, what they carry is rarely ever sufficient to meet the needs of Palestinians. “The goods that come through the crossing are very limited,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a human rights activist and writer in the enclave. “For example, meat of any kind is not allowed in. The reliance remains on canned foods, legumes and cheese.” “We went through a period where we didn’t have flour or bread … we had to eat rice instead, and we rationed bread carefully to keep some for the next day. At first, breakfast might have been za’atr and olive oil, but even those ran out, so we depended mainly on fava beans,” she recalled. Other times, the trucks are hijacked and looted or seized by criminal groups supported by Israel to break down civil order in the Strip and prevent aid deliveries, Nour added. While Palestinians always knew who funded these gangs, mounting evidence has recently surfaced, laying bare Israel’s glaring role in mobilising criminals in Gaza. On June 5, Netanyahu admitted : “The government has activated powerful local clans in the enclave on the advice of security officials.” Earlier, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that sources in Gaza claimed one such group Bibi referred to consisted of roughly 100 armed men operating with the implicit support of the Israeli military. The New Humanitarian, a not-for-profit newsroom, described the gangs as “big and very dangerous”. They are especially located in areas where aid is entering or being distributed. “They loot UN trucks, selling the goods at inflated rates — or sometimes the food just disappears altogether … they also steal food directly from other people who risk their lives to get aid from distribution centres.” What these gangs steal is sold into the market at exorbitant rates; sugar now costs 300 times more than it did before the war, same is the case with flour and beans. As per the IPC report released in August, July food prices in Gaza increased by 25pc to as much as 9,900pc compared to the February ceasefire levels, and by 233pc to 15,285pc compared to the pre-war prices. The highest fluctuations were seen in wheat flour — which has become both a bane and boon for Palestinians — up to $30 in June and coming back down to around $15 in July. A displaced Palestinian woman cooks amid ongoing food shortages in Gaza on July 28. — Reuters Qusay Qasem, 22, is among the thousands of Palestinians for whom fetching bread has become a fatal exercise. A resident of North Gaza, which has been declared a combat zone, he has to risk his life every day to secure a piece of bread. But the markets, now merely a remnant of what they used to be before the war, are nearly inaccessible. The IPC has found that Palestinians face extreme challenges reaching markets across the Strip, with 82pc of households in Deir al-Balah Governorate, 76pc in Khan Younis Governorate, 72pc in Gaza Governorate and 66pc in North Gaza Governorate unable to reach markets. “Instead, I head to aid distribution centres, where bullets pour down on us,” Qasem told Dawn.com . “I have escaped death several times. Yet, I return alive each time because I know my family is waiting for that one sack of flour, that one loaf of bread.” Bakeries, previously a reliable source of food — particularly bread — for a majority of Palestinians like Qasem, have remained closed since April 2025. Most of them have been bombed, and the undamaged ones are out of reach. Of the 29 bakeries in Gaza, 13 are now in evacuation and militarised zones, while none of the previous bakeries in North Gaza, Rafah, and Khan Younis are accessible due to the movement restrictions imposed by Israel. Before the war, many Gazans relied on the enclave’s fertile lands for sustenance and livelihood. But two exhausting years of Israeli aggression have snatched that. All that remains is rubble, dust and despair. According to an assessment by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, Gaza’s agrifood system faces a near-total collapse. About 86pc of cropland has been damaged, with over 91pc land inaccessible to farmers and only 1.5pc of arable land in use. Agriculture previously supplied most of the Strip’s fresh vegetables, eggs and milk. In fact, some of its top exports included strawberries, dates, olives, and flowers. A similar situation persists with livestock, most of which have been killed; only 26pc of sheep and 34pc of goats remain, ceasing the commercial production of poultry, cattle and dairy. With the Israeli ban on access to the sea — the beach that was once a source of solace, laughter and barbeques — over 72pc of fishing assets, including boats, aquaculture, farms and cold storage have been destroyed. With its 24-month-long aggression in Gaza, Israel has systematically robbed the enclave of its ability to feed itself, forcing Palestinians to now depend almost entirely on irregular food aid and imports. This is not just an erasure of life, but also dignity. And the FAO agrees, explicitly describing Gaza’s crisis as an “entirely man-made catastrophe, driven by access restrictions and bombardment rather than natural causes”. Families like that of Nour, who still have some financial stability enabling to purchase food, also face massive hindrances in terms of preparation because of the complete lack of fuel and gas — the latter hasn’t entered the enclave since February 2025. As a result, Gazans must now rely on burning rubbish to light their stoves. “Staple foods such as lentils and wheat flour, if poorly cooked, are not well digested by the body, reducing its ability to fully absorb and use the nutrients,” the FAO told Dawn.com . Thus, even for households that can sporadically access food, they often lack the means to safely prepare it. In addition to this, the IPC report highlighted that basic cooking implements continue to be in short supply due to the constant displacement of populations. Nearly 800,000 Palestinians have been displaced since the end of the ceasefire on March 18, with almost 350,000 since the escalation of May 15 alone. Most of the population has been displaced multiple times across Gaza Governorate, Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis governorates. Across these governorates, around 20pc or more of the population has been displaced three to six times, with at least 4pc across all three areas displaced seven or more times. Map by OCHA, October 1, 2025 Continued and frequent displacement erodes household capacity to cope as essential assets such as shelter materials, storage items, water, and food may be lost along the journey, especially given the limited notice that people have to evacuate or relocate from approaching hostilities, the report noted. Before the war, Hani Abufayez was recognised across Gaza as a successful businessman. He ran a consulting office and lived in a villa with his family of eight. Today, he lives in a tent after being displaced not once but at least thrice. “I survive on very little money … my fears grow with each passing day. I fear my family and I could be killed at any moment, or die of hunger.” “The reality is that Israel has turned Gaza into a death zone where there is no place for life anymore.” It didn’t just rain down bombs on the enclave, but also ran a planned campaign there, using “food and aid as a weapon to humiliate, weaken, displace and kill Palestinians”. Systems breakdown The dismantling of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees was a part of this campaign. For decades, Palestinians have relied on the organisation for aid. “It is the only agency with real experience in humanitarian relief,” said Khalil Abu Shama, a human rights defender in Gaza. “I am considered a part of the third generation of the Nakba of 1948. I completed my primary and preparatory education in UNRWA schools. I grew up witnessing the agency providing its services to refugees in various fields. I completed my studies, and throughout my long career in the field of human rights, there was continuous coordination between us and UNRWA,” he reminisced. The UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly on December 8, 1949, to provide basic support, including food, healthcare and education to Palestinian refugees, who were displaced during the Nakba. It supports about six million Palestinian refugees, residing both within and outside Palestine, and provides direct services such as schools, health centres and other social services. Before Israel launched its offensive in Gaza, about a million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were sheltering in UNRWA schools, clinics and other buildings run by the agency. Meanwhile, nearly the entire population of the Strip relied on it for basic necessities, including food, water and hygiene. “It was our lifeline, both before the war and especially after Oct 7, 2023,” emphasised Shama. But just the way it did with everything else, Israel deprived Palestinians of this support as well. On January 30, Tel Aviv banned the UNRWA, months after the Israeli parliament passed two bills : one, barring the agency from activity within Israel and the second banning Israeli authorities from any contact with it, essentially breaking a 1967 treaty that allowed the agency to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control. The action was taken after Israel accused 18 UNRWA employees of participating in the Oct 7 attack on Israel. Subsequently, a probe was launched by the UN, which found that nine workers of the agency “may have” been involved in the attack and no longer work for it. But UNRWA has maintained that Israel never presented any evidence supporting its allegations, adding that it regularly provided Tel Aviv with a full list of its staff members. The agency has also accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, pressurising them into making false confessions about ties with Hamas. But Netanyahu and his government were adamant on dismantling UNRWA, something they have been advocating for a long time. Israel claims that the UN body “perpetuated” the issue of Palestinian refugees because it allows Palestinians to transfer refugee status across generations, which Tel Aviv refuses to accept. It is also not a mere coincidence that Israel’s allegations came the same day the International Court of Justice ordered it to prevent genocidal acts and scale up aid to Gaza. Soon after the Israeli allegations were aired, the US became the first country to announce the suspension of funding to the agency. Canada, Australia, Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, Japan, Austria and Romania soon followed. What happened next looks like this: Israel made UNRWA vacate all premises in occupied East Jerusalem, cease its operations by Jan 30, and cut short the validity of all visas for UNRWA’s international staff. Basically, the agency was evicted . “Stopping the UNRWA’s work and placing obstacles in the way of its continued presence in Palestine — especially in Gaza — is effectively a death sentence for large numbers of refugees who have lost everything, including the ability to secure food,” said Shama. A month later, in February 2025, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — backed by the very powers accused of engineering the starvation — was born. It promised relief. What it delivered, many in Gaza say, was something else entirely. The death trap Dr Sami Alastal, a writer and political analyst based in Gaza, has lost 20 kilos since October 7, 2023. “We do not have any food, and if it is available, it is in very small quantities,” he rued. Yet, he refuses to visit the GHF aid distribution centres. “It is a scam,” he said. “It is a killing and torture squad disguised as a humanitarian organisation.” Dr Sami’s sentiments were echoed by a majority of Palestinians Dawn.com spoke to, who, despite the catastrophic levels of starvation and hunger in the enclave, refuse to visit the GHF-run stations. They see the distribution process as “humiliating to our humanity and dignity”. “We live near the Netzarim area, from where we see people heading to aid distribution sites,” said Nour Abu Shammala, a Palestinian human rights activist. “The process of entry and aid distribution is manipulated by the [Israeli] occupation to create chaos, and so for us it is unacceptable.” She shared how these aid distribution sites were located in areas described as “execution grounds” for civilians. “I heard about the crimes in Netzarim on television, watched them unfold from my house, but never went there myself.” Qusay Qasem, who has no choice but to visit the GHF centres, calls them traps. “It is akin to walking into your death … at any time, the Israeli military starts indiscriminately firing at us, there are bullets everywhere,” he recalled. “I have seen fellow aid seekers fall dead or wounded as I duck to the ground.” But even as bullets rain down on him, the 22-year-old Palestinian strives to reach the gates of the centre, his family’s shrunken faces flashing before his eyes. “I have to do it; they wait for a single piece of bread all day.” A displaced Palestinian girl takes a sip of lentil soup that she received at a food distribution point in Gaza City on July 25. — AFP This is exactly how Israel plays its game — it’s either death from guns or death from hunger. Here is how it is done: The journey begins hours before the aid site is set to open, often in early morning hours. The aid seekers are only allowed to bring their vehicles up to a certain point, which is at least 1.5km (a 12-20 minute walk) from the centre, and then cover the remaining distance on foot. This means that once — and if — they manage to secure sacks or boxes of aid, it must be carried back on foot. As the crowd keeps getting bigger, everyone is glued to their spots — unflinching for fear of losing out — waiting for the go-ahead signal, usually the buzz of drones. As soon as the signal rings through the now flattened Gaza, the walk begins, and, with that, the fear of death fills the air. “These centres are heavily guarded by the Israeli military, who encircle them with sniper nests, tanks and drones,” said Khalil Abu Shama. “The Israeli military monitors the movement of the crowd, sometimes opening fire even before the go-ahead signal.” “Every day between 10 and 50 civilians are killed without any clear explanation as to why, except that the occupation wants to slaughter as many people as possible in Gaza,” he added. On July 19, Israel killed at least 32 Gazans seeking aid near Rafah. According to an eyewitness, the shooting took place near a GHF aid distribution centre, adding that gunfire erupted from soldiers and tanks “as if they were in a battle with us”. Doctors who treated the wounded said they had severe gunshot wounds to the head and torso. The Israeli military, on the other hand, failed to provide any reason for the live fire. This is not something new for the Israeli military. They have been targeting aid coming into Gaza since the first month of the war. From October 2023 to 2024, Forensic Architecture has documented more than 322 attacks on aid, including workers and civilians, as well as 22 attacks on convoys transporting aid. Separately, during March and August this year, 64 incidents of the Israeli army opening fire on aid seekers were reported, of which 25 were around GHF centres, 19 in proximity to aid routes and seven during aid diversion. The vast majority of these shootings weren’t merely a mistake or misunderstanding. A report by Israeli newspaper Haaretz found that Israeli soldiers deliberately shot at unarmed Palestinians seeking aid in Gaza after being “ordered” to do so by their commanders. “We fire machine guns from tanks and throw grenades,” it quoted one soldier as saying. Another soldier said that between “one and five people were killed every day” where he was stationed in Gaza. “It’s a killing field,” he added. One of the authors of the Haaretz report, in an interview with Al Jazeera , said that the Israeli military’s orders to open fire on civilians were part of a method to “control” the aid seekers. “It’s actually a practice of … controlling the crowd by fire, like if you wanted the crowd to run off [from] a place, you shoot them at them, even though you know they are unarmed … You use fire to move people from one point to another,” Nir Hasson said. It almost translates to making Palestinians move to the tune of Israeli gunshots — not just a violation of their humanity but also of their dignity. “It is deliberate … Israel uses food as a tool of pressure,” Nour, the Palestinian human rights activist, pointed out. Meanwhile, Dr Alastal said: “Israel is using the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation to establish a military model of aid distribution wherein food is used as a weapon of war.” The same was also highlighted in the Forensic Architecture report. It explained how, for years, aid in Gaza was distributed through experienced humanitarian organisations such as the UNRWA, equipped to meet the needs of the enclave’s population. But after the war, just like every living thing in the Gaza Strip, these agencies too came under attack. Between March 2 and May 29, 2025, no aid was allowed to enter Gaza. During this period, Israel attacked aid warehouses and community kitchens, exacerbating the conditions of starvation. When aid trucks were finally permitted to re-enter Gaza at the end of May, ending the nearly three-month blockade, efforts to deliver supplies to warehouses faced significant challenges. To make matters worse, Cogat announced in July that Israel will gradually permit the entry of goods into the Strip under a new “private commercial sector” mechanism, in a bid to “increase the volume” of aid, while reducing reliance on aid collection by the UN and other international organisations. Palestinians gather for aid in Beit Lahia, Gaza, on June 17. — Reuters Simply put, Israel wanted complete control over the enclave. And this is how it was able to weaponise food distribution, ergo: The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. Per the FA’s findings, the previous UN-led distribution network in Gaza operated nearly 400 sites, whereas the GHF has only four of what it calls “mega sites”, a majority of which are located in the south, which the UN says is an attempt to relocate Palestinians from the north and depopulate it. “The military model dismantles the social fabric. In restricting the reach of any form of aid administration to the confines of the four ration stations, this model designates the remainder of the territory as something akin to a governance wilderness. “In this ungoverned territory, Israel promotes the lawlessness of criminal gangs and proxy forces. The attacks on aid workers, health workers, and community leaders are part of this,” the report noted. A method of war In this war, hunger is not incidental — and aid, under the GHF, is not compassionate. A report by the Jewish Voice for Peace lays it bare: from day one, GHF aid sites became kill-zones; “shoot at the crowds to communicate” were the instructions; distribution was concentrated in militarised zones and managed under Israeli oversight. This is aid designed to humiliate, corral, and control. And so we arrive at the darkest logic: to deliver bread is to own life. Gaza’s hunger cannot be undone by more trucks or rations — it must be undone by undoing the system that made hunger the weapon in the first place. Palestinians wait for food that was distributed by a charity organization in Gaza City on July 25. — Aandolu Agency Starvation in Gaza is not a byproduct of war — it is the method. This isn’t just the story of the last two years — the policy and actions go back two decades. What began as a blockade of goods has become a blockade of existence. Israel has built a system where food is not distributed but dispensed; where hunger is not a crisis to be solved but a condition to be managed. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the clearest example of this — aid designed not to relieve suffering but to regulate it. Every grain of wheat, every loaf of bread, is counted, rationed, and handed out under watchtowers and rifles. And still, the Palestinians resist. They refuse to let the act of eating become a performance of gratitude. In their hunger, they assert the one thing Israel cannot occupy — their humanity. In Gaza today, starvation has a geography, a policy, and an administration. It has checkpoints and drones, and waiting lines. It has signatures and seals. And that is the real tragedy — that the world has watched hunger become a bureaucracy. History will remember this war not just for the bombs that fell, but for the bread that didn’t.",

      "summary_orig": "IN the past week, it seemed attention was focused on the Middle East, Hamas, Israel and the much-discussed peace plan. But Pakistan is never far away from the excitement, even if it is overseas, and it was no different this time around — from discussions under the glare at the UN events to meetings in quiet rooms, tucked away from prying eyes, it appears Islamabad was always in the loop. But as events unfolded (to the dismay of some and the excitement of others), at home it also highlighted the dysfunctional and confused ways in which the government continues to behave. That Pakistan was working closely with Saudi Arabia had been evident for some time before the announcement of the defence pact . But that this collaboration was connected with the Gaza situation was only made public with the meetings held at the UN with United States President Donald Trump. One can only conjecture that the meeting at the White House with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief may also be linked to that. But those of us in Pakistan didn’t have to wait for long as the White House meeting with the Israeli PM and the joint press conference with Trump made public the plan to end the onslaught in Gaza. However, inexplicably, Sharif tweeted in favour of the Gaza plan quickly — perhaps too quickly. The rest of the countries that had been part of the meetings with the US president at the UN were more circumspect, especially as the details began to be made public. It took another couple of days before Ishaq Dar, foreign minister and deputy PM, realised the need to clear up the confusion. But how successful his efforts were is open to debate. Mixed messaging from the government or just confusion? It was hard to tell. What followed first was a press conference. But it was long and a bit unclear, and in this day and age of media management, where frequently journalists are guided as to what the headline-making quotes are, his words were left open to interpretation. This wasn’t just so in the immediate aftermath of the press conference but continued to be the case the next day too. One English-language newspaper, in its headline, spoke of Pakistan signalling a Gaza peacekeeping role, while another claimed that Pakistan was wavering because the Gaza deal draft had been changed. Mixed messaging from the government or just confusion? It was hard to tell at that moment. But when Dar repeated the mixed messages in parliament days later, it appeared as if the ambiguity was deliberate. It truly was a case of breadcrumbing, in the slang of today. Dar continued to argue the draft was changed but insisted that it was the only way to stop the Gaza bloodshed; the message was that there are few good choices and countries are forced to pick the least bad one. He dismissed the PM’s tweet as one made out of ignorance of the changes in the plan and insisted Pakistan continued to stick to its policy of a two-state solution. Unlike the Shama Junejo matter, he didn’t point the finger at the PM or distance himself from the matter. But this ambiguity takes on a different light against the background of the commentary by many media people who, too, are arguing about the necessity to end the Gaza war. The rest, they insist, will come and be thrashed out later — for now, whatever can be done to stop the killings. One can make a wild guess as to where these arguments are coming from. Is this simply a tightrope act, hoping to keep the rich allies happy as well as a populace which identifies with the Palestinians? Gossip in Islamabad has the answer but with little proof. Meanwhile, the government ends up looking dysfunctional and confused. But if this were the only issue, one could put it down to the complexity of Middle East politics, as the West keeps reminding us. However, the dysfunction is a product of more than just limited choices internationally. This came through in the other crisis the government had to contend with in Azad Kashmir. When the protests first began, the government’s reaction was one of arrogance. Little attention was paid to the matter. In any case, the PM and his deputy were far too busy with their foreign tours. The media, too, it appeared, was so busy with international events that the protests at home were ignored, and covered only by social media, despite the phone services having been suspended there. This dismissive attitude continued even as the protests turned bloody and lives were lost. The only sign that the government was aware of the matter was a reply given by ISPR during a question-and-answer session away from the cameras. Perhaps some intrepid reporter or observer provided the information to the media, in which the DG appeared confident that the government was in place in AJK and explained the need for everyone to pay taxes. However, the government abruptly began paying attention to the matter when the protests turned violent. First Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and then an entire retinue of PPP and PML-N leaders were selected to talk to the protesting Kashmiris. Overnight, the issue catapulted to the headlines and stayed there as the negotiating team acceded to most of the protesters’ demands. The need to pay taxes, one assumes, can wait. Did the change of heart come with the bloodshed or the inexplicable attack on the National Press Club in Islamabad? I, for one, am not privy to the decision-making. But it seems the government and media discovered the issue around the same time and the former rushed to resolve it. (And then we wonder why people believe social media and its lies.) But between both these incidents, the picture emerges of a government given to ignoring the larger context of politics in which it functions — until a possible explosive situation becomes a full-blown crisis and requires damage control rather than deft and timely management. This is a surefire recipe for disaster. The writer is a journalist. Published in Dawn, October 7th, 2025",

The rest, they insist, will come and be thrashed out later — for now, whatever can be done to stop the killings. One can make a wild guess as to where these arguments are coming from. Is this simply a tightrope act, hoping to keep the rich allies happy as well as a populace which identifies with the Palestinians? Gossip in Islamabad has the answer but with little proof. Meanwhile, the government ends up looking dysfunctional and confused. But if this were the only issue, one could put it down to the complexity of Middle East politics, as the West keeps reminding us. However, the dysfunction is a product of more than just limited choices internationally. This came through in the other crisis the government had to contend with in Azad Kashmir. When the protests first began, the government’s reaction was one of arrogance. Little attention was paid to the matter. In any case, the PM and his deputy were far too busy with their foreign tours. The media, too, it appeared, was so busy with international events that the protests at home were ignored, and covered only by social media, despite the phone services having been suspended there. This dismissive attitude continued even as the protests turned bloody and lives were lost. The only sign that the government was aware of the matter was a reply given by ISPR during a question-and-answer session away from the cameras. Perhaps some intrepid reporter or observer provided the information to the media, in which the DG appeared confident that the government was in place in AJK and explained the need for everyone to pay taxes. However, the government abruptly began paying attention to the matter when the protests turned violent. First Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and then an entire retinue of PPP and PML-N leaders were selected to talk to the protesting Kashmiris. Overnight, the issue catapulted to the headlines and stayed there as the negotiating team acceded to most of the protesters’ demands. The need to pay taxes, one assumes, can wait. Did the change of heart come with the bloodshed or the inexplicable attack on the National Press Club in Islamabad? I, for one, am not privy to the decision-making. But it seems the government and media discovered the issue around the same time and the former rushed to resolve it. (And then we wonder why people believe social media and its lies.) But between both these incidents, the picture emerges of a government given to ignoring the larger context of politics in which it functions — until a possible explosive situation becomes a full-blown crisis and requires damage control rather than deft and timely management. This is a surefire recipe for disaster. The writer is a journalist. Published in Dawn, October 7th, 2025",

Infirmities in the plan include the history of the Trump-Netanyahu axis to lure quarries with syrupy promises into death traps, as they did with Iran and Qatar. The trust deficit is thus an overarching challenge. Suppose the hostages were released, as the plan envisages — and it is way past the time they were since their living or dying is immaterial to Netanyahu’s murderous Hannibal Doctrine. What if Israel, with Trump’s support, then launches another widely expected attack on Iran? The discourse would change, wouldn’t it? And the idea of peaceful coexistence would in all likelihood be back to square one. This has happened before. People have won Nobel Prizes by promising Arab-Israeli peace. Why must this one be different, given that Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are the key players? Already, components of the genocidal ruling coalition in Israel see it as their religious duty to spit on Christians whose faces they get close to. They deal more viciously with Muslims, of course, whose lands they covet and claim ownership of through a dodgy and supremacist religious edict. The festering strife suits global hegemons. A potential trigger could be a Russian and Saudi agreement to step up oil production with adverse fallout for American hydrocarbon businesses. An Israeli-Iranian shootout would cynically staunch a potential oil glut. The flip side is that interdiction of oil flows would hand Russia a windfall. As the slaughter in Gaza showed, the region is enduring deeper ethnic polarisation. Britain mastered the use of religion and race to divide and rule, something it successfully carried out in Ireland before unleashing devastating experiments in Asia and Africa. The 1917 Balfour Declaration was timed to check the spread of Bolshevism in the Middle East. The antidote would forcibly truncate Palestine on religious grounds. Along the way, Lyndon Johnson loosened JFK’s tight leash on Israel to recraft the Zionist state as America’s unsinkable ship in the Mediterranean. The ties have never looked back. Trump’s Gaza plan is deemed to have the approval of Saudi rulers, though they are visibly absent from the negotiations. The prospect of Riyadh turning the settler colonial state into an equitable space for all three inhabitants of old Palestine would be tantamount to a miracle. Egypt, whose military dictatorship is funded by Riyadh as a quid pro quo for keeping the lid on the Egyptian hub of the religio-nationalist Muslim Brotherhood, is representing the paymaster in the talks with a grudging Netanyahu-led Israel. Before the events of Oct 7, 2023, Hamas was deemed a threat to Arab regimes more than to Israel. Netanyahu had reportedly aligned with Qatar to shore up hard-line Hamas as a foil to a moderate two-state-accepting Fatah. Was the Fahd plan a sleight of hand, an illusion, or the bus the Arabs missed? The plan was jolted when Muslim Brotherhood won the 2012 presidential elections in Egypt in the footsteps of Hamas outvoting Fatah in 2006. Both elections were cancelled by the West whose habit of dissolving uncomfortable democracies is legendary. The Anglo-American overthrow of Mohammad Mosaddegh’s elected government in 1953 in Iran reinstated the Shah as the first blow in the murky politics of oil. Israel’s prompting later foiled a religio-nationalist victory in the oil-rich former French colony of Algeria. Secular allies of the former USSR were next. Iraq, Libya and Syria were dismantled at Israel’s behest, with Saudi Arabia playing the staging post in all cases. Why then did the Saudis conjure a charming proposal on the Palestinian question in 1981? Was it to pre-empt the tide of mass fervour the Iranian Revolution threatened to unleash against incipiently anti-Palestinian Arab regimes? The Saudis unveiled their plan at the 1981 Fez summit of Arab leaders. It was barely two years into the Khomeini phenomenon. The threat became more dire when the Ayatollah met Yasser Arafat at his home in Tehran and set up an elite military guard called the Quds Force named after Jerusalem, sacred to Muslims. The Cold War was peaking as Crown Prince Fahd unveiled his proposals to the tense Fez meeting. For the first time in Arab discourse, it included the implicit recognition of Israel. Predictably, Iraq, Syria and Libya rejected Fahd’s implied two-state solution. Remember, in 1973, Saudi Arabia was leading the Arab oil embargo against US support for Israel. Shortly thereafter, the king who led the protest was shot dead by a royal nephew. The new incumbent promptly rowed back from a future stand-off with Israel. Trump’s so-called municipal deal for a greatly abridged Palestinian homeland is rooted in the Arab rulers’ fear of Palestine. It’s a slippery slope for both sides. The Zionist press is projecting Trump as a headscarf-wearing Hamas protégé and Netanyahu as a traitor to the cause of a ‘Greater Israel’. Was the Fahd plan a sleight of hand, an illusion, or the bus the Arabs missed? Consider the treasure on offer to decide: 1) Israel to withdraw from all Arab territory occupied in 1967, including Arab Jerusalem. 2) Israeli settlements built on Arab land after 1967 to be dismantled, including those in Arab Jerusalem. 3) A guarantee of freedom of worship for all religions in the holy places. 4) An affirmation of the right of the Palestinian Arab people to return to their homes and compensation for those who do not wish to return. 5) The West Bank and the Gaza Strip to have a transitional period under the UN’s auspices for a period not exceeding several months. 6) An independent Palestinian state should be set up with Jerusalem as its capital. 7) All states in the region should be able to live in peace in the region. 8) The UN or its member states to guarantee the carrying out of these provisions.

With the elements mentioned above routinely blamed for expensive electricity in the country, the failures of power sector regulators Nepra and the CPPA-G to effectively enforce regulation to protect consumer rights and financial interests have always escaped public scrutiny. The latest episode, in which an international coal supplier invoked force majeure to cancel a long-term contract with the Sahiwal power plant last year, compelling the latter to buy fuel at higher prices, is a case in point. Instead of penalising the defaulter through forfeiture of its performance guarantees to recover replacement costs for wrongly invoking the force majeure clause, Nepra and the CPPA-G decided to pass on the cost differential to power consumers in the form of a higher tariff. Not just that, the CPPA-G, rather than blacklisting the supplier, permitted it to continue the supply of coal under its long-term contract, and participate in and win a spot tender at a higher rate in June for the same power plant. That the two regulators failed to act against the defaulting supplier, and instead, effectively rewarded it for reneging on its contractual obligations, underscores just how weak and compromised the power sector’s regulatory framework has become. This failure is particularly indefensible given that industry data flatly contradicts the supplier’s justification for invoking force majeure. The firm had cited congestion at South Africa’s Richards Bay Coal Terminal and the flare-up with India in May this year as reasons for suspending deliveries. Yet, the record shows that other suppliers continued to meet their contractual commitments through the same terminal, while coal shipments to Pakistan from other traders remained uninterrupted. The real motive, it appears, was economic self-interest, with the supplier belatedly discovering that the agreed price discount was too steep for its comfort and thus choosing to walk away. Unfortunately, this is not the first time electricity consumers have been made to bear the cost of regulatory rot through their inflated bills. Nor, sadly, should it come as a surprise. The latest breach has only reaffirmed a familiar pattern where regulatory dysfunction seems to have been institutionalised. In Pakistan’s power sector, watchdogs too often become enablers and are complicit, whether by design or by neglect, in protecting private interests and defaulters rather than consumers.

Senior police officials told Dawn a group of armed men stormed into the Qazi Court building in the Maskan Kalat area, about 30 kilometres from Kharan city, at around 11:30am, while the judge was hearing cases. They held Judge Muha­mmad Jan and other court staff hostage, ransacking records and damaging office furniture and other items on the premises. “Armed terrorists stor­med into the court and set the courtroom and other sections of the Qazi Court on fire,” Deputy Inspector General of Police for Rak­h­shan region, Abdul Ha­yee Aamir Baloch, told Dawn. The court building was gutted, and the attackers also destroyed the court’s records. While fleeing after torc­hing the courtroom and other offices, the assailants kidnapped the judge at gunpoint. “The terrorists kidnapped the Qazi Court judge and also made off with two vehicles, including the judge’s official vehicle and that of a lawyer,” DIG Baloch said. Security forces, including the Frontier Corps, rushed to the site soon after receiving information about the incident. They cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace those involved in the attack and the kidnapping. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident so far.

      "summary_orig": "Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who was arrested by Israel when they intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla, called out world governments for continuing to enable Tel Aviv’s genocide in the Gaza Strip after she arrived in Greece on Monday. The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. The flotilla was intercepted by the Israeli navy, with commandos boarding the boats and arresting participants. Former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was also on board and is currently in Israeli custody. In her first public comments since her release by Israeli authorities, Greta emphasised that the real story is not the interception of the flotilla, but the genocide being carried out in the Gaza Strip. “The Global Sumud Flotilla was the biggest-ever attempt to break Israel’s illegal and inhumane siege by sea,” the Swedish activist said. “It is a story of global, international solidarity, of people stepping up when our governments fail to do so and people are saying ‘my leaders … who are supposed to represent me continue to fuel a genocide … they do not represent me’.“ She added that the mission even existing was “a shame”, condemning Israel’s “illegal and inhumane” siege of the enclave, as well as blocking routes for humanitarian aid. View this post on Instagram “Under international law, states have a legal obligation to act to prevent … to stop a genocide, including ending complicity, applying real pressure and ending arms transfers,” Thunberg said. “We are not even seeing the bare minimum from our governments,” she lamented. “Our international systems are betraying Palestinians. They are not even able to stop the worst war crimes from happening.“ Thunberg said she could “talk for a very, very long time” about her imprisonment and abuse at the hands of Israeli jailers, but insisted that it was not the story. She said the story was “Israel … continuing to worsen and escalate their genocide and mass destruction with genocidal intent; attempting to erase an entire population in front of our very eyes”. The Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced. Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.",

      "summary_orig": "The Gilgit-Baltistan Police on Monday said they had arrested eight facilitators of an attack the previous day on a religious leader from the proscribed Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) near the Central Police Office (CPO). Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed, who is the emir of the group’s GB and Kohistan chapter, was travelling along with police guards and a driver when the convoy came under fire. Police officials said the guards retaliated immediately, injuring some of the attackers, who managed to escape with the help of accomplices. The same day, a judge of the Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Court had also survived a brazen gun attack. Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway, Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest. Addressing a press conference to provide further updates, Inspector General of Police (IG) Gilgit-Baltistan Afzal Mahmood Butt said: “Eight actual culprits have been identified. Eight facilitators of theirs … have been arrested and in police custody,” he said. The police chief added that four vehicles used in the attack were also seized. He was holding a press conference alongside GB Home Secretary Captain (r) Syed Ali Asghar and Gilgit Deputy IG Raja Mirza Hassan. The GB police chief elaborated that eight suspects of the assassination attempt on the ASWJ leader and two suspects of the attack on the judge were identified, while four vehicles used in the former incident were also seized. IG Butt said the suspects involved in the attack would be arrested in a day or two and produced in court soon. He further added that a case was also registered after the two suspects who opened fire on Justice Malik Inayatur Rehman’s vehicle were identified. The police chief said that fingerprints and blood samples were obtained from the scene of the incident, which helped in identifying the suspects. The region’s top cop said that the police and investigation agencies are jointly investigating and based on initial evidence, they have identified the accused. Religious leaders from all sects had condemned the attacks, describing them as a conspiracy to sabotage peace in the region. Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam had also condemned the assassination attempt and ordered a high-level investigation. The minister directed authorities to use all available resources to ensure the swift arrest of the attackers. “Those involved in this heinous crime will not escape justice,” he said. GB Chief Minister Gulbar Khan had reiterated that no conspiracy against the peace of the region would be allowed to succeed. He had ordered the IG and law enforcement agencies to conduct a transparent investigation and immediately arrest the culprits. Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Speaker Nazir Ahm­ed Advocate, Deputy Spe­a­ker Sadia Danish, Oppo­sition Leader Kazim Mes­um, cabinet ministers, reli­g­ious leaders from var­ious sects, and civil society activists had all condem­ned the incidents and dem­anded a fair and tran­s­parent investigation.",

      "summary": "The Gilgit-Baltistan Police on Monday said they had arrested eight facilitators of an attack the previous day on a religious leader from the proscribed Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) near the Central Police Office (CPO). Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed, who is the emir of the group’s GB and Kohistan chapter, was travelling along with police guards and a driver when the convoy came under fire. Police officials said the guards retaliated immediately, injuring some of the attackers, who managed to escape with the help of accomplices. The same day, a judge of the Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Court had also survived a brazen gun attack. Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway, Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest. Addressing a press conference to provide further updates, Inspector General of Police (IG) Gilgit-Baltistan Afzal Mahmood Butt said: “Eight actual culprits have been identified. Eight facilitators of theirs … have been arrested and in police custody,” he said. The police chief added that four vehicles used in the attack were also seized. He was holding a press conference alongside GB Home Secretary Captain (r) Syed Ali Asghar and Gilgit Deputy IG Raja Mirza Hassan.

      "summary_orig": "Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam on Monday pressed the international community to help Pakistan in repatriating Afghan refugees to their country. Muqam was speaking at the 76th Session of the Executive Committee of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva, which is running from October 6-10, according to a press release from the ministry. “It is now our shared responsibility to facilitate safe and dignified return of displaced Afghans to their country. However, durable returns require investments, in countries of refugee origin for peace, stability, schools, clinics, and livelihoods to make return viable,” he was quoted as having said. Pakistan announced the phased repatriation of millions of Afghans in 2023 over security concerns and reasoning that the decades-long conflict had ended in Afghanistan. Currently, the repatriation of nearly 1.3 million registered Afghans is underway. Muqam said repeated calls for such support, alongside predictable multi-year funding for host countries such as Pakistan, had yet to be fully realised amid donor fatigue and delayed disbursements. The federal minister informed the delegates that for over four decades, Pakistan had generously hosted over 4m Afghan nationals, managing one of the world’s largest and most protracted refugee situations. “Despite our domestic problems, including economic pressures, security challenges and overstretched public services, we have upheld humanitarian principles by providing safety, access to education, healthcare, and livelihoods to the extent possible,” Muqam said. In the first phase, those who did not have any documents were repatriated, which was followed by the repatriation of those who held Afghan Citizen Cards. Muqam said Pakistan remained one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, adding that it had endured repeated climate-induced calamities, with this year’s devastating floods displacing millions, destroying infrastructure and causing huge economic losses. He further said the international community must support the UNHCR in creating conditions that make the return of Afghan refugees both desirable and sustainable. “When returnees are welcomed back with meaningful support, they can contribute to the recovery and progress of their societies. Provision of adequate, predictable, and flexible resources to UNHCR remains critical.” The minister pointed out that Pakistan continued to combat terrorism, which had severely impacted its people and economy over the years. “Over 90,000 Pakistanis have lost their lives, and the nation has endured staggering economic losses exceeding 150 billion dollars in this struggle. “These events have had far-reaching humanitarian, economic, and social impacts. Pakistan reiterates its call for the urgent start of the UNHCR’s Climate Resilience Fund and other financing mechanisms to support countries most affected by climate change.” He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to partnering with the international community to find durable solutions to humanitarian situations. The minister cited three imperatives: first, urgent investment in the countries of refugee origin for stability and reintegration; second, timely and predictable international support to offset the burdens on host communities; and third, fast-track resettlement in third countries. The minister also said that displacement continues to be a serious global challenge. He said that more than 132m people worldwide were forcibly displaced, including due to conflicts, persecution, violence and climate-induced disasters. “Clearly, most of these humanitarian crises are man-made. On the other hand, resources needed to respond to the growing needs of forcibly displaced worldwide are shrinking rapidly.”",

      "summary_orig": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Monday called Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Karachi for an urgent meeting as tensions continued to rise between the Sindh and Punjab governments, with the PPP staging a walkout from the National Assembly and Senate. The PPP and PML-N are coalition partners in the Centre. A post on X from the presidency said today that Zardari and Naqvi held a telephonic conversation related to the ongoing row between the Sindh and Punjab governments. “President Asif Ali Zardari spoke to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi over the phone to discuss the recent tensions between the Sindh and Punjab governments. The president has called the interior minister to Karachi for an urgent meeting in this regard,” the post said. The PPP and the PML-N’s Punjab leadership have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues ranging from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government. The war of words between the two sides initially kicked off over flood compensation but expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP lawmakers decided to stay away from parliamentary proceedings last week to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs subsequently met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces. However, she declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47. The now-shelved six-canal project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his elder brother and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday and discussed with him the ‘growing tensions’ between the PPP and PML-N, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon alleged a day ago that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government. Partners continue to trade barbs as PPP stages walkout from Senate, NA The coalition partners continued to trade barbs today as Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari vented that the province had always played the role of a “big brother” during any natural calamity. She said the Punjab cabinet expressed regret that when the province passed through the challenges of the recent floods, the moment was seized and used for the sake of politics and interests. “The chief minister said she was saddened and, in her own words: ‘It is difficult for me to forget this. I didn’t expect that Punjab would be treated this way.’” Bokhari also assailed Memon for his remarks and said a “planted campaign” was being run against CM Maryam. “Ask all these people doing press conferences what they have done for flood affectees,” she said, also taking a dig at Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab. The Punjab minister further said that she accepted Memon’s challenge to have a debate. Responding to her, PPP Senator Quratulain Marri said Bokhari had a “phobia” of Sindh. “PML-N’s declaration of war against Sindh is a dangerous precedent, the consequences of which will not be good for the country,” she said. Marri also reiterated Memon’s allegation that the Punjab government was actually targeting the PPP to weaken the Centre and PM Shehbaz. In a video message, PPP Senator and Senior Vice President Sherry Rehman said the party had said nothing to suggest that it was manipulating the issue of floods and aid for politics. “If we are demanding relief for the people of Punjab and someone feels bad about it, that’s strange; Punjab is not anyone’s personal estate.” Speaking in the Senate later, she said the PPP had great concerns and the federation was in “sheer need” of stability amid the devastation wrought by the floods. She said it was “clear” that the “war of words” between Punjab and Sindh was affecting the federal coalition, saying that the PPP strove to maintain unity during tough times but when “lines were crossed”, the “Punjab card” was used and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s run as foreign minister was criticised, then such statements and remarks crossed the bounds of criticism and decency. Rehman added that the PPP had never managed a coalition before in such a manner and said that apologising did not lead to a decline in self-respect and stature but only increased them. “If our leadership is not apologised to, then the PPP is the biggest party in the Senate, count the numbers, we are by far the biggest party in this House and don’t take our support for granted in the coalition benches. We don’t want to break anything, but don’t take our support for granted. That is very clear,” she announced before leading a walkout of PPP senators from the proceedings. Responding to her, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said everyone had a right to protest under a democratic system, but ebbs and peaks were also a part of it. Tarar said he tried his best in the National Assembly that the recent statements from both sides did not affect parliamentary functioning. He highlighted that PML-N Senator and PM aide Rana Sanaullah had assured the PPP in the Senate that water distribution from the Indus River would only be carried out under the Irsa pact. The law minister also appreciated that Rehman voiced her party’s grievances in a “very sophisticated” manner, adding that President Zardari and Nawaz were both leaders favouring “reconciliation”. Addressing the opposition, the law minister stressed that the ongoing tensions were an “ordinary change in temperatures”. At this point, Senate Deputy Chairman Syedaal Khan, who hails from the PML-N, called on his party’s Anusha Rehman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu, as well as on Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Amir Waliuddin Chishti to go and convince the PPP lawmakers to return to the Upper House. Meanwhile, PTI Senator Ali Zafar quipped that they were witnessing a “historic contest” between the coalition allies. “The contest is very interesting. It is about who served [the people] better during the floods.” The PTI senator said that “surely the PPP prepared and may have prevented Sindh from being flooded, but only in books, not in reality”. Noting the Punjab government’s assertions of providing ample rescue and relief services, Zafar claimed, “Surely they must have given the aid, but this is strange and perplexing aid because it did not reach the flood victims, but perhaps went into their pockets.” The PTI senator assailed both government parties for contesting over “who held more press conferences rather than who built more houses”. Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser welcomed the PPP’s “friendly fire” amid applause from the opposition. “I feel that if they are serious, they should come and present a vote of no confidence, we will side with them.” His suggestion came after PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said that it was hard for his party to continue to participate in proceedings until it was given assurances by Punjab or any other authority. Ashraf subsequently led a walkout of PPP lawmakers from the Lower House. PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro addressed Qaiser’s suggestion in an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’ and said a mere sentence could not do anything and “reliablility” needed to be considered. “I don’t know how reliable the PTI are, has he talked to his party founder?” he said.",

He highlighted that PML-N Senator and PM aide Rana Sanaullah had assured the PPP in the Senate that water distribution from the Indus River would only be carried out under the Irsa pact. The law minister also appreciated that Rehman voiced her party’s grievances in a “very sophisticated” manner, adding that President Zardari and Nawaz were both leaders favouring “reconciliation”. Addressing the opposition, the law minister stressed that the ongoing tensions were an “ordinary change in temperatures”. At this point, Senate Deputy Chairman Syedaal Khan, who hails from the PML-N, called on his party’s Anusha Rehman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu, as well as on Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Amir Waliuddin Chishti to go and convince the PPP lawmakers to return to the Upper House. Meanwhile, PTI Senator Ali Zafar quipped that they were witnessing a “historic contest” between the coalition allies. “The contest is very interesting. It is about who served [the people] better during the floods.” The PTI senator said that “surely the PPP prepared and may have prevented Sindh from being flooded, but only in books, not in reality”. Noting the Punjab government’s assertions of providing ample rescue and relief services, Zafar claimed, “Surely they must have given the aid, but this is strange and perplexing aid because it did not reach the flood victims, but perhaps went into their pockets.” The PTI senator assailed both government parties for contesting over “who held more press conferences rather than who built more houses”. Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser welcomed the PPP’s “friendly fire” amid applause from the opposition. “I feel that if they are serious, they should come and present a vote of no confidence, we will side with them.” His suggestion came after PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said that it was hard for his party to continue to participate in proceedings until it was given assurances by Punjab or any other authority. Ashraf subsequently led a walkout of PPP lawmakers from the Lower House. PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro addressed Qaiser’s suggestion in an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’ and said a mere sentence could not do anything and “reliablility” needed to be considered. “I don’t know how reliable the PTI are, has he talked to his party founder?” he said.",
      "title": "Zardari calls Naqvi to Karachi as Sindh-Punjab row heats up; PPP stages walkout from NA, Senate",
      "summary": "President Asif Ali Zardari on Monday called Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Karachi for an urgent meeting as tensions continued to rise between the Sindh and Punjab governments, with the PPP staging a walkout from the National Assembly and Senate. The PPP and PML-N are coalition partners in the Centre. A post on X from the presidency said today that Zardari and Naqvi held a telephonic conversation related to the ongoing row between the Sindh and Punjab governments. “President Asif Ali Zardari spoke to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi over the phone to discuss the recent tensions between the Sindh and Punjab governments. The president has called the interior minister to Karachi for an urgent meeting in this regard,” the post said. The PPP and the PML-N’s Punjab leadership have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues ranging from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government. The war of words between the two sides initially kicked off over flood compensation but expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP lawmakers decided to stay away from parliamentary proceedings last week to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs subsequently met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces. However, she declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47. The now-shelved six-canal project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his elder brother and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday and discussed with him the ‘growing tensions’ between the PPP and PML-N, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon alleged a day ago that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government. Partners continue to trade barbs as PPP stages walkout from Senate, NA The coalition partners continued to trade barbs today as Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari vented that the province had always played the role of a “big brother” during any natural calamity. She said the Punjab cabinet expressed regret that when the province passed through the challenges of the recent floods, the moment was seized and used for the sake of politics and interests. “The chief minister said she was saddened and, in her own words: ‘It is difficult for me to forget this. I didn’t expect that Punjab would be treated this way.’” Bokhari also assailed Memon for his remarks and said a “planted campaign” was being run against CM Maryam. “Ask all these people doing press conferences what they have done for flood affectees,” she said, also taking a dig at Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab. The Punjab minister further said that she accepted Memon’s challenge to have a debate. Responding to her, PPP Senator Quratulain Marri said Bokhari had a “phobia” of Sindh. “PML-N’s declaration of war against Sindh is a dangerous precedent, the consequences of which will not be good for the country,” she said. Marri also reiterated Memon’s allegation that the Punjab government was actually targeting the PPP to weaken the Centre and PM Shehbaz. In a video message, PPP Senator and Senior Vice President Sherry Rehman said the party had said nothing to suggest that it was manipulating the issue of floods and aid for politics. “If we are demanding relief for the people of Punjab and someone feels bad about it, that’s strange; Punjab is not anyone’s personal estate.” Speaking in the Senate later, she said the PPP had great concerns and the federation was in “sheer need” of stability amid the devastation wrought by the floods. She said it was “clear” that the “war of words” between Punjab and Sindh was affecting the federal coalition, saying that the PPP strove to maintain unity during tough times but when “lines were crossed”, the “Punjab card” was used and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s run as foreign minister was criticised, then such statements and remarks crossed the bounds of criticism and decency. Rehman added that the PPP had never managed a coalition before in such a manner and said that apologising did not lead to a decline in self-respect and stature but only increased them. “If our leadership is not apologised to, then the PPP is the biggest party in the Senate, count the numbers, we are by far the biggest party in this House and don’t take our support for granted in the coalition benches. We don’t want to break anything, but don’t take our support for granted. That is very clear,” she announced before leading a walkout of PPP senators from the proceedings. Responding to her, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said everyone had a right to protest under a democratic system, but ebbs and peaks were also a part of it. Tarar said he tried his best in the National Assembly that the recent statements from both sides did not affect parliamentary functioning.

      "summary_orig": "Violence has surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said on Monday. In a quarterly report, CRSS reported a 46 per cent rise in fatalities, including civilians, security personnel and terrorists, compared to the previous quarter. The thick tank recorded 901 fatalities and 599 injuries resulting from 329 incidents of violence, including terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations. The report noted that this year is on track to be deadlier than 2024 — already the most violent year in a decade. The surge reflects an “intensification of militant violence and the expanded scale of counter-terrorism operations”, CRSS said. “With an entire quarter still remaining, … 2025 is on course to surpass last year’s toll,” the report read. “If the current trend continues, 2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade.” There were 2,414 deaths in the first three quarters of 2025, nearing the 2,546 fatalities reported in 2024, according to the think tank. The report added that when comparing casualty numbers from January to September 2024 (1,527 fatalities) to this year, 2,414 fatalities were recorded within the same period — an increase of 58pc. “However, the source of fatalities has shifted; in 2024, security operations caused 505 deaths (33pc of the total), while terror attacks claimed 1,022. In 2025, security operations accounted for 1,265 deaths — over half of the total fatalities. This shift underscores how the state’s response has intensified, with security forces inflicting heavier losses on militants,” the report read. Attacks have increased since the withdrawal of US-led troops from neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, with the federal government accusing the Taliban authorities of sheltering terrorists — a charge they deny. However, the United Nations has warned of a “permissive environment” for militant groups in Afghanistan. Government officials told AFP in September on condition of anonymity that the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — designated Fitna al Khawarij by the authorities — had increased in recent months. That same month, opposition lawmakers accused the military of carrying out an air raid on militant hideouts that killed children. Local village councils have repeatedly warned that sweeping counter-terrorism operations would risk harming civilians.",

Attacks have increased since the withdrawal of US-led troops from neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, with the federal government accusing the Taliban authorities of sheltering terrorists — a charge they deny. However, the United Nations has warned of a “permissive environment” for militant groups in Afghanistan. Government officials told AFP in September on condition of anonymity that the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — designated Fitna al Khawarij by the authorities — had increased in recent months. That same month, opposition lawmakers accused the military of carrying out an air raid on militant hideouts that killed children. Local village councils have repeatedly warned that sweeping counter-terrorism operations would risk harming civilians.",

      "title_orig": "Nobel medicine prize goes to researchers studying immune system precision",
      "summary_orig": "American scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for work shedding light on how the immune system spares healthy cells, creating openings for possible new autoimmune disease and cancer treatments. This year’s prize relates to peripheral immune tolerance, or “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”, said Marie Wahren-Herlenius, a rheumatology professor at the Karolinska Institute. Sakaguchi told reporters outside his university laboratory that “I feel it is a tremendous honour”, Kyodo news agency reported. Regulatory T cells: the immune system’s ‘security guards’ The winners for medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute medical university and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2m), as well as a gold medal presented by Sweden’s king. Brunkow is senior programme manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, while Ramsdell is scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi is a professor at Osaka University in Japan. “Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example, for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement. The laureates identified so-called regulatory T cells, which act as the immune system’s security guards that keep immune cells from attacking our own body, it added. After announcing the winners, the institute’s Thomas Perlmann said specific therapies had yet to win market clearance, but more than 200 trials on humans involving regulatory T cells were ongoing. Among companies in the early race, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which Ramsdell co-founded, is partly funded and supported by US drugmaker Regeneron to work on therapies against diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. Also targeting that condition, Quell Therapeutics has partnered with AstraZeneca.  Other biotech firms exploring the approach include Bayer’s BlueRock. Medicine the first prize of Nobel season The Nobel Prizes were established through the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite and a wealthy businessman. They have been awarded since 1901 for outstanding contributions in science, literature, and peace, with interruptions mainly during the World Wars. The economics prize was added later and is funded by Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank. Winners are selected by expert committees from various institutions. All prizes are awarded in Stockholm, except for the Peace Prize, which is presented in Oslo — a possible legacy of the political union between Sweden and Norway during Nobel’s lifetime. Past recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine include renowned scientists such as Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 award for discovering penicillin. In recent years, the prize has recognised major breakthroughs, including those that enabled the development of Covid-19 vaccines . Last year’s medicine prize was awarded to US scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA and its key role in how multicellular organisms grow and live, helping explain how cells specialise into different types.

      "summary_en": "American scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for work shedding light on how the immune system spares healthy cells, creating openings for possible new autoimmune disease and cancer treatments. This year’s prize relates to peripheral immune tolerance, or “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”, said Marie Wahren-Herlenius, a rheumatology professor at the Karolinska Institute. Sakaguchi told reporters outside his university laboratory that “I feel it is a tremendous honour”, Kyodo news agency reported. Regulatory T cells: the immune system’s ‘security guards’ The winners for medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute medical university and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2m), as well as a gold medal presented by Sweden’s king. Brunkow is senior programme manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, while Ramsdell is scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi is a professor at Osaka University in Japan. “Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example, for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement. The laureates identified so-called regulatory T cells, which act as the immune system’s security guards that keep immune cells from attacking our own body, it added. After announcing the winners, the institute’s Thomas Perlmann said specific therapies had yet to win market clearance, but more than 200 trials on humans involving regulatory T cells were ongoing. Among companies in the early race, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which Ramsdell co-founded, is partly funded and supported by US drugmaker Regeneron to work on therapies against diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease. Also targeting that condition, Quell Therapeutics has partnered with AstraZeneca.  Other biotech firms exploring the approach include Bayer’s BlueRock. Medicine the first prize of Nobel season The Nobel Prizes were established through the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite and a wealthy businessman. They have been awarded since 1901 for outstanding contributions in science, literature, and peace, with interruptions mainly during the World Wars. The economics prize was added later and is funded by Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank. Winners are selected by expert committees from various institutions. All prizes are awarded in Stockholm, except for the Peace Prize, which is presented in Oslo — a possible legacy of the political union between Sweden and Norway during Nobel’s lifetime. Past recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine include renowned scientists such as Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 award for discovering penicillin. In recent years, the prize has recognised major breakthroughs, including those that enabled the development of Covid-19 vaccines . Last year’s medicine prize was awarded to US scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA and its key role in how multicellular organisms grow and live, helping explain how cells specialise into different types.

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday termed his Malaysian counterpart’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”, which he said would further augment engagement in this sector between the countries. The PM’s remarks came in a post on X after he addressed a joint press conference alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya following bilateral talks between the two leaders. PM Shehbaz had also mentioned during the press conference that the Malaysian premier had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan. PM Shehbaz, who reached Malaysia yesterday on a state visit, further shared in his post that he had a “most productive exchange of views with my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya today”. “We held wide-ranging discussions on ways to further strengthen our historic partnership — focusing on trade and investment, climate, defence, education, and tourism.” The prime minister added that the two leaders also had an in-depth discussion on regional and global developments, including the situation in the Middle East and South Asia. Both prime ministers “reaffirmed our shared resolve to continue working together for the peace, progress, and prosperity of our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said. Mentioning a “gracious and impressive welcome ceremony at Perdana Putra”, he thanked the Malaysian PM for the “warm and generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation”. Moreover, he said: “We also reflected on Allama Iqbal’s philosophy that the strength of a nation and the destiny of its people lie in the awakening of the self. It is through faith, effort, and perseverance that people shape their destiny. “Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and I shared our deep admiration for Allama Iqbal, whose message of faith and self-renewal continues to inspire generations across the Muslim world.” PM Shehbaz concluded his post saying that he was “looking forward to continued Pakistan–Malaysia collaboration across all areas of mutual interest”. Pakistan presents ‘immense’ business opportunities: PM Separately, after addressing the Malaysia Business Forum alongside his Malaysian counterpart, PM Shehbaz said he “invited Malaysian companies to seize the immense opportunities Pakistan offers”. In a post on X, the prime minister termed Pakistan as a “nation with a skilled and youthful workforce , a rapidly expanding market, and an investor-friendly business environment”. “With our economic trajectory on the rise and reforms unlocking new sectors, Pakistan offers a highly promising investment destination in the region,” the premier asserted. Addressing the Pakistan–Malaysia Business and Investment Conference alongside his Malaysian counterpart, the premier said he had a very “constructive and productive” meeting earlier in the day with PM Ibrahim, “who is very keen” that bilateral business relations between the two countries should improve further. “This seminar is a testimony of our joint desire that this is an area where we must cooperate with each other.” “We have a youth bulge, which is a challenge and also a great opportunity, and both Malaysia and Pakistan wish to use this asset,” said the prime minister. He added that the youth can be provided training in information technology, artificial intelligence, vocational training and modern skills to transform the challenge into a “great opportunity”. Referring to the tourism potential of Pakistan, PM Shehbaz said this is another area in which both Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur can cooperate. He suggested that companies from both countries can hold discussions to promote tourism and this initiative has the potential to be a “game changer”. ‘Pakistan wants to join hands for mutually beneficial projects’ Earlier, PM Shehbaz said during the press conference with Ibrahim alongside him that Pakistan wanted to “join hands” with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects which allowed for expertise from the two countries to come together. The prime minister began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation, and called Malaysia a “second home”. “This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said. “The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser. “I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations. “Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas. “Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said. The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said. He noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism. “It will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come, it will increase and have a quantum jump,” he said. The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script , which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development. “These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said. He further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”. “When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said. Talking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said. He concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering. Later, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia. PM Ibrahim ‘extremely appreciative’ of Pakistan’s stance on Palestine In his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities. He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million. Ibrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”. “So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said. Calling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). “Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said. Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism. He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue. “We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave. “Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said. PM given guard of honour After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.” “He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said. “The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said. PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office. According to Radio Pakistan , Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier. Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement. “I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight. Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added. ‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’ The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.” Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",

He suggested that companies from both countries can hold discussions to promote tourism and this initiative has the potential to be a “game changer”. ‘Pakistan wants to join hands for mutually beneficial projects’ Earlier, PM Shehbaz said during the press conference with Ibrahim alongside him that Pakistan wanted to “join hands” with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects which allowed for expertise from the two countries to come together. The prime minister began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation, and called Malaysia a “second home”. “This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said. “The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser. “I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations. “Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas. “Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said. The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said. He noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism. “It will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come, it will increase and have a quantum jump,” he said. The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script , which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development. “These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said. He further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”. “When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said. Talking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said. He concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering. Later, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia. PM Ibrahim ‘extremely appreciative’ of Pakistan’s stance on Palestine In his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities. He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million. Ibrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”. “So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said. Calling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). “Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said. Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism. He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue. “We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave. “Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said. PM given guard of honour After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.” “He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said. “The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said. PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office. According to Radio Pakistan , Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier. Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement. “I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight. Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added. ‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’ The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact. “The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read. It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.” Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistani-origin British lawmaker Shabana Mahmood has come under fire after announcing on Sunday that she would grant the police new powers to impose restrictions and conditions on repeat protests, amid a rise in pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the UK. UK police would be given greater powers to restrict protests as Mahmood said repeated large-scale pro-Palestinian demonstrations had caused “considerable fear” for the Jewish community. The government initiative follows last week’s deadly knife and car-ramming attack on a synagogue in the northwestern city of Manchester. “The strengthening of the legislation that I am going to bring about is based on the ability of the police to place conditions and restrictions on protests,” she said in a video posted on her X account. “What I will be making explicit is that cumulative disruption … the frequency of particular protests in particular places is in and of itself a reason for police to restrict or place conditions.” In an interview with the BBC , she further maintained that the move was not about a ban but about “restrictions and conditions”, such as relocating a demonstration and changing the time of protests. “What I will make clear in the law is [that] cumulative disruption is in and of itself a reason to place restrictions,” Mahmood said. “There would be protests related to the conflict in the Middle East that would now come into the purview of these changes, as well as other protests.” When asked about the “dark step” of restricting the fundamental right to protest, the home secretary said, “I don’t think it’s offensive to ask people to show a little humanity towards a community that has suffered such a terrible tragedy … I think just because you have a freedom, it doesn’t mean you have to use it at every moment of every day.” View this post on Instagram This move garnered significant backlash from political figures, human rights groups, and other public figures across Britain. Lawmaker Zarah Sultana wrote in a post on X that the home secretary aimed to ban pro-Palestinian protests, adding that Mahmood was “not content with locking up pensioners and priests for opposing the ban on Palestine Action”. “She’s (Mahmood) violating our civil liberties and the right to protest — all while supporting the flow of arms to the apartheid genocidal state of Israel,” Sultana wrote. “I hope the ministerial car was worth throwing Palestinians under the bus.” In an interview with Sky News , UK Green Party leader Zach Polanski called Mahmood “deeply irresponsible” to conflate protests against the Gaza crisis and “weaponising” against the Manchester synagogue attack. “Democratic nonviolent protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, and I think it’s worrying when governments are increasingly trying to crush down dissent and using what is a brutal attack … to point at a protest and say people don’t have a right to speak out about a genocide,” Polanski said. British actor and comedian Tez Ilyas posted a photo of Mahmood from 2014, showing her at a protest with a pro-Palestinian picket sign. “Shabana Mahmood, before she was given access to the corridors of power,” he wrote in the caption.",
