      "summary_orig": "China condemned on Sunday the deadly suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad earlier this week, asserting that it “firmly supports” the Pakistani government in safeguarding national security and stability. “China is deeply shocked by the deadly explosion in Pakistan’s capital Islamabad and the heavy casualties it has inflicted. China mourns for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones. “China strongly condemns the attack, opposes any form of terrorism and firmly supports the Pakistani government in safeguarding national security and stability and protecting the safety of the people,” a statement by the Chinese foreign ministry said. Turkiye FM offers condolences over loss of life Separately, in a phone call with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan conveyed “heartfelt condolences on behalf of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, himself, and the brotherly people of Türkiye” over the loss of life in the attack, the Foreign Office (FO) said. FM Dar “thanked the Turkish leadership for their solidarity and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unshaken resolve to combat terrorism and protect its civilians,” according to the statement. “Both leaders also exchanged views on bilateral relations, matters of mutual interest, and key regional & international developments,” the FO added. The attack took place inside the mosque at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra, located in the Tarlai area of what is considered ‘rural Islamabad’, off Lehtrar Road on Friday. It left over 30 people dead and more 100 injured. Police officials said the blast occurred after Friday prayers, adding that the attacker was stopped at the gate of the mosque, where he detonated his explosive payload. Footage and photos from the blast site showed several bodies lying near the mosque’s front gate, with people and debris also strewn across the red-carpeted prayer hall. Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the mosque as people called for help. The brazen attack elicited an outpouring of grief from across the country, and prompted condemnations from most world capitals, as well as local political and religious groups. Authorities have pointed fingers at Afghanistan and India as the investigation into the incident continues. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said yesterday that four facilitators behind the suicide bombing, including the mastermind, had been arrested, saying the suspects were detained in overnight raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said multiple agencies launched an investigation immediately after the blast and carried out operations overnight. “I want to praise our agencies and the Counter-Terrorism Department in KP that all the people who were linked to the blast, including the masterminds, were arrested before 3am,” he added. After the blast, raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera and the facilitators and the mastermind were arrested. Naqvi claimed that the mastermind was an Afghan national, affiliated with the militant Islamic State (IS) group. “The terrorist involved in the incident got training in Afghanistan. How he was trained, his travel history tells everything,” Naqvi said. A KP police assistant sub-inspector was martyred during the overnight raids, while several personnel were injured, the minister added. He stressed that the network had been dismantled. “The entire ISIS network has been busted,” he said. Naqvi claimed there were at least “21 terrorist organisations” operating from Afghanistan. He alleged that the mercenaries shifted allegiance “to whoever paid them more”. “Someone is giving them funds, and they are getting dollars from somewhere,” he said, alleging India was providing funding and targets. “Those who were giving $500 are now giving $1,500… India has increased the funding three times after May,” he said.",

PTI leader Asad Qaiser told Dawn the party had neither postponed nor cancelled its protest programme. “The day will be observed as a National Day of Mourning and, at the same time, protests will be held across the country against rigging in the general election,” he said. Mr Qaiser said Feb 8 was not only about PTI founder Imran Khan and the party leadership. “It is a day on which the nation was deprived of democracy and the right to choose its representatives,” he said, adding that the party would hold protests and a shutter-down strike “with the masses” against the alleged electoral manipulation. He said PTI and the opposition alliance, Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), would continue their efforts to restore democracy and uphold the rule of law. He said that as many as 10 committees had been formed at international, national and provincial levels to mobilise support for the protest. He said that Feb 8 was a “day of humiliation” for the entire nation as people had been allegedly deprived of their fundamental right to elect representatives and became powerless. PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities. He alleged that law enforcement agencies had focused on arrests and crackdowns against PTI workers, resulting in weak security arrangements in the federal capital and leading to Friday’s bombing that left at least 36 people dead and scores injured. “If police had focused on the security of the federal capital, the suicide attacker may not have entered the city,” he claimed. ‘Silent agitation’ In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”. Party workers and office-bearers distributed pamphlets and met representatives of traders, students and transport unions to seek support for the strike. The party’s Punjab chapter prepared two pamphlets — titled Imran Khan qaid nahin (Imran Khan is not imprisoned) and Pakistan ki faryad — abhi ya phir kabhi nahin (Pakistan’s cry — now or never) — and directed its MNAs, MPAs, ticket-holders and office-bearers to distribute them door to door, in markets and at shops across the province. PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level. “The all-day-long protest and torch-bearing rallies are very important for our leader Imran Khan’s release from jail,” Ms Malik said. Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers, alleging harassment of families during search operations. Rallies at district, tehsil level in KP In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions have also agreed to join the party’s protest. PTI’s provincial information secretary Adeel Iqbal said elected MNAs and MPAs would lead the demonstrations in their areas. PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders. In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests. PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found.

Bilateral interaction is close to zero, while Pakistan has strong reasons to believe that its eastern neighbour is playing a key role in fomenting terrorism within its borders. This is unsustainable in the long run, as the threat of conflict is never far away when such a massive gulf of mistrust exists. And while India keeps harping on about the main obstacle to better ties being ‘terrorism’, which it alleges emanates from Pakistan, it is India which is bringing terrorism to this country. Meanwhile, the main flashpoint in South Asia remains the unresolved question of Kashmir. Though New Delhi would like to believe its own fiction that the Kashmir dispute has been ‘resolved’ by the scrapping of the occupied territory’s limited autonomy in 2019, the fact remains that internationally, Kashmir remains a disputed region. The lack of resolution of the Kashmir question results in a state of permanent insecurity in the subcontinent. We must not forget that both states fought a limited war after the Pahalgam episode last year. The threat of fresh conflict is ever-present as long as the dispute is not judiciously settled. Moreover, Indian repression in occupied Kashmir continues unabated. And when events such as Pahalgam occur, the plight of Kashmiris in the held region, as well as in India, becomes even more acute. They are punished doubly; because of their Kashmiri origin, as well as their Muslim faith. Human Rights Watch has documented Hindu mob attacks in India after the Pahalgam assault in which Kashmiri students and workers were targeted in various Indian states. UN human rights experts have reached similar conclusions. Furthermore, the UN experts have condemned “arbitrary arrests and detentions, suspicious deaths in custody, torture … lynchings” of Muslims including Kashmiris. These grim facts reveal the true face of the ‘world’s largest democracy’. Pakistan has consistently sought to bring India to the table in order to resolve the Kashmir question. Yet India, particularly under Narendra Modi, has arrogantly rejected the invitation. While New Delhi abhors the thought of third-party meditation in Kashmir, it is time international actors paid more attention to the issue. US President Donald Trump has on several occasions said he is willing to step in and help resolve the dispute. Last year, he claimed to have “stopped the war” between Pakistan and India, while adding that “I can solve anything”. He is welcome to try, perhaps using his Board of Peace as a platform to address the Kashmir issue.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Bangladesh has expressed keen interest in procuring freight wagons and passenger coaches after Pakistan offered the rolling stock at prices cheaper than those in other countries. A two-member delegation, headed by a senior Bangladeshi official, has also visited the Pakistan Railways (PR) carriage factory in Islamabad and the Mughalpura Workshop in Lahore to receive a briefing from the railway authorities and to witness the rolling stock manufacturing process, Dawn has learnt. According to the Lahore-based PR authorities, Mr Farhad Islam, Bangladesh’s Secretary for International Organisations and Consular Affairs and Designate D-8 Commissioner and Mohammad Iqbal Hussain Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan, visited the Mughalpura workshop on Friday. Muhammad Nasir Khalili, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Carriage and Wagons), briefed the delegation on the overall functioning, technical capabilities, and ongoing projects of the PR’s workshops. A short documentary highlighting the workshops’ operational and working strengths was also shown to the guests. Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector. The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing. The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam. On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits. PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement. In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation. In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009. In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh. Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "WITH the end of the first round of negotiations in Oman between Iran and the US, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and later President Donald Trump described the talks as good. But the situation in the Gulf remains poised on a knife-edge. A US carrier strike group led by USS Abraham Lincoln is within 1,000 kilometres of Iran and at least one more is reportedly ready to be deployed to the region from the Pacific. Many US aerial assets have also been moved to American bases in the region. Tehran has reacted by saying that such a military build-up does not contribute to creating a conducive atmosphere for talks; the commanders of the Iranian military and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps have made clear that Iran’s finger remains on the trigger. The IRGC commander also assured Iran’s Gulf Arab neighbours that in case of a US-Israeli attack on Iran, “our brothers” won’t be targeted but US bases on their soil will be legitimate targets. Earlier this week, Al Jazeera published what it claimed was the draft of the deal to be discussed between the US and Iran. Al Jazeera said the draft was presented to both sides by mediators from Qatar, Turkiye and Egypt. Under that proposal, “Iran would commit to zero uranium enrichment for three years, after which it would limit enrichment to below 1.5 per cent … Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium — including about 440 kilograms enriched to 60pc — would be transferred to a third country under the framework”. The Al Jazeera report said the proposal included a ban on Iran initiating ballistic missile attacks and a commitment by it not to transfer weapons or technologies to its allied armed groups in the region. Neither side has commented. Bizarrely, the draft made no mention of what the other side would offer in return in the shape of lifting of crippling sanctions. The Israeli-US plan is to eliminate threats to Israel. And Iran remains the only known threat to Israel. Iran refused to hold negotiations in Turkiye, with Qatar, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan also invited to the process, and stuck to its guns that negotiations start where they were interrupted when Israel and US attacked its nuclear and other targets in June last year. It seems to trust only Omani mediators. It was not just that the US decided to attack Iranian targets in bad faith, while negotiations were on, that enraged Iran; its experience of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which Iran agreed to limit its enrichment to 3.67pc, would also guide Tehran’s hand. Araghchi was the key architect of that accord as deputy to the foreign minister then. The JCPOA was concluded during the Obama administration with major Western powers and Iran. Even the limited sanctions relief agreed was withdrawn when Trump, bowing to the wishes of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the apartheid state of Israel, unilaterally tore up the accord and embarked on a maximum sanctions campaign. Over the following five years, Iran gradually abandoned its commitments, eventually enriching uranium to near weapons-grade (over 60pc) and limiting IAEA (the global nuclear watchdog) inspector access. Former Pentagon adviser and renowned nuclear expert Theodore Postol says Iran should be treated as an undeclared nuclear-weapons state. He says Iran had 13,000 centrifuges and needed a few arrays of 174 ‘cascading’ centrifuges each to enrich the ‘408’ kg of uranium (60 to 83.7pc enriched) it already had to make it weapons-grade and have a bomb in a matter of weeks. Prof Postol said he’d have advised the Iranians to do that because even after the JCPOA sanctions relief was minimal and, after the unilateral scrapping of the deal by the US, Iran had no obligation to comply. US experts like Prof Jeffery Sachs of Columbia University, retired Col Douglas Macgregor, a former senior adviser to the US defence secretary and former US military and UN weapons inspector Scott Ritter all believe the US, egged on by Israel, will be unwise to attack Iran as the latter’s sophisticated missile programme, developed and honed over decades of arms embargoes, and arsenal are too formidable for any nation to take chances with. (Their views are in various YouTube podcasts). Some of these experts have also said that Israel, and US military assets in the region, could suffer serious damage in Iranian missile attacks. In the event of US military personnel losses, the backlash in the US would be immense. All these experts are critical of US policies and may well be underplaying US military might. The Israeli-US plan for the region remains on course and that is to eliminate threats to Israel. Syria and Hezbollah have been neutralised, and the pro-Iran militias in Iraq are unknown in terms of their ability to threaten Tel Aviv. Iran remains the only known threat to Israel and intervened to try and stop the Gaza genocide. With the infiltration of Mossad agents in Iran which, in my view, has undermined local opposition to the clergy, it is clear that even if military strikes are stayed, attempts will still be made to fragment the country by manipulating its fringe fault lines from the Kurds to Azeris to (Iranian) Arabs to the Baloch. Were this fragmentation to happen, it would threaten the region in a way different to the fallout from military strikes. The Turks would be horrified with Kurds gaining traction on Iranian soil next to their border. Pakistan wouldn’t want more impetus to Baloch separatism from across its border with Iran. And, as Friday’s suicide attack in Islamabad demonstrated, IS and other sectarian-terrorist groups will get space to stir sectarian violence across the country. A lot is riding on these talks and all stakeholders will be wishing for a peaceful resolution, despite the Israelis continuing to pressure the US to do what it can’t do itself because its hyped-up murderous military machine is good to mostly kill unarmed Palestinians.

(Their views are in various YouTube podcasts). Some of these experts have also said that Israel, and US military assets in the region, could suffer serious damage in Iranian missile attacks. In the event of US military personnel losses, the backlash in the US would be immense. All these experts are critical of US policies and may well be underplaying US military might. The Israeli-US plan for the region remains on course and that is to eliminate threats to Israel. Syria and Hezbollah have been neutralised, and the pro-Iran militias in Iraq are unknown in terms of their ability to threaten Tel Aviv. Iran remains the only known threat to Israel and intervened to try and stop the Gaza genocide. With the infiltration of Mossad agents in Iran which, in my view, has undermined local opposition to the clergy, it is clear that even if military strikes are stayed, attempts will still be made to fragment the country by manipulating its fringe fault lines from the Kurds to Azeris to (Iranian) Arabs to the Baloch. Were this fragmentation to happen, it would threaten the region in a way different to the fallout from military strikes. The Turks would be horrified with Kurds gaining traction on Iranian soil next to their border. Pakistan wouldn’t want more impetus to Baloch separatism from across its border with Iran. And, as Friday’s suicide attack in Islamabad demonstrated, IS and other sectarian-terrorist groups will get space to stir sectarian violence across the country. A lot is riding on these talks and all stakeholders will be wishing for a peaceful resolution, despite the Israelis continuing to pressure the US to do what it can’t do itself because its hyped-up murderous military machine is good to mostly kill unarmed Palestinians.

Only time will tell how effective this approach will be. Meanwhile, in the current situation, political parties appear to be losing the capacity to view critical national issues through a political prism. This was evident in the recent discussion on Balochistan in both the National Assembly and the Senate. In this context, the parliamentary debate on Balochistan revealed rare unanimity, but also the absence of introspection. Across party lines in both the National Assembly and the Senate, lawmakers converged on two broad premises: first, that the grievances of the Baloch must be addressed, without specifying what those grievances are, and second, that terrorism cannot be defeated through condemnations alone. However, from a security-centric outlook, this consensus was rhetorical. The debate ultimately stopped short of engaging with the deeper political and structural causes that have allowed violence to entrench itself in the province. Several among the parliamentarians pointed to a long-standing failure to address public grievances, particularly the denial of political rights, economic opportunity and meaningful participation for Baloch youth. This governance vacuum, they argued, has been exploited by hostile external actors and violent networks. Questions were also raised about the credibility of counter-smuggling measures, with lawmakers openly asking how oil continues to flow from border regions to major urban centres despite the presence of extensive security and what concrete steps were being taken to curb foreign involvement. In sum, the parliamentarians raised each and every issue of Balochistan, which was also reflected in the resolutions passed by both Houses, and they unanimously condemned the recent terrorist attacks and praised the security forces, as well as called for zero tolerance, improved intelligence coordination and stronger border security. The resolutions projected institutional convergence among the executive, political leadership and the security apparatus. Viewing Balochistan’s issues through a single prism gives no room to diverse perspectives. Dissenting opinions, particularly calls for political engagement and reconciliation, were absent from the final consensus, though some voices were raised in this regard by a few opposition figures, including the NA opposition leader Mehmood Achakzai and Senator Jan Buledi in the Senate, who called for political engagement and reconciliation to address the long-standing issues in Balochistan. The overwhelming impression one was left with was that the ruling alliance has concluded that coercive power, rather than political reconciliation, is the only viable path forward. These resolutions also reflected concurrence with the country’s power elites under the perceived paradigm of a hard state. While we are not entering into an academic debate on the concept of the hard state, one major flaw is evident in the approach: it becomes fixated on a narrow vision, viewing issues through a single prism and losing the ability to accommodate diverse perspectives, which is the essence of political processes. This approach is manifesting itself at multiple levels, but Balochistan remains its prime victim, as the space for resolving the province’s complex issues through a political process has steadily diminished. Baloch and Pakhtun nationalist parties, most notably Akhtar Mengal’s Balochistan National Party (BNP), Dr Abdul Malik’s National Party (NP) and Achakzai’s Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), continue to advocate political reconciliation. Although Sardar Akhtar Mengal has recently adopted a more hard-line stance to protect his political space, these parties have historically built bridges between the federation and Balochistan. Mainstream political parties, particularly the PML-N and PPP, have at times listened to these voices, even though they ultimately failed to resolve Balochistan’s problems. The PTI is now politically aligned with PkMAP and occupies a similar position. However, once in power, these mainstream parties have done little; despite being aware of the ground realities in Balochistan, they have often avoided addressing them and instead followed the preferences of security institutions. A few political analysts justify the actions of the mainstream parties by arguing that Balochistan has only a few constituencies and is rife with political landmines, and that they have left the province to security circles in exchange for a few seats and a share in the provincial government. Sometimes it is hard to accept such arguments, as the situation in Balochistan is worsening by the day, and another challenge is that the bridge between mainstream parties and Baloch nationalist parties is collapsing. This is happening because of a two-way process. First, the nationalist parties are losing appeal in the province because of their pro-federation politics, which many perceive as pro-establishment, but they have also lost the latter’s trust, while right-wing movements and resistance sentiments are increasingly capturing their space. These nationalist parties have their own arguments and blame the state apparatus for pushing them into a corner through manipulated elections, and a large segment of the youth that previously remained under their influence now faces fewer barriers to joining violent movements resisting the state. Both the NP and BNP advocate political solutions and hope that the state, mainstream political parties, and nationalist parties can all regain what they have lost through political experimentation in the province. Recently, an NP senator proposed ‘national reconciliation’ on Balochistan, and BNP’s Sanaullah Baloch has advocated a ‘truth and reconciliation commission’ on Balochistan, which was once endorsed by the Balochistan Assembly; there are efforts in this direction. However, political solutions and reconciliation do not resonate within the current power arrangement of the ruling elite, which clearly favours a hammer approach and assumes that even a softer tone could undermine perceptions of its strength. Who has gained in this process? Clearly, beyond mainstream parties sharing power in Balochistan, the beneficiaries include the bureaucracy in its various forms, those managing the province’s finances, and segments of the security apparatus. However, one of the major beneficiaries has also been the violent actors who exploit this power structure. The writer is a security analyst. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",

During these operations, which started last Saturday, they said the security forces killed as many as 216 terrorists, while the bodies of five laborers were found during combing operation in Nushki. The bodies of labourers, who hailed from Sindh, were shifted to Quetta. They would be handed over to their families, the officials said.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The public health crisis triggered by unchecked increase in stray dog population once again came into the spotlight when two female polio workers and a policeman escorting the field staff were injured in separate incidents of animal attacks on Saturday. Sources said one female worker carrying out door-to-door vaccination campaign was attacked by a street dog in Zaman town, Korangi, while the other in the area of Malir Cantonment. The third incident, the sources said, was reported in the Quaidabad area where a policeman escorting the polio team was bitten by a stray dog. He was later treated at the Indus Hospital. Speaking to Dawn , a spokesperson for the Sindh Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) only confirmed the cases involving two female workers. EOC confirms two incidents involving as many female polio workers; cop bitten by stray dog receives treatment at Indus Hospital “Two incidents involving street dogs affecting polio workers were officially reported today in Korangi and Malir. The safety of our frontline workers is our highest priority, and we stand fully with our teams,” said EOC-Sindh spokesperson Minahil Mustafa. According to her, the cases were immediately managed as per the health and safety protocols, with full support from relevant departments. She explained that teams established for the polio vaccination drive at union council level included representatives from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, town municipal corporations and the local government and “such issues are promptly raised and addressed through these coordination mechanisms”. The government encouraged the media and community members to share any relevant information so targeted support and solutions could be provided in affected areas, she added. Rabies Prevention and Training Centre Manager Aftab Gohar of the Indus Hospital confirmed that a policeman engaged in polio-related duties reported at the hospital with dog-bite injuries on Saturday. “A 21-year-old policeman, escorting the polio workers, reported at our facility today with dog-bite injuries. His leg injury was classified as a Category II exposure,” he said, adding that he was provided treatment and asked to report back for follow-up doses scheduled on Day 3 and Day 7. This year, he pointed out, at least two to three polio workers with dog-bite injuries had received treatment at the hospital. One of the victims was a woman in her late 30s. “On a daily basis, however, 150 to 200 dog-bite [old and new] cases are reported at our facility,” he said. The official emphasised the need for controlling dog population, training healthcare providers in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and creating public awareness. It might be recalled that this week a rabies case was reported in Karachi, raising the total number of reported cases of the deadly infectious disease to three in the province. Last year, at least 22 people lost their lives to rabies. Over 41,000 dog-bite cases were reported at three tertiary care hospitals — over 16,000 at the Indus Hospital, over 12,000 at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and over 13,000 at Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.

      "summary_orig": "RAWALPINDI: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi on Saturday dismissed an application filed by PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan, seeking permission for a medical check-up by his personal doctors at Adiala jail. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court declined to grant access to Mr Khan’s private physicians inside the jail. Appearing for the PTI founder, counsel Faisal Malik argued that as a former prime minister, his client deserved the same medical facilities previously extended to other ex-premiers, citing Nawaz Sharif as precedent. He contended that Mr Khan was an undertrial prisoner and had the legal right to be examined by doctors of his choice. The lawyer also claimed that Adiala jail lacked adequate facilities for specialised eye treatment. Referring to Pakistan Prison Rules, Mr Malik said Rule 795 required that a prisoner’s family be informed before any medical treatment. He questioned why Mr Khan had been taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) late at night, stating that he had not been taken out of jail for three years. Denial of access to personal doctors, he argued, amounted to discriminatory treatment. Special Prosecutor Zaheer Shah opposed the plea, arguing that Mr Khan was on bail in the GHQ attack case related to the May 9 events and convicted in other cases, and therefore could not be treated as an undertrial prisoner whose custody could be regulated by a criminal court. He further maintained that the ATC lacked jurisdiction to issue directions regarding jail administration or medical arrangements. Under prison rules, he said, medical care was the responsibility of government-appointed doctors, with no provision for private physicians. After hearing both sides, the court dismissed the application. Separately, Mr Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum alleged on X that medical reports promised by the Supreme Court had not been provided to the family, urging the chief justice to take contempt action. Meanwhile, a Pims medical report confirmed that Mr Khan was diagnosed with right central retinal vein occlusion and received hospital-based treatment, which was completed smoothly. Jail authorities informed the court that Mr Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were receiving medical care strictly under jail rules. Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Possibly for the first time in recent history, clerics belonging to all four mainstream schools of thought in the country, and representing several madressah boards, collectively visited both the victims and the site of a terrorist attack on a mosque. Members of the National Paig­ham-i-Aman Committee, led by its coordinator Allama Hafiz Ta­­h­ir Ashrafi, along with clerics and scholars from the Shia, Barelvi, Deobandi and Ahle Hadith schools of thought, visited the victims of the Tarlai suicide bomb blast at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). Later, the group visited Imam­bargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra to express solidarity with the victims and the community that faced the terrorist attack during Friday prayers. Addressing a news conference, Hafiz Ashrafi emphasised the importance of patience and unity in difficult times. In rare display of unity, clerics slam attack; warn against terrorism dividing country “We, the clerics belonging to all the mainstream schools of thought in the country, are here, and this is neither a political discussion nor a numbers game,” he said, adding that scholars from all sects were visibly emotional upon meeting the victims, refle­cting the gravity of the tragedy. “The nation stands united and cannot be divided by acts of terrorism.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan serves as a pre-eminent case study of a state creating a ‘Frankenstein’s monster’ by funding and facilitating proxies to destabilise a neighbour. Throughout the 1980s, acting at the behest of the United States and Saudi Arabia, the Pakistani state recruited, trained and armed various Islamist Afghan groups to combat Soviet forces occupying Afghanistan. Once the Soviet forces withdrew in 1989, the victorious proxies failed to reach an amicable power-sharing agreement and began fighting amongst themselves. Desperate to maintain a stake in the region, Pakistan helped mould an even more extreme force, the Taliban, who won decisive battles against rival factions to install a stringent Islamist regime by 1996 in Afghanistan. While the Pakistani state believed it had successfully installed a government beneficial to its strategic geopolitical interests, the internal fallout of this involvement had already commenced. A decade of establishing recruitment centres where young men were indoctrinated and trained in guerrilla warfare eventually backfired. These proxy militants turned their guns against the Pakistani state, forming groups such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to demand the enforcement of Sharia law and the creation of a ‘Greater Afghanistan’ that included Pakistan’s own Pakhtun-majority areas. From Afghan militancy in the 1980s and 1990s to the Middle East’s sectarian militias and from Africa to Balochistan, modern history is filled with states that created violent proxies, only for them to become existential threats to themselves For the next two decades, anti-state groups comprising former proxies and their Pakistani allies unleashed waves of brutal attacks across the country. By the time the state fully grasped the devastating consequences of the strategy it had initiated in the 1980s, over 80,000 Pakistani soldiers, police personnel, politicians and civilians had been killed. This ongoing conflict underscores a devastating strategic reversal, where proxies, once cultivated as a shield for regional interests, became an existential threat, sustained by the very forces Pakistan helped bring to power. This is but just one example of how proxies often become a problem for their own creators, a phenomenon frequently described as ‘blowback’. History is littered with instances where short-term tactical gains through third party actors led to long-term domestic catastrophes. In 2009, the American journalist Andrew Higgins wrote that Israel’s early, indirect encouragement of Islamist elements in the Palestinian territories as a counterweight to Yasser Arafat’s secular Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), contributed to the rise of Hamas, which later became Israel’s most formidable local adversary. These cases demonstrate a recurring geopolitical truth, that when a state breathes life into a proxy, it loses the ability to control the monster’s appetite once the original mission is over. This loss of control often transforms a strategic asset into a primary security threat, as Iraq experienced following the 2003 US invasion. The initial support provided by regional powers such as Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iran to sectarian militias in Iraq eventually resulted in the birth of the Islamic State (ISIS). In his book ISIS: A History, Lebanese-American academic Fawaz Gerges writes that many of the fighters who formed the backbone of ISIS were seasoned by years of proxy warfare, eventually turning their sights not just on Western targets, but on the regional states that had once turned a blind eye to their radicalisation. According to British academic Dr Alex Vines, Apartheid-era South Africa funded and trained rebels in Mozambique to destabilise that country. While the rebels successfully crippled Mozambique’s infrastructure, the resulting chaos created a massive refugee crisis and a thriving black market in small arms that flooded back across South African borders, fuelling a rise in violent crime and instability that persisted long after the official conflict ended. In his book Proxy Warfare, the British political scientist Andrew Mumford writes that the danger of creating proxies lies in the inherent paradox of attempting to outsource national security to autonomous actors, whose interests only temporarily align with those of the sponsor. According to the American political scientist Tyrone Groh, while states often view these groups as cost-effective tools for projectable power and plausible deniability, they frequently ignore the reality that a proxy is not a precision-guided weapon but a sentient political entity with its own evolving ambitions. As a conflict progresses, the proxy inevitably seeks to shed its dependence on its creator, often utilising the training, funding and ideological fervour it was gifted by its facilitator to pursue an independent and frequently contradictory agenda. This transforms a strategic asset into a domestic liability, a phenomenon that forces the original sponsor to expend even greater resources to contain the radicalism or violence it once actively cultivated. Despite the overwhelming historical evidence that proxies eventually turn on their creators, the allure of low-cost, deniable warfare remains irresistible to modern states. According to Mumford, this persistence suggests that, for many governments, the immediate tactical advantages — such as bleeding a rival — outweighs the potential for long-term domestic catastrophe. Contemporary geopolitics has seen the rise of new sponsors who have adopted these risky strategies with varying degrees of success and instability. India has frequently been accused of utilising proxy groups to maintain leverage in its complex regional environment. More recently, scholarship has examined the manner in which India is leveraging Baloch separatist groups in Pakistan to destabilise its western frontier. The Baloch separatist Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), as well as the Islamist TTP, have increasingly been identified by Pakistani authorities and some regional analysts as instruments of Indian strategic interest. The discourse surrounding their Indian-proxy status has intensified following significant escalations in 2025 and 2026. Perhaps more surprisingly, the UAE has emerged as a significant sponsor of third party actors to project power far beyond its small geographic footprint. According to the conflict analyst Emadeddin Badi, during the Libyan civil war, the UAE provided extensive military support, drone strikes, and funding to Gen Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA). According to the researcher Peter Salisbury, in Yemen, the UAE trained and equipped the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist militia that eventually staged military takeovers of key governorates, often clashing with the interests of the UAE’s own coalition partner, Saudi Arabia. UAE has also faced international scrutiny for its alleged role in fuelling the civil war in Sudan by supplying the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) with weapons and logistics, a strategy that has contributed to a massive humanitarian crisis and a surge in regional instability. According to Groh, the continued reliance on this strategy by states confirms a grim geopolitical truth: the “Frankenstein” lesson is often ignored in favour of immediate strategic depth. Even as nations witness blowback around the world, the temptation to use proxies as a ‘surgical’ tool for regional dominance remains a primary feature of modern statecraft, despite the near-certainty of future complications.

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday denied approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) in connection with the team’s boycott of the match against India on February 15. In a post on the social media platform X, the PCB issued a statement attributed to its spokesperson, Amir Mir. “I categorically reject the claim by Indian sports journalist Vikrant Gupta that the PCB approached the ICC,” Mir was quoted as saying. Gupta, earlier in the day, had posted on X that the PCB had “reached out to the ICC for dialogue”. He had alleged that after the ICC wrote back to the PCB regarding the legal ramifications it could face, the board approached the cricket world body for talks to resolve the issue. “As usual, sections of the Indian media are busy circulating fiction. A little patience and time will clearly show who actually went knocking and who didn’t,” PCB spokesperson Mir said. It is worth mentioning that earlier on Saturday, AFP had reported a source close to the developments as saying that the PCB had reached out to the ICC after a formal communication from the cricket world body. The ICC was seeking a resolution through dialogue and not confrontation, the source added, according to AFP . The government gave the cricket team the nod to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo. Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue. The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland. As a protest, Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture. Pakistan, who edged out Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate. India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said this week that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash. Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments. Earlier this week, Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown . Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would consult the government.",

Asked by a reporter whether the blast was a “failure of security agencies”, Tarar asserted, “No, not at all.” He went on to stress that Pakistan’s security institutions were hailed as examples internationally, recalling the recovery of abducted passengers “with minimal damages” during the deadly Jaffar Express attack . The minister also brought up the Pak-India conflict in May 2025, when “the enemy was brought to its knees, sought mediation and said ‘I’m sorry’”. He said that while a terrorist attack on the outskirts of Islamabad in the presence of the Safe City system and with “security agencies having entire apparatus” was “definitely tragic”, it was not a security failure. “I did not want to say something political but you must recall that Operation Raddul Fasaad and Zarb-i-Azb were also carried out in this country. You must also recall that suicide bombings had stopped. You must also recall that Karachi’s peace was also restored,” Tarar said. He added: “Then, a government came — I had not come with the intention of speaking about politics [and] it does not suit me to do that, given the institution I am present in but you have touched the topic. “I only want to remind you that someone said ‘these are peaceful people and our brothers, we should have talks with them’ and they were settled in settled areas,” he said, indirectly referring to ex-premier Imran Khan’s plan to relocate thousands of fighters from the outlawed Tehreek-i-Tali­ban Pakistan (TTP) to the country. The minister continued, “That same thinking of Taliban Khan; we are paying for that same thinking.” He asserted that the state had acted against terrorists previously, expelling and killing them, and “ended terrorism”. “ Abb yeh jo dehshatgardi waapis ayi hai, iss kay peechay PTI hai (The PTI is behind this resurgence of terrorism),” Tarar quipped while smiling. The PTI, meanwhile, took strong exception to the minister’s remark. In a post on X, the PTI’s official account said: “A day after a horrific terror attack, the information minister chose to joke, recite a hateful rhyme, and smile at a press conference. “It’s yet another reminder of how little regard they have for the people of Pakistan.” The PTI also responded to the accusation in a post on another official account. “They are in the government for four years, but the way this joker is smiling while blaming the PTI proves what kind of crap people the government has been handed over to,” it said. Separately, the PTI’s Central Media Department issued a statement in which it said that Pakistan had witnessed an “unprecedented period of peace” during Imran’s tenure as premier. In the statement, the party described Tarar’s press conference as misleading, propaganda-laden, and driven by blatant falsehoods. The PTI stated that the nation was fully cognizant of the fact that the resurgence of terrorism was a direct result of the governance of the PML-N and its allied parties. It emphasised that those who were raising alarm over the resurgence of terrorism must look inward, as the responsibility lay squarely with the current ruling coalition.",

      "title_orig": "Mastermind of attack on Islamabad imambargah among 4 arrested in KP raids, says Mohsin Naqvi",
      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday that four facilitators of the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad , including the “main mastermind”, had been arrested during raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He made the remarks while speaking to the media in Islamabad. In his media talk, the interior minister said that operations were underway throughout last night to trace those behind the attack. Making special mention of the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the KP police for their joint efforts, he said, “All those people linked to this, and the mastermind, at around 3am, all of them were apprehended.” He lauded all “agencies”, saying that this incident was a “test case”. “After the blast, raids were carried out in Nowshera and Peshawar, in which four facilitators were caught. And their mastermind, who is an Afghan, was also caught,” he said. He said that an assistant sub-inspector of KP police was martyred during the raids, while others were injured. “But the main mastermind is linked to Daesh and is in our custody,” he said, referring to the banned so-called Islamic State. The minister further said that the planning and training for the attack was done by “Daesh Afghanistan” and carried out in the neighbouring country. “We have people who are telling us details about how he (the attacker) went there and how he was trained,” he said. He again lauded law enforcement agencies on the achievement. “We have been saying for a while that whether it be Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Afghan Taliban, Daesh or other kharji terrorist organisations — they are all working together. At this time, 21 terrorist bodies’ setups … name any terrorist body, it is operating from Afghanistan,” he said. The minister further said that he had two requests for the public. “We are in a state of war; be it in Balochistan, KP or elsewhere. The intelligence [from] the community matters the most. When people get to know about an unknown person living in their community, report it to the police — when this system is activated, [terror incidents] will decrease,” he said. “Secondly, I received a message last night from someone asking where the security agencies were and why this incident happened. I can tell you that if one blast happens, 99 others are being foiled,” he said. “I spoke with the agencies and told them that we should share this with the media. It may spread panic but I said that we should share with the media which incidents were foiled,” he said. The interior minister further said that the names of Daesh and Taliban were coming up but “someone was funding them” and giving them targets. “They would get $500 but now they’re getting $1,500. Someone’s increasing their budget,” he said. “I say again with clarity that all of their funding comes from India. India is giving them all the targets; they are planning each and every thing behind the scenes. These organisations are at the front, while India is at the back,” he said. He said that while the world may stay silent for now, it would agree with Pakistan’s stance in the future. Naqvi noted that “nothing happens for free” and that the attack cost money to orchestrate, adding that since May, terrorists’ budgets had increased by three times. “We know about this and it is our duty to take this case to all international platforms,” the interior minister said. He added that he would brief the deputy prime minister on this in the coming days, so that foreign missions could update other countries about India’s involvement. “They (India) are now doing it so openly because they know that they cannot beat us in a war,” Naqvi added. “If they have adopted this tactic, then let them. But we will stop this; even if they increase their budget tenfold, it will have no impact,” he asserted. Naqvi further stated that the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) — which was behind a spate of attacks in Balochistan last weekend — created “high-production value” content that was carried by Indian media. “The world has declared BLA a terrorist organisation, but nobody will go there (India) and ask why they are showing the BLA’s content,” Naqvi said. “They create content, carry out incidents and run it on their media. It is a complete system they’ve created,” he said. He added that Indian media was trying to portray the BLA as having captured swathes of land in Pakistan but stated that “not one inch [of land] is under their control”. Talking about the attacks in Balochistan, Naqvi said that no attacker was spared. “They (India) are upset about that. But going forward, we will have a briefing on Balochistan and you will get the details,” he said. “We will continue fighting this war, but the world needs to realise that this is becoming a regional threat,” he warned. “We are doing what we can for our country, but these terrorist bodies are collaborating and jointly operating,” Naqvi added. “The world needs to observe the damage and if this violence goes elsewhere in the world, then it is on other countries to decide on what to do,” he said. Responding to questions from reporters, Naqvi noted that Pakistan had given a befitting response to Indian aggression in May last year, saying, “I think we are responding to them well. They will get a diplomatic answer.” He stated that the attacker came from Afghanistan, with the operation taking place “after an important member of Daesh came here”. Asked about the rank of the Daesh operative, Naqvi said further information would be provided in due course. “We have caught multiple accounts on Twitter being used by terrorists and they are not being shut down,” Naqvi said in response to another question about the use of social media by terrorists. “The government has written to them … but they are not blocked here, so we have taken this up very seriously,” he said. He added, “If they do not do it, we may have to adopt another strategy.” Questioned about security arrangements in Islamabad, Naqvi said that he had a detailed meeting with the Islamabad police today. “We discussed entry points in detail; we have 93 entry points,” the minister replied. “The red zone has separate entry points, and then we discussed the M-tag. Within the coming days, the chief commissioner or Islamabad inspector general will brief you.” Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior also said on the social media platform X and said, “ Based on technical and human intelligence, coordinated raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera districts of KP province, leading to the arrest of four facilitators, including the Afghan ISIS mastermind behind the attack.” “Evidence confirms that planning, training, and indoctrination were carried out in Afghanistan by ISIS. The nexus of terrorism under Afghan Taliban patronage remains a serious threat to regional peace,” it said. “During the conduct of these operations, an official of Law Enforcement Agencies embraced martyrdom and four sustained injuries. Our forces remain resolute; further intelligence-based operations are underway,” it said. Raids in KP Earlier in the day, security sources had also stated the same regarding the arrests of those involved. According to sources, a police officer was martyred, and three other security personnel were injured during the raids. Among those arrested is the alleged Afghan mastermind, affiliated with the banned Islamic State. The raids, based on technical and human intelligence, were conducted in connection with the ongoing investigation to arrest those involved in the Islamabad imambargah suicide bombing, according to the police sources. The raid in Nowshera was conducted in the Hakeemabad area of the district, according to police officials. An official of the Nowshera police said that during a late-night operation, following leads on possible facilitators of the Islamabad suicide bombing, an exchange of fire took place between law enforcement agencies and the suspected militants. “Yes, a raid was conducted in the district, and an exchange of fire took place. An assistant sub-inspector was martyred and a constable sustained injuries in the crossfire,” the police official confirmed. The official, who requested anonymity, added that the raid was conducted as part of an ongoing probe against those involved in the Islamabad suicide bombing and that “it was not Nowshera police alone that took part in the operation”. He, however, refused to share further details. Friday’s attack came less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. Yesterday’s attack was the deadliest in the capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel.

Naqvi noted that “nothing happens for free” and that the attack cost money to orchestrate, adding that since May, terrorists’ budgets had increased by three times. “We know about this and it is our duty to take this case to all international platforms,” the interior minister said. He added that he would brief the deputy prime minister on this in the coming days, so that foreign missions could update other countries about India’s involvement. “They (India) are now doing it so openly because they know that they cannot beat us in a war,” Naqvi added. “If they have adopted this tactic, then let them. But we will stop this; even if they increase their budget tenfold, it will have no impact,” he asserted. Naqvi further stated that the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) — which was behind a spate of attacks in Balochistan last weekend — created “high-production value” content that was carried by Indian media. “The world has declared BLA a terrorist organisation, but nobody will go there (India) and ask why they are showing the BLA’s content,” Naqvi said. “They create content, carry out incidents and run it on their media. It is a complete system they’ve created,” he said. He added that Indian media was trying to portray the BLA as having captured swathes of land in Pakistan but stated that “not one inch [of land] is under their control”. Talking about the attacks in Balochistan, Naqvi said that no attacker was spared. “They (India) are upset about that. But going forward, we will have a briefing on Balochistan and you will get the details,” he said. “We will continue fighting this war, but the world needs to realise that this is becoming a regional threat,” he warned. “We are doing what we can for our country, but these terrorist bodies are collaborating and jointly operating,” Naqvi added. “The world needs to observe the damage and if this violence goes elsewhere in the world, then it is on other countries to decide on what to do,” he said. Responding to questions from reporters, Naqvi noted that Pakistan had given a befitting response to Indian aggression in May last year, saying, “I think we are responding to them well. They will get a diplomatic answer.” He stated that the attacker came from Afghanistan, with the operation taking place “after an important member of Daesh came here”. Asked about the rank of the Daesh operative, Naqvi said further information would be provided in due course. “We have caught multiple accounts on Twitter being used by terrorists and they are not being shut down,” Naqvi said in response to another question about the use of social media by terrorists. “The government has written to them … but they are not blocked here, so we have taken this up very seriously,” he said. He added, “If they do not do it, we may have to adopt another strategy.” Questioned about security arrangements in Islamabad, Naqvi said that he had a detailed meeting with the Islamabad police today. “We discussed entry points in detail; we have 93 entry points,” the minister replied. “The red zone has separate entry points, and then we discussed the M-tag. Within the coming days, the chief commissioner or Islamabad inspector general will brief you.” Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior also said on the social media platform X and said, “ Based on technical and human intelligence, coordinated raids were conducted in Peshawar and Nowshera districts of KP province, leading to the arrest of four facilitators, including the Afghan ISIS mastermind behind the attack.” “Evidence confirms that planning, training, and indoctrination were carried out in Afghanistan by ISIS. The nexus of terrorism under Afghan Taliban patronage remains a serious threat to regional peace,” it said. “During the conduct of these operations, an official of Law Enforcement Agencies embraced martyrdom and four sustained injuries. Our forces remain resolute; further intelligence-based operations are underway,” it said. Raids in KP Earlier in the day, security sources had also stated the same regarding the arrests of those involved. According to sources, a police officer was martyred, and three other security personnel were injured during the raids. Among those arrested is the alleged Afghan mastermind, affiliated with the banned Islamic State. The raids, based on technical and human intelligence, were conducted in connection with the ongoing investigation to arrest those involved in the Islamabad imambargah suicide bombing, according to the police sources. The raid in Nowshera was conducted in the Hakeemabad area of the district, according to police officials. An official of the Nowshera police said that during a late-night operation, following leads on possible facilitators of the Islamabad suicide bombing, an exchange of fire took place between law enforcement agencies and the suspected militants. “Yes, a raid was conducted in the district, and an exchange of fire took place. An assistant sub-inspector was martyred and a constable sustained injuries in the crossfire,” the police official confirmed. The official, who requested anonymity, added that the raid was conducted as part of an ongoing probe against those involved in the Islamabad suicide bombing and that “it was not Nowshera police alone that took part in the operation”. He, however, refused to share further details. Friday’s attack came less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. Yesterday’s attack was the deadliest in the capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The death toll from the Islamabad imambargah attack rose to 36 on Saturday, according to hospital officials. The attack occurred at Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra in the Tarlai area on the city’s outskirts during Friday prayers. Over 160 others were injured, with the death toll expected to rise. “A 21-year-old man who was brought from the imambargah has died,” Dr Aneeza Jalil, a spokesperson at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), confirmed to Dawn . “The number of deaths has reached 33, and nine patients are in very serious condition,” she added. She recalled that 149 injured and 28 bodies were brought to Pims on Friday following the attack. Separately, HBS Hospital’s Dr Riaz Janjua confirmed to Dawn that three deaths from the attack were reported at his hospital. Great progress in probe: info minister Information Minister Attaullah Tarar held a press conference in Lahore with various religious scholars, including Allama Muhammad Hussain Akbar. “There has been progress to a great extent regarding his (terrorist’s) facilitators, and I do not want to go into much detail but I assure you that the net around them has been tightened and they will be taken to justice,” Tarar said. “We have gotten clues about the facilitators and handlers, and the public will soon be informed about the details,” he further said. “It is clear about him (the terrorist) that he went to Afghanistan for training,” Tarar said, declaring that Pakistan will not allow attacks on it from Afghan soil. “These are the same people who have no faith or religion, who shed Muslims’ blood for a few pennies,” he added. At another point, the information minister said the bomber had been identified, based on which further investigation was under way. Asked whether the incident was an “intelligence failure”, the information minister reiterated that the terrorists’ ability to attack “hard targets” had been eliminated, so they attempted to reach “soft targets”. He added, “Security and law enforcement agencies are definitely on alert. But obviously, sometimes they get access and successfully carry out activities in far-flung areas. “But rest assured, all of the handlers and those involved in this have nearly been traced, and punishment will be meted out to them.” Asked whether the blast was a “failure of security agencies”, Tarar asserted , “No, not at all.” On the question of possible action against officials for any negligence, the information minister affirmed that the Islamabad police were performing their duties to the best, even in “tough situations”. The minister said he was paying a visit to the scholars to express solidarity over the terrorist incident. “Calling those responsible for it human is an insult to humanity,” he asserted, noting that terrorists have no religion or faith or community. “On behalf of the state of Pakistan and the prime minister, I assure them that the government is taking great steps for the protection of mosques, imambargahs and such centres,” Tarar said, vowing to further improve the measures. Recalling his conversation with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Tarar stressed, “While steps are being taken for security and more will be taken, the main aim is to root out these terrorists.” He stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had met with Naqvi on Friday and issued “necessary directives”. Highlighting that Muslims were targeted during Friday prayers at the imambargah, Tarar said, “We will pursue them where they cannot even think of […] under no circumstance will we let you see any peace.” He further said, “They are khawarij , and Pakistan’s good lies only in their eradication.” The information minister also underscored that the country was united in the fight against terrorism, pointing out the efforts of the National Paigham-i-Aman Committee (NPAC). “We have reached out with the message of peace. There is no space for sectarianism and hatred in this. We all are muslims,” Tarar said, noting that NPAC’s objective was to counter the terrorists’ narrative and ideology. He pointed out that the committee had religious scholars from various sects and also had representation from minorities, including the Christian, Hindu and Sikh communities. “Due to this grief and sadness, our aim to eradicate you (terrorists) has only increased,” the minister said, affirming that scholars from all sects stood united. In his remarks, Allama Akbar said he has requested that security at imambargahs and mosques be heightened and solidarity be shown with the victims. “Especially, action against those who make speeches through various media channels and newspapers, [and] those who are part of banned outfits and make inciteful speeches, is extremely necessary because they are also their (terrorists’) facilitators and backers,” he said. Emphasising the need for intensified security, he demanded that an impartial judicial probe be launched into the incident. The scholar said the Islamabad blast was “one branch of the conspiracies being carried out against Pakistan on the global level to destabilise the country”. “Our two western provinces in particular are on their target,” he pointed out. “Especially at this time, the alliances being formed between Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkiye and Pakistan are a source of joy and courage for us, but for the enemy, they are a message of death, which is also why the enemy is more active against us,” Allama Akbar said. ‘Nation stands united’ Meanwhile, NPAC coordinator Allama Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi spoke to the media after visiting the injured at Pims. “Clerics belonging to all the mainstream schools of thought in the country are here. This is not a political talk or a number game,” he said, adding that scholars from all sects were visibly emotional upon meeting the victims, reflecting the gravity of the tragedy. “The nation stands united and cannot be divided by acts of terrorism. The enemies of the country want to see us divided,” he said. “These are attempts being made to spread fear and panic among Pakistanis but the entire nation responded with unity and the citizens came forward to help one another,” he said. Ashrafi added that hostile forces were using neighbouring territory against Pakistan and questioned how long such actions would continue, stressing that Pakistan considered Afghanistan a brotherly country. After the media talk, the clerics and scholars visited an imambargah to express solidarity with the victims and the community. Victims laid to rest Tearful mourners gathered at locations across Islamabad to bury the victims of the suicide blast. A mass funeral for 13 victims was held in the federal capital, with a large crowd in attendance, including religious scholars from various sects. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousuf and NA Standing Committee for Interior Affairs Chairman Raja Khurram Shahzad Nawaz also attended the prayers. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded, said at one funeral. Syed Jamil Hussain Shah, a 45-year-old resident, said: “Whatever happened was completely wrong and against humanity.” Separately, in-absentia funeral prayers for 32 individuals were offered in Tarlai under strict security arrangements, with the bereaved relatives and civil society members present. Politicians, including Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and PPP’s Nadeem Afzal Chan, also attended the prayers. Funerals for another two victims were held at Imambargah Jamia Sadiq, and for three others at an imambargah in Islamabad’s G-9. Inspector Bahadur Ali, who hailed from Gilgit-Baltistan and was martyred in the attack, was also laid to rest with full honours at the Police Lines Headquarters in Islamabad on Friday night. Senior police officers, including Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, attended the funeral. The body was later dispatched to his native area with full state honours. Friday’s attack was the deadliest in the federal capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel. “The attacker was stopped at the gate and detonated himself,” a security source told AFP about the imambargah blast. Muhammad Kazim, 52, said an “extremely powerful” explosion ripped through the building as prayers were just starting. Another worshipper, Imran Mahmood, told AFP there was a gunfight between the bomber and volunteer security personnel at the mosque. Mourners carry the coffin of a victim of the Islamabad imambargah attack on February 7, 2026. — AFP “The suicide attacker was trying to move forward, but one of our injured volunteers fired at him from behind, hitting him in the thigh,” he told AFP . He then “detonated the explosives”, Mahmood added. Suicide bomber’s identity Sources close to the investigation told Dawn that the attacker — whose severed head was found at the crime scene — had been identified as a resident of Gunj, in the walled city of Peshawar. They said that forensic investigators tracked his identity through the Nadra database. Preliminary investigation suggested that he was linked to the militant Islamic State (IS) group and had travelled to Afghanistan multiple times. The Peshawar police were also being approached to interrogate the family and relatives of the suicide bomber and collect other relevant details. Investigators said that all angles were being probed in this regard, and geo-fencing of the area was being conducted to identify other suspects. Authorities were conducting forensic sweeps of the crime scene, while CCTV footage from nearby cameras had been obtained to track the attackers. When approached, a senior Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police official told Dawn that they were making a lot of progress in the investigation. Another source said that raids were being conducted , and that some of the suspected bomber’s relatives had been picked up in Nowshera. Additional input from Kalbe Ali, AFP",

Over 160 others were injured, with the death toll expected to rise. “A 21-year-old man who was brought from the imambargah has died,” Dr Aneeza Jalil, a spokesperson at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), confirmed to Dawn . “The number of deaths has reached 33, and nine patients are in very serious condition,” she added. She recalled that 149 injured and 28 bodies were brought to Pims on Friday following the attack. Separately, HBS Hospital’s Dr Riaz Janjua confirmed to Dawn that three deaths from the attack were reported at his hospital. Great progress in probe: info minister Information Minister Attaullah Tarar held a press conference in Lahore with various religious scholars, including Allama Muhammad Hussain Akbar. “There has been progress to a great extent regarding his (terrorist’s) facilitators, and I do not want to go into much detail but I assure you that the net around them has been tightened and they will be taken to justice,” Tarar said. “We have gotten clues about the facilitators and handlers, and the public will soon be informed about the details,” he further said. “It is clear about him (the terrorist) that he went to Afghanistan for training,” Tarar said, declaring that Pakistan will not allow attacks on it from Afghan soil. “These are the same people who have no faith or religion, who shed Muslims’ blood for a few pennies,” he added. At another point, the information minister said the bomber had been identified, based on which further investigation was under way. Asked whether the incident was an “intelligence failure”, the information minister reiterated that the terrorists’ ability to attack “hard targets” had been eliminated, so they attempted to reach “soft targets”. He added, “Security and law enforcement agencies are definitely on alert. But obviously, sometimes they get access and successfully carry out activities in far-flung areas. “But rest assured, all of the handlers and those involved in this have nearly been traced, and punishment will be meted out to them.” Asked whether the blast was a “failure of security agencies”, Tarar asserted , “No, not at all.” On the question of possible action against officials for any negligence, the information minister affirmed that the Islamabad police were performing their duties to the best, even in “tough situations”. The minister said he was paying a visit to the scholars to express solidarity over the terrorist incident. “Calling those responsible for it human is an insult to humanity,” he asserted, noting that terrorists have no religion or faith or community. “On behalf of the state of Pakistan and the prime minister, I assure them that the government is taking great steps for the protection of mosques, imambargahs and such centres,” Tarar said, vowing to further improve the measures. Recalling his conversation with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Tarar stressed, “While steps are being taken for security and more will be taken, the main aim is to root out these terrorists.” He stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had met with Naqvi on Friday and issued “necessary directives”. Highlighting that Muslims were targeted during Friday prayers at the imambargah, Tarar said, “We will pursue them where they cannot even think of […] under no circumstance will we let you see any peace.” He further said, “They are khawarij , and Pakistan’s good lies only in their eradication.” The information minister also underscored that the country was united in the fight against terrorism, pointing out the efforts of the National Paigham-i-Aman Committee (NPAC). “We have reached out with the message of peace. There is no space for sectarianism and hatred in this. We all are muslims,” Tarar said, noting that NPAC’s objective was to counter the terrorists’ narrative and ideology. He pointed out that the committee had religious scholars from various sects and also had representation from minorities, including the Christian, Hindu and Sikh communities. “Due to this grief and sadness, our aim to eradicate you (terrorists) has only increased,” the minister said, affirming that scholars from all sects stood united. In his remarks, Allama Akbar said he has requested that security at imambargahs and mosques be heightened and solidarity be shown with the victims. “Especially, action against those who make speeches through various media channels and newspapers, [and] those who are part of banned outfits and make inciteful speeches, is extremely necessary because they are also their (terrorists’) facilitators and backers,” he said. Emphasising the need for intensified security, he demanded that an impartial judicial probe be launched into the incident. The scholar said the Islamabad blast was “one branch of the conspiracies being carried out against Pakistan on the global level to destabilise the country”. “Our two western provinces in particular are on their target,” he pointed out. “Especially at this time, the alliances being formed between Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkiye and Pakistan are a source of joy and courage for us, but for the enemy, they are a message of death, which is also why the enemy is more active against us,” Allama Akbar said. ‘Nation stands united’ Meanwhile, NPAC coordinator Allama Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi spoke to the media after visiting the injured at Pims. “Clerics belonging to all the mainstream schools of thought in the country are here. This is not a political talk or a number game,” he said, adding that scholars from all sects were visibly emotional upon meeting the victims, reflecting the gravity of the tragedy. “The nation stands united and cannot be divided by acts of terrorism. The enemies of the country want to see us divided,” he said. “These are attempts being made to spread fear and panic among Pakistanis but the entire nation responded with unity and the citizens came forward to help one another,” he said. Ashrafi added that hostile forces were using neighbouring territory against Pakistan and questioned how long such actions would continue, stressing that Pakistan considered Afghanistan a brotherly country. After the media talk, the clerics and scholars visited an imambargah to express solidarity with the victims and the community. Victims laid to rest Tearful mourners gathered at locations across Islamabad to bury the victims of the suicide blast. A mass funeral for 13 victims was held in the federal capital, with a large crowd in attendance, including religious scholars from various sects. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousuf and NA Standing Committee for Interior Affairs Chairman Raja Khurram Shahzad Nawaz also attended the prayers. “What happened yesterday has left us extremely angry and deeply hurt,” Bushra Rahmani, whose brother was among the wounded, said at one funeral. Syed Jamil Hussain Shah, a 45-year-old resident, said: “Whatever happened was completely wrong and against humanity.” Separately, in-absentia funeral prayers for 32 individuals were offered in Tarlai under strict security arrangements, with the bereaved relatives and civil society members present. Politicians, including Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and PPP’s Nadeem Afzal Chan, also attended the prayers. Funerals for another two victims were held at Imambargah Jamia Sadiq, and for three others at an imambargah in Islamabad’s G-9. Inspector Bahadur Ali, who hailed from Gilgit-Baltistan and was martyred in the attack, was also laid to rest with full honours at the Police Lines Headquarters in Islamabad on Friday night. Senior police officers, including Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, attended the funeral. The body was later dispatched to his native area with full state honours. Friday’s attack was the deadliest in the federal capital since September 2008, when 60 people were killed in a suicide truck bomb blast that destroyed part of the five-star Marriott hotel. “The attacker was stopped at the gate and detonated himself,” a security source told AFP about the imambargah blast. Muhammad Kazim, 52, said an “extremely powerful” explosion ripped through the building as prayers were just starting. Another worshipper, Imran Mahmood, told AFP there was a gunfight between the bomber and volunteer security personnel at the mosque. Mourners carry the coffin of a victim of the Islamabad imambargah attack on February 7, 2026. — AFP “The suicide attacker was trying to move forward, but one of our injured volunteers fired at him from behind, hitting him in the thigh,” he told AFP . He then “detonated the explosives”, Mahmood added. Suicide bomber’s identity Sources close to the investigation told Dawn that the attacker — whose severed head was found at the crime scene — had been identified as a resident of Gunj, in the walled city of Peshawar. They said that forensic investigators tracked his identity through the Nadra database. Preliminary investigation suggested that he was linked to the militant Islamic State (IS) group and had travelled to Afghanistan multiple times. The Peshawar police were also being approached to interrogate the family and relatives of the suicide bomber and collect other relevant details. Investigators said that all angles were being probed in this regard, and geo-fencing of the area was being conducted to identify other suspects. Authorities were conducting forensic sweeps of the crime scene, while CCTV footage from nearby cameras had been obtained to track the attackers. When approached, a senior Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police official told Dawn that they were making a lot of progress in the investigation. Another source said that raids were being conducted , and that some of the suspected bomber’s relatives had been picked up in Nowshera. Additional input from Kalbe Ali, AFP",
