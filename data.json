      "title_orig": "Ton-up Babar Azam takes Pakistan to series-clinching victory over Sri Lanka",
      "summary_orig": "Babar Azam finally ended his 807-day wait for a One-day International century, scoring an unbeaten 102 to lead Pakistan to an eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the second match at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Friday, sealing the three-match series with a game to spare. The former Pakistan skipper, under intense scrutiny after 83 innings without a three-figure score, struck eight boundaries in a 119-ball innings that blended patience with poise. He reached his milestone in the 47th over, pulling pacer Pramod Madushan to midwicket for a single, before collapsing to his knees in prostration and embracing Mohammad Rizwan at the non-striker’s end. The Rawalpindi crowd erupted, having waited long for this moment. Reaching the milestone, Babar equalled former opener Saeed Anwar’s record for the most ODI hundreds for Pakistan — 20 centuries. Rizwan played the ideal supporting role, remaining unbeaten on 51 off 54 balls, hitting five fours and a six. The pair added an unbroken 112 for the third wicket, guiding Pakistan across the finish line two balls into the 49th over. The chase began explosively. Openers Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman raced to 77-0 in the Powerplay. Saim smashed 33 off 25 balls (five fours and a six) before holing out to mid-off off pacer Dushmantha Chameera in the 10th over. Fakhar, dropped thrice, anchored with 78 off 93 balls (eight fours and six) before falling to a superb low catch by Janith Liyanage at short midwicket off Chameera in the 31st. Sri Lanka’s fielding lapses proved decisive. Fakhar survived a skier spilled by substitute Pavan Rathnayake, a miscued loft dropped by Asitha Fernando at long-off off Charith Asalanka, and an earlier edge. These errors allowed Pakistan to maintain momentum on a pitch offering little after early swing. Chameera was Sri Lanka’s only wicket-taker, finishing with 2-58 in 10 overs. The rest struggled: Asitha Fernando leaked 66 in 8.2 overs without success, Pramod Madushan conceded 62 in eight, while Wanindu Hasaranga, usually a threat, went wicketless for 35 in 10. Captain Asalanka’s part-time spin and Janith Liyanage’s medium pace offered no control. Babar, initially cautious, grew in confidence. He reached fifty off 66 balls with a short-arm jab through point, then accelerated with trademark cover drives and pulls. Rizwan, joining at 177-2, rotated strike expertly before raising his fifty with a steer to deep midwicket. The winning runs came off Asitha in the 49th over — Babar guiding a low full toss to cover. The pair walked off grinning, series sealed. Earlier, having starred with the ball in the opener, Haris Rauf was at it again as Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to 288-8. The pacer, who finished with 3-66, responded each time when called upon, especially when Sri Lanka were threatening to post an even bigger total where he picked up two quick wickets to snuff out their hopes. Haris’ spell at the end came after leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed (3-41) had ripped through Sri Lanka’s top order; their exploits giving Pakistan a good chance of wrapping up the series despite a valiant half century by Liyanage and a counter-punching 44 by Kamindu Mendis. The match, initially scheduled for Thursday, was pushed back to Friday after the terror attack in Islamabad on Tuesday, when Pakistan had won the opener at the same venue. Salman Ali Agha, standing in place of flu-stricken skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi, had opted to bowl after winning the toss and it needed work from fast bowlers Naseem Shah and Mohammad Waseem Jr in the deep to get Pakistan their first breakthrough. Pathum Nissanka (24) had been looking good, having hit four boundaries, but was run out attempting a risky third run, with his departure bringing to an end a 51-run opening stand. Fellow opener Kamil Mishara (27) followed soon after; Rizwan’s quick glovework helping complete a stumping off Abrar, who sat out the first game due to illness and was returning to the playing XI after a match-winning performance against South Africa last week. Abrar had been difficult to read for Sri Lankan batters and struck again when Kusal Mendis (20) holed out to Mohammad Nawaz inside the circle on the leg-side. Abrar was hit for the first boundary of his spell when Asalanka swept him away but the leg-spinner hit back on the next ball, trapping the left-hander lbw with a ball that spun away after pitching. Sri Lanka reached 100 in the 23rd over and the first six of their innings came on the first ball of the 24th when Liyanage came down the track and hit Abrar over the long-on fence. Abrar was pulled out of the attack and that gave Sri Lanka the breathing space they needed and Liyanage and Sadeera Sameerawickrama (42) settled soon after. When the latter got his third boundary with a flick off Nawaz in the 29th, Salman felt Pakistan needed to change tact. Haris was called into action and the pacer, fresh from picking up four wickets in the opening ODI, responded by cleaning up Sameerawickrama, who also hit a six, with a length ball that hit the top of his off-stump and ended a 61-run stand. The incoming Kamindu launched Haris for a six and with the more sedate Liyanage took Sri Lanka to 200 in the 38th over. Pakistan turned to Abrar once again but Kamindu swatted him away for four as Sri Lanka set themselves up for a late charge. Spinner Nawaz was plundered for 14 in the 41st over where Liyanage raising his half-century off 56 deliveries and Kamindu getting his second six. But Haris broke the 73-run partnership when he had Kamindu, who hit four fours during his 38-ball stay, caught at the square leg fence. Liyanage fell in the next over, hitting Waseem to Nawaz at midwicket before Haris trapped Chameera lbw. Hasaranga’s unbeaten 37 in the end ensured Sri Lanka set Pakistan 289 to win.",

      "summary_orig": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government on Friday declared the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations, 2011, to be a law that violates basic human rights and approved a resolution passed by the KP Assembly to withdraw its appeal against the law from the apex court. In 2019, the then Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) provincial government extended the law to the entire province; however, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) nullified the move, terming the law a violation of basic human rights. The government, however, later obtained a stay order from the Supreme Court against the PHC verdict. On September 8, the KP Assembly passed a resolution recommending that the provincial government withdraw its appeal. “This House recommends that the provincial government declare the implementation of the law in KP and the merged districts to be against basic rights and withdraw its appeal against it from the Supreme Court,” the resolution read. On Friday, the chief minister’s aide on information and public relations, Shafiullah Jan, told the media that the most important decision made in the cabinet meeting, chaired by Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, concerned the Action in Aid of Civil Power regulation. Jan, while briefing the media after the cabinet meeting, said that the law was being misused and that the government had expressed its concerns. He added that the cabinet also approved an inquiry commission to investigate the attack on the Radio Pakistan building on May 9 during what he described as a “false flag operation”. He said that the commission formed to probe the Radio Pakistan Peshawar attack would collect all available evidence, including CCTV footage, and submit its findings to the cabinet. He added that the names of the commission members would be finalised in the next cabinet meeting. “The KP government believes that the May 9 operation was against PTI, to dismantle the party and to send its founder, Imran Khan, behind bars. PTI achieved nothing from May 9,” he said, and questioned who benefited from May 9 since it was used against PTI. The chief minister’s aide also criticised Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for speaking against Pashtuns, adding that an entire Pashtun generation had laid down their lives. He said that the federal government should be asked how the explosives entered Pakistan since the federal government controls the border. Jan said that the provincial government brought together the entire political leadership in KP under one roof and that the draft finalised after the peace jirga would be discussed in the security committee, followed by a provincial action plan. He also said that the TORs would be finalised and the details shared with the corps commander, adding that the final decision would be made by the chief minister. The aide also said that they would enhance the police’s capacity so that the department could counter militancy in the province. Jan added that the cabinet decided not to spend taxpayers’ money on publicity of individuals, adding that PTI believed in transparency and that the cabinet had decided there would be zero tolerance for corruption. He elaborated that the provincial government released a Rs4 billion grant for displaced persons since they had left their homes during Operation Zarb-e-Azb, but the federal government, even after promising financial assistance to the displaced families, never fulfilled its promises during the last three years. The chief minister’s aide informed that a package of Rs6 billion had been announced for the provision of missing facilities in schools across the province, adding that the chief minister had ordered the release of Rs1.20 billion. He said that 0.745 million children would be enrolled and a stipend would be paid to their parents. Additionally, funds were approved for roads in Swat and South Waziristan. Jan maintained that the cabinet members and the bureaucracy stressed the need to improve the law and order situation and governance, adding that further decisions would be made to bring visible changes over the next three years. The provincial government thanked all the political parties, tribal elders, and other participants for taking part in the peace jirga.",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI’s Taimur Saleem Jhagra claimed on Friday that he was barred from clearing immigration and boarding his flight to the United States at Peshawar Airport. The former KP finance minister said in a post on X that he was travelling to Washington, DC, to attend a debate at the Pakistan Conclave at Georgetown University, but could not clear immigration. “At the airport, I was told my name was on the PNIL (Provisional National Identification List), and hence that my passport was inactive,” Jhagra wrote. “The FIA staff said they would have been unable to even comply with court orders, unless the computer system they had was updated with the status.” He said there was a lack of transparency with the PNIL and questioned who can add and remove names from the list and for what purpose. “I had written to [the] secretary [of] interior on November 4, anticipating this, and personally delivered the letter to the ministry. In ten days, I received no response,” Jhagra added. “I also went to court, and even had a hearing in Peshawar High Court today, to highlight the absurdity of individuals buying tickets and booking travel, and then not being allowed to travel at a whim.” According to Jhagra, the deputy attorney general was present at the hearing and when asked why Jhagra’s name was on the PNIL, he replied that the interior ministry could only explain in writing. “At court, I saw at least two other MNAs also attempting to clear their names off the no-fly list, including [Sher Ali Arbab],” he wrote. “He was going to travel as part of a parliamentary delegation to COP30 in Brazil. Think of the amount of time wasted in courts on issues like this.” “Ironically, I have exited the country and reentered at least six times since June 2024, without any issue, since I consult part-time. Since I last returned, I have not even violated a red light or a motorway speed limit,” he noted. Jhagra added that while he was allowed to travel on a prior trip, his 18-year-old daughter had been unable to fly abroad for her studies as her name was added to the PNIL. In his post, he noted that the PHC stepped in, and her name was taken off the list. “Certainly hoping that the future of democracy in Pakistan is bright at some point of time, but with all these muppets around, the present fate of democracy is pretty dark! And that is why we must fight for it!” he concluded. Earlier this month, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid Ahmed was barred from travelling to Saudi Arabia for Umrah, despite directives from the Lahore High Court (LHC) allowing him to travel abroad. According to an October 30 court order, the AML leader’s name had been removed from the Exit Control List (ECL), following involvement in several May 9 cases . The court had directed relevant authorities to allow him to travel. However, in a video message posted on the social media platform X, Rashid alleged: “Today, I was stopped from going to Saudi Arabia for Umrah, despite having permission from LHC’s Rawalpindi bench under Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan.”",

      "summary_orig": "The health ministry and the World Health Organisation warned on Friday that one in three adults in the country was affected by diabetes. In a press release issued on World Diabetes Day, both warned that “diabetes affects 34.5 million people in Pakistan, including one in three adults. Pakistan has the highest diabetes burden globally — in percentage terms — and hosts more than 40 per cent of the total estimated cases in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.” They said they were partnering to organise special diabetes screening activities in medical facilities, urging people to adopt a healthy lifestyle and encouraging the early detection of a “silent killer that can affect people of any age”. The press release said that four in 10 people affected by diabetes in the region were not aware of it, increasing their risk of serious health complications such as blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation. It added that Type 2 diabetes could be prevented and the consequences of all types of diabetes minimised or delayed by maintaining a healthy diet, staying physically active, detecting the disease early, seeking treatment when needed, avoiding tobacco and reducing sugar intake. “Today, we observe World Diabetes Day to highlight the rising burden of diabetes in Pakistan. The Ministry of Health, through the Prime Minister’s Diabetes Programme, is promoting early detection, free screening and healthier lifestyles. I urge all citizens to know their risk, get tested and take simple steps like healthy eating and physical activity,” Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal was quoted as saying in the press release. Meanwhile, WHO representative and Head of Mission in Pakistan Dr Luo Dapeng said: “Diabetes is a silent killer, but we can all do our part to protect ourselves and our families by adopting a healthy lifestyle and regular medical checkups. “Prevention is always the best cure, and WHO will stand with Pakistan and its people to combat a disease that can be prevented or minimised through early detection and timely treatment.” The press release concluded that globally, the number of people living with diabetes rose from 200m in 1990 to 830m in 2022, adding that the disease was rising more rapidly in low and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.",

      "title_orig": "RNA recovered from Siberian mammoth that died 39,000 years ago",
      "summary_orig": "Scientists have recovered the oldest-known RNA, a molecule necessary for most biological functions, from a woolly mammoth that inhabited Siberia about 39,000 years ago, showing it can last longer than previously known and promising a new path for studying organisms that lived long ago. The RNA, successfully isolated and sequenced, was extracted from muscle tissue in the left front leg of a juvenile male mammoth, perhaps five to 10 years old, whose carcass was discovered in 2010 in the Siberian permafrost in the Russian Far East along the Oyogos Yar coast bordering the Laptev Sea. The mammoth, given the name Yuka, represents one of the best-preserved frozen carcasses of this extinct species. Its RNA, among other things, revealed which genes had been “turned on” in Yuka’s tissue around the time of death, showing signs of cell stress. Most knowledge about prehistoric organisms comes from studying skeletal fossils, but there is a limit to what these can reveal about their biology. The growing ability to recover telltale biomolecules from ancient remains, however, has offered new ways to understand such organisms. The new RNA achievement complements advances in recent years in the study of ancient DNA, the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for all living organisms, and ancient proteins, the molecules that build and run much of a cell’s machinery. RNA, short for ribonucleic acid, serves as the messages sent from an organism’s genome to its cellular machinery, telling cells which genes to activate or deactivate, how and when to regulate their function and which proteins to make. “With RNA, you can access the actual biology of the cell or tissue happening in real time within the last moments of life of the organism,” said Emilio Mrmol, a geneticist, veterinarian and bioinformatician at the University of Copenhagen’s Globe Institute, lead author of the study published on Friday in the journal Cell . “This gives us direct access to the functional landscape of the cell metabolism of woolly mammoths when they were alive, something that is not possible, at least not in the lengths we report, just by using DNA or proteins. Adding this layer of information provides a more comprehensive view to the biology of woolly mammoths,” Mrmol said. RNA is more fragile than DNA and proteins. The oldest DNA recovered to date was from animals, plants and microbes dating to about 2 million years ago from sediment in Greenland. The oldest proteins came from dental remains of a hornless rhinoceros that lived about 23 million years ago in the Canadian High Arctic. Until now, the oldest RNA recovered was from a wolf cub that lived in Siberia about 14,000 years ago. “I think the key finding is that we can recover RNA from such an old sample. It’s a proof of principle that opens the door for much more detailed analyses of gene expression patterns in Ice Age megafauna,” said geneticist and study co-author Love Daln of Stockholm University and the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Sweden. Yuka experienced trauma before death, with deep cuts on its hide indicating an attack by a cave lion, an extinct species that was a cold-adapted and bulkier cousin of today’s African lion. “None of the marks are severe enough to have caused the death, so it is still a bit unclear why Yuka died,” Daln said. The researchers detected RNA molecules in Yuka that code for proteins involved in muscle contraction and metabolic regulation under stress, possibly but not necessarily stemming from this attack. Scientists long thought RNA degrades mere minutes or hours after death, but this study and others showed that under the right circumstances, it can survive much longer. The frigid conditions of Siberia were particularly conducive to RNA preservation. Yuka’s DNA has also been sequenced by these researchers and others previously. Previously thought to have been female, the genetic data showed that Yuka, which stood about 5-1/4 feet (1.6 meters) at the shoulder, was male, with an X and a Y chromosome. The researchers believe that under the right conditions, RNA can be recovered from even older remains, noting that ancient RNA offers numerous possibilities. “We hope our work elicits a renewed interest in exploring RNA in other old remains, not necessarily from the Ice Age or extinct species, but also from medieval or historical remains of both extinct and extant organisms,” Mrmol said.",

The researchers believe that under the right conditions, RNA can be recovered from even older remains, noting that ancient RNA offers numerous possibilities. “We hope our work elicits a renewed interest in exploring RNA in other old remains, not necessarily from the Ice Age or extinct species, but also from medieval or historical remains of both extinct and extant organisms,” Mrmol said.",

      "summary_orig": "The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday vowed to vigorously protest through all democratic means to restore the Constitution to its original form in the wake of the passage of the contentious 26th and 27th amendments. President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment on Thursday, enacting it into law. The TTAP had already ann­o­unced a nationwide protest movement aga­i­nst the am­­end­ment since Sunday and urged the people to take a stand agai­nst the “extremely dark and dangerous” change in the Constitution. While the 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their vote as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) had also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour. In a post on X today, the TTAP said it was holding an emergency meeting at the residence of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. In attendance were Qaiser, PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar and Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai and others, including Zain Ali Shah, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Ali Asghar Khan, Hussain Akhwandzada, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Shaukat Basra. The members of the meeting later gathered and chanted slogans against the post-amendment Constitution and dictatorship and in favour of PTI founder Imran Khan and democracy. In a press release issued after the meeting, the alliance said: “TTAP reiterates its resistance and struggle against these unconstitutional amendments and will vigorously protest through all democratic means to restore the Constitution in its original form and demands that the Constitution be restored in its original form.” It said the amendments were against the basic structure of the Constitution and an attack on a fundamental pillar of democracy — the judiciary — that had subordinated the judiciary to the executive and “destroyed the basic structure of the Constitution” while introducing person-specific changes. The TTAP said its leaders rejected the amendments and demanded that the Constitution be restored to its original form. “These controversial constitutional amendments have completely destroyed the judiciary and limited the authority and existence of the Supreme Court,” the TTAP said. It also hailed the resignations of Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah as resistance to the “robbery of the Constitution” and paid tribute to judges who upheld their constitutional oath. Outlining the moves against the 27th amendment, the TTAP said MNAs and senators would march from the National Assembly to the Supreme Court on Monday, a resolution would be presented in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly against the 27th amendment and MPAs would march from the Punjab Assembly to the Lahore High Court on Monday with lawyers participating as well. The TTAP further announced observing next Friday as a ‘black day’ across the country. In other announcements, the TTAP said it fully supported the declaration of the KP Peace Jirga and demanded its implementation; demanded the immediate release of Imran, his wife and incarcerated PTI leaders and workers, as well as the leadership and members of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee. The PTI’s Parlia­mentary Commi­ttee previously suggested holding countrywide protests against the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, also voiced opposition to the amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court. Contentious bill The government’s plan to make a 27th Amendment to the Constitution took shape roughly a year after it managed to get the 26th Constitutional Amendment approved. In the following months, even though the 26th Amendment remained mired in controversy and continued to face challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad remained abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment. The speculation about whether the government intended to further tweak the Constitution was put to rest when Bilawal announced on social media platform X on November 3 that the government had sought his party’s support for the amendment. Subsequently, the prime minister also held consultations with other ruling allies to secure support for the controversial amendment.",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan will not hold talks with any terrorist group: FO",
      "summary_orig": "Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi asserted on Friday that Pakistan had never eschewed dialogue with any government in Kabul but would not hold talks with any terrorist groups. The spokesperson’s speech came in the context of the third round of talks that concluded on November 7 in Istanbul between Pakistan and Afghanistan, aimed at ending cross-border terrorism and consolidating a fragile ceasefire that was initially agreed upon after border clashes last month. Since the skirmishes, representatives of the two countries held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement could not be achieved. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that a ceasefire, however, was still in place “for the time being”. “Pakistan has never eschewed dialogue with any government in Kabul. However, Pakistan will not hold dialogue with any terrorist groups, be it Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA),” he said while addressing his weekly press briefing. “The third round of talks with the Afghan Taliban regime concluded on November 7 in Istanbul,” he said, expressing appreciation for the “sincere efforts” of mediating countries Qatar and Turkiye. “Since the Taliban regime came to power in Afghanistan, there has been a sharp surge in terrorist attacks emanating from Afghan soil on Pakistan. Throughout these years, Pakistan — despite suffering military and civilian casualties — exercised maximum restraint and did not escalate,” he said. He added that Pakistan expected that with the passage of time, the Taliban regime would be able to control these attacks and take concrete actions against the banned TTP. He said that during this time, Pakistan also tried to positively engage with the Afghan Taliban regime, offering bilateral trade concessions and humanitarian assistance. “However, despite all these positive gestures by Pakistan, the response from the Taliban regimes has only been hollow promises and inaction,” he regretted. He said that the TTP and the BLA were declared enemies of Pakistan. “Anyone harbouring, abetting or financing them is not considered a friend and a well-wisher of Pakistan and its people,” he said. “Pakistan is determined to take every possible action to safeguard its security and the security of its people. We regret that the Taliban regime is constantly trying to misrepresent the issue of terrorists hiding in Afghanistan as a humanitarian issue. “Taliban regime is also trying to portray TTP and BLA as refugees in Afghanistan. This is not a humanitarian or a refugee crisis but a ploy to frame terrorists as refugees,” he said. “Pakistan is ready to receive any Pakistani living in Afghanistan … provided they are handed over at the border crossing … and not hurled across the border fully equipped with sophisticated weapons and equipment,” he said. The FO spokesperson also stated that some elements in the Afghan Taliban did not want confrontation with Pakistan, but there was a “strong lobby” with monetary support from foreign actors that had been tasked to “stoke tension”. “These elements have been engaged in abuses and outrageous allegations against Pakistan, and in doing so, they are fast eroding whatever goodwill they had,” he said. “Some elements in the Taliban regime are also trying to propagate that there is some disagreement within Pakistan over its Afghan policy. This is misleading. There is absolute clarity among the people of Pakistan that ordinary people are the biggest victims of terrorist activities by elements hiding in Afghanistan,” he said. “The armed forces of Pakistan are making sacrifices to safeguard the lives and properties of the people of Pakistan. Therefore, the entire nation stands with its armed forces to safeguard the interests of Pakistan and the lives of the people,” he said. Andrabi also said that some elements within the Afghan Taliban regime were “trying to instigate Pashtun nationalism in Pakistan.” “It is a historical fact that Pashtuns in Pakistan are a vibrant part of society and state, holding leadership positions across the spectrum of public life and civil society. More Pashtuns live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan; therefore, instead of instigating Pashtunism in Pakistan, it would be wise for the Taliban regime to look into its own credentials,” he said. The FO spokesperson added that with the “evidence-based and well-documented sharp rise in terrorism emanating from Afghanistan into Pakistan after August 2021, the Taliban regime can neither deny the reality nor absolve itself of its responsibility”. “While the Afghan Taliban declare terrorism and Pakistan an internal issue, they fail to mention that there are people within Afghanistan who have issued fatwas, legitimising terrorist attacks against Pakistan. Moreover, terrorist groups operating inside Pakistan now comprise a large no. of Afghan nationals. He said that Pakistan remained committed to the resolution of bilateral differences through dialogue; however, Pakistan’s core concerns, i.e. terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, needed to be addressed “first and foremost.”",

The post gave no details of what the operation would entail or how it might differ from military actions already being undertaken. President Donald Trump’s administration is conducting a military campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, deploying naval and air forces for what it calls an anti-drugs offensive. US forces have carried out strikes on about 20 vessels in international waters in the region since early September, killing at least 76 people, according to US figures. Asked for clarification on the precise nature of Operation Southern Spear, a Pentagon spokesperson simply referred inquiries back to Hegseth’s post on X. CBS News on Wednesday cited multiple sources as saying senior military officials had presented Trump with updated options for potential operations in Venezuela, including strikes on land. Venezuela announced on Tuesday what it called a major, nationwide military deployment to counter the growing US naval presence off its coast — including a newly arrived US aircraft carrier strike group in the region. Caracas fears the deployment, which also includes F-35 stealth warplanes sent to Puerto Rico and six US Navy ships in the Caribbean, is a regime change plot in disguise. New US strike on alleged drug boat kills four in Caribbean US forces have struck another alleged drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean, upping the death toll in the contentious anti-narcotics campaign to 80, US media reports said on Thursday.

CBS News on Wednesday cited multiple sources as saying senior military officials had presented Trump with updated options for potential operations in Venezuela, including strikes on land. Venezuela announced on Tuesday what it called a major, nationwide military deployment to counter the growing US naval presence off its coast — including a newly arrived US aircraft carrier strike group in the region. Caracas fears the deployment, which also includes F-35 stealth warplanes sent to Puerto Rico and six US Navy ships in the Caribbean, is a regime change plot in disguise. New US strike on alleged drug boat kills four in Caribbean US forces have struck another alleged drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean, upping the death toll in the contentious anti-narcotics campaign to 80, US media reports said on Thursday. This week’s reported strike took the toll to 80 deaths in 20 strikes in international waters. The timing of the strike was not clear, with broadcaster CBS reporting the boat was destroyed on Monday and The New York Times reporting the strike took place on Wednesday, both citing an unnamed Pentagon official. The Pentagon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",

      "summary_orig": "The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Friday imposed a ban on the use of government resources, such as vehicles, by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for personal or political use. According to a court order available with Dawn , the provincial administration was banned from using official vehicles without authorisation, stating that it amounted to “misconduct and abuse of authority”. “This court is of the view that the use of official vehicles, machinery, or any other government resources for participation in, or facilitation of, political gatherings, protest rallies, or long marches constitutes a blatant misuse of public property and authority,” the PHC ruled. The order added that this practice was not only violating public trust but also undermining the concept of neutral governance. “Public resources, including official vehicles and heavy machinery, are procured and maintained from the public exchequer for the sole purpose of performing official duties and providing services to the citizens in accordance with law,” the order read. “Their diversion for political or extraneous purposes, whether directly or indirectly, undermines the sanctity of the public office and shakes public confidence in the fairness and impartiality of the administration,” it added, further stating that nobody holding public office can employ government resources for partisan or personal use. The PHC ruled that Articles 4 (right of individuals to be dealt with in accordance with law), 5 (loyalty to state and obedience to Constitution and law) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution imply that public resources cannot be used by any one party or individual  “to the disadvantage of others”. “In a democratic system governed by the rule of law, the state must maintain strict separation between official functions and political activities,” the order read. “The use of government vehicles or personnel in political events conveys an impression of state endorsement or complicity in partisan matters, which is impermissible.” The PHC ordered the KP government to ensure that “no official vehicle, machinery, or manpower under their control is deployed, used, or permitted to be used for any protest, long march, rally, or political activity of any nature”. Last November, a petition was filed against the KP government, led by then-chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur, against the use of government vehicles like fire engines during the PTI’s long march to Islamabad. The petition stated that the provincial government had used government resources such as fire engines and heavy machinery from the local government department that government officials had been mobilised to join their march. During the march, protesters gathered at D-Chowk to demand PTI founder Imran Khan’s release, among other things, amid reports of intense tear gas shelling by security forces to curtail the large crowds. Clashes between party supporters and police ended in a hasty retreat of the party’s top leadership and supporters from the Red Zone. More to follow.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday criticised two Supreme Court judges for tendering resignations following the passage of the 27th constitutional amendment a day earlier, saying their “consciences only awakened after their monopoly was curtailed.” Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah handed in their resignations , hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday. Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly today, Asif accused the judges of having “selective amnesia”, saying that they had “forgotten their past” and were now becoming “guardians of democracy”. “Four to five years ago — in fact, eight to 10 years ago — when the process to remove Nawaz Sharif from his post started, I want to tell you about the history of our SC judges at that time. The conspiracy created against Nawaz before that and the role our judiciary played in turning that conspiracy into reality,” Asif said, amid chants of ‘kon bachayega Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan’ [who will save Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan] by the opposition. “The entire process started with the Panama case when Chief Justice Saqib Nisar formed two benches that deemed Nawaz ineligible to hold office,” Asif said, adding that the bench included Justices Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Ejaz Afzal, Gulzar Ahmed, and Ijazul Ahsan. “After Nawaz was declared ineligible, another bench was created to decide the duration of the ineligibility,” the defence minister said. He highlighted that under the supervision of Justice Nisar, a bench comprising Justices Umar Ata Bandial, Ijazul Ahsan, and Sajjad Ali Shah, decided that ineligibility will be life-long. “Then another bench was formed, also supervised by Justice Nisar, which declared that no ineligible person can become the leader of a political party,” Asif added. He said in almost every political lawsuit, the same few judges were witnessed thereafter. “When these kangaroo courts were being formed, Nawaz was being victimised, and an agenda was being implemented that he would not remain a leader and would be expelled from politics forever; at that time, no one felt any shame,” the minister said, referring to the resignations of Justices Shah and Minallah following the passage of the 27th Amendment by the parliament. “These judges from yesterday were serving in SC and high courts back then; now they’re writing poetry and issuing political statements,” referring to a poem Justice Shah added to his resignation letter. According to Asif, the judges’ “conscience awakened because their monopoly in SC was curtailed.” The minister added that the amendment in question sought to establish the superiority of the Constitution. Referring to the opposition, he said that they chant ‘Khan nahi tou Pakistan nahi’ [if there is no Khan, there is no Pakistan], which was proof that they don’t stand with the Constitution of Pakistan but instead with a single person. “These people have become protectors of terrorists; people who come from across the border and do murder and destruction here,” Asif said, assailing the opposition for not condemning the attacks in Wana and Islamabad . Resignation letters In his letter to the president yesterday, Justice Shah had assailed the 27th Amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan”, which “dismantles the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugates the judiciary to executive control, and strikes at the very heart of our constitutional democracy”. “By fracturing the unity of the nation’s apex court, it has crippled judicial independence and integrity, pushing the country back by decades,” he wrote. “As history bears witness, such a disfigurement of the constitutional order is unsustainable and will, in time, be reversed — but not before leaving deep institutional scars.” The judge had stated that he had a choice between serving as an SC justice, which he said “undermines the very foundation of the institution one has sworn to protect”, or hand in his resignation. On the other hand, Justice Minallah had stated in his letter that when he took the oath of office 11 years ago, he swore to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”. He wrote: “Prior to the passage of the 27th Amendment, I wrote to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, expressing concern over what its proposed features meant for our constitutional order. “I need not reproduce the detailed contents of that letter, but suffice it to say that, against a canvas of selective silence and inaction, those fears have now come to be,” he added. Justice Minallah regretted that the Constitution he swore to uphold was “no more”, adding that he “can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that, as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave”. “What is left of it is a mere shadow; one that breathes neither its spirit, nor speaks the words of the people to whom it belongs,” the judge wrote. Senate’s approval The president’s assent to the legislation had come hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest. Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani had said 64 votes were cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.” The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate yesterday to consider the latest changes. The 27th Amendment promised , on paper, to “streamline” governance through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded. At the heart of the amendment is the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters",

Referring to the opposition, he said that they chant ‘Khan nahi tou Pakistan nahi’ [if there is no Khan, there is no Pakistan], which was proof that they don’t stand with the Constitution of Pakistan but instead with a single person. “These people have become protectors of terrorists; people who come from across the border and do murder and destruction here,” Asif said, assailing the opposition for not condemning the attacks in Wana and Islamabad . Resignation letters In his letter to the president yesterday, Justice Shah had assailed the 27th Amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan”, which “dismantles the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugates the judiciary to executive control, and strikes at the very heart of our constitutional democracy”. “By fracturing the unity of the nation’s apex court, it has crippled judicial independence and integrity, pushing the country back by decades,” he wrote. “As history bears witness, such a disfigurement of the constitutional order is unsustainable and will, in time, be reversed — but not before leaving deep institutional scars.” The judge had stated that he had a choice between serving as an SC justice, which he said “undermines the very foundation of the institution one has sworn to protect”, or hand in his resignation. On the other hand, Justice Minallah had stated in his letter that when he took the oath of office 11 years ago, he swore to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”. He wrote: “Prior to the passage of the 27th Amendment, I wrote to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, expressing concern over what its proposed features meant for our constitutional order. “I need not reproduce the detailed contents of that letter, but suffice it to say that, against a canvas of selective silence and inaction, those fears have now come to be,” he added. Justice Minallah regretted that the Constitution he swore to uphold was “no more”, adding that he “can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that, as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave”. “What is left of it is a mere shadow; one that breathes neither its spirit, nor speaks the words of the people to whom it belongs,” the judge wrote. Senate’s approval The president’s assent to the legislation had come hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest. Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani had said 64 votes were cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.” The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate yesterday to consider the latest changes. The 27th Amendment promised , on paper, to “streamline” governance through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded. At the heart of the amendment is the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters",

      "summary": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday criticised two Supreme Court judges for tendering resignations following the passage of the 27th constitutional amendment a day earlier, saying their “consciences only awakened after their monopoly was curtailed.” Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah handed in their resignations , hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday. Speaking on the floor of the National Assembly today, Asif accused the judges of having “selective amnesia”, saying that they had “forgotten their past” and were now becoming “guardians of democracy”. “Four to five years ago — in fact, eight to 10 years ago — when the process to remove Nawaz Sharif from his post started, I want to tell you about the history of our SC judges at that time. The conspiracy created against Nawaz before that and the role our judiciary played in turning that conspiracy into reality,” Asif said, amid chants of ‘kon bachayega Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan’ [who will save Pakistan; Imran Khan, Imran Khan] by the opposition. “The entire process started with the Panama case when Chief Justice Saqib Nisar formed two benches that deemed Nawaz ineligible to hold office,” Asif said, adding that the bench included Justices Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Ejaz Afzal, Gulzar Ahmed, and Ijazul Ahsan. “After Nawaz was declared ineligible, another bench was created to decide the duration of the ineligibility,” the defence minister said. He highlighted that under the supervision of Justice Nisar, a bench comprising Justices Umar Ata Bandial, Ijazul Ahsan, and Sajjad Ali Shah, decided that ineligibility will be life-long. “Then another bench was formed, also supervised by Justice Nisar, which declared that no ineligible person can become the leader of a political party,” Asif added. He said in almost every political lawsuit, the same few judges were witnessed thereafter. “When these kangaroo courts were being formed, Nawaz was being victimised, and an agenda was being implemented that he would not remain a leader and would be expelled from politics forever; at that time, no one felt any shame,” the minister said, referring to the resignations of Justices Shah and Minallah following the passage of the 27th Amendment by the parliament. “These judges from yesterday were serving in SC and high courts back then; now they’re writing poetry and issuing political statements,” referring to a poem Justice Shah added to his resignation letter.

      "summary_orig": "Four terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were arrested for their involvement in the suicide blast in Islamabad earlier this week, the government said on Friday. “In a joint operation conducted by the Intelligence Bureau Division and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), four members of the TTP/ Fitna al-Khawarij terrorist cell involved in the suicide attack at the Judicial Complex G-11, Islamabad have been apprehended,” the government said in a post on social media platform X. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP. The government said that during the investigation, the handler of the suicide bomber, identified as Sajidullah alias Sheena, confessed that TTP Commander Saeedur Rehman alias Daadullah contacted him through the Telegram app to carry out a suicide attack in Islamabad to cause maximum casualties of law enforcement agencies. The government said that the TTP commander sent pictures of the suicide bomber, identified as Usman alias Qari, for Sheena to recieve him. It further said that on the directives of the TTP commander, Sheena collected a suicide jacket from a graveyard in Peshawar and brought it to Islamabad. On the day of the blast, the handler “set the suicide jacket” on the suicide bomber, the government added. “The network was handled and guided at every step by the Fitna al-Khawarij /TTP high command based in Afghanistan. The entire cell involved in the incident, including its commander and three other members, has been arrested,” the government said. “Investigations are continuing, and more revelations and arrests are expected,” it added. At least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured as a bomb blast ripped through the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on Tuesday. The blast occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the sixth Margalla Dialogue. Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had said earlier that the bomber was “not a Pakistani national”, while Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the blast was “related to Afghanistan”. The incident in Islamabad had come the same week as an attack on the Cadet College in Wana that was successfully thwarted. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accused Afghanistan and India of being involved in recent terrorist activity, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.",

However, the suggestions will be discussed in a meeting of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday (today), followed by a press conference. The parliamentary party’s meeting was chaired by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief and TTAP chairman, and attended by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Asad Qaiser and other members of the National Assembly. Former NA speaker Qaiser, while talking to Dawn , said during the meeting, proposals were sought to devise a strategy after the passage of the 27th Amendment. “The participants [of the meeting] unanimously agreed that the incumbent government is not capable to run the country. At the same time there is an economic crisis, miserable law and order situation and the country is at the verge of a civil war,” he said. Mr Qaiser said Mr Achakzai was of the view that the countries, which lac­ked respect for the law and Constitution, were destined to fall apart. “[Mr] Achakzai suggested involving the religious segment of the society and holding a countrywide protest on Fridays.” Replying to a question, the former NA speaker said the resignation of the two judges was a commendable act and marked the first drop of rain against the government. “We urge the judiciary to stand on its feet because the whole nation will stand along with it over the issue,” he continued. He said that a meeting of the TTAP to be held on Friday would chalk out and announce the collective strategy of the joint opposition. KP CM denied meeting again Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was stopped from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan for the sixth time on Thursday. Mr Afridi, along with other leaders of the opposition, including Raja Nasir Abbas and Junaid Akbar, reached Adiala jail, but were not allowed to enter its premises. Later, they returned to their vehicles as the time for the meeting had expired. The KP chief minister, while talking to reporters, said that it was unfortunate that the orders of Islamabad High Court were not being implemented. It is worth mentioning that the apex court has directed to allow the KP chief minister’s meeting with the PTI founder. Mr Afridi wondered as to why there was a fear if he held a meeting with his party’s patron-in-chief. “Am I going to discuss nuclear secrets with him?” he remarked. He urged the security establishment to “focus on the borders of the country” and allow the politicians to address their issues through politics. Published in Dawn, November 14th, 2025",
