      "summary_orig": "A proposal to introduce a so-called “sugar tax” on products with excessive sugar content is once again gaining traction in South Korea. Advocates argue that such a policy is needed to curb rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases linked to sugar overconsumption. The goal is to reduce the social and economic costs of these health risks and use the tax revenue to fund public health initiatives, particularly for low-income communities. At the forefront of the debate is Yun Young-ho, head of the Health Culture Project at Seoul National University and a professor of family medicine at the university’s College of Medicine. Yun hosted a “Sugar Overuse Tax Forum” at the National Assembly Sept. 24, where he highlighted the urgent need for a sugar tax. “One in three adolescents in Korea consumes more sugar than the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommended daily limit of 50 grams for adults,” Yun said. “Added sugars in soft drinks contribute to cavities, obesity, diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.” Because of these risks, WHO now recommends",

      "summary_orig": "WHILE rejecting an international media report about Pakistan offering America access to a proposed port at Pasni, senior security sources were cited as saying that any related discussions vis-à-vis private or commercial entities would have been “exploratory” and not “state initiatives”. Nevertheless, the subject has raised many questions. According to the Financial Times , the proposal was discussed with some US officials and shared with the army chief before he met President Donald Trump at the White House last month. The report claimed that ‘advisers’ to the army chief (Pakistani security sources said that the army chief does not have any official advisers) had approached the Americans with a proposal to build and operate a port on the Arabian Sea. The FT said that the plan envisions American investors developing and managing a port in Pasni to facilitate access to Pakistan’s critical minerals sector. It is a highly sensitive issue, which concerns our foreign and national security policy, and if unfounded, the FT report needs to be strongly and publicly rebutted by the political and military leadership, especially as the report involves the latter in the purported negotiations. So far, no official denial of the reported discussions on the proposed port with American officials or private companies has been issued by the government, including the Foreign Office. The only clarification on this extremely sensitive matter has come from unnamed security sources who reportedly told selected media persons that the ( FT ) report did not represent the official government or military policy. A number of questions have been raised about the purported Pasni discussions. According to media reports, the state-run digital outlet PTV also cited the sources as saying, “Conversations with private companies were exploratory, not official initiatives.” It was further said: “There is no plan to hand over Pasni’s security to any foreign power.” This clarification reportedly by anonymous security sources and echoed by official digital media has raised more questions. When some “exploratory” conversation with private American entities on the port project appears to have taken place, and when security sources say it is not an official initiative, the question arises: whose initiative is it? It is an extremely vague statement that fails to contradict the FT report. Can even an “exploratory” consultation on such a sensitive matter be described as a private initiative without the government’s approval? The FT report claims that the paper has seen what it describes as an “audacious plan” for the proposed Pasni port project. According to the report: “A blueprint anticipated the port would cost up to $1.2 billion with a proposed financing model that would be a mix of Pakistani federal and US-backed development finance.” “The scheme,” the FT report said, “is one of several ideas floated publicly and privately by Pakistani officials to maintain momentum with the Trump administration.” The sources do not appear to respond clearly to these assertions by a reputable global publication. A strategically located small coastal town, Pasni serves as a naval air station and military airport. The proposed port holds strategic importance. Pasni is located about 110 kilometres from the China-backed Gwadar port and 160km from Pakistan’s border with Iran. Were the proposed port to be handed over to the US to build and operate, there could be serious geopolitical ramifications, not only for the country but for the region as well. The whole port idea is linked to the American interest in Pakistan’s minerals sector, particularly the rare earth minerals that are a vital component of technologies used for manufacturing electric vehicles, generating renewable energy and producing electronics and defence systems. The demand for rare earth minerals appears to be an important pillar of the renewed US-Pakistan relationship. In fact, visuals were also released of President Trump being presented with a box of rare earth minerals by the civil and military leadership at the White House. Meanwhile, a Missouri-based company US Strategic Metals signed an MoU recently with Pakistan’s military engineering arm to boost collaboration. The company is also planning to set up a refinery. Pakistan lately shipped a modest first consignment of critical and rare earth minerals to USSM, which included copper, antimony and neodymium. The sample shipment was reportedly prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation. This first delivery of rare earth minerals is being described as “a milestone in the Pakistan-US strategic partnership” that promises to establish a roadmap for cooperation across the entire mineral value chain. It may be a very positive sign for Pakistan to attract much-needed foreign investment, particularly in the minerals sector with its vast deposits, but there is also a need for caution when dealing with foreign companies interested in these critical resources in a strategically important region. Most of these minerals are believed to be located in restive Balochistan and the north-western tribal regions. Many projects in this region have involved Chinese investment for the past many years. There is also the question of whether the presence of American companies will trigger new tensions between the world’s two most powerful powers. Pakistan has a long-standing strategic partnership with China , which has now developed a much deeper economic dimension as well. At the other end, Pakistan’s ties with the US have historically been on a roller-coaster trajectory. Even in the best of times, the relationship has been a transactional one, occasionally with some strategic convergence. For the past several years, it had remained dormant. It is important to avail the changing mood in Washington, but we must also understand the unpredictable nature of the Trump administration. In the backdrop of these facts, the FT report is quite disturbing. Equally alarming is the government’s intriguing silence over it. It is extremely important for all foreign deals to be presented before parliament to lend them transparency. It is essential that the country protect its national and security interests.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka on Tuesday extended the pre-arrest bail of former prime minister Imran Khan, his wife Bushra Bibi, and six other party leaders till October 28, while issuing a show-cause notice to Adiala Jail authorities for not producing the former prime minister before the court. During the hearing, the judge expressed displeasure over the jail administration’s failure to ensure the PTI founder’s attendance and directed that he be produced either in person or via video link at the next hearing of the case. The court also sought a written explanation from the Adiala Jail superintendent and adjourned proceedings till Oct 28. The court restrained the authorities from arresting the couple in the relevant cases until the next hearing. Adiala officials get show-cause notice for not producing ex-PM before court; notices issued on plea regarding Imran’s Twitter activity Meanwhile, Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas of the Islamabad High Court adjourned the hearing of acquittal pleas filed by Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi in the Toshakhana case related to a jewellery set. During the proceedings, Mr Khan’s counsel Salman Safdar argued that the current case was based on similar charges and witnesses as the earlier Toshakhana case, in which his client’s conviction had already been suspended by a division bench. He contended that multiple investigations by different agencies — the Election Commission, NAB, FIA, and the Kohsar police — on the same allegations amounted to double jeopardy under Section 403 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Mr Safdar maintained that when an individual voluntarily discloses having received gifts, a corruption case cannot be sustained. Justice Minhas said any violation of rules or procedures must be determined through proper adjudication and directed the counsel to submit relevant verdicts. The defence counsel urged the court to restrain the trial court from announcing its verdict in the Toshakhana case, arguing that otherwise the acquittal plea would become meaningless. The judge said the matter would be examined and adjourned further hearing. Speaking to reporters outside the Islamabad High Court, Aleema Khan, the sister of the PTI founder, alleged that justice was not being served and that those who had “fabricated” the cases were now themselves in trouble. She said the PTI founder was under pressure to strike a deal but he had refused, adding that the courts and judges were also facing extraordinary pressures. She said the “truth” behind the cases had become evident. Imran’s Twitter activity In another development, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday issued notices to former prime minister Imran Khan and other respondents on a petition seeking the removal of allegedly controversial posts from the PTI founder’s official X (formerly Twitter) account. The court adjourned hearing till a fortnight. The petition, filed by citizen Ghulam Murtaza Khan through Barrister Zafarullah Khan, contended that the dissemination of “provocative and malicious” content from the account of a convicted prisoner was unlawful and in violation of prison regulations.

      "summary_orig": "THE alliance between the PML-N and PPP is in disarray. What began as a public spat over flood relief efforts in Punjab has snowballed into a full-blown confrontation between the two political parties, disrupting the functioning of parliament and, possibly, threatening the future of the coalition. On Monday, both Houses of Parliament were forced to adjourn without transacting any business after PPP legislators staged walkouts in protest against the combative rhetoric of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, and the unsavoury remarks of her information minister against the party’s top leadership. Ms Nawaz sees the PPP’s proposal to use the BISP network for assisting flood-affected populations in Punjab as an act of interference. She has also accused the party of exploiting the floods to gain political mileage. At the same time, she is using the rift to stir up nationalist sentiments in Punjab by reviving talk on the controversial canal-building project opposed by Sindh. Her remarks appear to have touched a raw nerve within the PPP, which has responded with equal force. Its leaders have demanded an apology from the Punjab chief minister, warning the PML-N not to take their support in Islamabad for granted. PPP leader Sherry Rehman aptly reminded the coalition partner that “a coalition cannot be run by insulting others”. With both sides trading barbs over flood relief efforts and the contentious canal project, routine legislative work is suffering amid repeated quorum disruptions and adjournments since the start of the current parliamentary session on Sept 29. What makes this episode particularly troubling is its timing. The country is still reeling from the impact of the recent floods , and millions await help for recovery. Such a moment demands maturity from the ruling parties. Instead, their escalating hostilities threaten to further erode interprovincial harmony and weaken the federation itself. It is time both sides stepped back lest their feud spiral out of control. Therefore, President Asif Zardari’s decision to mediate between the warring parties through the interior minister is a welcome step. Yet, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s alleged decision to back his daughter’s combative stance — apparently disregarding Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s request for his help in defusing the tension — is likely to exacerbate the rift. The question now is whether President Zardari can rescue this marriage of convenience, which is being consumed by mutual distrust, while Nawaz Sharif chooses to look the other way.

      "summary_orig": "• Official says group wants complete Israeli withdrawal • Qatar questions why Israel hasn’t ceased Gaza operations • Witkoff-led US delegation to join negotiations today SHARM EL-SHEIKH/DOHA: On the  second anniversary of Israel’s renewed war on Gaza, Hamas has said it wants to reach a deal to end the violence based on US President Trump’s plan, but it still has a set of demands. The statement signals that indirect talks with Israel in Egypt could be difficult and lengthy. Trump, however, expressed optimism on Tuesday about progress toward a  Gaza deal and said a U.S. team had just left to take part in the  negotiations. “I think there’s a possibility that we could have peace in the  Middle East” beyond just Gaza, he told reporters in the Oval Office. Earlier, senior Hamas official Fawzi Barhoum set out Hamas’s position a day after indirect negotiations began in Sharm el-Sheikh. Hamas sets out conditions “The (Hamas) movements delegation participating in the current negotiations in Egypt is working to overcome all obstacles to reaching an agreement that meets the aspirations of our people in Gaza,” Barhoum said in a televised statement. He said a deal must ensure an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip — conditions that Israel has never accepted. Israel, for its part wants Hamas to disarm, something the group rejects. Hamas wants a permanent, comprehensive ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the immediate start of a comprehensive reconstruction process under the supervision of a Palestinian “national technocratic body”, he said. Palestinian factions vowed to maintain armed resistance, while Netanyahu stayed silent on the talks. The US is seeking a ceasefire and prisoner deal, but Qatar says key gaps persist as Israel’s Gaza offensive and global protests continue. In a related development, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty  said that a US delegation led by presidential envoy Steve Witkoff would  join talks aimed at a truce in Gaza and prisoner exchange on Wednesday In a joint press conference with his German counterpart, Abdelatty said he and Johann Wadephul “had a long conversation with Steve  Witkoff, who is expected in Egypt in the coming hours”. Gaza strikes In the latest spate of violence, residents of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and Gaza City in the north reported new attacks by Israeli tanks, planes and boats in the early hours on Tuesday. Israel and Hamas have endorsed the overall principles behind Trump’s plan, under which fighting would cease, prisoners go free and aid pour into Gaza. It also has backing from Arab and Western states. Meanwhile, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman said that Israel should have ceased operations in Gaza already in line with US President Trump’s peace plan. “Regarding the ceasefire, this question should be directed first to the Israeli occupation government. It was supposed to actually cease fire if the statements made by the prime minister there regarding adherence to the Trump plan were true,” Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha. After Hamas agreed on Friday to discuss freeing prisoners under Trump’s plan, the US president had called on Israel to cease fire in Gaza, posting on his Truth Social platform: “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the prisoners out safely and quickly!”.

      "summary_orig": "SHIKARPUR: Four bog­ies of the Jaffar Expr­ess derailed following an explosion on the track near the town of Huma­yoon, in the Shikarpur district, injuring seven passengers on Tuesday morning. Railways Minister Ha­nif Abbasi alleged foreign involvement, stating that India was behind the repeated attacks on the Jaffar Express. He affir­med that railway operations would continue desp­ite the incident. The train was en route from Peshawar to Quetta when the blast occurred at around 8:15am, said Shik­a­rpur Deputy Commis­sioner Shakeel Ahmed Abro while speaking to the media on the scene soon after the incident. He said there were no fatalities, and the seven injured passengers were promptly transported to Shikarpur Civil Hospital. The injured included Muh­ammad Shafique, son of Abdul Azziz, a railway official, Muhammad You­nis, Hawaldar Javed, constable Abdul Rahman, con­­­s­table Azhar Jameel, besides two unidentified passengers. Four of the more seriously injured were later shifted to the military hospital for further treatment. Later, the deputy commissioner made it clear that all seven injured were in stable condition and that arrangements were being made to safely transport all remaining passengers to their destinations. He also confirmed that repair work on the damaged track was currently underway. Tuesday’s blast is reportedly the seventh attack on Jaffar Express so far this year, starting with the deadliest episode in March, when terrorists killed 21 passengers after hijacking the train. Since then, the train has been attacked at least six times. Talking to Dawn , Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi blamed India for the repeated attacks on Jaffar Express. However, he declared that the train’s operation to and from Balochistan would continue despite such cowardly attacks “The terrorists targeting Jaffar Express again and again are, in fact, proxies of India that is not ready to digest and bear its defeat it faced during operation Bunyan Al Marsoos ,” he said. “These incidents are cowardly act of India that is still feeling the pain of wounds it received during the May war,” he added. In response to a question, Mr Abbasi said this time the terrorists selected the railway track near Shikarpur (Sindh). He said such cowardly attacks could not stop Pakistan Railways to cease the operations of Jaffar Express. “The train will continue operating as per routine, as we will never afraid of such attacks,” he said, adding that the security of the track and train would be tightened further. He praised “brave drivers, guards and other crew members who continue to perform duties in this train despite such horrible incidents. I also salute our brave passengers who continue to travel by this train, giving a message to the coward terrorists that Pakistani people are a brave and great nation that would never surrender before such proxies. I also salute our armed forces that are endeavoring to eliminate such terrorists for the protection of citizens of Pakistan”. Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah condemned the incident and sought an inquiry report from the police chief. He directed the Larkana commissioner to provide best medical assistance to the injured passengers. Later, Sindh lawmaker Imtiaz Sheikh, along with DC Abro, visited Civil Hospital to inquire after the condition of the injured passengers, including Muhammad Younis and Muhammad Shafique. Khalid Hasnain in Lahore also contributed to this report Published in Dawn, October 8th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja on Tuesday aired concerns about party founder Imran Khan being transferred from Adiala Jail to some unknown location to prevent his access to his family and legal team. “Another matter that is coming to the fore is that Khan sahib is being transferred somewhere from Adiala Jail,” said the PTI leader addressing the media. “We have great concern about this, and apparently, it seems that this is part of the plan of cutting Khan off from his family and lawyers.” The PTI leader said Imran had given clear directions to the party a day ago to resist any such move and protest against it. “We will never accept this injustice and won’t allow Khan to be lost to any solitary cell. This is a clear announcement from our end, if there is any such plan and action is taken on it, then our response will be that of an honourable people.” A day ago, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum had aired similar misgivings, saying there were plans to shift him from Adiala Jail to another facility and keep him in complete isolation. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady. Last month, his legal team approached United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Dr Alice J Edwards to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple.",

      "summary_orig": "Still searching for a sense of direction in the ICC Women’s World Cup, Pakistan will take on a rampant Australian side at the R. Premadasa Stadium on Wednesday, hoping to spark a turnaround against the tournament’s most complete outfit. Fatima Sana’s charges have endured a tough start to their campaign, slumping to heavy defeats against Bangladesh and India . Their batting has wavered, their bowling has lacked consistency, and their fielding has been short of international standard — a combination that has left them bottom of the eight-team table with little margin for error. But ahead of their clash with the defending champions, Pakistan’s senior batter Sidra Amin struck a note of quiet defiance. “I think tomorrow is a big game for us as a team,” she said at the pre-match press conference on Tuesday. “We are a good batting side, but as batters, we have to spend more time on the wicket so that we can execute our plans and assess the conditions really well.” Sidra, one of the few bright spots in Pakistan’s otherwise bleak campaign, scored a fighting half-century against India and has been a steadying presence at the top of the order. She admitted that the team’s batting collapses have often been self-inflicted. “If we look at the bigger picture, we’ve been leaving around five to seven overs — that’s about 42 balls,” she pointed out. “If we tackle things this way, the number of dot balls and the pressure will reduce. As batters, we need to take more responsibility, stay longer on the wicket, and play the maximum number of overs.” Pakistan’s inability to post a competitive total has been their undoing in both matches so far. They mustered only 160 against Bangladesh and folded for 180 against India, failing to bat their full quota of overs on both occasions. With middle-order batters struggling for fluency and the lower order offering little resistance, the team’s overreliance on Sidra, Fatima, and Muneeba Ali has become glaring. Even their bowling, traditionally Pakistan’s strength, has been inconsistent. The new-ball pairing of Fatima and Diana Baig has lacked rhythm, and the spinners have struggled for control in conditions that should ideally suit them. Pakistan conceded 18 extras against Bangladesh — a reflection of their discipline woes — though Diana’s four-wicket haul against India hinted at some improvement. “The discussions are ongoing,” Sidra said when asked about the team’s approach. “Our coach has guided us individually. He can tell us what to do, but as players, how we tackle things is what matters. Everyone knows our team is strong in bowling, and our spinners and attacking bowlers could cause problems for two or three of their batters — that might help us in this game.” However, even familiarity with the conditions — with Pakistan playing all their matches in Colombo — may not suffice against an Australian side that has looked a cut above. “Yes, we have an edge in that sense,” Sidra admitted. “But how the team uses that edge is very important. They’re a very well-prepared side. I heard that when they’re training for Asian conditions, they even set up indoor facilities at 35–40 degrees to simulate the heat. That’s the kind of preparation they do.” Australia, led by Alyssa Healy, enter the contest as firm favourites. Their campaign so far has been near-flawless, marked by powerful batting displays and disciplined bowling. They remain the only team to have posted a 300-plus total in the tournament — a feat they achieved in their commanding 89-run win over New Zealand in Indore, where Ashleigh Gardner’s century proved decisive. While some of their big names, including Healy and Beth Mooney, have yet to hit full stride, Australia’s depth has made them nearly invincible. The pace of Annabel Sutherland and the guile of Sophie Molineux have been particularly effective on subcontinental surfaces, while the side’s balance allows them to dominate in all phases of the game. Their only setback came off the field when their previous match against Sri Lanka was washed out, denying them the chance to go top of the standings. Yet, if anything, the break has left them fresher and more focused. All-rounder Ellyse Perry, speaking to reporters on the eve of the match, acknowledged both the challenge and respect her side have for their opponents. “Oh, yeah, [Fatima Sana] is an amazing player,” Perry said. “A real talisman, I think, for the Pakistan team. She plays with so much passion and energy — she’s incredibly talented, too. It’s always nice when we get a chance to play against her.” On the conditions, Perry added: “We obviously got to have a bit of a look at the conditions the other night with the India-Pakistan match. Probably hasn’t changed too much to how we were thinking the other day when we were hoping to play. But we’ve had a chance to prepare pretty well.”",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Tuesday sought regional countries’ cooperation to counter threats emerging from Afghanistan during the Moscow Format Consultations held in the Russian capital on Tuesday. Pakistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq addressed the moot, which was also attended by Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. The consultations, held at the level of special representatives and senior officials of Afghanistan, were attended by India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. For the first time, the Afghan delegation participated in the meeting as a member. Russia became the first country to recognise the Taliban government in July this year. A delegation from Belarus also attended the meeting as guests. “I spoke about the urgent need for collective regional efforts to effectively counter terrorism and dismantle all terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil,” Ambassador Sadiq told the 7th meeting of the Moscow Format. Sadiq said he also highlighted the importance of strengthening regional cooperation in political and economic fields, along with enhanced counter-terrorism and anti-drug collaboration. Pakistan has long been pressing the Taliban rulers to take action against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other Pakistani militant groups in view of the increase in violence after the [Taliban’s takeover][2] of Afghanistan in 2021. The Taliban government insists it does not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against Pakistan. “Continued dialogue, cooperation, and coordinated actions remain essential to address these challenges and support lasting peace in the region,” he said. The special representative also reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to a peaceful, stable, and secure Afghanistan.” In a joint statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting, the participants emphasised that Afghanistan should be supported to undertake comprehensive measures aimed at the elimination of terrorism and its eradication so that the country’s soil is not used as a threat to the security of neighboring countries and beyond. “The parties underscored that terrorism constitutes a serious threat to the security of Afghanistan, the region and the wider world,” according to the statement, also issued by the Russian embassy in Islamabad. The parties, in a veiled reference to the US and its NATO allies, also urged the countries mainly responsible for the current predicament in Afghanistan to earnestly fulfill commitments on the economic recovery and future development of the country. The parties called for strengthening counter-terrorism cooperation at both bilateral and multilateral levels. Attempts by other countries to deploy their military infrastructure in the landlocked nation were called unacceptable as this does not serve the interests of regional peace and stability. The statement did not name any country, but the statement came in the wake of repeated statements by President Donald Trump regarding Bagram air base, which was central to the US military operations in Afghanistan for 20 years. The Taliban have rejected Trump’s calls for handing over the strategic airbase. The parties reaffirmed their unwavering support for the establishment of Afghanistan as an independent, united and peaceful state. The parties further noted the need for the development of economic and trade exchanges, investment cooperation of Afghanistan with regional countries and the international community. They expressed their interest in developing regional economic projects with Afghan participation and promoting steady progress in fields such as healthcare, poverty alleviation, agriculture and disaster prevention. The participants also supported the active integration of Afghanistan into the system of regional connectivity. The parties reiterated their commitment to continue humanitarian support to the Afghan people, and called on the international community to intensify the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, while simultaneously reaffirming opposition to the attempts of politicising it. Sadiq meets Muttaqi on sidelines On the sidelines of the moot, the Pakistani envoy met his Afghan counterpart. The 90-minute long meeting focused on advancing bilateral cooperation in key areas of mutual interest, including economic cooperation, trade, transit, and regional security. Sadiq, in a post on X, said Islamabad and Kabul “reaffirmed the importance of enhancing regional connectivity and agreed to explore practical measures to facilitate trade and transit, particularly through streamlined customs procedures and improved infrastructure links”. He elaborated that emphasis was also placed on unlocking the potential of trade corridors in the region to further benefit the region’s development and economy. Earlier, in a post on X, Sadiq Khan detailed the discussions that took place during the Quadrilateral Meeting of Special Representatives for Afghanistan, saying, “The participating states unanimously reaffirmed their steadfast commitment to a stable, sovereign, and peaceful Afghanistan, underscoring the necessity of a country free from the scourge of terrorism and external intervention.” Voicing their concerns over the terrorist groups present in Afghanistan, the envoy went on to say that the participating countries agreed on “enhanced coordination and collaborative action” to fight against terrorism in the region. Separately, Khan, in different meetings with his Chinese and Iranian counterparts, discussed regional security, counterterrorism cooperation, as well as humanitarian concerns in Afghanistan. With his Iranian counterpart Muhammad Reza Bahrami, Khan held “ in-depth discussions on the latest developments in Afghanistan“, particularly terrorism, as per a statement posted on his X. “Both sides emphasised the importance of continued dialogue and coordination to address common challenges,” he added. Meanwhile, in a meeting with China’s Yue Xiaoyong, both countries underscored the “importance of a coordinated approach to promote lasting peace and stability in the region,” as per a statement posted on his X. “The meeting underscored the strong partnership between Pakistan and China in addressing shared challenges and advancing regional development,” he added. The envoy also held discussions with his Russian counterpart, Zamir Kabulov, focusing on measures to promote regional cooperation in Afghanistan. Russian FM receives Muttaqi Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and discussed the further strengthening of political relations between the two countries, the development of economic cooperation, and regional issues in a comprehensive manner, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said. The Afghan Foreign Minister thanked the Russian Federation for its decision to officially recognise the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, describing it as a significant and historic development in the trajectory of bilateral relations. He stated that the announcement of recognition has not only opened new doors for political and economic cooperation. He said the decision is also considered an important step towards Afghanistan’s active role in the international community.

      "summary_en": "Pakistan on Tuesday sought regional countries’ cooperation to counter threats emerging from Afghanistan during the Moscow Format Consultations held in the Russian capital on Tuesday. Pakistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq addressed the moot, which was also attended by Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi. The consultations, held at the level of special representatives and senior officials of Afghanistan, were attended by India, Iran, Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. For the first time, the Afghan delegation participated in the meeting as a member. Russia became the first country to recognise the Taliban government in July this year. A delegation from Belarus also attended the meeting as guests. “I spoke about the urgent need for collective regional efforts to effectively counter terrorism and dismantle all terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil,” Ambassador Sadiq told the 7th meeting of the Moscow Format. Sadiq said he also highlighted the importance of strengthening regional cooperation in political and economic fields, along with enhanced counter-terrorism and anti-drug collaboration. Pakistan has long been pressing the Taliban rulers to take action against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other Pakistani militant groups in view of the increase in violence after the [Taliban’s takeover][2] of Afghanistan in 2021. The Taliban government insists it does not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against Pakistan. “Continued dialogue, cooperation, and coordinated actions remain essential to address these challenges and support lasting peace in the region,” he said. The special representative also reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unwavering commitment to a peaceful, stable, and secure Afghanistan.” In a joint statement issued at the conclusion of the meeting, the participants emphasised that Afghanistan should be supported to undertake comprehensive measures aimed at the elimination of terrorism and its eradication so that the country’s soil is not used as a threat to the security of neighboring countries and beyond. “The parties underscored that terrorism constitutes a serious threat to the security of Afghanistan, the region and the wider world,” according to the statement, also issued by the Russian embassy in Islamabad. The parties, in a veiled reference to the US and its NATO allies, also urged the countries mainly responsible for the current predicament in Afghanistan to earnestly fulfill commitments on the economic recovery and future development of the country. The parties called for strengthening counter-terrorism cooperation at both bilateral and multilateral levels. Attempts by other countries to deploy their military infrastructure in the landlocked nation were called unacceptable as this does not serve the interests of regional peace and stability. The statement did not name any country, but the statement came in the wake of repeated statements by President Donald Trump regarding Bagram air base, which was central to the US military operations in Afghanistan for 20 years. The Taliban have rejected Trump’s calls for handing over the strategic airbase. The parties reaffirmed their unwavering support for the establishment of Afghanistan as an independent, united and peaceful state. The parties further noted the need for the development of economic and trade exchanges, investment cooperation of Afghanistan with regional countries and the international community. They expressed their interest in developing regional economic projects with Afghan participation and promoting steady progress in fields such as healthcare, poverty alleviation, agriculture and disaster prevention. The participants also supported the active integration of Afghanistan into the system of regional connectivity. The parties reiterated their commitment to continue humanitarian support to the Afghan people, and called on the international community to intensify the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people, while simultaneously reaffirming opposition to the attempts of politicising it. Sadiq meets Muttaqi on sidelines On the sidelines of the moot, the Pakistani envoy met his Afghan counterpart. The 90-minute long meeting focused on advancing bilateral cooperation in key areas of mutual interest, including economic cooperation, trade, transit, and regional security. Sadiq, in a post on X, said Islamabad and Kabul “reaffirmed the importance of enhancing regional connectivity and agreed to explore practical measures to facilitate trade and transit, particularly through streamlined customs procedures and improved infrastructure links”. He elaborated that emphasis was also placed on unlocking the potential of trade corridors in the region to further benefit the region’s development and economy. Earlier, in a post on X, Sadiq Khan detailed the discussions that took place during the Quadrilateral Meeting of Special Representatives for Afghanistan, saying, “The participating states unanimously reaffirmed their steadfast commitment to a stable, sovereign, and peaceful Afghanistan, underscoring the necessity of a country free from the scourge of terrorism and external intervention.” Voicing their concerns over the terrorist groups present in Afghanistan, the envoy went on to say that the participating countries agreed on “enhanced coordination and collaborative action” to fight against terrorism in the region. Separately, Khan, in different meetings with his Chinese and Iranian counterparts, discussed regional security, counterterrorism cooperation, as well as humanitarian concerns in Afghanistan. With his Iranian counterpart Muhammad Reza Bahrami, Khan held “ in-depth discussions on the latest developments in Afghanistan“, particularly terrorism, as per a statement posted on his X. “Both sides emphasised the importance of continued dialogue and coordination to address common challenges,” he added. Meanwhile, in a meeting with China’s Yue Xiaoyong, both countries underscored the “importance of a coordinated approach to promote lasting peace and stability in the region,” as per a statement posted on his X. “The meeting underscored the strong partnership between Pakistan and China in addressing shared challenges and advancing regional development,” he added. The envoy also held discussions with his Russian counterpart, Zamir Kabulov, focusing on measures to promote regional cooperation in Afghanistan. Russian FM receives Muttaqi Afghan Foreign Minister Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and discussed the further strengthening of political relations between the two countries, the development of economic cooperation, and regional issues in a comprehensive manner, the Afghan Foreign Ministry said. The Afghan Foreign Minister thanked the Russian Federation for its decision to officially recognise the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, describing it as a significant and historic development in the trajectory of bilateral relations. He stated that the announcement of recognition has not only opened new doors for political and economic cooperation. He said the decision is also considered an important step towards Afghanistan’s active role in the international community. The statement said the minister also emphasised the importance of mutual cooperation in the areas of combating narcotics, regional economic projects, and transportation corridors.

      "summary_orig": "Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Tuesday that former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had arrived at the Pakistan embassy in Amman, Jordan and was in “good health and high spirits”, adding that he would return on October 9. Ahmad led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. In a post on social media platform X, Dar said, “I am pleased to confirm that former senator Mushtaq has been released and is now safely with [the] Pakistan embassy in Amman. He is in good health and high spirits.” He said that the embassy stood ready to facilitate his return to Pakistan at his wish. “[I] am pleased to extend our gratitude to all our friendly countries who actively engaged and assisted in this behalf,” he said. In a post later in the day, Dar said he spoke to Ahmad on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan Embassy. “Arrangement has been by the Pakistan Foreign Office for return of senator Mushtaq to Pakistan on October 9.” Meanwhile, Ahmad also posted a video on his X account in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted. He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention. On Sunday, the Foreign Office (FO) said it was actively engaged with international partners to ensure the “safety and prompt repatriation“ of Pakistanis detained by Israel. With regards to Ahmad, it had stated: “We have been further advised that, in accordance with local legal procedures, [former] senator Mushtaq will be presented before a court. Upon the issuance of deportation orders, his repatriation will be facilitated on a fast-track basis.” On Monday, FO reiterated that it was making efforts for the safe return of the former senator. “With the invaluable assistance of the Jordanian government, we are hopeful that the process can be successfully concluded within the next couple of days,” the FO had said. It had also expressed deep gratitude to the “brotherly” government of Jordan for “their exemplary cooperation and generous support”. Pakistan and several other countries had condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the GSF. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also called for the release of those detained by Israel. On Oct 3, he had assured JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman during a telephone conversation that the government was actively engaged in efforts to secure the safe return of Pakistani nationals, including Ahmad.",

Per the police, the teachers were “abducted” from GHS Zindi Musa Khan in Bannu’s Mandati Naika Zyarat area, which falls within the limits of Hoid police station. “The first incident occurred within the limits of Hoid police station, which is under threat of militants,” District Police Officer (DPO) of Bannu Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com . “In the past few months, the police station in Hoid has been attacked several times by militants.” DPO Kulachi added that unknown armed men had taken the school teachers to unidentified locations. Among the abductees were the headmaster of the school, who was a resident of Nekam Kaki, as well as a senior school teacher, who was a resident of Bannu, Bannu police spokesperson Kashif Nawaz told Dawn.com . Nawaz added that both teachers were abducted by the militants when they were returning from the school. “A search operation is being conducted in the area to get the abductees released from the terrorists,” he added. DPO Kulachi also confirmed the second incident. “Terrorists came in a group of 15 to 20 and stormed the BISP payment disbursement point,” he told Dawn.com . He added that the terrorists kidnapped two workers from the BISP, identified as assistant director Safiullah and supervisor Shah Khalid. However, the DPO could not confirm the amount of money the terrorists took from the victims. Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks . On Sunday, a soldier was martyred and another injured when unknown assailants opened fire on them near Bannu, according to the police. In August, a police constable was martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Bannu, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.",

      "summary_orig": "The National Press Club on Tuesday submitted its charter of demands to the interior ministry following the recent police operation in which uniformed personnel forcibly entered the club premises. The incident occurred during a protest by journalists and demonstrators from Azad Jammu and Kashmir, some of whom were reportedly fleeing from police action when officers stormed into the club. A joint action committee (JAC) was subsequently formed with all key media associations and various factions of the NPC. A press release issued today from the NPC said the JAC held a meeting a day earlier in which the charter was finalised and the same was submitted today in a meeting with Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudry, who was also briefed on the demands. “Strict legal action should be taken against those responsible for the attack on the NPC and they should be punished accordingly. A high-level inquiry committee should be immediately established to determine those responsible for the attack, consisting of journalists nominated by the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Information and the NPC. “The inquiry committee should determine the losses of reporters, video journalists and photographers who were victims of the violence by Islamabad police personnel and ensure redress. After receiving the Charter of Demand from the NPC JAC, the Ministry of Interior should issue a notification of the inquiry committee within 24 hours and submit a report within four days,” the press release said. It added that press clubs and journalistic organisations were the main centres of freedom of expression and it had become imperative to ensure their security and sanctity after last week’s incident. The NPC said it was necessary to establish a committee under the interior minister’s chairmanship, comprising the information ministers and secretaries of all four provinces, AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan, the presidents of the press clubs of the federal capital and provincial capitals, to address such incidents. It added that the interior ministry should issue a formal notification for the above committee to ensure the safety, sanctity and security of press clubs, relevant unions and their members instead of verbal assurances. The JAC also pointed out that the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act included several provisions for the safety and security of those in the industry, but a commission for the said purpose could still not be established after four years, because of which no journalist or media worker could secure any relief. It called for the act to be reactivated, for the commission to be completed within two weeks and for the protection of all press clubs to be ensured as per the act’s terms of reference. “Due to which no journalist or media worker has been able to get relief yet, therefore, the said Act should be activated within 2 weeks by taking a positive action. The TORs of this act should also ensure the protection of all press clubs.” The press release said Chaudhry assured the JAC of securing approval for the demands after contacting the Senate chairman, National Assembly speaker, the federal interior and information ministers and the provincial home and information ministers. It added that Chaudhry said the security of press clubs across the country would be ensured in light of the charter. The state minister further stated that the prime minister and interior and information ministers also expressed serious concern over the incident, ordered a full investigation and issued instructions that immediate steps should be taken to avoid any such condemnable incident in the future. Chaudhry said that steps would be taken so that the police would seek formal permission from the administration before entering any press club.",

      "summary_orig": "Russia said on Tuesday it was waiting for clarity from the United States about the possible supply of Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying such weapons could theoretically carry nuclear warheads. US President Donald Trump said on Monday he would want to know what Ukraine planned to do with Tomahawks before agreeing to provide them because he did not want to escalate the war between Russia and Ukraine. He said, however, that he had “sort of made a decision” on the matter. Asked about the comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “We understand that we need to wait, probably, for clearer statements, if any come.” Peskov said that under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, US practice had been to announce supplies of new weapons only once they had been delivered to Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said in comments published on Sunday that if Washington supplied Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for long-range strikes deep into Russia, it would lead to the destruction of Moscow’s relationship with the US. Peskov said it was important to realise that “if we abstract from various nuances, we’re talking about missiles that could also be nuclear-capable. Therefore, this is truly a serious round of escalation.” Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 kilometres, so Ukraine would be able to use them to strike targets anywhere in European Russia, including Moscow, if Trump gave the go-ahead to supply them.",

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in comments published on Sunday that if Washington supplied Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine for long-range strikes deep into Russia, it would lead to the destruction of Moscow’s relationship with the US. Peskov said it was important to realise that “if we abstract from various nuances, we’re talking about missiles that could also be nuclear-capable. Therefore, this is truly a serious round of escalation.” Tomahawk missiles have a range of 2,500 kilometres, so Ukraine would be able to use them to strike targets anywhere in European Russia, including Moscow, if Trump gave the go-ahead to supply them.",

      "title_orig": "26th Amendment case: SC Constitutional Bench approves live streaming of proceedings",
      "summary_orig": "An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) approved on Tuesday a set of requests seeking the live streaming of proceedings on pleas challenging the 26th Amendment. The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy. It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered the prime minister to appoint the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that led to its establishment. It has been challenged by various high court bar associations, the PTI and others. A CB headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprises Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan resumed hearing the set of pleas today, which were last taken up on January 27 . Today’s hearing During today’s hearing, three matters were primarily discussed — the constitution of a full court to hear the pleas against the 26th Amendment, objections to the CB and live streaming of the proceedings. At the outset of the hearing, Justice Aminuddin Khan said the bench would first hear arguments on requests for a full court hearing on the pleas and objections to CB. “We will decide on the matter of live streaming (of court proceedings) later,” he added. At that, lawyer Khawaja Ahmad Hassan argued that arguments on pleas seeking a full court hearing should be live-streamed so that the public was also made aware of the grounds on which the request was being made. He then urged the court to first hear arguments on requests for streaming the proceedings live. Justice Aminuddin Khan remarked that matters of the bench were of relevance to the court, not the public. He asserted that the court would first take up the matter regarding the constitution of a full court. At one point during the hearing, he said, “Things have to be managed. All of us are serving the public, we are all fulfilling our responsibilities.” The counsel for Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan Vice Chairperson Mustafa Khokhar, Shahid Jameel, informed the court that the SC registrar had raised objections over his client’s plea for a full court hearing. “We filed an appeal against the objections,” he said, requesting the court to first decide Khokhar’s appeal. He further said that his client had also raised objections over the CB and urged the court to hear it along with the other petitions. After consultation among the judges, Khokhar’s petition was allotted a number. The lawyer representing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government also presented arguments for a full court hearing of pleas. He clarified that they did not have any objection regarding any of the members of the existing eight-judge CB but wanted a full court to hear the pleas. During his arguments, Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed contended that every citizen had the right to information. However, neither was the draft of the 26th Amendment made public nor was there a public debate on it, he argued. He then argued that at least proceedings should be live-streamed for public viewing. He recalled that the 26th Amendment was approved by parliament “in the darkness of the night”, adding that previously court proceedings had also been streamed live, including those in Zulfikar Bhutto case and the case pertaining to the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act. He said senior advocate of the SC Makhdoom Ali Khan had declared the 26th Amendment case the “constitutional case of the century”, arguing that a full court or a full CB should hear the case. Following his arguments, Justice Afghan enquired, “So you want that apart from the proceedings taking place in broad daylight, they should also be live-streamed?” To that, Barrister Ahmed said, “The Amendment was passed in the darkness of the night. That is why facts must be revealed to the public.” Following that, the bench reserved its decision on requests seeking live streaming of the proceedings. During the hearing, Justice Malik also asked Additional Attorney General Amir Rehman about the government’s stance on the live streaming of court proceedings. To that, Rehman said the matter was administrative. “So you will agree with whatever the bench decides?” asked Justice Mazhar. At one point, Justice Mandokhail remarked, “This is a big case, we will proceed on this in an orderly manner.” Eventually, the court approved the requests for live streaming the case’s proceedings and adjourned the hearing till 11.30am tomorrow (Wednesday). The petitions The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary which is a salient feature of the Constitution: namely the provisions for annual performance evaluation of judges of the high court by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the chief justice of Pakistan being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches of the apex court and high courts. As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued. The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an unconstitutional amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs. The petitioners also requested the SC for a full court hearing of the pleas instead of a hearing by the CB, which was established under the 26th Amendment. ‘Opportunity lost’ Between January and now, there have been multiple calls for a full court hearing of these pleas. On August 14, two responses from Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi were uploaded on the court’s website, explaining why he had disregarded a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full SC. The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024, under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing. The CJP had argued that such a move would undermine the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges and expose the apex court to public comment, which, he noted, had regrettably been the case in the recent past. On Aug 20, Justices Shah and Akhtar wrote a joint letter to the CJP, following the SC decision to make public the Oct 31 committee’s minutes. In their joint letter, Justice Shah and Justice Akhtar observed: “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e. the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.”",

They also called for the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) (Amendment) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an unconstitutional amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs. The petitioners also requested the SC for a full court hearing of the pleas instead of a hearing by the CB, which was established under the 26th Amendment. ‘Opportunity lost’ Between January and now, there have been multiple calls for a full court hearing of these pleas. On August 14, two responses from Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi were uploaded on the court’s website, explaining why he had disregarded a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full SC. The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024, under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing. The CJP had argued that such a move would undermine the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges and expose the apex court to public comment, which, he noted, had regrettably been the case in the recent past. On Aug 20, Justices Shah and Akhtar wrote a joint letter to the CJP, following the SC decision to make public the Oct 31 committee’s minutes. In their joint letter, Justice Shah and Justice Akhtar observed: “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending and a golden opportunity to decide them at the earliest instance before the institution as a whole — i.e. the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably.”",

      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Chinese weapon systems deployed during Pakistan’s four-day military conflict with India in May performed “exceptionally well”. During the conflict, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar reportedly said the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) used Chinese J-10C jets in its response to India’s May 7 attack. A report by The Guardian had noted that Pakistan deploying J-10Cs would “mark the first time the Chinese planes — and the PL-15 missiles they were carrying — have been used in combat anywhere in the world”. In May, China had expressed ignorance about the use of its jets, saying it was “not familiar with the matter”. In July, however, the Chinese air chief commended the PAF’s “exemplary performance” in the May conflict. In an interview with Bloomberg , which was held last week and published yesterday, Lt Gen Chaudhry said: “Of course lately, recent Chinese platforms, they’ve demonstrated exceptionally well.” “We are open to all sorts of technology,” he added. Lt Gen Chaudhry was quoted as saying that Pakistan had recently raised its tally of Indian aircraft shot down to seven — up from a previous count of six. Recently, United States President Donald Trump also described how he confronted both nations during an active war that saw “ seven aircraft shot down ”. The DG ISPR also refuted Indian claims of Pakistan losing any planes. “Pakistan has never tried to play with figures and facts,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.\nPakistan said it downed six Indian jets in retaliation in May, including the French-made Rafale. India’s highest-ranking general has acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft. “The conflict marked the largest battlefield deployment of Chinese weaponry in recent history, with the J-10C as well as the PL-15 air-to-air missile seeing live documented fighting for the first time,” Bloomberg stated. During the escalation, shares of Chinese defence-manufacturing companies rallied as tensions between India and Pakistan boosted the outlook for mainland exporters. After the Indian political and military leadership made aggressive statements last week, repeating its terrorism allegations — which Pakistan has repeatedly refuted — the Pakistani military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “ cataclysmic devastation ”. A day later, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the May escalation, and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”. The May conflict was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation. Pakistan had said it downed six Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire .",

In May, China had expressed ignorance about the use of its jets, saying it was “not familiar with the matter”. In July, however, the Chinese air chief commended the PAF’s “exemplary performance” in the May conflict. In an interview with Bloomberg , which was held last week and published yesterday, Lt Gen Chaudhry said: “Of course lately, recent Chinese platforms, they’ve demonstrated exceptionally well.” “We are open to all sorts of technology,” he added. Lt Gen Chaudhry was quoted as saying that Pakistan had recently raised its tally of Indian aircraft shot down to seven — up from a previous count of six. Recently, United States President Donald Trump also described how he confronted both nations during an active war that saw “ seven aircraft shot down ”. The DG ISPR also refuted Indian claims of Pakistan losing any planes. “Pakistan has never tried to play with figures and facts,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.\nPakistan said it downed six Indian jets in retaliation in May, including the French-made Rafale. India’s highest-ranking general has acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft. “The conflict marked the largest battlefield deployment of Chinese weaponry in recent history, with the J-10C as well as the PL-15 air-to-air missile seeing live documented fighting for the first time,” Bloomberg stated. During the escalation, shares of Chinese defence-manufacturing companies rallied as tensions between India and Pakistan boosted the outlook for mainland exporters. After the Indian political and military leadership made aggressive statements last week, repeating its terrorism allegations — which Pakistan has repeatedly refuted — the Pakistani military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “ cataclysmic devastation ”. A day later, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said India faced a “decisive defeat with a score of 6-0” in the May escalation, and “if they try again [to go to fight], God willing, the score will be much better than the last time”. The May conflict was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation. Pakistan had said it downed six Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire .",

      "summary_orig": "At least seven people were injured on Tuesday after a blast on a railway track derailed four bogies of the Jaf­far Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district, according to officials. With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure. Speaking to Dawn.com , Shikarpur Deputy Commissioner Shakeel Abro said, “A blast had occurred on the train tracks at 8:15am. The incident occurred at a distance of 1km from the Sultan Kot railway station.” He said that the blast had caused the derailment of four bogies. Abro said that seven people had been injured, out of which four had been taken to the Combined Military Hospital, while the remaining three had been taken to the Civil Hospital in Shikarpur. He said that the Jaffar Express train was bound for Quetta via Jacobabad. Sukkur Deputy Divisional Superintendent Syed Moalim said that the blast occurred while the train was moving on the track. He said that a crane was being brought by railway officials to put the derailed bogies back on the track. Sukkur Divisional Transport Officer (DTO) Mohsin Ali Sial told Dawn.com that “passengers were being taken to nearby stations so that work could commence on repairing the track.” Shikarpur Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Shahzeb Chachar added that the remaining bogies had proceeded toward Jacobabad. He said that the blast had targeted a single track used by trains going to and from Quetta via Jacobabad. He maintained that police in Jacobabad and Shikarpur were trying to trace the culprits responsible for the incident. Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah condemned the incident. According to Radio Pakistan , Shah sought a report of the incident from the Sindh police inspector general. He also directed the Larkana commissioner to provide medical assistance to the injured passengers. In August, no loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of the Jaffar Express. The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board. The incident came just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.",
