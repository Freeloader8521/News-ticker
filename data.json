      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken notice of the frequent offloading of passengers travelling abroad, ordering the constitution of a committee to look into the matter, Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain said on Monday. Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crackdown was launched on migrant smuggling following the Greece boat tragedy in 2024, one which claimed several Pakistani lives. In a statement issued today, the minister stated that PM Shehbaz had formed a “special committee” to look into the issue of offloading passengers at airports and to ensure safe migration. “Recently, despite having complete documentation, some passengers have still been offloaded,” the minister said. “People who held valid visas were offloaded as well.” The committee will prepare “recommendations regarding the safe migration of people,” the minister was quoted as saying. He detailed that a meeting of the committee is expected this week. “By the end of January, we will prepare proposals to address these issues, “ he shared, stressing that safe migration was a “fundamental right”. The minister also lauded the International Organisation of Migration’s (IOM) work for ensuring safe migration. Last month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in a visit to the Islamabad airport, said that no passenger in possession of “genuine and complete documents” should be barred from travelling abroad. On November 27, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.",

      "summary_orig": "A soldier was martyred during a counter-insurgency operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district on Monday, in which seven terrorists were killed, the military’s media wing said in a statement. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in DI Khan’s Kulachi area on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to the Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read. During the battle, Naik Yasir Khan, 34, a resident of Mardan, embraced martyrdom after “having fought gallantly [and] paid the ultimate sacrifice”, the ISPR said. The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area. “[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded. Earlier, security forces killed 13 terrorists in two IBOs across KP, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday. “On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a statement. It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district, while the other was carried out in Bannu. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025 , published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years. Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.",

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement read. During the battle, Naik Yasir Khan, 34, a resident of Mardan, embraced martyrdom after “having fought gallantly [and] paid the ultimate sacrifice”, the ISPR said. The statement added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who were involved in terrorist activity in the area. “[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless Counter Terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded. Earlier, security forces killed 13 terrorists in two IBOs across KP, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday. “On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a statement. It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district, while the other was carried out in Bannu. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025 , published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years. Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.",

      "summary_orig": "A Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney has said he had received death threats and was “terrified” to leave his home after his photo was widely shared online as the gunman responsible for the Bondi Beach shooting, it emerged on Monday. Two gunmen on Sunday had opened fire at a Hanukkah gathering in Sydney’s Bondi Beach, killing 15 in Australia’s worst incident of gun violence since 1996. Police have not yet disclosed the names of the suspects , who happen to be father and son, or their motives. However, various news outlets identified them as Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, respectively. The father first came to Australia in 1998 on a student visa, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke told reporters on Monday. He was killed at the scene. His son — an Australian-born citizen according to the home affairs minister — is critically injured and being treated in a Sydney hospital bed under police guard. Photos of a beaming man in a green Pakistan cricket jersey had subsequently pinged across social media. Some of the posts were shared thousands of times, drawing vitriolic comments. But the photo was taken from the Facebook profile of a different Naveed Akram, who pleaded on Monday for people to stop the misinformation in a video published by the Pakistan Consulate of Sydney. The video was also picked up by Australia’s SBS News , with Akram, who runs his own business and arrived in Australia in 2018, saying, “As per media reports, one of the shooters, his name is Naveed Akram. My name is also Naveed Akram. Unfortunately, our names are the same.” “I just want you to know that that person is a different person,” he added. “That is not me, and I have nothing to do with that incident or that person,” Akram said as he condemned the shooting. He further said that this “propaganda” was being spread through “Indian accounts”. He appealed to people to report instances of his photos being linked to the shooting, adding that he was “stressed and scared”. “I really need your help because this is a life-threatening event and there can be many issues that can arise from this,” he was quoted as saying. “I can’t even go outside safely,” he added. The 30-year-old, who lives in a northwestern suburb of Sydney, told AFP he first heard around 9:30pm on Sunday that he had been falsely identified as the shooter. “I could not even sleep last night,” Akram told AFP by phone, adding he deleted all the “terrible” messages he got. “I’m terrified. I could not go outside, like it’s a life-threatening issue, so I don’t want to risk anything … my family is worried as well, so it’s quite a hard time for me.” He asked the Pakistan Consulate to put out the video because relatives in Punjab were getting phone calls as well. “It was destroying my image, my family’s image,” he said. “People started to call them. They were worried, and they have told the police over there.” The Pakistan native moved to Australia in 2018 to attend Central Queensland University and later did a masters at Sydney’s Holmes Institute. Today he runs a car rental business, and he said Australia is “the perfect country”. “I love this country. I have never had any safety issues here, like everyone is so nice, the people are so nice here,” Akram said. “It’s only this incident that has caused me this trauma.”",

      "summary_orig": "“From Plato to Nato, the history of command in war consists of an endless quest for certainty…historical commanders have always faced the choice between two basic ways of coping with uncertainty…to construct an army of automatons following the orders of a single man, allowed to do only that which could be controlled; the other, to design organisations and operations in such a way as to enable the former to carry out the latter without the need for continuous control. …the second of these methods has, by and large, proved more successful than the first…” — Martin van Creveld quoted by William Lind in Manoeuvre Warfare Handbook “He plunged past with his bayonet towards the green hedge, King, honour, human dignity, etcetera Dropped like luxuries in a yelling alarm To get out of that blue crackling air His terror’s touchy dynamite.” — The Bayonet Charge by Ted Hughes SITUATING THE ISSUE Among other changes brought in by the 27th Constitutional Amendment, one relates to the creation of the office of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). The position, which is to represent command of all three services, will not exist as an independent office but will be held concurrently by whoever is Chief of the Army Staff, beginning with the current incumbent. The amendment also extends the tenure of the current army chief/CDF as also those who would succeed him. The issue of the probity of the amendment and the manner in which it was pushed through continues to be debated. The delay in the notification gave rise to much speculation about the grey areas in the draft, which seemed tailored for specific circumstances and person but will impact the Higher Defence Organisation (HDO) and civil-military relations beyond this moment and its politics. Expectedly and rightly, the debate on the political aspects of the amendment should continue. My purpose here, however, is different and is related to analysing the argument, given by some former generals, that there’s nothing novel about the changes that have been made in the HDO because the issue was long being debated within the organisation and the system. They have argued that, in light of evolving warfare, the imperative for ‘jointness’ — seamless operational coordination among the services — has now been formalised through these changes. On the face of it, these arguments cannot be faulted. For instance, the need for coordination at all three levels — tactical (where battles are fought), operational (where planning is done to achieve the desired outcomes), and politico-strategic (the highest level that informs the purpose of war as also the direction and intent of the other two levels) — should be obvious. War is not a clash of mobs. It requires disciplined forces that must operate to create synergies. That requires coordination. The 27th Constitutional Amendment promises streamlined command across the military services by creating the post of Chief of Defence Forces. But neither is this a novel concept, nor is the current interpretation without its issues. History shows that organisational redesign alone cannot overcome the realities of conflict. Ejaz Haider urges revisiting the details of an important and necessary doctrine… However, agreeing with the obvious or stating it without reference — in this case, to factors that do not fall within the operational domain — is not the same thing as agreeing with the details of how it is to be achieved and why in a particular way and not in another. Further, while jointness is much talked about, like strategy, a term that has almost become meaningless, it must be problematised. It is neither a magic wand nor even desirable in many battle scenarios. We shall return to that. At this point, a caveat is in order. What follows is my view. There can be many views. Debates over doctrines and the best courses of action have to continue. Wars usually settle them! One example is the post-WWI debate in France over static and mobile defences. Critics of the idea of the Maginot Line — a vast French system of concrete fortifications, obstacles and weapon installations built along its eastern borders (Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland) in the 1930s — argued that it symbolised passivity, would be costly and a drain on resources and would not be effective against German manoeuvre warfare. The proponents argued that it would provide a strong defence, a base for counterattack and force the Germans into Belgium, drawing their main thrust into a pre-planned battleground. As it happened, the real test came with the German offensive. The Germans didn’t attack the main line. They rapidly advanced through the supposedly impassable Ardennes Forest, getting around the line’s northern end. The French, who had committed their best mobile forces to Belgium, had left the Ardennes and the road to Paris vulnerable. The point is that debates over this and that can only be settled when the real test of battle comes. The second issue is that wars are not linear. Nor do they follow a particular template, at least not for the winning side, which wins precisely because it does something different, unexpected. As the celebrated German Panzer commander Gen Hermann Balck once said, “There can be no fixed schemes. Every scheme, every pattern is wrong. No two situations are identical. That is why the study of military history can be extremely dangerous.” In other words, the official view remains untested. Let me begin this discussion with some history related to HDO in this country, take a look at jointness and its attendant problems and square it off with how battles frustrate top-down planning and why it is important to keep things simple. Pakistan Army’s Special Service Group (SSG) commandos march during a Pakistan Day parade: the challenge is to institutionalise the principles of jointness — shared intent, trust and interoperability — while minimising the bureaucratic structures that are supposed to deliver it | AFP HAVE WE THOUGHT OF JOINTNESS ONLY NOW? The short answer is no. We thought of it way back in the 1970s, after realising the organisational failures, both vertically and horizontally, in the 1965 and 1971 Wars. Gen Ehsanul Haq, former Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff and arguably a most experienced officer, wrote an excellent paper (2013) for the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) on higher defence organisation. The paper briefly traces the history of why the government of the day established the Joint Staff Headquarters (JSHQ) in March 1976, how and why the centrality of that JSHQ was undermined and what needs to be done to return to what was started in the mid-’70s. The paper is easily available for anyone interested in reading it, so I won’t go into the details of Gen Haq’s arguments. Two points are important, though. The first is a direct quote from the paper: “Given the political history of Pakistan, unless we build up credible security policy making mechanisms subordinated to Parliament and civilian control, ad hoc and parochial interests would continue to impact our policy formulation processes, undermining critical aspects of our national defence effort [Italics added].” This, as should be obvious, establishes the principle of civilian control and the fact that, in war’s three levels, the highest is the domain of the civilian principals. The second point is that jointness did not really require reinventing the wheel. JSHQ was meant precisely for that and, as Gen Haq suggested in 2013, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) could have been made Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff or, if we like CDF better for some reason, CJCSC could have been renamed CDF or CDS or whatever suits our fancy. The only point where I disagreed with Gen Haq’s excellent analysis when I first read the paper 12 years ago was his suggestion that “while the Chairman may continue to be from the Army (due to the predominance of land strategy and asymmetry in the size of the services), the Vice Chairman [4-star] may be on rotation between the Navy and the Air Force.” General Haq’s suggestion is/was in good faith. My disagreement then was based on two factors: JSHQ became dysfunctional precisely because of the army and the praetorian tendency of certain chiefs. In fact, within 14 months of the reorganisation of high defence, Gen Ziaul Haq mounted his coup, essentially kicking the chessboard to play solitaire. To break that cycle and move away from the army’s primacy, the office was to rotate among the three services. Second, jointness is not about service size. Just like an army CJCS or a CDF cannot make naval operational strategy and would need the navy’s input, a navy CJCS would need the army’s or air force’s inputs for land and air operations. Now I have a third objection, given the type of war we have witnessed: non-contact, technical and high-intensity, no ground incursions. (This is not to say there can’t be ground incursions. Small-scale incursions can and would likely happen, but the thrust has generally changed.) If the idea of jointness has to have any meaning in the operational sense, the air force has emerged as the thin end of the wedge and, in any future round, the navy could likely get involved on its own and with dedicated air assets in support from the air force. Within land forces, ground air defence (AD) and long-range artillery have emerged as the main fighting elements. This is unlikely to change and this is where ground AD will have to be fully integrated with PAF. Cyber is a new element but will be central to many operations. Given these and other factors, we have to look anew at the traditional centrality of land forces as the backbone of military operations — ie the assertion that the army, given its sheer size, is not just primus inter pares [first among equals] but the dominant force. It is not, from an operational perspective, the politics of the issue notwithstanding. Critics might point to the Russo-Ukraine War and say land forces are critical. That situation does not obtain between Pakistan and India. Neither has the sustainment capacity for long, meat-grinding wars and both are nuclear armed. The Russo-Ukraine scenario would mean — even if we discount the sustainment factor — that either one or the other will resort to nuclear weapons or else the weapons and the entire concept of deterrence through them has been bunkum. LET’S TALK JOINTNESS AND COORDINATION There’s a reason for this. The neatness of ‘jointness’ and coordination on the drawing board must get tested in the messy reality of the battlefield, as it often does. The US military should know. Their Joint Publication 1 , whose latest iteration came in 2023, promises to be “the capstone publication for all joint doctrine, presenting fundamental principles and overarching guidance for the employment of the Armed Forces of the United States.” Yet, we have seen the US military grapple with the contingencies of irregular wars and has often failed strategically, even when winning tactical battles. A good example is the military presentation of plans. Maps, symbols, arrows, timelines. Units represented by icons. They assume perfect (or at least good) communication, shared situational awareness, adherence to timelines and probable enemy reactions. But information is never perfect — radios don’t work well in nullah beds. The enemy can be wily and Boyd Cycle you, to quote Lind, which basically refers to US Air Force Col John Boyd’s ‘OODA’ loop — observe, orient, decide, act. Whoever can run the OODA loop faster is better placed. Exercises and simulations try to model friction but they cannot go beyond controlled variables. The reality, when the shooting begins, is about exhausted, scared humans with equipment malfunctioning and everything that can possibly go wrong going wrong. A supposedly rapid advance on a map becomes a gruelling slog through mud, traffic jams on narrow bridges, or unexpected urban sprawl. If you think this is fiction or unlikely, just recall what happened to the Russian forces advancing on the north-south axis towards Kyiv from Belarus. The conceptual Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) of the 1980s was thought to reduce and ultimately eliminate the fog of war. The First Gulf War further entrenched this idea. Since then, battlegrounds have made clear to both practitioners and theoreticians that the fog comes in many ways and no one can get rid of it. Cutting-edge technology can help defeat forces in conventional conflicts but the fog sets in when a military tries, as the US did, to grapple with populations. Technology, however useful, can fail. GPS can be spoofed, software can crash, batteries can die. Ukrainian artillery with GPS-guided HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System] rounds realised the Russians were jamming and spoofing their GPS signals. It was back to relying on non-GPS rounds and old-school artillery methods both for battery and counter-battery. Take logistics. The perfectly synchronised attack can falter when one unit runs out of fuel, ammunition or food, because a supply convoy was ambushed, or the map was read wrong by a unit. Any military officer reading this would nod in agreement with a sad face. One only has to read reports from the Russo-Ukraine front and even about the genocidal Zionist occupation force. Fear, fatigue, fog (in the case of Donbas, a real one!). Humans are not robots. They get exhausted. Exhaustion degrades decision-making among commanders and the fighting spirit among soldiers. To top it all. The dastardly enemy has an independent will. He is the greatest source of disorder because, unsurprisingly, he actively seeks to disrupt coordination. He ambushes command posts, attacks supply lines and flanks, jams communications, feints and deceives. What he does can throw everything awry: planned timelines and sequences. Does this mean planning and coordination are meaningless? No! If anything, they are even more important. As in most endeavours in life, the paradox is that planning is essential precisely because it will go wrong. In other words, coordination is crucial not because it is easy to achieve for the reasons cited above (and they aren’t exhaustive), but because its absence can be catastrophic. Put another way, it provides a commonly-understood baseline and shared intent for all fighting echelons in that theatre of operations. When communication breaks down, which can often happen, leaders at the tactical level can make decisions based on the operational commander’s intent. This is what Germans called Auftragstaktik [‘mission-tactics’ or as the US military translates it, ‘mission command’]. The term often misunderstood, like Clausewitz’s schwerpunkt (which is NOT centre of gravity), had its meaning in professionalism and an entire military culture (Prussian and German) as it evolved over a long period of time. In his Instructions for Large Unit Commanders , Helmut Karl Bernhard von Moltke (the Elder) wrote in 1869: “In general, one does well to order no more than is absolutely necessary and to avoid planning beyond the situation one can foresee. These change very rapidly in war. Seldom will orders that anticipate far in advance and in detail succeed completely to execution. The higher the authority, the shorter and more general will the orders be. The next lower command adds what further precision appears necessary. The detail of execution is left to the verbal order, to the command. Each thereby retains freedom of action and decision within his authority.” This passage was quoted in ‘How the Germans Defined Auftragstaktik’ by Donald E. Vandergriff, a former US Army major. Vandergriff writes, “The overall commander’s intent is for the member to strive for professionalism. In return, the individual will be given latitude in the accomplishment of their given missions.” According to Lind, “During 19th-century war games, German junior officers routinely received problems that could only be solved by disobeying orders. Orders themselves specified the result to be achieved, but never the method ( Auftragstaktik ). Initiative was more important than obedience. Mistakes were tolerated as long as they came from too much initiative rather than too little.” Today’s wars and their many battles are far more complex. No CDF can stand on high ground like Bonaparte, observe enemy movements and send directives to commanders in the field. Yes, we have satellites and other means to have eyes on the enemy, but command has to be delegated and field commanders have to think on their feet. Nothing has changed on that count and nothing is likely to. Pakistani armed forces officials pictured on August 14, 2017: different services (army, navy, air force) have different cultures, communication protocols and priorities | AFP A SYSTEM-LEVEL ANALYSIS Critics would say: what are you talking about? Jointness is about the three services and making them fight like one unit, not in silos. A higher headquarters, in this case the CDF, will make the plans on the basis of threat assessment so the army, navy and air force can operate seamlessly, communicate with each other, be integrated. Sounds good. The problem is, wars have different formats. A conventional war is not the same as an irregular war or low-intensity conflict. A conventional, non-contact war (May is an example) is not the same as a ground incursion. A ground incursion at a single point or even multiple points in one theatre is not the same as on a very broad front. The fight is different in the mountains from operations in the plains or the desert. Air operations are not the same as naval operations and vice versa, though air can support both ground troops and naval attack vessels. A short, sharp war is different from a long, attritive war in the trenches, which is what we are witnessing in Ukraine. This brings into play the issues of training and doctrinal gaps. Different services (army, navy, air force) have different cultures, communication protocols, and priorities. This is a problem which has been analysed and written about a lot within the US military. Despite the emphasis on jointness, the US military continues to grapple with challenges like integrating complex systems, overcoming bureaucratic silos among services — what’s referred to as stove-piping — adapting to new threats (cyber, grey zone operations) etc. The services also face funding problems where the requirement of modernisation often runs into the problem of readiness. This invariably leads to inter-services friction. True jointness, in addition to other impediments, requires overcoming deep-seated institutional biases. Again, the point is not that jointness should be ditched. It’s a process. Joint planning forces different services to communicate, reveal their capabilities and limitations, and build (some) shared understanding before the battle. This relationship-building is as valuable as the plan itself. Equally, the plan cannot be taken as a rigid script. At best, it’s a foundation for adaptation whose goal, howsoever difficult, is to adapt together more effectively than the enemy. Put another way, coordination in real-battle conditions is often a patchwork effort to manage chaos at the operational and tactical levels. The elegant flowchart can only provide design principles. To expect more of it is to assume that one side has perfect information and, therefore, can work out every little detail about the adversary’s moves. That is simply not possible. Another downside of jointness and creating multiple headquarters that link up with a single office is bureaucratisation. This problem has been dealt with by various writers in relation to the US military, albeit that’s just one example. Personally, I find Edward Luttwak’s The Pentagon and the Art of War: The Question of Military Reform to be an incisive account. Luttwak highlights how the Pentagon’s immense budget often funds technically impressive but strategically useless weapons systems and is driven by bureaucratic incentives rather than genuine military need. Reason: large bureaucracies, in this case the Pentagon, prioritise internal processes, career advancement, and complex planning over effective outcomes, leading to waste and strategic blunders. Luttwak coined the “Luttwak Paradox”, which suggests that military efforts often become less effective as they become more complex and technically advanced. Jointness demands inter-services interface. In reality it means (again the US military’s example) that an individual service’s bureaucracy is not replaced. Instead, a new layer on top of existing bureaucracies is added. As identified by various writers, this means that a commander must navigate not only their own service’s logistics, personnel and acquisition systems but also the protocols, politics and resource battles of the joint structure. What begins with creating agility and clarity ends up doing the opposite: slowing things down. Complexity in systems is a subject long debated since American sociologist Charles Perrow’s analysis of the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown accident. What’s true of tightly coupled engineering systems and the cascading effect of failure in one spreading through the system is also true — in a different way — of complex human organisations. A good example of how what begins as an elegant concept can end up badly in the heat of battle was the ‘Systemic Operational Design’ created and introduced into the Zionist Occupation Force by Brig Gen Shimon Naveh, who headed the defunct Israeli Operational Theory Research Institute. The language of the concept, given the complexity it introduced, was never understood by the fighting echelons and their commanders who went to battle Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006. Success lies not in the most elaborate joint plan, but in creating the conditions where a simple directive, empowered subordinates, and shared awareness can produce coherent action in chaos. The system must be designed not for neatness on the drawing board, but for resilience under stress — and that almost always favours robust simplicity over fragile complexity, to use Lebanese-American writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s phrase. The challenge is to institutionalise the principles of jointness — shared intent, trust and interoperability — while minimising, to the extent possible, the bureaucratic structures that are supposed to deliver it. The aim is, to use the title of US Gen Stanley McChrystal’s book, create a ‘team of teams’ culture that coordinates organically and is not a rigid, top-down machine that requires constant management. In essence, go back to Elder Moltke’s advice: keep it simple. EPILOGUE Let’s recap: if we can make three disparate services with their own roles, systems, training protocols etc to roll together, that’s great. But if such integration is not done intelligently, it can end up defeating the very purpose for which jointness was undertaken. The other point, as discussed above, is that jointness was conceptualised and a system put in place in 1976. It was made to fail because allowing it to work would have undermined army chiefs and how they control(led) politics. Laying waste to that system, instead of strengthening it had nothing to do with military professionalism. What 27th Amendment has done is to constitutionalise what was long debated and opposed by proponents of balanced civil-military relations. To cloak it in the shiny garbs of jointness and operational integration is to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes. Jointness requires input from all services. Given the conduct of war, in most cases, the air force and navy will have a bigger role to play. If we are indeed looking for jointness from an operational, not political, angle then the office of CDF should be separate from the office of army chief, stand on its own and above the offices of service chiefs. And, yes, it should rotate among the three services. Finally, no matter how sound the planning at the top, battles are fought on the ground. It’s ultimately the commander in the field — at any level — who needs to have the Odyssean metis or what Bonaparte, in a different context, called coup d’œil — the glance that takes in a comprehensive view.

The only point where I disagreed with Gen Haq’s excellent analysis when I first read the paper 12 years ago was his suggestion that “while the Chairman may continue to be from the Army (due to the predominance of land strategy and asymmetry in the size of the services), the Vice Chairman [4-star] may be on rotation between the Navy and the Air Force.” General Haq’s suggestion is/was in good faith. My disagreement then was based on two factors: JSHQ became dysfunctional precisely because of the army and the praetorian tendency of certain chiefs. In fact, within 14 months of the reorganisation of high defence, Gen Ziaul Haq mounted his coup, essentially kicking the chessboard to play solitaire. To break that cycle and move away from the army’s primacy, the office was to rotate among the three services. Second, jointness is not about service size. Just like an army CJCS or a CDF cannot make naval operational strategy and would need the navy’s input, a navy CJCS would need the army’s or air force’s inputs for land and air operations. Now I have a third objection, given the type of war we have witnessed: non-contact, technical and high-intensity, no ground incursions. (This is not to say there can’t be ground incursions. Small-scale incursions can and would likely happen, but the thrust has generally changed.) If the idea of jointness has to have any meaning in the operational sense, the air force has emerged as the thin end of the wedge and, in any future round, the navy could likely get involved on its own and with dedicated air assets in support from the air force. Within land forces, ground air defence (AD) and long-range artillery have emerged as the main fighting elements. This is unlikely to change and this is where ground AD will have to be fully integrated with PAF. Cyber is a new element but will be central to many operations. Given these and other factors, we have to look anew at the traditional centrality of land forces as the backbone of military operations — ie the assertion that the army, given its sheer size, is not just primus inter pares [first among equals] but the dominant force. It is not, from an operational perspective, the politics of the issue notwithstanding. Critics might point to the Russo-Ukraine War and say land forces are critical. That situation does not obtain between Pakistan and India. Neither has the sustainment capacity for long, meat-grinding wars and both are nuclear armed. The Russo-Ukraine scenario would mean — even if we discount the sustainment factor — that either one or the other will resort to nuclear weapons or else the weapons and the entire concept of deterrence through them has been bunkum. LET’S TALK JOINTNESS AND COORDINATION There’s a reason for this. The neatness of ‘jointness’ and coordination on the drawing board must get tested in the messy reality of the battlefield, as it often does. The US military should know. Their Joint Publication 1 , whose latest iteration came in 2023, promises to be “the capstone publication for all joint doctrine, presenting fundamental principles and overarching guidance for the employment of the Armed Forces of the United States.” Yet, we have seen the US military grapple with the contingencies of irregular wars and has often failed strategically, even when winning tactical battles. A good example is the military presentation of plans. Maps, symbols, arrows, timelines. Units represented by icons. They assume perfect (or at least good) communication, shared situational awareness, adherence to timelines and probable enemy reactions. But information is never perfect — radios don’t work well in nullah beds. The enemy can be wily and Boyd Cycle you, to quote Lind, which basically refers to US Air Force Col John Boyd’s ‘OODA’ loop — observe, orient, decide, act. Whoever can run the OODA loop faster is better placed. Exercises and simulations try to model friction but they cannot go beyond controlled variables. The reality, when the shooting begins, is about exhausted, scared humans with equipment malfunctioning and everything that can possibly go wrong going wrong. A supposedly rapid advance on a map becomes a gruelling slog through mud, traffic jams on narrow bridges, or unexpected urban sprawl. If you think this is fiction or unlikely, just recall what happened to the Russian forces advancing on the north-south axis towards Kyiv from Belarus. The conceptual Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) of the 1980s was thought to reduce and ultimately eliminate the fog of war. The First Gulf War further entrenched this idea. Since then, battlegrounds have made clear to both practitioners and theoreticians that the fog comes in many ways and no one can get rid of it. Cutting-edge technology can help defeat forces in conventional conflicts but the fog sets in when a military tries, as the US did, to grapple with populations. Technology, however useful, can fail. GPS can be spoofed, software can crash, batteries can die. Ukrainian artillery with GPS-guided HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System] rounds realised the Russians were jamming and spoofing their GPS signals. It was back to relying on non-GPS rounds and old-school artillery methods both for battery and counter-battery. Take logistics. The perfectly synchronised attack can falter when one unit runs out of fuel, ammunition or food, because a supply convoy was ambushed, or the map was read wrong by a unit. Any military officer reading this would nod in agreement with a sad face. One only has to read reports from the Russo-Ukraine front and even about the genocidal Zionist occupation force. Fear, fatigue, fog (in the case of Donbas, a real one!). Humans are not robots. They get exhausted. Exhaustion degrades decision-making among commanders and the fighting spirit among soldiers. To top it all. The dastardly enemy has an independent will. He is the greatest source of disorder because, unsurprisingly, he actively seeks to disrupt coordination. He ambushes command posts, attacks supply lines and flanks, jams communications, feints and deceives. What he does can throw everything awry: planned timelines and sequences. Does this mean planning and coordination are meaningless? No! If anything, they are even more important. As in most endeavours in life, the paradox is that planning is essential precisely because it will go wrong. In other words, coordination is crucial not because it is easy to achieve for the reasons cited above (and they aren’t exhaustive), but because its absence can be catastrophic. Put another way, it provides a commonly-understood baseline and shared intent for all fighting echelons in that theatre of operations. When communication breaks down, which can often happen, leaders at the tactical level can make decisions based on the operational commander’s intent. This is what Germans called Auftragstaktik [‘mission-tactics’ or as the US military translates it, ‘mission command’]. The term often misunderstood, like Clausewitz’s schwerpunkt (which is NOT centre of gravity), had its meaning in professionalism and an entire military culture (Prussian and German) as it evolved over a long period of time. In his Instructions for Large Unit Commanders , Helmut Karl Bernhard von Moltke (the Elder) wrote in 1869: “In general, one does well to order no more than is absolutely necessary and to avoid planning beyond the situation one can foresee. These change very rapidly in war. Seldom will orders that anticipate far in advance and in detail succeed completely to execution. The higher the authority, the shorter and more general will the orders be. The next lower command adds what further precision appears necessary. The detail of execution is left to the verbal order, to the command. Each thereby retains freedom of action and decision within his authority.” This passage was quoted in ‘How the Germans Defined Auftragstaktik’ by Donald E. Vandergriff, a former US Army major. Vandergriff writes, “The overall commander’s intent is for the member to strive for professionalism. In return, the individual will be given latitude in the accomplishment of their given missions.” According to Lind, “During 19th-century war games, German junior officers routinely received problems that could only be solved by disobeying orders. Orders themselves specified the result to be achieved, but never the method ( Auftragstaktik ). Initiative was more important than obedience. Mistakes were tolerated as long as they came from too much initiative rather than too little.” Today’s wars and their many battles are far more complex. No CDF can stand on high ground like Bonaparte, observe enemy movements and send directives to commanders in the field. Yes, we have satellites and other means to have eyes on the enemy, but command has to be delegated and field commanders have to think on their feet. Nothing has changed on that count and nothing is likely to. Pakistani armed forces officials pictured on August 14, 2017: different services (army, navy, air force) have different cultures, communication protocols and priorities | AFP A SYSTEM-LEVEL ANALYSIS Critics would say: what are you talking about? Jointness is about the three services and making them fight like one unit, not in silos. A higher headquarters, in this case the CDF, will make the plans on the basis of threat assessment so the army, navy and air force can operate seamlessly, communicate with each other, be integrated. Sounds good. The problem is, wars have different formats. A conventional war is not the same as an irregular war or low-intensity conflict. A conventional, non-contact war (May is an example) is not the same as a ground incursion. A ground incursion at a single point or even multiple points in one theatre is not the same as on a very broad front. The fight is different in the mountains from operations in the plains or the desert. Air operations are not the same as naval operations and vice versa, though air can support both ground troops and naval attack vessels. A short, sharp war is different from a long, attritive war in the trenches, which is what we are witnessing in Ukraine. This brings into play the issues of training and doctrinal gaps. Different services (army, navy, air force) have different cultures, communication protocols, and priorities. This is a problem which has been analysed and written about a lot within the US military. Despite the emphasis on jointness, the US military continues to grapple with challenges like integrating complex systems, overcoming bureaucratic silos among services — what’s referred to as stove-piping — adapting to new threats (cyber, grey zone operations) etc. The services also face funding problems where the requirement of modernisation often runs into the problem of readiness. This invariably leads to inter-services friction. True jointness, in addition to other impediments, requires overcoming deep-seated institutional biases. Again, the point is not that jointness should be ditched. It’s a process. Joint planning forces different services to communicate, reveal their capabilities and limitations, and build (some) shared understanding before the battle. This relationship-building is as valuable as the plan itself. Equally, the plan cannot be taken as a rigid script. At best, it’s a foundation for adaptation whose goal, howsoever difficult, is to adapt together more effectively than the enemy. Put another way, coordination in real-battle conditions is often a patchwork effort to manage chaos at the operational and tactical levels. The elegant flowchart can only provide design principles. To expect more of it is to assume that one side has perfect information and, therefore, can work out every little detail about the adversary’s moves. That is simply not possible. Another downside of jointness and creating multiple headquarters that link up with a single office is bureaucratisation. This problem has been dealt with by various writers in relation to the US military, albeit that’s just one example. Personally, I find Edward Luttwak’s The Pentagon and the Art of War: The Question of Military Reform to be an incisive account. Luttwak highlights how the Pentagon’s immense budget often funds technically impressive but strategically useless weapons systems and is driven by bureaucratic incentives rather than genuine military need. Reason: large bureaucracies, in this case the Pentagon, prioritise internal processes, career advancement, and complex planning over effective outcomes, leading to waste and strategic blunders. Luttwak coined the “Luttwak Paradox”, which suggests that military efforts often become less effective as they become more complex and technically advanced. Jointness demands inter-services interface. In reality it means (again the US military’s example) that an individual service’s bureaucracy is not replaced. Instead, a new layer on top of existing bureaucracies is added. As identified by various writers, this means that a commander must navigate not only their own service’s logistics, personnel and acquisition systems but also the protocols, politics and resource battles of the joint structure. What begins with creating agility and clarity ends up doing the opposite: slowing things down. Complexity in systems is a subject long debated since American sociologist Charles Perrow’s analysis of the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown accident. What’s true of tightly coupled engineering systems and the cascading effect of failure in one spreading through the system is also true — in a different way — of complex human organisations. A good example of how what begins as an elegant concept can end up badly in the heat of battle was the ‘Systemic Operational Design’ created and introduced into the Zionist Occupation Force by Brig Gen Shimon Naveh, who headed the defunct Israeli Operational Theory Research Institute. The language of the concept, given the complexity it introduced, was never understood by the fighting echelons and their commanders who went to battle Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006. Success lies not in the most elaborate joint plan, but in creating the conditions where a simple directive, empowered subordinates, and shared awareness can produce coherent action in chaos. The system must be designed not for neatness on the drawing board, but for resilience under stress — and that almost always favours robust simplicity over fragile complexity, to use Lebanese-American writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s phrase. The challenge is to institutionalise the principles of jointness — shared intent, trust and interoperability — while minimising, to the extent possible, the bureaucratic structures that are supposed to deliver it. The aim is, to use the title of US Gen Stanley McChrystal’s book, create a ‘team of teams’ culture that coordinates organically and is not a rigid, top-down machine that requires constant management. In essence, go back to Elder Moltke’s advice: keep it simple. EPILOGUE Let’s recap: if we can make three disparate services with their own roles, systems, training protocols etc to roll together, that’s great. But if such integration is not done intelligently, it can end up defeating the very purpose for which jointness was undertaken. The other point, as discussed above, is that jointness was conceptualised and a system put in place in 1976. It was made to fail because allowing it to work would have undermined army chiefs and how they control(led) politics. Laying waste to that system, instead of strengthening it had nothing to do with military professionalism. What 27th Amendment has done is to constitutionalise what was long debated and opposed by proponents of balanced civil-military relations. To cloak it in the shiny garbs of jointness and operational integration is to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes. Jointness requires input from all services. Given the conduct of war, in most cases, the air force and navy will have a bigger role to play. If we are indeed looking for jointness from an operational, not political, angle then the office of CDF should be separate from the office of army chief, stand on its own and above the offices of service chiefs. And, yes, it should rotate among the three services. Finally, no matter how sound the planning at the top, battles are fought on the ground. It’s ultimately the commander in the field — at any level — who needs to have the Odyssean metis or what Bonaparte, in a different context, called coup d’œil — the glance that takes in a comprehensive view.

      "title": "RETHINKING PAKISTAN’S HIGHER DEFENCE",
      "summary": "“From Plato to Nato, the history of command in war consists of an endless quest for certainty…historical commanders have always faced the choice between two basic ways of coping with uncertainty…to construct an army of automatons following the orders of a single man, allowed to do only that which could be controlled; the other, to design organisations and operations in such a way as to enable the former to carry out the latter without the need for continuous control. …the second of these methods has, by and large, proved more successful than the first…” — Martin van Creveld quoted by William Lind in Manoeuvre Warfare Handbook “He plunged past with his bayonet towards the green hedge, King, honour, human dignity, etcetera Dropped like luxuries in a yelling alarm To get out of that blue crackling air His terror’s touchy dynamite.” — The Bayonet Charge by Ted Hughes SITUATING THE ISSUE Among other changes brought in by the 27th Constitutional Amendment, one relates to the creation of the office of Chief of Defence Forces (CDF). The position, which is to represent command of all three services, will not exist as an independent office but will be held concurrently by whoever is Chief of the Army Staff, beginning with the current incumbent. The amendment also extends the tenure of the current army chief/CDF as also those who would succeed him. The issue of the probity of the amendment and the manner in which it was pushed through continues to be debated. The delay in the notification gave rise to much speculation about the grey areas in the draft, which seemed tailored for specific circumstances and person but will impact the Higher Defence Organisation (HDO) and civil-military relations beyond this moment and its politics. Expectedly and rightly, the debate on the political aspects of the amendment should continue. My purpose here, however, is different and is related to analysing the argument, given by some former generals, that there’s nothing novel about the changes that have been made in the HDO because the issue was long being debated within the organisation and the system. They have argued that, in light of evolving warfare, the imperative for ‘jointness’ — seamless operational coordination among the services — has now been formalised through these changes. On the face of it, these arguments cannot be faulted. For instance, the need for coordination at all three levels — tactical (where battles are fought), operational (where planning is done to achieve the desired outcomes), and politico-strategic (the highest level that informs the purpose of war as also the direction and intent of the other two levels) — should be obvious. War is not a clash of mobs. It requires disciplined forces that must operate to create synergies. That requires coordination. The 27th Constitutional Amendment promises streamlined command across the military services by creating the post of Chief of Defence Forces. But neither is this a novel concept, nor is the current interpretation without its issues. History shows that organisational redesign alone cannot overcome the realities of conflict. Ejaz Haider urges revisiting the details of an important and necessary doctrine… However, agreeing with the obvious or stating it without reference — in this case, to factors that do not fall within the operational domain — is not the same thing as agreeing with the details of how it is to be achieved and why in a particular way and not in another. Further, while jointness is much talked about, like strategy, a term that has almost become meaningless, it must be problematised. It is neither a magic wand nor even desirable in many battle scenarios. We shall return to that. At this point, a caveat is in order. What follows is my view. There can be many views. Debates over doctrines and the best courses of action have to continue. Wars usually settle them! One example is the post-WWI debate in France over static and mobile defences. Critics of the idea of the Maginot Line — a vast French system of concrete fortifications, obstacles and weapon installations built along its eastern borders (Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland) in the 1930s — argued that it symbolised passivity, would be costly and a drain on resources and would not be effective against German manoeuvre warfare. The proponents argued that it would provide a strong defence, a base for counterattack and force the Germans into Belgium, drawing their main thrust into a pre-planned battleground. As it happened, the real test came with the German offensive. The Germans didn’t attack the main line. They rapidly advanced through the supposedly impassable Ardennes Forest, getting around the line’s northern end. The French, who had committed their best mobile forces to Belgium, had left the Ardennes and the road to Paris vulnerable. The point is that debates over this and that can only be settled when the real test of battle comes. The second issue is that wars are not linear. Nor do they follow a particular template, at least not for the winning side, which wins precisely because it does something different, unexpected. As the celebrated German Panzer commander Gen Hermann Balck once said, “There can be no fixed schemes. Every scheme, every pattern is wrong. No two situations are identical. That is why the study of military history can be extremely dangerous.” In other words, the official view remains untested. Let me begin this discussion with some history related to HDO in this country, take a look at jointness and its attendant problems and square it off with how battles frustrate top-down planning and why it is important to keep things simple. Pakistan Army’s Special Service Group (SSG) commandos march during a Pakistan Day parade: the challenge is to institutionalise the principles of jointness — shared intent, trust and interoperability — while minimising the bureaucratic structures that are supposed to deliver it | AFP HAVE WE THOUGHT OF JOINTNESS ONLY NOW? The short answer is no. We thought of it way back in the 1970s, after realising the organisational failures, both vertically and horizontally, in the 1965 and 1971 Wars. Gen Ehsanul Haq, former Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff and arguably a most experienced officer, wrote an excellent paper (2013) for the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) on higher defence organisation. The paper briefly traces the history of why the government of the day established the Joint Staff Headquarters (JSHQ) in March 1976, how and why the centrality of that JSHQ was undermined and what needs to be done to return to what was started in the mid-’70s. The paper is easily available for anyone interested in reading it, so I won’t go into the details of Gen Haq’s arguments. Two points are important, though. The first is a direct quote from the paper: “Given the political history of Pakistan, unless we build up credible security policy making mechanisms subordinated to Parliament and civilian control, ad hoc and parochial interests would continue to impact our policy formulation processes, undermining critical aspects of our national defence effort [Italics added].” This, as should be obvious, establishes the principle of civilian control and the fact that, in war’s three levels, the highest is the domain of the civilian principals. The second point is that jointness did not really require reinventing the wheel. JSHQ was meant precisely for that and, as Gen Haq suggested in 2013, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) could have been made Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff or, if we like CDF better for some reason, CJCSC could have been renamed CDF or CDS or whatever suits our fancy. The only point where I disagreed with Gen Haq’s excellent analysis when I first read the paper 12 years ago was his suggestion that “while the Chairman may continue to be from the Army (due to the predominance of land strategy and asymmetry in the size of the services), the Vice Chairman [4-star] may be on rotation between the Navy and the Air Force.” General Haq’s suggestion is/was in good faith.

Complexity in systems is a subject long debated since American sociologist Charles Perrow’s analysis of the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown accident. What’s true of tightly coupled engineering systems and the cascading effect of failure in one spreading through the system is also true — in a different way — of complex human organisations. A good example of how what begins as an elegant concept can end up badly in the heat of battle was the ‘Systemic Operational Design’ created and introduced into the Zionist Occupation Force by Brig Gen Shimon Naveh, who headed the defunct Israeli Operational Theory Research Institute. The language of the concept, given the complexity it introduced, was never understood by the fighting echelons and their commanders who went to battle Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006. Success lies not in the most elaborate joint plan, but in creating the conditions where a simple directive, empowered subordinates, and shared awareness can produce coherent action in chaos. The system must be designed not for neatness on the drawing board, but for resilience under stress — and that almost always favours robust simplicity over fragile complexity, to use Lebanese-American writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s phrase. The challenge is to institutionalise the principles of jointness — shared intent, trust and interoperability — while minimising, to the extent possible, the bureaucratic structures that are supposed to deliver it. The aim is, to use the title of US Gen Stanley McChrystal’s book, create a ‘team of teams’ culture that coordinates organically and is not a rigid, top-down machine that requires constant management. In essence, go back to Elder Moltke’s advice: keep it simple. EPILOGUE Let’s recap: if we can make three disparate services with their own roles, systems, training protocols etc to roll together, that’s great. But if such integration is not done intelligently, it can end up defeating the very purpose for which jointness was undertaken. The other point, as discussed above, is that jointness was conceptualised and a system put in place in 1976. It was made to fail because allowing it to work would have undermined army chiefs and how they control(led) politics. Laying waste to that system, instead of strengthening it had nothing to do with military professionalism. What 27th Amendment has done is to constitutionalise what was long debated and opposed by proponents of balanced civil-military relations. To cloak it in the shiny garbs of jointness and operational integration is to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes. Jointness requires input from all services. Given the conduct of war, in most cases, the air force and navy will have a bigger role to play. If we are indeed looking for jointness from an operational, not political, angle then the office of CDF should be separate from the office of army chief, stand on its own and above the offices of service chiefs. And, yes, it should rotate among the three services. Finally, no matter how sound the planning at the top, battles are fought on the ground. It’s ultimately the commander in the field — at any level — who needs to have the Odyssean metis or what Bonaparte, in a different context, called coup d’œil — the glance that takes in a comprehensive view.

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday condemned the “heinous” attack which claimed the lives of six United Nations (UN) peacekeepers from Bangladesh in Sudan’s Kadugli, calling for holding those responsible accountable. At least six Bangladeshi peacekeepers were killed and eight wounded in a drone attack on a UN base on Saturday in the disputed Abyei region between Sudan and South Sudan, according to Bangladesh’s armed forces. In a statement released on Monday, the FO said, “Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the heinous attack against UN peacekeepers in Kadugli, Sudan, which has resulted in the tragic deaths of six peacekeepers from Bangladesh serving with the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (Unisfa), and injuries to several others.” It expressed Pakistan’s deepest condolences to the government and people of Bangladesh on the lives lost, adding that Pakistan stood in solidarity with the bereaved families. “UN peacekeepers remain at the forefront of international efforts to prevent conflict, protect civilians, and support peace under the UN flag,” the FO statement said. “We pay homage to the ultimate sacrifice made by these Blue Helmets in the line of duty for peace and stability in the region,” it added. The FO also called for a swift investigation to identify the perpetrators of the “cowardly attack” and to hold the responsible parties accountable. “We will also continue to work closely with members of the UN Security Council and the international community to ensure the safety and security of all UN peacekeepers,” it said. Bangladesh is one of the largest contributors to UN peacekeeping missions and its troops have long been deployed in the volatile region. In a statement on Sunday, the Bangldesh armed forces’ public relations division said, “A drone attack was carried out by separatist armed groups on the Kadugali Logistics Base under the UN peacekeeping mission in Abyei, Sudan yesterday (Saturday) from approximately 3:40pm to 3:50pm local time.” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had also condemned the attack in a post on X, expressing his condolences to the families of those killed and wishing a speedy recovery to the injured. “Attacks against UN peacekeepers like this one are unjustifiable & may constitute war crimes. I remind everyone of their obligation to protect UN personnel and civilians,” he said. South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 following a long civil war, but they failed to agree on the status of several regions that both sides claimed sovereignty over.",

      "summary_orig": "A brave few dashed towards Australia’s Bondi Beach as a mass shooting unfolded on Sunday night, wading through fleeing crowds to rescue children, treat the injured and confront the gunmen. A father-and-son duo opened fire as crowds thronged Australia’s famous surf beach for a yearly Jewish celebration on a balmy summer evening, killing 15 people and wounding dozens more. Confronting tales of heroism and terror trickled out in the hours following Australia’s deadliest mass shooting in almost 30 years. A team of off-duty lifeguards sprinted across the sand to drag children to safety. “The team ran out under fire to try and clear children from the playground while the gunmen were firing,” said Steven Pearce from Surf Life Saving New South Wales. “They were able to get the children inside,” he told AFP . “The other lifesavers went out and started trying to do CPR on the shot victims, and tried to drag as many inside as they could.” Bleeding victims were carried across the beach atop surfboards turned into makeshift stretchers. A pregnant woman went into labour after taking refuge in the surf club’s headquarters, Pearce said, and was later rushed to hospital. “We have used every bandage in the surf clubs,” said Pearce. “Teams just ran out of everything.” Fruit seller Ahmed Al Ahmed, 43, was lauded as the man who disarmed one of the attackers. Footage showed a t-shirt clad man — later identified as Ahmed by local media — sneaking up on one of the gunmen. He briefly tussles with the shooter before knocking him to the ground and wresting away the weapon. View this post on Instagram “It’s been a very, very brave person, actually, who went and attacked frontally one of the shooters, and saved a lot of lives,” US President Donald Trump said of Ahmed. Churches, bars and restaurants threw open their doors to shelter the panicked crowds sprinting away from the beach. Frenchman Alban Baton, 23, hid for several hours with other customers in the cool room of a Bondi Beach grocery store. “It was very fast,” he told AFP . “One girl said: ‘There is one guy with a gun’. And from this moment, everybody ran, and it was like survival instinct, so we all run in the cool room,” he said. “Minute after minutes, we were starting to realise what was happening.” Mass shootings have been rare in Australia since a lone gunman killed 35 people in the tourist town of Port Arthur in 1996. The so-called Port Arthur massacre led to sweeping reforms that would come to be lauded around the world as a gold standard for gun safety.",

      "summary_orig": "Two alleged gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish celebration at Sydney’s Bondi Beach were a father and son, police said on Monday, as Australia began mourning victims of its worst gun violence in almost 30 years. The father, a 50-year-old, was killed at the scene, taking the number of dead to 16, while his 24-year-old son was in a critical condition in hospital, police said at a press conference on Monday. The father and son were identified as Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, respectively, by state broadcaster ABC and other local media outlets. Officials have described Sunday’s shooting as a targeted anti-Semitic attack. Forty people remain in hospital following the attack, including two police officers who are in a serious but stable condition, police said. The victims were aged between 10 and 87. Witnesses said the attack at the famed beach, which was packed on a hot evening, lasted about 10 minutes, sending hundreds of people scattering along the sand and into nearby streets. Police said around 1,000 people had attended the targeted Hanukkah event, which was held in a small park off the beach. A bystander captured on video tackling and disarming an armed man during the attack has been hailed as a hero whose actions saved lives. 7News Australia named him as Ahmed al Ahmed, citing a relative, who said the 43-year-old fruit shop owner had been shot twice and had undergone surgery. View this post on Instagram A fundraising page for the man had raised more than A$350,000 (£233,000) by Monday afternoon. Amid speculations regarding the identity and ethnic background of the attackers, police did not release the shooters’ names but said the father had held a firearms licence since 2015 and had six licensed weapons. Home Minister Tony Burke said the father arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa, while his son is an Australian-born citizen. Police did not provide details about the firearms, but videos from the scene showed the men firing what appeared to be a bolt-action rifle and a shotgun. “We are very much working through the background of both persons. At this stage, we know very little about them,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters. According to ABC , the two had possible links to the Islamic State group. Senior officials in the investigation told the ABC that two IS flags were found in the gunmen’s car at the beach, although New South Wales police said they could not confirm the report. Bondi local Morgan Gabriel, 27, said she had been heading to a nearby cinema when she heard what she thought were fireworks, before people started running up her street. “I sheltered about six or seven. Two of them were actually my close friends, and the rest were just people that were on the street. But people, their phones had been left down the beach, and everyone was just trying to get away,” she said. “It’s a very sad time this morning … Normally, like on a Monday or any morning, it’s packed. People are swimming, surfing, running. So this is very, very quiet. And there’s definitely a solemn sort of vibe.” A makeshift memorial with flowers and Israeli and Australian flags was set up at the Bondi pavilion and an online condolence book was established. Police and private Jewish security guards wearing earpieces were positioned around as mourners paid respects and laid flowers. World leaders condemn the attack Authorities said they were confident only two attackers were involved in the incident, after previously saying they were checking whether a third offender was involved. At the suspects’ home in Bonnyrigg, a suburb around 36 km west of the CBD, there was a heavy police presence on Monday, with a cordon wrapping around several neighbouring houses. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Bondi Beach on Monday morning to lay flowers near the scene of the attack. “What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of anti-Semitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location,” Albanese told reporters. “The Jewish community are hurting today. Today, all Australians wrap our arms around them and say, we stand with you. We will do whatever is necessary to stamp out antisemitism. It is a scourge, and we will eradicate it together.” Albanese later urged Australians to light a candle in solidarity with the Jewish community “to show that light will indeed defeat darkness — part of what Hanukkah celebrates”, he said. Albanese said several world leaders including US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron had reached out and offered condolences and support. Sunday’s shootings were the most serious in a string of anti-Semitic attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars in Australia since the beginning of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023. ‘Saw bodies on the ground ’ Mass shootings are rare in Australia, one of the world’s safest countries. Sunday’s attack was the worst since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people at the Port Arthur tourist site in the southern island state of Tasmania. Rabbi Mendel Kastel, whose brother-in-law Eli Schlanger was killed in Sunday’s attack, said it had been a harrowing evening. “You can very easily become very angry and try to blame people, turn on people but that’s not what this is about. It’s about a community,” he said. “We need to step up at a time like this, be there for each other, and come together. And we will, and we will get through this, and we know that. The Australian community will help us do it,” he added. Local woman Danielle, who declined to give her surname, was at the beach when the shooting occurred and raced to collect her daughter, who was attending a bar mitzvah at a function centre near where the alleged shooters were positioned. “I heard there was a shooting so I bolted there to get my daughter, I could hear gunshots, I saw bodies on the ground. We are used to being scared, we have felt this way since October 7.” Australia’s Jewish diaspora is small but deeply embedded in the wider community, with about 150,000 people who identify as Jewish in the country of 27 million. About one-third of them are estimated to live in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, including Bondi. Major cities including Berlin, London and New York stepped up security around Hanukkah events on Sunday following the attack at Bondi.",

And there’s definitely a solemn sort of vibe.” A makeshift memorial with flowers and Israeli and Australian flags was set up at the Bondi pavilion and an online condolence book was established. Police and private Jewish security guards wearing earpieces were positioned around as mourners paid respects and laid flowers. World leaders condemn the attack Authorities said they were confident only two attackers were involved in the incident, after previously saying they were checking whether a third offender was involved. At the suspects’ home in Bonnyrigg, a suburb around 36 km west of the CBD, there was a heavy police presence on Monday, with a cordon wrapping around several neighbouring houses. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Bondi Beach on Monday morning to lay flowers near the scene of the attack. “What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of anti-Semitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location,” Albanese told reporters. “The Jewish community are hurting today. Today, all Australians wrap our arms around them and say, we stand with you. We will do whatever is necessary to stamp out antisemitism. It is a scourge, and we will eradicate it together.” Albanese later urged Australians to light a candle in solidarity with the Jewish community “to show that light will indeed defeat darkness — part of what Hanukkah celebrates”, he said. Albanese said several world leaders including US President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron had reached out and offered condolences and support. Sunday’s shootings were the most serious in a string of anti-Semitic attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars in Australia since the beginning of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023. ‘Saw bodies on the ground ’ Mass shootings are rare in Australia, one of the world’s safest countries. Sunday’s attack was the worst since 1996, when a gunman killed 35 people at the Port Arthur tourist site in the southern island state of Tasmania. Rabbi Mendel Kastel, whose brother-in-law Eli Schlanger was killed in Sunday’s attack, said it had been a harrowing evening. “You can very easily become very angry and try to blame people, turn on people but that’s not what this is about. It’s about a community,” he said. “We need to step up at a time like this, be there for each other, and come together. And we will, and we will get through this, and we know that. The Australian community will help us do it,” he added. Local woman Danielle, who declined to give her surname, was at the beach when the shooting occurred and raced to collect her daughter, who was attending a bar mitzvah at a function centre near where the alleged shooters were positioned. “I heard there was a shooting so I bolted there to get my daughter, I could hear gunshots, I saw bodies on the ground. We are used to being scared, we have felt this way since October 7.” Australia’s Jewish diaspora is small but deeply embedded in the wider community, with about 150,000 people who identify as Jewish in the country of 27 million. About one-third of them are estimated to live in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, including Bondi. Major cities including Berlin, London and New York stepped up security around Hanukkah events on Sunday following the attack at Bondi.",

      "summary": "Two alleged gunmen who killed 15 people at a Jewish celebration at Sydney’s Bondi Beach were a father and son, police said on Monday, as Australia began mourning victims of its worst gun violence in almost 30 years. The father, a 50-year-old, was killed at the scene, taking the number of dead to 16, while his 24-year-old son was in a critical condition in hospital, police said at a press conference on Monday. The father and son were identified as Sajid Akram and Naveed Akram, respectively, by state broadcaster ABC and other local media outlets. Officials have described Sunday’s shooting as a targeted anti-Semitic attack. Forty people remain in hospital following the attack, including two police officers who are in a serious but stable condition, police said. The victims were aged between 10 and 87. Witnesses said the attack at the famed beach, which was packed on a hot evening, lasted about 10 minutes, sending hundreds of people scattering along the sand and into nearby streets. Police said around 1,000 people had attended the targeted Hanukkah event, which was held in a small park off the beach. A bystander captured on video tackling and disarming an armed man during the attack has been hailed as a hero whose actions saved lives. 7News Australia named him as Ahmed al Ahmed, citing a relative, who said the 43-year-old fruit shop owner had been shot twice and had undergone surgery. View this post on Instagram A fundraising page for the man had raised more than A$350,000 (£233,000) by Monday afternoon. Amid speculations regarding the identity and ethnic background of the attackers, police did not release the shooters’ names but said the father had held a firearms licence since 2015 and had six licensed weapons. Home Minister Tony Burke said the father arrived in Australia in 1998 on a student visa, while his son is an Australian-born citizen. Police did not provide details about the firearms, but videos from the scene showed the men firing what appeared to be a bolt-action rifle and a shotgun. “We are very much working through the background of both persons. At this stage, we know very little about them,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters. According to ABC , the two had possible links to the Islamic State group. Senior officials in the investigation told the ABC that two IS flags were found in the gunmen’s car at the beach, although New South Wales police said they could not confirm the report. Bondi local Morgan Gabriel, 27, said she had been heading to a nearby cinema when she heard what she thought were fireworks, before people started running up her street. “I sheltered about six or seven. Two of them were actually my close friends, and the rest were just people that were on the street. But people, their phones had been left down the beach, and everyone was just trying to get away,” she said. “It’s a very sad time this morning … Normally, like on a Monday or any morning, it’s packed.

      "summary_orig": "Hong Kong’s High Court on Monday found tycoon and pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai guilty of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces in the city’s highest-profile trial under a China-imposed national security law that could see him jailed for life. The landmark case has drawn international scrutiny of Hong Kong’s judicial independence amid a years-long crackdown on rights and freedoms in the global financial hub after 2019 pro-democracy protests that Beijing saw as a challenge to its rule. While 78-year-old Lai’s supporters see him as a freedom fighter, Beijing sees him as a mastermind of the protests and a conspirator advocating for US sanctions against Hong Kong and the mainland. Chinese authorities have rejected accusations of eroding the city’s rule of law. “There is no doubt” that Lai “had harboured his resentment and hatred of” China for many of his adult years, Judge Esther Toh told a packed courtroom as the tycoon, wearing a pale green jumper and a grey jacket, sat with his arms folded. The two other judges in his case were Alex Lee and Susana D’Almada Remedios. Sentencing expected next year Lai, the founder of the now- shuttered Apple Daily newspaper and one of the most prominent critics of China’s Communist Party leadership, has already spent five years in jail , facing a slew of litigation under the sweeping security legislation that Beijing enacted in response to the 2019 protests. A pre-sentencing hearing where Lai can plead for lenience is scheduled for January 12. His lawyer Steven Kwan said Lai will decide whether to appeal after the sentencing. Hong Kong’s national security police chief Steve Li said on Monday he welcomed the verdict. Lai, who suffers from health issues including diabetes and high blood pressure, was found guilty on two counts of conspiracy to collude with foreign forces and one of conspiracy to publish seditious material. He had pleaded not guilty on all counts. The verdict bookends a year that marked the essential disappearance of Hong Kong’s democratic opposition under pressure from Beijing. The Democratic Party voted to disband on Sunday. Outside the court, people overnight formed a queue more than a block long, some with camping gear, seeking to attend the verdict. Police were monitoring the area around the building. Rights groups criticise verdict Lai’s trial began in December 2023 in the former British colony that reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, with the verdict seen as a potential fresh diplomatic flashpoint. Countries including the US and Britain, as well as rights groups, say the trial is politically motivated and have called for Lai’s immediate release. US President Donald Trump raised Lai’s case with Xi in a meeting in October and has said he would do his utmost to “save” Lai. Beh Lih Yi, Asia-Pacific director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, called the verdict a “sham conviction” and “a disgraceful act of persecution”. “The ruling underscores Hong Kong’s utter contempt for press freedom,” she said. “Jimmy Lai’s only crime is running a newspaper and defending democracy.” Media advocacy group Reporters Without Borders also described Lai’s trial as “a sham”. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments have said the tycoon’s trial was fair and that the national security law treats all equally. They have said no freedoms are absolute when it comes to safeguarding national security. Lai’s family say his health has worsened after more than 1,800 days in solitary confinement, and that he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and heart palpitations. His verdict comes at a delicate moment for Hong Kong, where residents have been mourning after a fire last month killed at least 160 people in one of the worst blazes in a residential complex globally in recent years. Chinese national security authorities have warned they would crack down on any “anti-China” individuals who tried to use the fire to “plunge Hong Kong back into the chaos” of 2019, when massive pro-democracy protests triggered a political crisis.",

But at a late-night news conference hours later, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley and other state and local officials told reporters the man detained would be released from custody, saying the investigation was going into a “different direction”. “We have not yet solved this case, but I am confident we are going to do that in the near future,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said. Officials declined to elaborate on why the man who was taken into custody was detained in the first place. “There was a quantum of evidence which justified detaining this person as a person of interest,” Neronha said, adding that investigators later determined there was “no basis to believe that he’s a person of interest, so … he’s being released”. Authorities said they believed an unidentified person pictured in surveillance footage to be the person they were still looking for. FBI Director Kash Patel said earlier on Sunday in a post on X that the person of interest had been detained in a hotel room in the Rhode Island town of Coventry, a 30-minute drive from the Brown campus. An FBI team specialising in cellular data analysis used geolocation information to track the suspect, Patel said. While the killer was presumed to remain at large, authorities said on Sunday night they would not reimpose an initial shelter-in-place order for the campus and surrounding community that had been lifted. The mass shooting — the latest of nearly 400 in the US this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive — shook the community at the university, one of the oldest in the United States. The school cancelled exams and classes for the rest of the year, and the campus was quiet on Sunday as a light snowfall blanketed the city. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said that authorities, as of midday on Sunday, had not yet contacted all of the victims’ family members because some were travelling. He invited residents to a previously planned event on Sunday to light a Christmas tree and a menorah to mark the first night of Hanukkah. “It is quite clear that if we can come together as a community and shine a little bit of light tonight, I think there’s nothing better that we could be doing,” Smiley said. Authorities release video of suspect Seven people injured at Brown University were in stable condition, Smiley said. One remained in critical but stable condition, while another had been discharged, he added. Shelter-in-place orders at the university and nearby areas were lifted on Sunday. Smiley said earlier in the day that residents should expect a visible police presence across the city. The gunman fled after shooting students in a classroom in Brown’s Barus & Holley engineering and physics building, where outer doors had been left unlocked while exams were taking place, officials said on Saturday. Authorities on Saturday released a short video clip of a person of interest dressed in black walking near the engineering building. Providence Deputy Police Chief Timothy O’Hara said on Saturday the individual may have worn a mask, but officials were not certain. Brown President Christina Paxson told reporters that all or nearly all of the victims were students, adding: “This is the day one hopes never happens, and it has.” Students caught by surprise Ref Bari, 22, a graduate student at Brown, said he was inside the Barus & Holley building when he heard a series of loud popping sounds that appeared to be gunfire. Bari ran out of the building and asked another student running in the street if he could hide with her and her friends, and she agreed. They returned to her basement apartment and hid in the bathroom. “She trusted me,” he said. “The only connection between us is we’re both students at Brown, but beyond that, we don’t know each other.” Teaching assistant Joseph Oduro, 21, told CNN he was in a classroom that was attacked. “The first couple of gunshots went straight to the chalkboard right where I was standing,” Oduro said. “Who knows, if I didn’t duck, maybe I’m not here today.” A student next to him took two bullets to the leg and was due to undergo surgery on Sunday, he said. Jack DiPrimio, another graduate student at Brown, said he was initially not concerned when the university went on lockdown because he had experienced many active-shooter drills. The drills have become more common in the US as attacks targeting students have increased. “I had faced so many lockdowns in high school and even a few at my undergrad, so I wasn’t that worried at first,” DiPrimio said in a TikTok video after coming out of a five-hour lockdown. “Maybe I was desensitised.”",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: The ongoing development projects — both public and private sectors — have come to a grinding halt in Lahore and other parts of Punjab after the suspension of delivery of supplies of construction material due to the ongoing wheel-jam strike by goods transporters. The situation of dust pollution, smog and other environmental issues has also worsened due to the incomplete projects, Dawn has learnt. “At present, the work on all the ongoing development projects in which construction material (mainly cement, crushed stones etc) is required is stopped for the last seven days or so due to the suspension of material delivery from Sargodha and other parts of Punjab,” commented an official of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA). “The situation persists not only in Lahore but also in other cities and towns of the province where a huge number of development works are underway at the moment,” he added. According to another official source in the Metropolitan Corporation Lahore, the work on the ongoing development schemes under the Lahore Development Plan (LDP) has also slowed down due to the non-supply of construction material. “The concrete work is a vital part of construction that cannot be completed without crushed stones, cement and other items,” he explained. Public and private sector development projects in Punjab have come to a grinding halt owing to the lack of construction material delivery Talking to Dawn , a private builder said that all construction-related activities requiring core building material had stopped or slowed down not only in Lahore but also in other cities including Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Sahiwal, Bahawalpur and Multan. “At present, no work is in progress at the under-construction building requiring brickwork, lenter, plaster, tilework etc, as there is no supply of cement, crushed stone and other material. Even those constructing their houses privately have no option but to stop work in such a terrible situation,” he explained. He requested the government to make efforts to resume business activities as the same was also causing unemployment. On the other hand, the transporters have refused to surrender before the government till the acceptance of their demands, including suspension of the controversial clauses of the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 2025, stopping registration of FIRs against drivers, imposition of heavy fines and impounding vehicles on various traffic laws violations. “We will not call off the strike until the acceptance of our genuine demands,” said Khalid Arain of the Punjab Stone Transporters Association based in Sargodha. “We can call off the strike if, at least, someone responsible can give us an assurance to resolve our issues within the shortest possible time,” he said, requesting the government to cooperate for the sake of a huge number of people having no work due to the strike. EXHIBITION: The annual Chrysanthemum Flower Show 2025, organised by the Parks & Horticulture Authority (PHA), is in full swing at the Jilani Park, captivating citizens with its vibrant colours, pleasant fragrance, and creative floral displays. The event has emerged as a major attraction for families, with more than 100,000 people visiting the park over the weekend alone to enjoy the breathtaking exhibition. According to PHA Managing Director Raja Mansoor Ahmad, the visitors had appreciated the excellent arrangements, artistic presentation, and innovative landscaping showcased at the exhibition. Featuring more than 200 varieties of flowers and thousands of beautifully arranged flowerpots, the show has transformed Jilani Park into a mesmerizing blend of colors and scents. The park has become a serene, family-friendly, and visually appealing recreational destination for children, women, and men alike. “Chrysanthemum Flower Show will continue at Jilani Park until December 15,” said the MD. He said that the annual flower show had proven to be a special gift for the public. “So far, more than 1.5 million visitors have attended the exhibition, reflecting its immense popularity and public appreciation,” he added.

He said that the annual flower show had proven to be a special gift for the public. “So far, more than 1.5 million visitors have attended the exhibition, reflecting its immense popularity and public appreciation,” he added.

But it remains fragile as Israel and Hamas accuse each other almost daily of violations. The agreement is composed of three phases. In the first phase of the deal, Palestinian committed to relea­sing the remaining 48 living and dead captives held in the territory. So far they have released all of the prisoners except for one body. Under the second phase Israeli troops would further withdraw from their positions in Gaza and be replaced by an international stabilisation force, while Hamas would lay down its weapons. Israel has repeatedly insisted Hamas “will be disarmed”. The third phase includes the reconstruction of the vast areas of Gaza levelled by Israel’s retaliatory military campaign. Hayya also confirmed the head of the group’s weapons production was killed in an Israeli strike in the Gaza Strip the day before. “The Palestinian people are currently going through difficult times and suffering greatly… with the martyrdom of more than 70,000 people, the latest of whom was the mujahid commander Raed Saad and his companions.” Raed Saed’s funeral Israel announced on Saturday that it had killed Saad, describing him as “one of the architects” of the Oct 2023 raid. Thousands of Hamas supporters rallied in central Gaza City at a funeral for senior commander Raed Saed and three associates killed alongside him on Saturday. The mourners chanted “Martyrs are dear to God” and carried the bodies in coffins draped in green Hamas flags, in one of the group’s biggest displays of its presence since a US-backed ceasefire deal came into effect in Gaza in October.

Both LeT and JeM were declared proscribed organisations by Pakistan in 2002. The proposed sanctions — a global asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo — signal closer US-India counterterrorism cooperation. Yet, strikingly, the joint statement does not mention Pakistan. That omission has not gone unnoticed, especially given India’s frequent charge that such groups operate from Pakistani soil — a claim Islamabad denies. Joint call makes no mention of Islamabad, despite India’s wishes Observers interpret the omission as deliberate and revealing of Washington’s strategic balancing act in South Asia. As Washington-based analyst Shuja Nawaz noted: “The US may have avoided naming Pakistan. It has named India as a partner in the Indo-Pacific theatre. I wonder how long this straddling policy will last.” The US and Indian delegations, led respectively by Monica Jacobsen of the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and India’s Counterterrorism Joint Secretary Vinod Bahade, emphasised cooperation in training, cybersecurity, judicial coordination, mutual legal assistance and intelligence-sharing. They condemned recent attacks notably the April 22 Pahalgam attack and the Nov 10 Red Fort incident in New Delhi — stressing that “those responsible for terrorism should be held accountable”. They also welcomed the US designation of The Resistance Front (TRF), which India blames for being behind the Pahalgam attack, as both a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and Specially-Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). But as observers noted, the silence on Pakistan reflects a US desire to continue counterterrorism cooperation with India, while keeping open diplomatic space with Pakistan, whose utility Washington appears to value anew. The broader context helps explain this approach. According to a Dec 8 Foreign Policy article titled ‘Trump’s Pivot to Pakistan’, the warming of US-Pakistan relations since mid-2025 has been dramatic. The piece noted that President Trump has “developed a close relationship with senior Pakistani leadership, including the country’s powerful military chief, Asim Munir, whom he hosted at the White House in June and again in September, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whom he met three times this year.” As the article reports, “The Pakistanis have done a very good job of developing a positive relationship with President Trump,” according to a former US diplomat who requested anonymity. The logic seems tactical: Islamabad has offered “things of value” from cooperation on counterterrorism (including high-profile arrests of militants), to access to critical minerals , to interest in emerging sectors such as energy, mining, and even cryptocurrency — aligning with some of Trump’s strategic and personal predilections. According to one former Pakistani ambassador to the US, the outreach has been carefully crafted: “They gave him the praise that he wanted,” the diplomat said. In this context, the joint US-India terror-designation statement can be read as tactical: the US still wants to maintain the appearance of cooperation with India on counterterrorism, but avoids confrontation with Pakistan, preserving for Islamabad a renewed space in US foreign policy. That’s why observers argue the omission of Pakistan in the joint statement is not a mere oversight, but a reflection of evolving US strategy in South Asia, where alliances are becoming more transactional, fluid and hedged. The next session of the India-US JWGCT and Designations Dialogue scheduled in the United States will offer an early test of whether this balancing act can hold. In the meantime, the strategic triangle between Washington, New Delhi and Islamabad appears more complex and fragile than ever before. Published in Dawn, December 15th, 2025",

He said there was no difference between the stance of Afghan clerics and that of those belonging to Pakistan. “There are two basic points in the declaration. First, they [Afghan clerics] say that aggression against Afghan soil is unacceptable, and we say that terrorism in Pakistan is unacceptable. Second, they say that Afghan soil should not be used against any other country, and we hold the same opinion. There should be no attacks on Pakistan from Afghanistan and vice versa,” he added. Stressing that peace and stability in the region are in the collective interest, he thanked Turkiye, Qatar and Saudi Arabia for their attempts to negotiate between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Mr Ashrafi warned that any attempt to raise voices against the armed forces would be strongly resisted. He said that if the need arose, religious seminaries and mosques would stand ready to defend the country, its security and stability. He emphasised that safeguarding the homeland was a collective responsibility. Calling for political maturity, Mr Ashrafi urged all political parties to sit together and engage in dialogue to strengthen the country’s defence, economy and internal stability. He criticised the use of abusive language in politics, saying that those who resorted to hate speech did not want peace in the country. He said scholars from all schools of thought had unanimously declared that violent behaviour was unacceptable. “Our objective is to take the country towards the caliphate system through peaceful means,” he added.

The calls for action came during a meeting of Special Representatives for Afghanistan from neighbouring countries, plus Russia. The Taliban were invi­ted to participate, but declined to attend, according to statements from both Iranian and Taliban officials. The high-level gathering in the Iranian capital brought together special representatives from Paki­stan, China, Russia, Tajiki­stan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan to discuss shared security concerns and strategies for engaging with Afgha­nistan’s de facto authorities. Pakistan’s Special Rep­re­sentative for Afgha­nistan Mohammad Sadiq made the country’s position clear, emphasising the persistent threat of terrorism originating from Afghan territory. “The continued threat of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil is a big challenge for the region,” Mr Sadiq said, according to a statement. He highlighted that a stable Afghanistan, free from terrorist elements, was essential for gaining the trust of its neighbours and unlocking its vast economic potential. “It is, therefore, imperative that the current de-facto rulers take steps to ameliorate their suffering. And the foremost step in this regard would be to rid their soil indiscriminately of all types of terrorists,” he stated. He later posted on X that “the people of Afghanistan have already suffered enough and they deserve better”. Only an Afghanistan that does not harbour terrorists, he explained, will inspire confidence in neighbouring countries to meaningfully engage, which would in turn help realise the country’s immense potential for economic connectivity. The regional forum was first initiated and hosted by Pakistan in September 2021, just weeks after the Taliban seized control of Kabul as US and Nato forces completed their withdrawal after a 20-year conflict. Iran hosted the second foreign ministers’ meeting of the group in late October 2021. However, the forum has struggled to achieve its goals. According to Pakistan’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Khan, the original intent was for the group to make collective decisions, including the possibility of a coordinated recognition of the Taliban government. “The grouping could not become an effective forum as the Taliban did not positively respond,” Mr Khan told Dawn on Sunday. He added that Pakistan had hoped the neighbouring countries would adopt a unified approach on critical issues such as counter-terrorism, political inclusivity, girls’ education, and human and women’s rights in Afghanistan. Separately, Ambassador Sadiq held a bilateral meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi. According to Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, Muhammad Muddasir Tipu, Sadiq expressed hope that the meeting would play a useful role in promoting regional peace. “Recalling closer interactions taking place between leaderships of both countries at the highest levels in the past two years, Mr Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to further deepen and widen its ties with Pakistan,” Mr Tipu wrote on X. Regional solutions Mr Araqchi, addressing the meeting, argued that Afghanistan’s stability hinges on its integration into regional political and economic structures, not on external involvement. “Experience has shown that ‘imported prescriptions and trans-regional decisions’ have failed to bring stability to crisis-hit countries,” he said, according to Iran’s Press TV . He highlighted the primary role of neighbouring states, describing them as the “most natural and reliable” actors capable of addressing Afghanistan’s complex challenges. Mr Araghchi pointed to Afghanistan’s strategic geoeconomic position at the intersection of Central, West, and South Asia, highlighting its potential to serve as a vital corridor for trade, energy transit, and regional connectivity. The Iranian foreign minister argued that the security and prosperity of Afghanistan are inseparable from the interests of the entire region. “Afghanistan’s stability and development are not only a humanitarian necessity but also a strategic imperative for the entire region,” he noted. He called for collective responsibility and confidence-building measures among regional nations, warning against an over-reliance on security-centric approaches and the neglect of Afghanistan’s social and cultural realities. Mr Araghchi attributed past failures to these factors, as well as the marginalisation of regional actors and the chaotic foreign military withdrawal in 2021 and said the integration of Afghanistan into regional political and economic processes would help establish long-term stability and reduce tensions. Reaffirming Iran’s commitment, he said his country was ready to expand cooperation with Afghanistan’s neighbours in transportation, trade, energy, and consular services, arguing that regional convergence could create a sustainable framework for cooperation centred on Afghanistan. “At the heart of all these efforts are the people of Afghanistan, who deserve a secure and dignified future,” he said. Taliban decline invitation Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baqaei, confirmed at a briefing that the Taliban had been formally invited, stating that Iran believed their participation would enhance mutual understanding and help resolve issues between Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries. “Afghanistan, however, chose not to attend the meeting, a decision that Iran respects,” Baqaei said, according to the IRNA news agency. He noted that the meeting allowed participating countries to discuss regional developments, including recent border tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Baqaei stressed Iran’s concerns over regional stability, saying, “Iran shares a total border of nearly 2,000 kilometres with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any tension that arises between the two countries will inevitably affect us as well.” Kabul’s decision to stay away was criticised by Asif Durrani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to Iran. “The Taliban regime’s decision not to participate in tomorrow’s Tehran meeting of senior officials from Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours and Russia is further proof of the Taliban’s lack of political maturity,” Durrani wrote on X. “This decision reinforces the argument that the Taliban cannot negotiate an issue; a mere ‘ Na-manu (don’t accept)’ is a head-in-the-sand attitude and will not resolve the serious problems.” Published in Dawn, December 15th, 2025",

And the foremost step in this regard would be to rid their soil indiscriminately of all types of terrorists,” he stated. He later posted on X that “the people of Afghanistan have already suffered enough and they deserve better”. Only an Afghanistan that does not harbour terrorists, he explained, will inspire confidence in neighbouring countries to meaningfully engage, which would in turn help realise the country’s immense potential for economic connectivity. The regional forum was first initiated and hosted by Pakistan in September 2021, just weeks after the Taliban seized control of Kabul as US and Nato forces completed their withdrawal after a 20-year conflict. Iran hosted the second foreign ministers’ meeting of the group in late October 2021. However, the forum has struggled to achieve its goals. According to Pakistan’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Khan, the original intent was for the group to make collective decisions, including the possibility of a coordinated recognition of the Taliban government. “The grouping could not become an effective forum as the Taliban did not positively respond,” Mr Khan told Dawn on Sunday. He added that Pakistan had hoped the neighbouring countries would adopt a unified approach on critical issues such as counter-terrorism, political inclusivity, girls’ education, and human and women’s rights in Afghanistan. Separately, Ambassador Sadiq held a bilateral meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi. According to Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, Muhammad Muddasir Tipu, Sadiq expressed hope that the meeting would play a useful role in promoting regional peace. “Recalling closer interactions taking place between leaderships of both countries at the highest levels in the past two years, Mr Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to further deepen and widen its ties with Pakistan,” Mr Tipu wrote on X. Regional solutions Mr Araqchi, addressing the meeting, argued that Afghanistan’s stability hinges on its integration into regional political and economic structures, not on external involvement. “Experience has shown that ‘imported prescriptions and trans-regional decisions’ have failed to bring stability to crisis-hit countries,” he said, according to Iran’s Press TV . He highlighted the primary role of neighbouring states, describing them as the “most natural and reliable” actors capable of addressing Afghanistan’s complex challenges. Mr Araghchi pointed to Afghanistan’s strategic geoeconomic position at the intersection of Central, West, and South Asia, highlighting its potential to serve as a vital corridor for trade, energy transit, and regional connectivity. The Iranian foreign minister argued that the security and prosperity of Afghanistan are inseparable from the interests of the entire region. “Afghanistan’s stability and development are not only a humanitarian necessity but also a strategic imperative for the entire region,” he noted. He called for collective responsibility and confidence-building measures among regional nations, warning against an over-reliance on security-centric approaches and the neglect of Afghanistan’s social and cultural realities. Mr Araghchi attributed past failures to these factors, as well as the marginalisation of regional actors and the chaotic foreign military withdrawal in 2021 and said the integration of Afghanistan into regional political and economic processes would help establish long-term stability and reduce tensions. Reaffirming Iran’s commitment, he said his country was ready to expand cooperation with Afghanistan’s neighbours in transportation, trade, energy, and consular services, arguing that regional convergence could create a sustainable framework for cooperation centred on Afghanistan. “At the heart of all these efforts are the people of Afghanistan, who deserve a secure and dignified future,” he said. Taliban decline invitation Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baqaei, confirmed at a briefing that the Taliban had been formally invited, stating that Iran believed their participation would enhance mutual understanding and help resolve issues between Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries. “Afghanistan, however, chose not to attend the meeting, a decision that Iran respects,” Baqaei said, according to the IRNA news agency. He noted that the meeting allowed participating countries to discuss regional developments, including recent border tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Baqaei stressed Iran’s concerns over regional stability, saying, “Iran shares a total border of nearly 2,000 kilometres with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any tension that arises between the two countries will inevitably affect us as well.” Kabul’s decision to stay away was criticised by Asif Durrani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to Iran. “The Taliban regime’s decision not to participate in tomorrow’s Tehran meeting of senior officials from Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours and Russia is further proof of the Taliban’s lack of political maturity,” Durrani wrote on X. “This decision reinforces the argument that the Taliban cannot negotiate an issue; a mere ‘ Na-manu (don’t accept)’ is a head-in-the-sand attitude and will not resolve the serious problems.” Published in Dawn, December 15th, 2025",

Authorities identified the CTD official as Khalil Ahmed, who was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Tusp area of Panjgur. His body, which showed signs of torture and gunshot wounds, was later found dumped in an abandoned site in Tusp. Locals informed the authorities about the presence of a body, prompting police to rush to the Chakul locality on the outskirts of Panjgur town. Police took custody of the body and shifted it to the district hospital. Later, family members protested in front of the district police officer in Panjgur to press the police for immediate arrest of the kidnappers and killers. The protesters alleged police had been informed about the abduction of the official, but they did not rescue him. However, after negotiations with police officials and the district administration, the demonstrators ended their protest and dispersed peacefully. Police said an investigation into the incident is underway. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing of the official. Meanwhile, two other people were killed in Turbat, police said. They said armed men riding motorcycles targeted Muhammad Naeem in the Kahirabad area, killing him on the spot before speeding away. In a similar shooting, armed men killed a man in the Absar area of Turbat before fleeing. The body was shifted to the Turbat hospital. “In both incidents attackers fired at their targets from close range, which caused their instant death,” police said.
