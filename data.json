      "summary_orig": "BEFORE we move on to actually discussing the ramifications of the Pakistan-Saudi mutual defence agreement let’s first thank the two men who helped make it possible, starting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose strategic blunder in May this year — fuelled by hubris, rabid nationalism and a gross overestimation of India’s capabilities — continues to be a gift that keeps on giving. For Pakistan, that is. In launching his unprovoked attack on Pakistan and getting a bloody nose in return, he not only succeeded in puncturing India’s aura but also, crucially, showed the world that Pakistan’s military is very much capable of taking on a much larger adversary armed with the latest military tech from around the world. No one was more surprised by this than Pakistanis themselves. Next, we should also thank Modi’s ally and ideological twin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who — deep in the throes of an unquenchable bloodlust and feeling absolutely invincible — conducted air strikes in the capital of Qatar, purportedly to assassinate Hamas leaders who were meeting there. While he did not achieve his stated objectives, he has almost certainly succeeded in making the Gulf states consider exactly what a US defence shield is worth, when it is ineffective in curbing Israeli aggression. It has also certainly caused those states to consider that Israel’s expansionist agenda encompasses the entire region and not ‘just’ Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Here we see a perfect example of the application of the law of unintended consequences. The pact reverses the drift between Islamabad and Riyadh. This then starts a serious conversation about how to hedge against uncertainty in a world that is, and will remain, in serious strategic flux. And one way to do that is by means of bilateral, and perhaps even eventually multilateral and regional, security pacts. The deal signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia can thus be correctly seen in that context, and while it is in many ways a culmination of the decades-long relationship between the two states and was certainly in the works for some time, I have little doubt that the Israeli attacks on Doha added a very real sense of urgency. What this pact also does is to reverse what had been a clear drift between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. We would do well to recall that Pakistan had previously resisted Saudi entreaties to join in their war against Yemen , and the refusal to do so had indeed soured relations to a considerable extent. This period also saw Saudi Arabia, along with other Gulf states, move closer to India, to Pakistan’s detriment. That this trend seems to be halting may also have to do with India’s very clear alliance with Israel — recently the Gaza genocide’s poster boy, Israeli minister Bezalel Smotrich, was in India to sign a bilateral treaty and Modi took over 24 hours to condemn the attacks on Doha, without once even naming Israel. While this does not entail any sort of actual break between the Gulf states and India, it should provoke a rethink. Naturally there are some very real questions and concerns in Pakistan as to what this pact would actually entail. If India were to attack Pakistan again, would Saudi Arabia deploy its troops in defence of Pakistan? To be frank, this is unlikely at best, and would not even be something Pakistan needs. What this pact will do, however, is raise the costs of any future aggression by India and complicate their strategic calculations. If the details of the pact are ambiguous, then that is by design. Other voices in Pakistan are (habi­tually) asking whe­ther this means that the country will once again become embroiled in ‘some-one else’s war’ and concerns are being raised as to whe­ther the true target of this pact is Iran. Now, had this pact been signed a few years or even a few months ago, then this would have been a valid concern. But with Iran no longer the existential threat it was considered to be by the Gulf states pre-Oct 7, 2023, and very clear signals of rapprochement between Riyadh and Tehran , this sort of thinking should be considered the concerns of a by­­gone era. It is worth noting that a few days before this pact was signed, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hosted Iran’s Ali Larijani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, in Riyadh. As for the rest of the Gulf states, the pact provides a template for similar agreements. Qatar, given its close relations with Turkiye, could opt for a similar arrangement with Ankara, which then could also be extended to Pakistan. Here, the real wild card is the UAE, which, with its destabilising tentacles spread as far afield as Libya and Sudan, will likely remain aloof, trusting in its close relations with Israel to keep the peace.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister She­hbaz Sharif on Sunday said that as neighbours, the onus is now on India and Pakistan, whether to live in peace or war. Speaking at a gathering of overseas Pakistanis in London, the prime minister said that Pakistan wanted to hold dialogue with India on contentious issues like Kashmir, terrorism, water and trade on the basis of equality. The prime minister said that without the resolution of the Kashmir issue, which was the key to the regional peace, bilateral ties between the two countries could not be established. “Anyone who is thinking otherwise is akin to living in a fool’s paradise,” he said, adding that Kashmiris would get their right to self-determination and freedom. Expresses grief over 64,000 deaths, grave humanitarian situation in Gaza “I have made this offer so many times in the past. We want to discuss Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism issues, not because of any weakness but on the basis of equal terms,” the prime minister said. After visiting Saudi Arabia, PM Shehbaz made a stopover in London for four days and then he will proceed to the US on Monday to attend United Nations General Assembly conference . He said that as the ceasefire between Pakistan and India had been achieved, Pakistan wanted peace, progress and prosperity and an end to unemployment and poverty. Underlining the significance of unity and solidarity which led to triumph in the recent armed conflict with India, PM Shehbaz pledged to guide the country on the path of progress and prosperity. The prime minister said that after India’s baseless allegations over Pah­algam incident, he had offered, during his visit to Kakul, a probe by an international committee into the incident in a fair, impartial and transparent manner, but India did not respond to his offer. On May 6, aggression was unleashed against the innocent civilians and civilian assets were attacked inside Pakistan, leading to causalities, he said, adding that Pakistan in its right of defence, downed six enemy’s fighter jets in one go which made the enemy realise its precarious position. Expressing his grief over 64,000 deaths and grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, he said the world had not witnessed such heart-wrenching scenes The prime minister called upon the Islamic world and the international community to come forward and address the issue urgently. He said that on the basis of hard work of overseas Pakistanis, in the previous year, the country received $38.5 billion in remittances, adding that without this contribution of overseas Pakistanis, the country’s economy could not move forward. He said the country’s economic indicators were showing upward trends and at the diplomatic front, the country was strengthening its ties and position. Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar said that overseas Pakistanis were the country’s diplomats. He said in the year 2022, when the incumbent government came to power, it was a difficult time as the country was at the verge of default, and the global rating agencies and institutions were setting dates in this regard. He said the nation saluted the prime minister for his dynamic leadership that ensured economic turnaround. Enumerating the downward trends in the inflation and interest rates, he resolved that the government was striving for the economic empowerment. Referring to the Indian aggression, he said Pakistan defeated an enemy that boasted of its armed power and regional net security provider, adding that the myth was buried on May 10. Referring to climate change impact, Mr Dar said that Pakistan was vulnerable to climate change and the government was devising projects so that in the coming years, the country could be able to cope with this challenge. He said the government was also raising its voice for the equality and justice, because the climate change was a matter of justice, not only for Pakistan but for any country suffering from the emissions worldwide.

      "summary_orig": "FOLLOWING a week of political mudslinging , the cricketers of India and Pakistan resumed the unequal music of their rivalry on Sunday. Pakistan’s only chance was posting a total that could pressurise India’s formidable batting line-up. Encouragingly, they took that chance in the first half of their innings and at the end, but a baffling seven overs of lethargy in the middle terminally damaged the team’s prospects. India’s openers, Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill, thrashed Pakistan’s bowling all around the Dubai International Stadium. By the 10th over, India had full control of the game and had lost no wickets. This shows that India produces batsmen while Pakistan unearths hitters. The latter also selects too many nudgers and blockers, so when the best teams in the world go hard at the opposition throughout an innings, it’s hard to understand why Pakistan persist with a bygone strategy. Fakhar’s dismissal was just the latest example of the unwritten laws of cricket, which state that Team India — not the batsman — should receive the benefit of the doubt The PCB might respond by saying that these are among the best players available. However, what the PCB must ask itself is why it oversees a system that fails to produce batsmen of sufficient quality to perform consistently in international cricket. It must also ask itself why it fails to produce batsmen capable of executing the aggressive approach that today’s white ball cricket demands. And it must ask itself why Pakistan’s players are so inept at playing spin bowling. But on the bright side, the version of Pakistan that we saw in the Super 4 contest was to some degree a different and welcome one. The hitters attacked from the beginning; granted they were aided by a pitch that — although a little on the slow side — offered no help to bowlers. Fakhar Zaman set the example. He came not to play; he came to attack and seize the initiative.  Disappointingly, just as he was beginning to force the issue, he was wrongly dismissed by the third umpire, who somehow believed that a ball bouncing on the grass before nestling in the wicketkeeper’s gloves was out. It was just the latest example of the unwritten laws of cricket, which state that Team India — not the batsman — should receive the benefit of the doubt. Fakhar’s gusto was enough to light the fire in Sahibzada Farhan. Pakistan had made a wise decision in dropping Saim Ayub to number three, and Farhan laid a solid foundation for Pakistan’s innings. Farhan continued his domination of the world’s premiere fast bowler following a historic six last week. This was something of a second humbling for Jasprit Bumrah, who other than his precision yorker, wasn’t quite sure how to respond. When Saim joined Farhan, Pakistan’s pinch-hitter-turned-indispensable-bowler played a steady hand. Between them they took Pakistan to the dizzy heights of 93 from the first 10 overs. Unfortunately, the innings unravelled after the traditional break in play. Pakistan lost momentum, firstly through Saim rediscovering his trademark no-look flick off the hips, which led to his dismissal. It is probably a shot that Saim needs to put away for a while. Next, India’s spinners and back up bowlers becalmed Pakistan for no other reason than a lack of ambition from the Pakistani ‘nudgers and blockers’. Part of the problem was that the Pakistan thinktank has become obsessed with the strategy of maintaining a left-and-right-hand combination. This led to Mohammad Nawaz, in particular, getting a promotion up the order, which backfired. It was in those seven overs after the halfway mark that Pakistan shot themselves in the foot. Farhan became frustrated, fatigued, and partly succumbed to his hand injury. Salman Ali Agha, the captain, alongside Nawaz, wrongly chose to stabilise the innings. Stability is one thing, but failing to score a boundary in 40 balls is a crime against cricketing logic. The sad truth for Pakistan is that, however noble he is as a cricketer, Salman is not fit for the T-20 team. Equally, it’s unclear how often Nawaz must demonstrate his unsuitability for international cricket. These mistakes must be corrected when the next T-20 squad is picked. Still, Pakistan recovered to a par score of 171. This was largely thanks to the witless approach of Nawaz, who was run out dawdling back to the crease in a homage to the great Inzamam-ul-Haq. Pakistan were fortunate that Faheem Ashraf, who came in next, was in the mood to smite 20 runs off eight deliveries. Faheem’s success was in his willingness to take the attack to the Indian bowling, something that Salman and Nawaz were incapable of doing. Through this mixture of calculated and fearless aggression — as demonstrated by Fakhar, Farhan, and Faheem — and dozy cricket — best exemplified by Salman and Nawaz — Pakistan reached a respectable total. However, it was 20 runs short of where it should have been given Pakistan’s start and given the opposition. It didn’t make any sense that the hitting power of Mohammad Harris and Shaheen Shah Afridi was left sitting in the pavilion as the nudgers and blockers invited India back into the game. Let’s not forget that India gave Pakistan an unexpected helping hand by shelling four catches. This may be a Pakistan side in transition, but the reality is that the problems in the batting order and tactics have made Pakistan a second rank side. The bowling needs work too but it’s hard to evaluate properly because of the chronic failure of these hitters and the permanent indulgence of nudgers and blockers. Pakistan can still qualify for the final, but it would be a major surprise, and, at the moment, fully undeserved. Published in Dawn, September 22nd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "MANILA: Thousands of Filipinos marched in Manila on Sunday to vent their anger over a ballooning scandal involving bogus flood-control projects believed to have cost taxpayers billions of dollars. But a day of largely peaceful mass protests erupted into violence as riot police deployed water cannon in clashes with scores of mostly young masked people who hurled rocks and shattered the glass of one police outpost. Police arrested 72 people — including 20 minors — in two separate incidents that saw at least 39 officers injured and a trailer that was being used as a barricade set ablaze, according to a spokeswoman. Major Hazel Asilo told AFP it was unclear if those arrested were “protesters or just people who are causing trouble”. Trailer set on fire; 72 arrested, 39 injured in violent clashes Rage over the so-called ghost infrastructure projects has been mounting in the Southeast Asian country since President Ferdinand Marcos put them centre stage in a July state of the nation address that followed weeks of deadly flooding. Marcos said early last week he did not blame people for protesting “one bit”. Sunday in the capital began without violence with a morning demonstration at a park that drew nearly 50,000 people, according to city estimates. Thousands more joined an afternoon rally at the capital’s EDSA thoroughfare, ground zero for the 1986 movement that ousted Marcos’s dictator father. ‘This is enough’ “It’s very rare for me to go to rallies, but this situation was bad enough that I was really urged to say ‘this is enough’,” Mitzi Bajet, a 30-year-old designer said at the EDSA protest. Teddy Casino, 56, chairman of left-wing alliance Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, said his group was demanding not only the return of stolen funds, but also prison time for those involved. “Corruption requires people to go to the streets and express their outrage in the hope of pressuring government to actually do their jobs,” he said. Billions lost The Department of Finance has estimated the Philippine economy lost up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2 billion) from 2023 to 2025 due to corruption in flood control projects. Greenpeace has suggested the nu­m­ber is actually closer to $18 billion. Earlier this month, the owners of a construction firm accused nearly 30 House members and Department of Public Works and Highways officials of taking cash payments. The scandal has already sparked leadership changes in both houses of Congress, with House speaker Martin Romualdez, a cousin of Marcos, tendering his resignation earlier this week. On Sunday, multiple politicians were among those taking part in the EDSA protest, an event supported by the powerful Catholic Church that drew numerous families.

      "summary_orig": "JERUSALEM: Israeli forces blew up more residential buildings in Gaza City , killing at least 37 Palestinians, including a pregnant woman, her two children and a visually impaired man, as tanks pushed further into the densely populated city on Sunday. “The mother, the boy, the girl, and the baby in her womb — we found them all gone,” said Mosallam Al-Hadad, the dead woman’s father-in-law, saying his son had been seriously injured in the strike. “(He) was in a critical condition. We took him to the hospital, and his leg was amputated,” Hadad said. Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 65,283 people and wounded 166,575 since October 2023. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble. The strikes on besieged Palestinian territory also caused famine and displaced the territory’s population — in many cases multiple times. On Sunday, a number of Pales­tinians were attacked by Israeli settlers in a village south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, according to Al Jazeera Arabic , quoting local sources. The assault took place in the area of Khirbet Haribat al-Nabi in Masafer Yatta, a collection of Pale­stinian villages that have repeatedly been subjected to settler violence. Senior doctor rejects Israeli military’s claim about Hamas sniper, saying his brother was visually impaired Just a day ago, nearly 90 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes across the territory, most of them in Gaza City. Hamas sniper? The Israeli military claimed on Sunday it had killed a Hamas sniper in a strike the day before, but a senior Gaza doctor who is the man’s brother rejected the claim as “a lie and slander”, saying his sibling was visually impaired. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital, had been working in the emergency department on Saturday when his brother and sister-in-law’s bodies were brought in, telling AFP at the time that they were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza City. He rejected the Israeli military’s accusation about Hamas sniper as “a lie, slander and an unacceptable justification for targeting civilians with direct missile strikes”. “My brother is a 57-year-old man who suffers from several illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and he has severe vision impairment — and they claim he was a sniper? This is pure fabrication,” he told AFP , noting his brother’s family had been displaced several times over the past two years. In recent weeks, the Israeli military has launched a heavy air and ground assault on Gaza City, claiming that it was an effort aimed at eliminating Hamas from the territory’s largest urban hub. On Sunday, witnesses said Israeli tanks were advancing towards the west through Tel Al-Hawa, a southeastern suburb. The Israeli military estimates that over 450,000 people have left the city since the start of September. Hamas authorities dispute this, saying under 300,000 left and that nearly a million people remain des­pite ongoing shelling. The offensive has also alarmed many Israelis, as thousands rallied on Saturday night outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem, calling on him to end the war.

      "summary_orig": "Most of us Pakistan fans may not admit it, but we hope. We hope against hope when our team takes on India. Before the first ball is bowled, we tend to somehow forgo a few harsh realities and the reality that underlines all of them; India are way better. “ Farq hai yaar (there’s a difference),” as my colleague put it right after Tilak Varma clattered Shaheen Afridi past deep square-leg for a four to wrap things up. “It’s a gulf in fact, a huge gulf of quality,” he concluded. His short analysis summed up Sunday’s Super Four fixture, which India comfortably won by six wickets with seven balls to spare. Pakistan genuinely came back stronger, impressing with the bat early on, but the “gulf” glared the brightest when Indian openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill were at the crease. Indispensable Abhishek, Gill With their opening partnership of 105 off 59, Gill and Abhishek — the two friends from the Indian Punjab — set the match aside for India, neutralising Faheem Ashraf and Haris Rauf’s decent show with the ball that came later on. India’s Abhishek Sharma plays a shot during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai on September 21, 2025. — AFP The openers’ ability to play the field made Pakistan’s bowlers look ordinary in the first half of India’s chase as they once again put on display their wide range of shots. When Pakistan bowled even slightly short, Abhishek and Gill jumped back into their respective creases and bashed away through the leg-side and square through the off-side. When the Pakistan bowlers pushed it fuller, the duo would use their powerful wrists to clear the boundary. It wasn’t all about power for Gill and Abhishek; they had enough presence of mind to find gaps with pure timing and placement. Applying that kind of world-class skill, they combined to hit 14 fours and five sixes — all of the maximums hit by Abhishek. Spinners fold under pressure While the pitch didn’t offer much to the fast bowlers with the new ball, it had enough for the spinners in it, and taking nothing away from Gill and Abhishek, Pakistan spinners Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed were poor. They were clueless against the Indian openers, failing to find the right lines and lengths on a consistent basis, bowling too short or too full and lacking in pace variation good enough to pose any threat to the batters. Abrar.  who came into the match with an economy rate of less than four in the Asia Cup, gave away 10.50 an over on Sunday – a total of 42 runs in his four overs. Saim — more of a part-timer — on the other hand, had the opportunity to add to his better show with the bat earlier, but leaked a mammoth 35 in these three overs. By the time Abrar and Saim were pulled out of the attack, India had completed more than half of the job. Middle-order blunders Despite getting more than a decent start as Pakistan cruised at 91-1 — thanks to Sahibzada Farhan’s fifty and impressive contributions by Fakhar Zaman and Saim — Pakistan struggled massively to continue the momentum from early on. Why though? A middle-order incapable of attacking stroke play. The national side before this match had gone with Hasan Nawaz as their only middle-order pinch hitter — yes, his form, like all his colleagues, wasn’t the best — but replacing him with Hussain Talat, a totally different breed of a batter — was a highly questionable move from the Pakistan team management. The left-hander returned a paltry 10 off 11, and the decision to send Mohammad Nawaz and himself over the likes of Mohammad Haris and Faheem — who have much more of the ability to go big — was criminal by Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha in a period when Indian medium-pacer Shivam Dube flourished. Nawaz, who seemed completely at sea in front of the Indian spinners, was stuck in his crease, absolutely failing to use his feet, and added 21 off 19. Salman, meanwhile, avoiding strike in the last over, proving critics right over his place in the Pakistan T20 side, scored 17 off 13. Confident top-three Pakistan’s start was refreshing. The side’s openers came into the match with a bad-boy attitude, a kind of naughtiness in their demeanour and smartness to back it up with. Sahibzada and Fakhar were getting under the skins of Indian stalwarts Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya — at times exchanging words with them on the pitch. Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman (L) and Sahibzada Farhan run between the wickets as India’s Jasprit Bumrah (C) watches during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai on September 21, 2025. — AFP After being dropped by Abhishek at third-man off Pandya, Sahibzada responded with bravery, seeing off Bumrah’s pinpoint Yorkers with equal amounts of precision and forcing the bowler to miss out on the right lengths as the right-hander from Peshawar posted a 38-ball 50. His hits were clean and oozed with confidence as Fakhar also manipulated the Indian bowlers’ minds on the other end. Had it not been for a clearly wrong decision that went against his way, the seasoned southpaw may have made it slightly more difficult for India to continue their dominance over Pakistan. Saim, who had started the Asia Cup with three ducks, meanwhile, improved from his past performances to hit 21 off 17 — that straight hit for six off Kuldeep Yadav — underlining his potential. But the left-hander’s contribution came only after he was dropped by Kuldeep when he had only single figures against his name. Haris, Faheem impress with the ball India’s Sanju Samson is clean bowled by Pakistan’s Haris Rauf during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai on September 21, 2025. — AFP Apart from the openers, only Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf came up with a fight. Haris, in fact, was continually in the face of the Indian batters despite his team being on the back foot in the context of the match. He backed his aggression up with fiery pace bowling as well, destroying the stumps of Sanju Samson and getting the Indian skipper out for his two wickets and gave away a mere 26 runs in his four overs. Faheem, meanwhile, gave away 31, but still caused problems for the Indian batters — although that came about too late for Pakistan — especially producing a peach of a delivery to clean up Gill through the gate. More of that, and at the right time, is required if Pakistan are to make it to the finals. And against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, Salman and co have to prove that they are at least capable of beating decent sides in the world if not the best like that of India. Header image:",

Asked whether he would help defend the EU members if Russia intensifies hostilities, Trump told reporters: “Yeah, I would. I would.” Estonia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday following Friday’s incursion. Three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland, triggering complaints of a dangerous new provocation from the European Union and Nato, but a denial from Moscow. Italian F-35 fighters attached to Nato’s air defence support mission in the Baltic states, along with Swedish and Finnish aircraft, were scrambled to intercept the Russian jets and warn them off. Asked whether he had been briefed on the situation in Estonia, Trump answered in the affirmative and added: “We don’t like it.” His statement came about two weeks after some 17 Russian drones violated Polish airspace, in an incident that Trump then sought to downplay. “It could have been a mistake,” Trump told journalists on September 11.",

      "summary_orig": "Britain, Australia and Canada on Sunday recognised a Palestinian state in a seismic shift in decades of Western foreign policy, triggering swift Israeli anger. Portugal was also to recognise Palestinian statehood later on Sunday, as Israel came under huge international pressure over the conflict in Gaza triggered almost two years ago by the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack . “Today, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognises the State of Palestine,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a message on X. Britain and Canada became the first G7 countries to take the step, with France and other nations expected to follow at the annual UN General Assembly, which opens Monday in New York. “Canada recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote on X. Meanwhile, Australia announced it “formally recognises the independent and sovereign State of Palestine”, according to a post on X by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. “In doing so, Australia recognises the legitimate and long-held aspirations of the people of Palestine to a state of their own,” Albanese said in a statement as his country joined other major Western nations in increasing pressure on Israel to end the conflict in Gaza. “Today’s act of recognition reflects Australia’s longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, which has always been the only path to enduring peace and security for the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples.” It is a watershed moment for Palestinians and their decades-long ambitions for statehood, with the most powerful Western nations having long argued it should only come as part of a negotiated peace deal with Israel. Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said that Britain, Canada and Australia’s recognition of a Palestinian state was a necessary step toward lasting peace in the region. Welcoming the move by the three countries, Abbas said, “It constitutes an important and necessary step toward achieving a just and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” according to a statement by his office. Abbas also called for a ceasefire in Gaza. “He emphasised that today’s priorities are achieving a ceasefire, allowing humanitarian aid to enter, securing the release of all hostages and prisoners, ensuring Israel’s complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, enabling the State of Palestine to assume full responsibilities, advancing recovery and reconstruction and halting settlement activity and settler violence, “the statement added. A senior Hamas official hailed the three nations’ recognition of a Palestinian state, describing it as a victory for the rights of Palestinians. “These developments represent a victory for Palestinian rights and the justice of our cause, and send a clear message: no matter how far the occupation goes in its crimes, it will never be able to erase our national rights,” Mahmud Mardawi told AFP . But the move puts those countries at odds with the United States and Israel, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacting angrily and vowing to oppose it at the UN talks. Calls for a Palestinian state “would endanger our existence and serve as [an] absurd reward for terrorism,” Netanyahu said on Sunday. A growing number of longtime allies have shifted positions , as Israel has intensified its Gaza offensive, vowing to eliminate Hamas. The Gaza Strip has suffered vast destruction, a spiralling death toll and a lack of food that has sparked a major humanitarian crisis since the start of the conflict, which has drawn an international outcry. ‘Special burden’ The UK government has come under increasing public pressure to act, with thousands rallying every month on the streets. A poll released by YouGov on Friday showed two-thirds of young Britons aged 18-25 supported Palestinian statehood. Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy acknowledged at the UN in July that “Britain bears a special burden of responsibility to support the two-state solution”. Over a century ago, the UK was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the state of Israel through the 1917 Balfour Declaration. Three-quarters of UN members already recognise Palestinian statehood, with over 140 of the 193 having taken the step. Starmer said in July that his Labour government intended to recognise a Palestinian State unless Israel took “substantive” steps, including reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, getting more aid into the territory and confirming it would not annex the West Bank. Starmer has also repeatedly called on Hamas to release the remaining hostages they captured in the 2023 attack, and is expected to set out new sanctions on the Palestinian group. Lammy told the BBC on Sunday that the Palestinian Authority — the civilian body that governs in areas of the West Bank — had been calling for the move for some time, “and I think a lot of that is wrapped up in hope”. “Will this feed children? No, it won’t, that’s down to humanitarian aid. Will this free hostages? That must be down to a ceasefire.” But he said it was an attempt to “hold out for” a two-state solution. Palestinian foreign minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin told AFP last week: “Recognition is not symbolic. It sends a very clear message to the Israelis on their illusions on continuing their occupation forever,” she said. ‘Worrying evolution’ Hamas’s 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.\nIsrael’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 65,208 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. Portugal said that it would also formally declare its recognition in New York on Sunday. “By acting now, as the Portuguese government has decided, we’re keeping alive the possibility of having two states,” Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said.",

      "summary_orig": "Seven terrorists were killed, including three “Afghan nationals”, by security forces during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, the military’s media wing said on Friday. In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the operation was carried out in the Kulachi area upon the presence of “ khawarij ”. The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and [as a result], seven Indian sponsored khwarij , including three Afghan National khwarij and two suicide bombers, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said. The statement added that Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government, run by the Afghan Taliban, to uphold its responsibilities and deny the use of its soil to carry out acts of terror. Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have soured over the use of the latter’s territory to stage attacks. Earlier this week, Pakistan warned the UN Security Council that terrorist groups operating from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan pose the gravest threat to its national security. Kabul denies the allegations. “[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded. Earlier this week, security forces killed 31 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, the military’s media wing said on Monday. “On 13-14 September, 31 khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in [the] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a press release. Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022 , the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.",

      "title_orig": "Afghan govt spokesperson says leaders shouldn’t make ‘provocative’ statements, stresses need for talks",
      "summary_orig": "The spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan Zabiullah Mujahid has said that leaders should refrain from making “provocative” statements and that his country could not be held responsible for attacks taking place in Pakistan. Mujahid’s remarks come as Pakistan continues to raise alarm over terrorist outfits, particularly the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), using Afghan soil to carry out attacks across the border. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to choose between maintaining ties with its neighbour or harbouring terrorists , but Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations. He made these remarks during an interview with Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies. According to Gul, the interview — conducted in the Pushto language — was recorded during his recent visit to Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. During the interview, Gul sought proposals from Mujahid to address recurring problems, such as the issue of TTP or “the negative propaganda in the media that harms and poisons the relations” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The spokesperson was also asked whether he felt the need for some sort of “joint mechanism” on such matters. In his response, Mujahid emphasised that leaders should avoid making “provocative” statements. If statements having “threatening” undertones were issued, “we cannot stop” others, he asserted. The Taliban government spokesperson went on to say that “giving statements to the media, spoiling the environment and taking military action is unwise”. Instead, he stressed that talks should be held. “There should be more visits, which would create trust on both sides,” Mujahid added. He said his government was “unhappy with the current environment and propaganda that was happening presently” as it was not in the interest of either Pakistan or Afghanistan. Mujahid also highlighted that attacks by militants and terrorists in Pakistan were not a recent occurrence. “It has been happening since 2003.” “Then Pakistan should take steps to foil such attacks”, he said. “Islamabad should also share information with Kabul so that we can make efforts to counter these threats as well.” But, at the same time, Mujahid added that Afghanistan could not be held responsible for bomb blasts in Bannu or any other area of Pakistan. “Pakistan should ensure its own security,” he asserted, further recommending that Islamabad and Kabul should engage in talks to discuss the reasons behind the issue of terrorism. “You should take us into confidence if you believe that you face threats from [an entity] in Afghanistan.” Mujahid’s remarks follow a recent statement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in which he issued a stern message to Kabul, saying that Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the TTP. The premier’s statement had come after he attended the funeral of 12 soldiers in Bannu, who were martyred during an exchange of fire with terrorists in  South Waziristan. The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks. Gul also raised this issue during his conversation with Mujahid with respect to the strained ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan. “Pakistan seems to have drawn a red line as far as the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan is concerned,” Gul said, adding that this was seen as the main reason for growing tensions between the two countries. Gul asked Mujahid whether he agreed with this. Mujahid, however, clearly stated that the TTP was Pakistan’s “internal issue”. “Pakistan should find a solution to this problem,” he said, adding that Islamabad should not spoil its ties with Kabul over this matter. He also assured that Afghanistan was making efforts to make sure that “no one uses its soil against any other country”. “No armed person can go to Pakistan from Afghanistan […] The terrain in some areas is difficult, and some people may be able to take advantage of it. “We should find a solution to this problem through negotiations and Afghanistan should not be blamed for it […] We do not want fighting, bloodshed and difficulties in Pakistan.” Earlier in the interview, when asked what messages he and the Islamic Emirate had for those in Pakistan, he said he wanted to convey to leaders and officials that “Afghanistan wanted brotherly ties and that any issues between the two countries should be resolved through negotiations”. “Levelling allegations and making threats spoil the environment, which further complicates matters,” he said.  The spokesperson also called for reforms in policy and urged religious scholars in Pakistan to play a role in maintaining good ties between the two countries. Lastly, he said, he had a message for the people of Pakistan. “My final message is for the people of Pakistan. Afghans do not want lawlessness in Pakistan. Afghanistan does not want difficulties in Pakistan […] Afghanistan wants normalisation of ties with Pakistan.”",

      "summary_orig": "An Afghan Taliban government official said on Sunday that a deal over Bagram air base was “not possible”, after US President Donald Trump said he wanted the former US base back. Trump threatened the country on Saturday with unspecified punishment, just days after he raised the idea of the United States retaking control of the base while on a state visit to the United Kingdom. “If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!” the 79-year-old leader wrote on his Truth Social platform. Trump, who has previously said he wants the United States to acquire territories and sites ranging from the Panama Canal to Greenland , has appeared focused on Bagram for years. Asked on Saturday whether he would send in US troops to retake the base, Trump declined to give a direct answer, saying: “We won’t talk about that.” “We’re talking now to Afghanistan and we want it back and we want it back soon, right away. And if they don’t do it — if they don’t do it, you’re going to find out what I’m gonna do,” he told reporters at the White House. On Sunday, Fasihuddin Fitrat, chief of staff of the Ministry of Defence, said “some people” want to take back the base through a “political deal”. “Recently, some people have said that they have entered negotiations with Afghanistan for taking back Bagram air base,” he said in comments broadcast by local media. “A deal over even an inch of Afghanistan’s soil is not possible. We don’t need it.” Separately, the Afghan Taliban also issued an statement, saying: “In accordance with Islamic principles and grounded in its balanced, economy-oriented foreign policy, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan seeks constructive relations with all states on the basis of mutual and shared interests.” The statement said it had been “consistently communicated to the United States in all bilateral negotiations that, for the Islamic Emirate, Afghanistan’s independence and territorial integrity are of the utmost importance”. It added: “ It should be recalled that, under the Doha Agreement, the United States pledged that ‘it will not use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs.’ Therefore, it is necessary that they remain faithful to their commitments. “Accordingly, it is once again underscored that, rather than repeating past failed approaches, a policy of realism and rationality should be adopted.\nIslamic Emirate of Afghanistan.” ‘Re-occupying Bagram might end up looking like re-invasion’ Bagram, the largest air base in Afghanistan, was a linchpin of the US-led war effort against the Taliban, whose government Washington toppled following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. US and Nato troops chaotically pulled out of Bagram in July 2021 as part of a Trump-brokered deal with the Taliban. The loss of crucial air power saw the Afghan military collapse just weeks later and the Taliban sweep back to power . Current and former US officials privately caution that re-occupying Bagram air base in Afghanistan might end up looking like a re-invasion of the country, requiring more than 10,000 troops as well as deployment of advanced air defences. Experts say the sprawling air base would be difficult to secure initially and would require massive manpower to operate and protect. Even if the Taliban accepted the US re-occupation of Bagram following negotiations, it would need to be defended from a host of threats including the terrorist Islamic State and Al Qaeda militants inside Afghanistan. It could also be vulnerable to an advanced missile threat from Iran, which attacked a major US air base in Qatar in June after the United States struck Iranian nuclear sites .",

Disruption had eased significantly by early Sunday despite some continuing delays, airport officials and data showed, while regional regulators said they were investigating the origin of the hacking incident. The disruption is the latest in a string of hacks to hit sectors from healthcare to autos.

Berlin Brandenburg Airport said on Sunday that problems persisted, but that it was working with the company to resolve the issue. A manual workaround is in place, and there are currently no major delays or cancellations, it added. Brussels Airport said in an update to passengers on Sunday that the cyberattack was having a “large impact on the flight schedule”, causing delays and cancellations of flights. Heathrow said early on Sunday work was continuing to recover from the check-in system outage. It added that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”. An analysis by aviation data provider Cirium said delays at Heathrow were “low”, Berlin had “moderate” delays, while Brussels had “significant” delays, but that they were decreasing.",

The hacking incident hit check-in and boarding systems provider Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX, disrupting operations on Saturday at London’s Heathrow, Berlin Airport and in Brussels, where passengers faced long queues, dozens of cancellations and delays. Disruption had eased significantly by early Sunday despite some continuing delays, airport officials and data showed, while regional regulators said they were investigating the origin of the hacking incident. The disruption is the latest in a string of hacks to hit sectors from healthcare to autos. A breach at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover halted production, while another caused Marks & Spencer losses in the hundreds of millions of pounds. RTX called the incident a “cyber-related disruption” and said it had impacted its MUSE software, which is used by several airlines. RTX was not immediately available for comment on Sunday. Berlin Brandenburg Airport said on Sunday that problems persisted, but that it was working with the company to resolve the issue. A manual workaround is in place, and there are currently no major delays or cancellations, it added. Brussels Airport said in an update to passengers on Sunday that the cyberattack was having a “large impact on the flight schedule”, causing delays and cancellations of flights. Heathrow said early on Sunday work was continuing to recover from the check-in system outage. It added that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”. An analysis by aviation data provider Cirium said delays at Heathrow were “low”, Berlin had “moderate” delays, while Brussels had “significant” delays, but that they were decreasing.",
