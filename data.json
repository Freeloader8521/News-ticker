      "summary_orig": "I'm a PPL just starting the idea of obtaining my instrument ticket. I fly with a really good CFII from time to time to stay sharp and work on skills, especially if I feel I'm rusty, otherwise my missions tend to be in search of the perfect $100 hamburger or omelette with my girlfriend. Anyway, I live, and my PA-28 is based, just outside of Chicago. But I often travel (commercially) to Detroit for work. In speaking with my CFII, we thought it might be cool to do a day trip to Detroit Coleman Young Airport (DET), the closest to my office, as a practice IFR flight. Looking it over, there are some approaches that require flight across the border into Canada. So, the question is does this approach become an international flight? Will we need the radio license? Maybe a passport if we're diverted? Or is it just understood that since this approach, while technically over Canadian airspace, is a US flight into a US airport? Will we need to contact Canadian ATC? Sorry, that's more than one question. Any suggestions from pilots who've frequented Coleman Young would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

      "summary_orig": "Had a bit of a day the other day. I'm a low time PPL (~120 hours) and have been trying to get in Xcountry time anywhere I can before really diving into IFR training. Had a wedding to go to a few hours drive away and decided to make a xcountry out of it. However things started showing signs that flying instead of driving was a mistake in this case. Original plane booked with the club was unavailable at the last minute getting hung up in maintenance, no notice or anything, show up and the plane just isn't there (strike 1). Luckily there was another plane available - a Piper Warrior (though at a different airport) so swapped last minute and rushed over there. Preflight the plane, get it topped off with fuel and we're on our way. Run up was mostly fine, though the carb heat got stuck half way (strike 2). After fiddling for a few minutes in run up managed to muscle it back closed full. Take off was smooth and we get about 20min out and up to cruise so I lean things out and I notice the fuel pressure was creeping up (strike 3).... and didn't stop. So I tried a quick (undo what you just did) and enriched, but no effect. Tried cycling the electric fuel pump, no effect. Everything seemed to be running just fine, but this gauge is now at what I think is as high as it will read (See pic - https://imgur.com/a/3RS20TY ), so I have no idea how high it actually is reading. I decided to call it, turn around and land at the closest airport just a few NM behind me. After talking with the owner (nicest guy btw, he flew another plane up to this airport we were now semi-stranded at to give us the option to continue our trip, above and beyond honestly), it sounds like the issue I called the flight on was sort of hand waived as \"this plane just does that\". I can't think of any reason that should be allowed I keep thinking about what sort of issues it could cause and it sounds like worst worst case on the carbureted warrior if it were uncontrolled high fuel pressure it could overflow the carb possibly leading to fuel in the airbox (or dripping into the cowling) which is a recipe for a fire. On the other hand it could have just been a faulty gauge... Just wanted to see how others would have played it.

This content will be decided on a case by case basis. Content involving incidents like the one that was seen at Milan Bergamo Airport will always be marked as NSFW, and we will provide details in pinned comments and the flair to elaborate on how NSFW the content is, so that everyone can make their own choice on what they want to see.

      "summary_orig": "Hello users of r/UkrainianConflict , For the past three years, Ukrainian cities have endured relentless attacks from Russian missiles and Iranian-made Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. In 2025 alone, over 12,000 of these drones have struck Ukraine — targeting not military infrastructure, but homes, hospitals, and schools. Thousands of civilians have been killed. Hundreds of them were children. A number of subreddits, including this one, believe this campaign of terror must end. We're proud to join the Sky Sentinel fundraiser in collaboration with United24, the official fundraising platform of Ukraine. The goal: help fund Sky Sentinel, an Al-powered, Ukrainian-made turret system designed to autonomously detect and shoot down these deadly drones. Each turret costs $150,000. United24 supporters have already raised over $1 million, and now we're coming together to raise enough for one more turret - entirely through Reddit. If we should not reach the goal, the donations will still be used for Sky Sentinel. If we don't reach the goal, the donations will still go to United24's general Sky Sentinel Program. If we succeed: • We'll save civilian lives. • A community vote will name the turret. • We'll receive a photo of the deployed turret, showing our contribution in action. Every donation helps, no matter the amount.

      "summary_en": "Hello users of r/UkrainianConflict , For the past three years, Ukrainian cities have endured relentless attacks from Russian missiles and Iranian-made Shahed-136 kamikaze drones. In 2025 alone, over 12,000 of these drones have struck Ukraine — targeting not military infrastructure, but homes, hospitals, and schools. Thousands of civilians have been killed. Hundreds of them were children. A number of subreddits, including this one, believe this campaign of terror must end. We're proud to join the Sky Sentinel fundraiser in collaboration with United24, the official fundraising platform of Ukraine. The goal: help fund Sky Sentinel, an Al-powered, Ukrainian-made turret system designed to autonomously detect and shoot down these deadly drones. Each turret costs $150,000. United24 supporters have already raised over $1 million, and now we're coming together to raise enough for one more turret - entirely through Reddit. If we should not reach the goal, the donations will still be used for Sky Sentinel. If we don't reach the goal, the donations will still go to United24's general Sky Sentinel Program.
