The premier, visiting Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the crown prince, is leading a high-level Pakistani delegation during the trip. The delegation includes Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and PM’s aides Tariq Fatemi and Bilal Bin Saqib, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). A statement issued on X by state broadcaster PTV News said the meeting with the Saudi crown prince was held in a “cordial atmosphere”. “Matters of mutual interest were discussed in the meeting. The joint statement of the meeting regarding discussions on promoting trade, investment, and cooperation in various sectors between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will be issued shortly,” the statement said, adding that the meeting was attended by FM Dar, COAS Munir and senior cabinet members from both sides. PM Shehbaz earlier arrived at the King Khalid International Airport where he was received by Riyadh Deputy Governor Muhammad bin Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Malki and Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq. The prime minister left for Riyadh earlier today from Lahore. The invitation for the conference, signed by the crown prince, was given to PM Shehbaz in August by Ambassador of the King­dom of Saudi Arabia Naw­af bin Said Al-Malky. The FII9 will convene global leaders, investors, policymakers, and innovators to explore the theme, “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth”. Thematic discussions will address global challenges and opportunities, focusing on key topics such as innovation, sustainability, economic inclusion, and geopolitical shifts. The Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement yesterday that during his visit, the PM would engage with the Saudi leadership to explore avenues for enhanced cooperation in the trade, investment, energy, and human resource sectors. “The discussions will also cover regional and global issues of mutual interest and concern,” it added. On the sidelines of the summit, the PM will also interact with leaders from other participating countries and heads of international organisations. The FO said these exchanges would highlight Pakistan’s investment potential and its readiness to pursue collaborations in sustainable development, in line with the “Think, Exchange, and Act” model.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan’s build-up towards next year’s T20 World Cup will continue on Tuesday when they take on South Africa in the opener of the three-match series at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. The national side goes into the series after faring decently in their biggest test at the Asia Cup last month — beating all sides they came up against except world number one and archrivals India, who handed them defeats in all three encounters including the final. South Africa, in contrast, arrive as a depleted outfit on paper — the presence of star batter Quinton de Kock, featuring in a Twenty20 International for the first time since June 2024, standing out in a largely second-string squad led by Donovan Ferreira, who has just nine T20Is to his name. Hence, Pakistan can be safely called favourites to take the series trophy, which would help restore their damaged confidence following the triple-drubbing from India. The hosts too haven’t shied away from striking a balance between experimentation and experience. Former skipper Babar Azam has returned to the T20I ranks following a four-month absence, while Fakhar Zaman waits in the reserves. “He’s a world-class player,” Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said of Babar in the pre-series press conference on the eve of the match. “His presence always benefits the team. He’s played over a hundred T20s, led Pakistan many times, and scored heavily. His experience will strengthen our batting line-up.” Pacer Naseem Shah, who missed both the tri-nation series and the Asia Cup, is also set to make his comeback. Uncapped spinner Usman Tariq and exciting middle-order batter Abdul Samad have been drafted in as part of Pakistan’s search for depth and flexibility ahead of the global showpiece next year. Pakistan have also axed Mohammad Haris, despite the team management previously backing the wicket-keeper batter before he fell out of favour to make way for Usman Khan. The decision has raised concerns of inconsistent selection. “We were looking for a wicket-keeper-batter who can play in the middle order, especially against spin,” Salman said, defending Usman’s inclusion. “Even though his international record isn’t great yet, you must’ve seen in the PSL that he bats well against spin in middle overs. We needed that kind of player who can both keep wickets and handle spin in that phase.” Pakistan have undergone a T20I revamp since the appointment of Mike Hesson as the side’s white-ball head coach in June, with an increased emphasis on strike-rates under the New Zealander. Hard-hitting has been a central theme of their approach in the 21 matches under Hesson so far. But with the strategy largely failing to yield consistent results, there is a growing realisation that a more adaptable approach is needed. “Given the kind of conditions we’ve been playing in, we need batters who can build innings and rotate strike, and then accelerate when required,” Salman said. “Middle-overs batting against spin is another key area. We need to improve strike rotation there, and we’ve worked on that during our recent camp.” The pitch at Rawalpindi is expected to be a batting paradise, which could also allow South Africa to challenge Pakistan with big totals and put the hosts under pressure. For the visitors, too, the series offers an opportunity to fine-tune their combination ahead of the T20 World Cup. “It is important to build up toward the World Cup,” Ferreira said. “I think this is the big stepping stone for us toward the World Cup.” Ferreira was named skipper after veteran batter David Miller was ruled out due to injury. Gerald Coetzee and Kwena Maphaka have also missed out through fitness issues, while the Proteas have rested regular T20I captain Aiden Markram, batters Tristan Stubbs and Ryan Rickelton, and spearhead Kagiso Rabada. Squads: Pakistan: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abdul Samad, Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usman Khan (wk), Usman Tariq; Reserves: Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Sufiyan Moqim.

      "summary_orig": "The Sindh government and police on Monday announced the arrest of four suspects from a proscribed outfit in the murder case of journalist and anchorperson Imtiaz Mir. Mir, who was associated with Metro News television, was heading home in a car driven by his elder brother last month when six assailants riding two motorcycles fired a volley of bullets on his vehicle on the National Highway. The anchorperson sustained multiple bullet wounds and was taken to a private hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Journalists had strongly condemned the inaction by the police for failing to arrest the attackers and demanded their immediate arrest. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, many members of his cabinet and leaders of political parties had expressed their sorrow, with CM Shah directing the inspector general of police (IG) to immediately arrest the killers. Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, IG Ghulam Nabi Memon and Additional IG Javed Alam Odho held a press conference today on updates regarding the case. “Four people have been arrested in the murder of journalist Imtiaz Mir,” Lanjar said, adding that a joint operation was carried out by the Karachi police and a federal intelligence agency. “The culprits belong to a banned organisation that used to take instructions from abroad,” he added. Lanjar termed it a breakthrough in the murder case, adding that the bike used in the attack was also recovered. The home minister said that Mir had given an interview in which he talked in “favour of Israel”, adding that it appeared to be “an exact motive” of the murder. He said a sub-organisation of the proscribed Zainabiyoun Brigade was involved in the case. Lanjar added that the primary suspect lived in a neighboring country, without specifying who he was referring to. The home minister alleged that the neighboring country was “providing funding and spreading chaos” in Pakistan. Mir’s brother Riaz Ali had registered a case under Sections 34 (common intention) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Saudabad police station, nominating a man and his sons for the attack. The complainant said that the attack was carried out at the behest of Umer Daraz and his two sons — Ahmed Bux and Aftab — with whom they had a land dispute in their native town in Jacobabad. Saudabad Station House Officer Ateequr Rehman had told Dawn that both parties belonged to the same tribe. He recalled that the late anchorperson had also lodged an FIR against the same suspects at the Shah Latif Town police in 2023. According to a report published last month by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.",

      "title_orig": "DNA from mass grave reveals pathogens that beset Napoleon’s army in 1812",
      "summary_orig": "The retreat from Russia by Napoleon Bonaparte and the French Grande Armée in 1812 was a cataclysmic event that marked the beginning of the end for his empire and personal dominance in Europe, with about 300,000 soldiers perishing in a force that originally numbered roughly half a million. A new study involving DNA extracted from the teeth of 13 French soldiers who were buried in a mass grave in Lithuania’s capital Vilnius along the route of the retreat is offering a deeper understanding of the misery the Grande Armée experienced, detecting two pathogens not previously documented in this event. The discovery of the bacteria that cause paratyphoid fever and louse-borne relapsing fever showed, alongside previous work, that several infections had circulated among soldiers already enfeebled by cold, hunger and exhaustion. The Vilnius site, discovered in 2001, contains the remains of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers from Napoleon’s army. “Vilnius was a key waypoint on the 1812 retreat route. Many soldiers arrived exhausted, starving and ill. A substantial number died there and were interred rapidly in mass graves,” said molecular biologist and geneticist Nicolás Rascovan, head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and senior author of the study published in the journal Current Biology. “While cold, starvation and typhus have long been emphasised, our results show that paratyphoid fever and louse-borne relapsing fever were also present and may have contributed to debilitation and mortality,” Rascovan added. Paratyphoid fever typically is food- or water-borne, with symptoms including fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation, weakness and sometimes a rash. The form of relapsing fever detected is transmitted by body lice and causes episodes of recurring high fever, with headache, muscle pain and weakness. In the study, four of the 13 soldiers tested positive for the paratyphoid fever bacterium and two for the relapsing fever bacterium. The symptoms of the two ailments match those described in historical accounts of the retreat. A 2006 study involving DNA from 35 other soldiers from the same cemetery detected the pathogens behind typhus and trench fever, diseases that cause symptoms similar to those of paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever. The new study did not detect typhus and trench fever. Napoleon led the Grande Armée on an invasion of Russia in 1812 and marched into Moscow, but the campaign unravelled and he was forced to retreat thanks to factors including dwindling supplies, counter-attacks and the onset of the brutal Russian winter. The new findings add nuance to the story of the plight of the French emperor’s soldiers, pointing to a scenario not of a single or a couple of ailments in circulation but rather a high prevalence of various infectious diseases. The study does not quantify the overall impact of the newly identified pathogens or establish them as widespread across the entire army, but it helps explain the medical complexity of the retreat. “Ancient DNA lets us put names to infections that symptom-based accounts alone cannot resolve. The co-occurrence of pathogens with different transmission routes underscores how dire sanitary conditions were,” Rascovan said. “Future work across more sites and individuals will refine the disease landscape of 1812.” The study illustrates how the steadily improving science of ancient DNA analysis can provide new insight into historical events. “Ancient DNA allows us to test historical hypotheses directly, adding evidence that can confirm or complicate narratives built from chronicles and symptoms,” Rascovan said. “With careful authentication, genomics reveals which pathogens were present, how they evolved and persisted, and how they spread — helping historians and scientists reconstruct complex crises with greater resolution.” Header image: People sit in front of the 1802 painting “Le Premier Consul franchissant le Grand-Saint-Bernard” by French artist Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) as they visit the exhibition “Napoleon and Europe” at the Musee de l’Armee (Army Museum) at the Invalides in Paris, France, March 26, 2013. — Reuters/File",

Melissa is forecast to take a turn to the north-east towards Jamaica on Monday afternoon, making landfall on Tuesday by about midday, maintaining it’s current strength, which would make it the strongest of only five hurricanes ever recorded to hit Jamaica directly.

      "summary_orig": "Posts from multiple pro-Indian and pro-Afghan users on social media platform X on Monday shared a video, claiming to show recent cross-border shelling between Pakistan and India in Leepa Valley at the Line of Control (LoC). However, the video is old and was previously shared in May 2025 during the Pakistan–India standoff. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. Pakistan later launched the retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a United States-led push helped broker a ceasefire. On Monday night, Indian forces apparently violated the cea­sefire in the Leepa Sector of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. While there was no official word on losses, locals reported an intense exchange of fire on Sunday evening. Today, an Indian propaganda account shared a video on X with the following caption: “At least seven Pakistani soldiers killed in overnight clashes in Leepa Valley (PoK) after Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked firing at Indian posts in Tangdhar sector. Indian Army retaliated with 15× intensity, destroying two enemy posts and a supply vehicle. (Sources).” The post gained over 97,000 views. Another Indian propaganda account shared the same video with the following caption: “Pakistani accounts have accidentally exposed their own embarrassment sharing videos showing the Indian Army pounding Pak Army posts in Leepa Valley (PoK) after Pakistan violated the ceasefire near Tangdhar. Artillery fire. Precision strikes.” The post garnered over 20,000 views. Journalist Sumair Jamil also shared the video with the following caption: “Pak India LoC firing update. Indian army intermittently firing in the Leepa Valley sector of Azad Kashmir. Pakistan army is responding with full force.” His post received 1,000 views. The video was also shared by a pro-military account with the following caption: “Five Indian posts that were firing on the Leepa Valley sector in Kashmir have been blown away. The enemy has raised white flags. Our losses are zero, the enemy will report its own losses. Silence has also prevailed in the Tatta Pani and Haji Pir sectors .” Several other pro-Indian and pro-Afghan accounts reshared the same footage as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here , gaining over 19,000 views collectively. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and to dispel any confusion about the incident, about which very few details have been released so far. A keyword search to corroborate whether the footage was from the fresh hostilities did not yield any video report featuring the same footage from Pakistani or Indian media outlets. A reverse image search of the video’s keyframes showed that the same clip was shared previously on May 9, 2025, by multiple users. No older shares of the video were found from before the May conflict. Those sharing the video at the time, including Geo News correspondent Murtaza Ali Shah , also said that it was from live firing between Pakistan and India. While the exact location of the older video along the LoC could not be conclusively determined due to a lack of details, it is clear that it is not from the current outbreak of shelling in Leepa Valley. On May 9, 2025, heavy fighting erupted along the Pakistan-India border and LoC, with both sides accusing each other of major ceasefire violations. Pakistani media reported civilian casualties in Hajira and Neelum Valley, while India claimed to have intercepted multiple drone incursions from across the border. Shelling had forced residents to flee border villages, and emergency shelters were opened amid fears of further escalation. International observers warned that the clashes marked the most serious escalation in years between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows cross-border shelling from a recent flare-up in violence between India and Pakistan in the Leepa Valley is false . The footage is old and was shared previously in the May 2025 conflict between the two countries. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

Israel claimed it struck a member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group on Saturday, accusing the individual of planning to attack Israeli troops. However, Islamic Jihad denied it was planning an attack. Speaking aboard US President Donald Trump’s plane during a trip to Asia, Rubio said: “We don’t view that as a violation of the ceasefire.” The US top diplomat added that Israel has not surrendered its right to self-defence as part of the agreement brokered by Washington, Egypt and Qatar that saw Hamas release the remaining living hostages held in Gaza this month. “They have the right if there’s an imminent threat to Israel, and all the mediators agree with that,” Rubio insisted. Rubio said the ceasefire in Gaza, which remains in force between Israel and Hamas just over two years since the conflict began, was based on obligations on both sides, reiterating that Hamas needs to speed up the return of the remains of hostages who died in captivity. Israel’s Saturday strike came shortly after Rubio departed Israel after a visit aimed at shoring up the ceasefire.",

      "summary_orig": "Eight people, including seven Levies Force personnel, were injured in a bomb blast targeting the convoy of Kech Deputy Commissioner (DC) Major (retd) Bashir Barech in Balochistan’s Turbat on Monday, according to police. Kech Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Captain (retd) Zohaib Mohsin told Dawn.com that a remote-controlled bomb was used in the attack that took place at Press Club road. “The bomb, which was planted in a motorcycle, was triggered using a remote control when the DC’s convoy was passing by the area,” he said, adding that five Levies personnel and a passerby were injured in the incident. He later told Dawn.com that the number of the injured had increased to eight, including seven Levies personnel. The Kech DC remained safe as he was in a bulletproof vehicle, he added. He was travelling from his home to office and his car was only partially damaged in the incident, the SSP said. “The blast was so intense that four of the vehicles parked nearby and closely located buildings were also damaged,” SSP Mohsin added. Police and Frontier Corps personnel had reached the site of the incident and were further investigating the matter, he said. Pakistan has witnessed an increase in terrorist attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The increase followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s move to end a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. On Saturday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while addressing the Balochistan Workshop in Islamabad, regretted the resurgence of terrorism in Balochistan and other regions, calling for a serious look at “the reasons that led to the unrest”. One of the recent incidents of terrorism in the province took place on October 9, when a bomb exploded on a railway track near Dera Murad Jamali. The track connects Balochistan to the rest of the country. A railway employee was killed in the incident while train services were suspended following the fourth incident of such nature in a month. This incident followed a blast in the provincial capital of Quetta on September 30. At least 10 people were martyred and 32 injured in the incident when a bomb blast had ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s FC headquarters. A week prior to that, women and chil­dren were among 12 people injured wh­en the Quetta-bound Jaf­far Express was targeted in a bomb blast in the Spizend area of Balochistan’s Mas­tung district. In another explosion near a taxi stand in the Pak-Afghan border area of ​​Chaman on September 18, at least five people were killed and one was injured. Similarly, at least five people were killed and 29 injured in a blast at a rally of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium on September 2.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Monday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif against “unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province. The development comes as the Punjab government has faced criticism by the KP and Sindh governments for choking wheat flow to the two provinces. However, a day earlier, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari insisted that there was no ban on the inter-provincial movement of wheat, terming the “ongoing propaganda in this regard baseless and contrary to facts”. In a post on social media platform X today, the KP governor said he had written to the premier, urging his “immediate intervention to lift the unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province. “Such limitations not only affect the province’s food security but also go against the spirit of cooperative federalism enshrined in our Constitution,” he said. He expressed his confidence that the matter would be resolved promptly “under the prime minister’s leadership”. The letter, which Kundi also posted on X, termed the restrictions a “serious concern”, pointing out that KP was a “wheat-deficient province and depends substantially on inter-provincial inflows to meet its essential food requirements”. It said that the restrictions were against Article 151 of the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse among the provinces. “Any disruption in supply risks creating artificial shortages, price escalation and public hardship,” he said. “It has further been observed that these limitations are unintentionally encouraging illegal and informal transportation of wheat through alternate means and routes, which is resulting in uncontrollable supply distortions in the open market. This diversion is causing [a] rapid escalation in wheat and flour prices, directly burdening the general public and potentially triggering unwarranted public resentment,” he said. Kundi requested PM Shehbaz’s “kind and immediate intervention in this matter and direction to the concerned authorities” to withdraw the restrictions in order to ensure the “uninterrupted and legally protected movement of wheat” into KP. “I remain confident that, under your leadership, the constitutional rights of the people of KP will be safeguarded effectively and without delay,” he said. Kundi seeks restoration of daily int’l flights from Peshawar Separately, the KP governor wrote to Defence Minister Khawaja Asif requesting him to restore daily flights between Peshawar and Karachi, as well as international ones, “particularly to the Gulf and Middle Eastern countries”. “The suspension of these (international) flights has caused considerable hardship for overseas Pakistanis, entrepreneurs and their families,” Kundi said in a later post on X, noting that a “large expatriate population” from KP was employed in the Middle East. Kundi further said a “single private airline is operating with absolute monopoly” on the route between Peshawar and Karachi, inconveniencing people and traders due to exorbitant fares and limited seat availability. The governor requested Asif to issue directions to restore the flight services, adding, “I also earnestly hope and pray that our National Flag Bearer airline will once again ascend to command the skies of the world as it gloriously did during the golden decades of the 1960s and 1970s.” KP’s grievances In the aftermath of the recent floods, the Punjab government had begun tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage. The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement. While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. On Sept 7, Kundi had regretted the reports that Punjab had banned the movement of wheat to other provinces. He had issued another condemnation of the reported ban the very next day in a post on social media platform X. “The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi had said on X. The Constitution’s Article 151 states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”. The KP governor had further said: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation. “On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban.” Meanwhile, on Sept 7, the KP Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province. Subsequently, the government had approved a national wheat policy earlier this month. According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, stakeholders were told during a briefing about the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat. Then, in a letter dated October 23, the KP government had asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province. KP’s food secretary, in a letter to his Punjab counterpart, said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security. The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depended on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day. “The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read. While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements. KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force. “This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said. The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by PM Shehbaz, on October 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025 . “The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said. Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed. Last week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had again condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to the province, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province. Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat. Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable. Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5m tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces.",
