Choi Won-ho, chair of the Nuclear Safety and Security Commission, visited the plant in Gyeongju, 330 kilometers southeast of Seoul, as the historic city is set to host the APEC summit from Oct. 31 to Nov. 1. During the visit, Choi was briefed on the plant's readiness against illegal drones and unidentified vessels. \"As terrorist attacks against nuclear plants can lead to serious radiation accidents, it is important to maintain a strong defense posture,\" Choi said during the visit, urging related organizations, including Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., to maintain a robust security system. The APEC summit is expected to bring together nearly 20,000 participants from across the region, including the heads of state and some 3,500 other government delegates from the 21 APEC member economies.",

      "summary_orig": "FOR all the talk about their apparent mediocrity after their twin thrashings against India in the Asia Cup, Pakistan have at least upheld the status of being the second best team in the continent. The status was sealed on Thursday, when Pakistan edged Bangladesh by 11 runs in a tense, low-scoring Super Four encounter. The win meant Pakistan have beaten all their opponents in the campaign apart from India, and that the archrivals will meet for the third time in three weeks in the Asia Cup final — the first between the two side’s in the tournament’s 17-edition history. To make it to the title clash, Pakistan needed to get past defending champions Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, and the national side did that in the space of three days. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan had come into Thursday’s encounter on the back of their respective wins against Sri Lanka. The contest, therefore, was finely poised before Pakistan flexed their muscle, however, in bits and pieces in what was a show of poor batting throughout the 40 overs. Shaheen, Haris in the groove Batting may still remain a headache for Pakistan, but what must be pumping the team’s dugout up is how the fast bowlers have come into their element at just the right time in the tournament. While Shaheen — who looked better with the bat than ball at the start of the tournament — picked up his bowling rhythm from Tuesday’s win against Sri Lanka (3-28), Haris, returned from the bench, to fire 2-26 in Sunday’s six-wicket loss to India. Both combined against Bangladesh to deliver six scalps, putting up on display a classic, trademark Pakistan pace bowling show. After Shaheen dismantled Bangladesh’s powerplay, Haris arrived later on to finish the job, and made impact with the wicket of Saif Hassan, Bangladesh’s most dangerous batter in the tournament. There was calculated aggression on display from the duo, who mixed up hitting hard lengths with searing yorkers and deceptive slower ones to shine in the wickets columns and given their form, Shaheen and Haris could show up as box office items in the final. Batting Weaknesses persist Although Pakistan were clinical with the ball, they struggled big time with the bat, regardless that it was a tricky surface to play on. It was expected from Pakistan’s top-three to build onto their decent shows against India the last time the side played in Dubai, but both failed miserably against Bangladesh. Sahibzada Farhan seemed in touch when he cracked a backfoot cover drive early on but how he casually drove the next ball into the fielder’s hands was poor decision-making from the right-hander. Fakhar Zaman, meanwhile, looked clueless against the Bangladesh spin attack before departing cheaply. And Saim Ayub added a ninth duck to his T20 career stats trying to pick the wrong delivery up over the infield. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s poor run in the Asia Cup continued as his credentials as a T20 batter were questioned once again, while Hussain Talat was also dismissed on a loose delivery. Lower-order flourish Had it not been a lower-order flourish, ignited by Shaheen’s 13 off 19 — which included two massive sixes — and marshalled by Mohammad Haris, who stuck around to add a 23-ball 31 before Mohammad Nawaz smashed 25 off 15 (a four and two sixes), Pakistan wouldn’t have been able to cross even the 100-mark. The effort deep into the innings, infact, saw Pakistan add 80 off the last eight over after having reeling at 49-5 by the end of the 11th over. Despite the top-ordee failure, the lower-order’s utility came in handy for Pakistan, which is a huge confidence-boostimg point ahead of a clash which would require heaps of it. Bangladesh were poor too Bangladesh, for their part, were ordinary. Chasing 136, they never found rhythm. Regular wickets crippled their response, with Shamim Hossain’s 30 the only notable resistance. Saif Hassan briefly threatened before Haris accounted for him, and the rest folded without offering a fight. Crucially, Bangladesh also let Pakistan off the hook in the field, spilling chances that could have swung momentum. In a game decided by slim margins, such sloppiness proved costly. Pakistan’s spinners also deserve credit for applying the brakes. Saim Ayub’s tidy spell of 2-16 kept Bangladesh on the leash, while Nawaz bowled with control to choke the middle overs. It was the kind of collective effort that ensured the pace bowlers’ early breakthroughs did not go to waste. For Bangladesh, the failure to chase down a modest target underlines a gulf in execution. For Pakistan, the win reinforces the formula that has carried them so far: pace potency, lower-order grit and just enough from the rest. But against India in a final, where mistakes are punished ruthlessly, more will be needed.

Preparations to protect life and property should be\ncomplete.\n \nFor storm information specific to your area, please monitor\nproducts issued by your national meteorological service.\n \n \nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\n----------------------\nAt 600 AM GMT (0600 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone\nGabrielle was located near latitude 38.6 North, longitude 27.7 West.\nThe post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the east-northeast near\n30 mph (48 km/h).  An eastward to east-northeastward motion with a\ngradual decrease in forward speed is expected through Saturday,\nfollowed by a turn toward the southeast and south through early \nnext week.  On the forecast track, the center of post-tropical \nGabrielle will move across the Azores during the next few hours, \nthen approach the coast of Portugal by early Sunday.\n \nMaximum sustained winds are near 65 mph (100 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Some slight re-strengthening is possible during the next \nseveral hours, but gradual weakening should begin on Saturday.\n \nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 160 miles (260 km)\nfrom the center. Horta Airport on Faial Island recently reported \nsustained winds of 48 mph (78 km/h) and a wind gust of 76 mph   \n(122 km/h). A few hours ago, Serra St. Barbera, located in the \nmountains on Terceira Island, reported a wind gust of 115 mph   \n(185 km/h).\n \nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 987 mb (29.15 inches).\n \n \nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nKey messages for Gabrielle can be found in the Tropical Cyclone\nDiscussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT2 and WMO header WTNT42 KNHC.\n \nWIND: Tropical storm conditions, with gusts to hurricane force, are\noccurring in the central Azores and will spread to the southeastern\nAzores over the next couple of hours.  Strong, gusty winds will\ncontinue across these islands through the morning.\n \nGusty winds are possible along portions of the coast of Portugal\nlate Saturday through Sunday.\n \nSTORM SURGE: A dangerous storm surge is expected to produce\nsignificant coastal flooding in areas of onshore winds in the\nAzores. The surge will be accompanied by large and destructive\nwaves.\n \nRAINFALL: Through this morning, Gabrielle could produce 3 to 5\ninches, or 75 to 125 mm, of storm total rainfall across the central\nAzores.  This rainfall could cause flash flooding across the\nterrain.  Elsewhere, Gabrielle is expected to produce 1 to 3 inches,\nor 25 to 75 mm, of rain across the eastern Azores.\n \nSURF: Swells generated by Gabrielle will affect the Azores through\nthe weekend and will reach the coasts of Portugal, northwestern\nSpain, and northern Morocco on Saturday. These swells are expected\nto produce life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.

      "title_orig": "Quest for economic sovereignty",
      "summary_orig": "IN 1765, undivided India lost its financial sovereignty when Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II granted the East India Company the right to collect taxes (diwani) in Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa. This enabled systematic extraction of wealth and control over India’s economy and redirected resources to Britain. This erosion of financial sovereignty undermined national security and ultimately state sovereignty. After independence, Pakistan regained sovereignty when the Quaid inaugurated the State Bank of Pakistan on July 1, 1948, and issued its own currency. Until then, the Reserve Bank of India controlled Pakistan’s currency and banking system. As the Quaid noted, “The opening of the State Bank of Pakistan symbolises the sovereignty of our state in the financial sphere.” That sovereignty has gradually eroded through unchecked reliance on external aid. At the macro level, Pakistan remains locked in IMF programmes. Budgets are passed by parliament but pre-approved by the IMF. Monetary policy is nominally independent but shaped by Fund advice. The energy sector is trapped by IMF diktats to raise tariffs and fuel taxes. Recently, the IMF has even intruded into governance and judicial realms, beyond its mandate and expertise. The 2021 SBP Act amendments — passed reluctantly by the parliament under IMF conditionality despite strong reservations by all parties — symbolised a blow to sovereignty. Since 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has financed over 300 programmes and the World Bank (WB) more than 150, many co-financed by bilateral donors. They are involved across virtually all socioeconomic sectors: tax, energy, trade, agriculture, SMEs, finance, urban management, water, health, education, and justice. Many projects overlap as donors compete. Donors claim to promote self-reliance, yet the sheer number and scale of projects undertaken for decades contradict that very claim. Today, Pakistan appears to have become a colony of donors. Even junior staff of the IMF and donor agencies often act like viceroys and vicereines, negotiating directly with ministers and top civil servants dictating advice. Between 2000 and 2022, Pakistan received about $50 billion in official development assistance (ODA). Yet it still ranks near the bottom of global human, social and economic indicators. International aid erodes sovereignty because donors pursue their own agendas. Despite the proliferation of multibillion-dollar donor projects over decades, it is difficult to find tangible positive outcomes. Growth has stalled, unemployment is rising, and poverty is deepening. Twenty-six million children remain out of school, 40 per cent of under-fives are stunted, corruption has surged, and government effectiveness has deteriorated. Waste and abuse of borrowed resources is evident from the failure of donor-driven projects to improve the tax-to-GDP ratio, exports and competitiveness, SME financing, or even Karachi’s liveability conditions. Ironically, the very sectors that have received sustained donor support remain most inefficient, resulting in policy lethargy, institutional decay, and misuse of resources. The World Bank, ADB and others claim to be Pakistan’s ‘development partners’ but accept no responsibility for worsening conditions. Our officials outsource policy formulation and abdicate decision-making to foreign technocrats who have no stake in Pakistan’s future. Meanwhile, foreign aid has burdened the country with large, unsusta­inable debt, and repayments consume enormous resources, leaving behind little for investment in people. International aid erodes sovereignty because donors pursue their own agendas. Bilateral donors use aid as ‘soft power’ to secure votes in international organisations, support allies, access markets for exports, deter asylum seekers, or fight terrorism. As US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated this year, changes to USAID are “not about ending foreign aid” but about structuring it to further US national interests. In 2018, UK prime minister Theresa May declared that post-Brexit Britain’s aid would be used to advance British trade and political interests. If poverty alleviation or economic development were the true objectives, most aid would flow to the poorest nations — South Sudan, Burundi, Congo, Mozambique, etc. Instead, donor countries channel resources to strategic allies. Ukraine, for example, received $40bn in ODA in 2023 and $29.5bn in 2022, making it the largest aid recipient ever. In 2023, the US’s top five aid recipients were Ukraine, Israel, Jordan, Egypt, and Ethiopia. Pakistan now receives little in bilateral ODA — just $116 million from USAID in 2024 and £41.5m from the UK. These sums are negligible compared to Pakistan’s $410bn economy, but grant donors disproportionate influence. While USAID has shut down, the UK’s FCDO remains deeply entrenched. Through certain entities, it encroaches upon the SBP’s role in the financial sector. Also, in another instance, Karandaaz has penetrated the FBR to ‘modernise its tax system’, though its expertise in tax administration is open to question. Using Gates Foundation funds, it hired McKinsey to digitise FBR operations, with some fearing that such moves can give access to sensitive information. Many would see this as a breach of sovereignty. Tax collection is a fundamental function of a sovereign state. Imagine, Pakistan’s tax authority, mobilising Rs12 trillion in taxes, needing a few million dollars from a foundation to modernise itself. India, once dependent on foreign aid, has since transitioned from a recipient to net donor. After the 2004 tsunami, prime minister Manmohan Singh turned down humanitarian aid, saying India could cope on its own. Since then, India has disciplined aid flows, ending most bilateral programmes, channelling money through multilaterals, and restricting NGO foreign funding. Pakistan must also discipline international aid by restricting it to projects that enhance productivity and directly contribute to growth, while keeping debt within sustainable limits. The approach of accepting whatever comes in, on whatever terms, must end. The Economic Affairs Division must set clear priorities for external assistance, identify critical sectors and agencies for development cooperation, and communicate them to donors. Multilateral concessional financing should support demand-driven projects with high development impact. Bilateral donor programmes should be diminished sharply with their offices closed in Pakistan. This would immediately signal to the government to assume full responsibility for development and the welfare of its citizens. The quest for economic sovereignty is not about rejecting aid entirely. It is about regaining control over economic policy choices and ensuring external assistance serves Pakistan’s core development priorities, rather than foreign agendas. It is not just about pride — it is vital for national security and prosperity. The writer is the author of The Shady Economics of International Aid.

      "summary_orig": "• Two-judge bench declines Justice Jahangiri’s plea to join proceedings • Insists court will first hear and decide maintainability of petitions • Petitioners and their lawyers walk out of courtroom, stage protest KARACHI: Heated sce­nes were witnessed at the Sindh High Court on Thursday as a two-judge bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Islamabad High Court Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on seven petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree. The two-judge constitutional bench (CB) comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, however, set aside the IHC judge’s application, insisting that it would first hear and decide the maintainability of the petitions before it. Justice Jahangiri, accompanied by IHC Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, pleaded for a right of hearing, saying he was the aggrieved party and Karachi University (KU) had not issued him a notice before canceling his degree. Lawyers for the petitioners, however, objected to the jurisdiction of the bench and urged the court to decide their objections first. The proceedings drew a large number of lawyers inside and outside the courtroom, with many chanting slogans, clapping and later staging a protest outside the SHC against one of the judges. The petitioners and their lawyers also walked out of the courtroom in protest over their objections not being addressed and the court’s refusal to entertain Justice Jahangiri’s plea. Some lawyers later claimed that the bench had dismissed the petitions for non-prosecution, though the written order is expected to be issued today (Friday). The petitions had been filed last year by various bar associations, lawyers and a member of the KU syndicate, challenging decisions of the university’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate that canceled Justice Jahangiri’s degree. In September last year, the SHC had suspended, through an interim order, the KU decisions, restraining the university from taking coercive measures. The court had observed that every citizen’s right to fair trial was protected but that no hearing had been provided to Justice Jahangiri before the cancellation of the degree, which appeared obj­ec­­tionable, illegal and without authority. The petitions were fixed for Thursday’s hearing after the Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC) filed an urgent application seeking vacation of the interim stay order. Justice Jahangiri also appeared in person, filing an application to intervene in the proceedings. However, Justice Agha remarked that the court would first examine the issue of maintainability. Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, representing a petitioner, questioned how the issue could be decided without hearing the aggrieved person. Justice Jahangiri introduced himself at the rostrum and reiterated that, as the affected party, he had a fundamental right to be heard. Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed pointed out that Justice Memon was also part of a division bench that, in September last year, had suspended KU’s cancellation order. He added that the matter had originally been fixed before another constitutional bench headed by Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed for Sept 30, but was later transferred without explanation to the present bench. He argued that the matter should return to CB-II, as transfers of cases are the domain of a three-judge committee, and questioned how a constitutional bench could override an administrative order. Advocate Siddiqui also argued that the case should be heard by a regular bench rather than a constitutional bench. The petitioners’ lawyers further questioned the SHEC’s urgent application, arguing that the commission itself had admitted it had no role in the matter and should be removed as a respondent. They expressed surprise that the SHEC was now seeking an urgent hearing. Justice Jahangiri told the bench that he had always upheld his oath as a high court judge, testifying that his degree was genuine. “I did not act as a puppet, nor did I make decisions at the behest of any sector commander,” he asserted. The IHC judge, recently barred from exercising judicial powers by an IHC division bench, asked the SHC to grant him the right of hearing. The petitioners and their lawyers, however, left after the bench maintained it would decide maintainability first. Later, speaking to the media, Barrister Ahmed demanded that the bench recuse itself, voicing strong resentment over the transfer of the case, the conduct of the hearing and the court’s refusal to hear the aggrieved judge. In a pointed remark aimed at the ruling PPP, he said: “The Sindh High Court should remain a court of law and not turn into a ‘People’s High Court’.” Published in Dawn, September 26th, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Terrorists receive ‘state patronage’ in Afghanistan: Sarfraz Bugti",
      "summary_orig": "Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Thursday that terrorists were receiving “state patronage” in Afghanistan, from where they launched attacks on Pakistan. His comments come against the backdrop of a tumultuous security situation in Balochistan, which has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces. Islamabad, for the last couple of years, has been insisting that terrorists use Afghan soil to lauch attacks across the country. Kabul, however, denies the allegations. Responding to a question during a press conference in Islamabad, CM Bugti reiterated the state’s narrative and said, “Terrorists were provided safe havens and places to run training camps in Afghanistan.” He highlighted that many among the recently killed terrorists were from Afghanistan. The CM called on the Taliban rulers in Afghanistan to abide by the Doha agreement, in which, he said Kabul had “committed not to let your soil be used against any country”. Bugti justifies 4G suspension Earlier in the press conference, he shared details of a intelligence-based operation conducted in Chagai yesterday, in which he said two men were killed and another surrendered. Bugti said one of the two killed “terrorists” was a lawyer by profession. He detailed that the lawyer was traced following some arrests over the killing of Pakistan Air Force men on May 8 in Dal Badin. “We observed him for two to three months and surrounded his house yesterday. Then, through a loud speaker, we asked him to surrender, and as soon as we did that, firing started from their end.” A Federal Constabulary soldier was injured, and retaliatory firing by security personnel led to a fire exchange which went on for two to three hours, he said, adding that eventually two of the “terrorists” were killed and their third companion surrendered. Answering a question, he alleged that efforts were being made to gather terrorist organisations in Balochistan. He went on to say that this was a “war” facilitated and funded by Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing. “They have foisted an intelligence-based war on us, and they are trying to bring together all those who want to destabilise Pakistan.” Bugti also touched upon the suspension of 4G mobile network services in Balochistan. “We faced criticism for suspending 4G services,” he said, clarifying that the authorities’ intention behind such moves was not to cause inconvenience for the people. “But, terrorists have started using means of communication that are beyond the capacity of our intelligence agencies,” he explained, adding that the suspension of mobile network services helped with tracking down and catching terrorists. In response to another questioned, he stressed the need to distinguish between the “youth” who had not taken up arms and those who had  taken up arms with the intention to break Pakistan. He questioned if an area was deprived of development and resources, should its people kill others. “How are you justifying violence on this basis? … We continue to link this violence to deprivation, unparalleled development, [violation of] human rights.” Balochistan, where violence has been a problem for long, continues to face neglect in terms of development and resource availability as well. Human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International, have also repeatedly called out the authorities over action against rights activists, notably Baloch Yakjehti Committee’s Mahrang Baloch. Mahrang has particularly raised voice on the issue of missing persons. Bugti also directed criticism toward her and said “there is a huge difference between self-disappearance and enforced disappearance”. “Unfortunately, you continue to buy the narrative being peddled out here, without thinking that the reality may be different from perception,” he continued. He also dispelled the impression that there “is a puppet government in Balochistan”. The CM shared that the federal and Balochistan government had decided to carry out an exercise with the help of satellite images and would not get Pakistan’s poppy-free status get compromised. He was also asked about the reports of killing of a terrorist identified as Rehman Gul in Afghanistan, who is said to be the mastermind of the Jaffer Express attack . CM Bugti said these were unconfirmed reports. “It cannot be said that this is 100 per cent true. This is what we have been informed of from different sources … But I believe that this is a big success of ours, even if the reports are unconfirmed. Though, it seems they will be confirmed soon.”",

      "summary_orig": "A lady health worker, part of a vaccination team for the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) immunisation campaign for girls, was beaten up by local women in Mandi Bahauddin on Thursday, police said. Speaking to Dawn.com , Kuthiala Sheikhan Police Station House Officer (SHO) Sabir Hussain Sindhu said that the incident took place in Chak No 38. “LHW Ghulam Sughra was beaten up by local women while the vaccination campaign was being carried out at a school,” he said, adding that the health worker was also thrown to the ground during the assault. He said that a first information report (FIR) had been registered on the complaint of the health worker but no arrests have been made so far. The FIR of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com , was registered at the Kuthiala Sheikhan Police Station under Sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code . In the FIR, Sughra stated that she was present along with the team at Chak No 38. The complainant said that the team was vaccinating children at an elementary school when they were attacked by a woman, identified as Parveen, along with 15 other women. “Parveen threw me to the ground and started punching me. The other women also started hitting me [and] they also swore at me,” she said. Vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities. The HPV vaccine, first launched in Pakistan in 2022, has now been rolled out nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. The immunisation campaign, which began on September 17, will conclude on September 27. The campaign is being implemented in three phases: Phase 1, running from 15–27 September 2025, covers Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Islamabad Capital Territory; Phase 2 will expand to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026; and Phase 3 will reach Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027. The goal is to vaccinate 90 per cent of girls aged 9–14 in Phase 1 regions by the end of 2025, and to sustain high coverage through routine immunisation in the coming years.",
