      "summary_orig": "• Indigenous leaders demand protection for their territories • Scientists highlight rapid destabilisation of the planet’s frozen regions • It’s unclear whether states would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for end of the event BELEM: The COP30 climate summit opened Monday in this Amazon city with the UN climate chief urging countries to cooperate with one another in the fight against a warming planet rather than battling over competing priorities. Host country Brazil brokered an agreement on the agenda for the two-week summit, fending off attempts from developing-country negotiating blocs to shoehorn contentious issues like climate finance and carbon taxes into the formal talks. The opening day was marked by calls for unity, stark warnings from scientists and Indige­nous groups, and a notable abse­nce by the US federal government that drew sharp criticism from one of its own governors. “In this arena of COP30, your job here is not to fight one another — your job here is to fight this climate crisis, together,” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates from more than 190 countries attending the conference. Stiell acknowledged that three decades of UN climate talks had helped to bend the curve in projected warming downward, “because of what was agreed in halls like this, with governments legislating, and markets responding.” It remained unclear whether countries would aim to negotiate a single, final agreement for the end of the event — a hard sell in a year of fractious global politics and US efforts to obstruct a transition away from fossil fuels. Some officials have suggested that countries focus on smaller efforts that do not need universal consensus, after years of COP summits making lofty promises only to leave many unfulfilled. Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned against interests trying to obscure the dangers of climate change in his opening remarks. “They attack the institutions, the science, the universities,” he said. “It’s time to imp­ose another defeat to denialists.” The world’s biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gases, the United States, opted to skip the summit at the federal level, while US President Donald Trump asserts that climate change is a hoax. However, a state-level US presence was expected, with California Gov Gavin Newsom and New Mexico Gov Michelle Lujan Grisham scheduled to arrive in Belem on Tuesday. Addressing a global investors summit, Newsom questioned the federal government’s disengagement. “What the hell is going on here?” Newsom said about the US government’s absence from the talks. “We’re in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world’s great democracies. I mean hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50 percent tariffs,” Newsom said. European nations planned to use the summit to press for firm commitments. Germany said it would join other European countries to push for commitments to rein in fossil fuel use, a goal also promoted by Lula. Warning signs Delegates were joined by Indigenous leaders, who arri­v­ed on Sunday by boat after travelling some 3,000 kilometres (1,864 miles) from the Andes. They are demanding more say in how their territories are managed as climate change escalates and industries such as mining, logging and oil drilling push deeper into forests. “We want to make sure that they don’t keep promising, that they will start protecting, because we as Indigenous people are the ones who suffer from these impacts of climate change,” said Pablo Inuma Flores, an Indigenous leader from Peru.—Reuters Published in Dawn, November 11th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• CJCSC urged troop mobilisation • COAS cautioned against hasty escalation ISLAMABAD: The Natio­nal Secur­ity Committee (NSC) did not overrule the then army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa’s response plan during the 2019 Balakot crisis , according to at least two participants of that meeting who spoke on Monday. “The then army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s response strategy was agreed upon and executed by the Pakistan Air Force,” said a federal minister who attended the meeting, adding that the then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, Gen Zubair Hayat, had proposed a more radical option that was not accepted. An armed forces official who also participated in the meeting gave a similar account, saying that then prime minister Imran Khan was “displeased” with Gen Hayat’s suggestion, which he thought “did not make any sense.” The statements counter a recent claim by former defence secretary Lt Gen (Retd) Asif Yasin Malik, who said that during the 2019 NSC meeting held after the Balakot strikes, Gen Bajwa had advised restraint but was overruled by the air chief and the CJCSC. The 2019 escalation followed a Feb 14 suicide bombing in Pulw­ama, India-occupied Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel. India responded with airstrikes on Balakot on Feb 26, the first time since the 1971 war that Indian aircraft had crossed deep into Pakistani territory. According to the two participants, who spoke separately to Dawn , the sequence of events began in the early hours of Feb 26, 2019, when then chief of general staff (CGS) Gen Nadeem Raza called Gen Bajwa at about 2:30am to report an Indian airstrike near Balakot. Gen Bajwa asked for an assessment of the damage, and the CGS later informed him that no significant damage had occurred. A seminary built during the Afghan war, used for religious education of local children, had been the intended target. However, the missile missed its mark and landed some distance away, causing no casualties or structural damage. Soon afterwards, the then air chief marshal Mujahid Anwar contacted Gen Bajwa to discuss the situation. Gen Bajwa suggested that since no damage had been caused, the matter could be addressed during a meeting with the prime minister later that morning. Before attending the NSC meeting, Gen Bajwa convened his core team at General Headquarters (GHQ), where the director general of military operations (DGMO) suggested that Pakistan must respond, but in a measured way, to avoid escalation. The DGMO proposed that, unlike India’s night raid on a single site, Pakistan should strike multiple targets in broad daylight to send a clear message and restore deterrence. The response operation, later known as Operation Swift Retort , was conceived during these consultations. Gen Bajwa then took the plan to the National Security Committee meeting at the Prime Minister’s House. During the session, Gen Zubair Hayat spoke for about 40 minutes, emphasising that he was the prime minister’s principal adviser in times of war. When Gen Bajwa asked for his concrete suggestion, Gen Hayat proposed full mobilisation of troops and a declaration of war against India. According to participants, Gen Bajwa cautioned against hasty escalation. He then presented the operational plan prepared at GHQ, which was approved by the NSC. The detailed strategy was subsequently discussed with the PAF chief, who executed the air operation, they recalled. On Feb 27, Pakistani aircraft struck six targets in India-occupied Kashmir, hitting “open spaces” to demonstrate their capability to hit Indian targets without escalating the tensions further.

Before attending the NSC meeting, Gen Bajwa convened his core team at General Headquarters (GHQ), where the director general of military operations (DGMO) suggested that Pakistan must respond, but in a measured way, to avoid escalation. The DGMO proposed that, unlike India’s night raid on a single site, Pakistan should strike multiple targets in broad daylight to send a clear message and restore deterrence. The response operation, later known as Operation Swift Retort , was conceived during these consultations. Gen Bajwa then took the plan to the National Security Committee meeting at the Prime Minister’s House. During the session, Gen Zubair Hayat spoke for about 40 minutes, emphasising that he was the prime minister’s principal adviser in times of war. When Gen Bajwa asked for his concrete suggestion, Gen Hayat proposed full mobilisation of troops and a declaration of war against India. According to participants, Gen Bajwa cautioned against hasty escalation. He then presented the operational plan prepared at GHQ, which was approved by the NSC. The detailed strategy was subsequently discussed with the PAF chief, who executed the air operation, they recalled. On Feb 27, Pakistani aircraft struck six targets in India-occupied Kashmir, hitting “open spaces” to demonstrate their capability to hit Indian targets without escalating the tensions further.

      "summary": "• CJCSC urged troop mobilisation • COAS cautioned against hasty escalation ISLAMABAD: The Natio­nal Secur­ity Committee (NSC) did not overrule the then army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa’s response plan during the 2019 Balakot crisis , according to at least two participants of that meeting who spoke on Monday. “The then army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s response strategy was agreed upon and executed by the Pakistan Air Force,” said a federal minister who attended the meeting, adding that the then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, Gen Zubair Hayat, had proposed a more radical option that was not accepted. An armed forces official who also participated in the meeting gave a similar account, saying that then prime minister Imran Khan was “displeased” with Gen Hayat’s suggestion, which he thought “did not make any sense.” The statements counter a recent claim by former defence secretary Lt Gen (Retd) Asif Yasin Malik, who said that during the 2019 NSC meeting held after the Balakot strikes, Gen Bajwa had advised restraint but was overruled by the air chief and the CJCSC. The 2019 escalation followed a Feb 14 suicide bombing in Pulw­ama, India-occupied Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel. India responded with airstrikes on Balakot on Feb 26, the first time since the 1971 war that Indian aircraft had crossed deep into Pakistani territory. According to the two participants, who spoke separately to Dawn , the sequence of events began in the early hours of Feb 26, 2019, when then chief of general staff (CGS) Gen Nadeem Raza called Gen Bajwa at about 2:30am to report an Indian airstrike near Balakot. Gen Bajwa asked for an assessment of the damage, and the CGS later informed him that no significant damage had occurred. A seminary built during the Afghan war, used for religious education of local children, had been the intended target. However, the missile missed its mark and landed some distance away, causing no casualties or structural damage. Soon afterwards, the then air chief marshal Mujahid Anwar contacted Gen Bajwa to discuss the situation. Gen Bajwa suggested that since no damage had been caused, the matter could be addressed during a meeting with the prime minister later that morning.

      "summary_orig": "At least two terrorists were killed during an attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan on Monday as security forces conducted a clearance operation at the educational facility, said the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The military’s media wing said the initial attempt by the terrorists to breach the perimeter security was foiled by the “vigilant and resolute response by own troops”. However, the attackers then rammed an explosives-laden vehicle against the main gate of the college, causing it to collapse and damaging an adjacent structure. The terrorists then entered the educational facility and were “cornered in the college’s administrative block”. “Displaying unwavering courage and professional excellence, own troops engaged the intruders with precision, eliminating two khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij ,” said the ISPR. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned TTP. The ISPR added that the terrorists, inside the college, are in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan and “are getting instructions”. “This blatant act of barbarism orchestrated by Khwarij from Afghanistan is in contrast to assertions made by the Afghan Taliban Regime claiming non-presence of these terrorist groups on their soil.” The military added that Pakistan reserves the right to respond against the terrorists and their leadership present in Afghanistan. “These khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij have once again tried to repeat the barbaric act of terrorism carried out by them in Army Public School Peshawar in 2014 ,” said the ISPR. On December 16, 2014, Pakistan lived through one of its most horrific chapters. The attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar and the operation to clear out the terrorists unfolded in less than 10 hours, during which 147 people, including 132 schoolchildren, were martyred. The military maintained that the latest attack aims to instill fear among the youth of the tribal areas, “who are acquiring quality education at their doorstep to excel in life and achieve a better future for not only themselves and their families but also for their communities.” Earlier today, the military’s media wing said at least 20 terrorists were killed in North Waziristan and Dara Adam Khel districts of KP. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to attack security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies’ personnel. PM, Naqvi condemn attack Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the attack and lauded the retaliatory action of the security forces. He said the cowardly enemy had once again tried to target an educational institution and failed. “Unwavering resolve of the security forces will thwart the nefarious designs of the terrorists,” the premier added. “The entire nation salutes the security forces,” he said, adding that the government was determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the professionalism and courage of the security personnel for repelling the attack and eliminating two terrorists. He said the timely and decisive action of the forces prevented a major tragedy and demonstrated their high level of preparedness. “By thwarting the terrorists’ attempt, our brave soldiers have once again proven their dedication to protecting the nation,” Naqvi said. Naqvi reiterated that the government and people stood united against terrorism and would continue efforts to eradicate all extremist elements from the country. State broadcaster PTV News also released a video message from parents of the students condemning the attackers and expressing their solidarity with the security forces.",

      "summary_orig": "The contentious bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment sailed through the Senate on Monday after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The government and its coalition partners secured a two-thirds majority in the vote following the defection of two opposition members, leading to a total of 64 votes for the bill. The bill, which had stirred controversy in the country for weeks, was presented in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the proceedings. Initially, a clause-by-clause voting was carried out. Later, voting by division was conducted, with the entry and exit gates of the Senate closed as per the protocol. View this post on Instagram Before the passage of the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward Tarar’s table as he began to present it. Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber — paving the way for the smooth passage of the bill. A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s (NA) law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House. Following its approval by the Senate, the bill will also have to be voted on in the NA. The session had begun today but it was adjourned. The NA will now reconvene at 11am tomorrow (Tuesday). In the 336-member NA, the ruling coalition does enjoy a two-thirds majority. It has 233 members while the opposition holds 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM-P 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each. PTI senator resigns after voting in favour Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI resigned shortly after voting in favour of the bill. Speaking on the floor of the upper house, the lawmaker said he “voted only for Syed Gen Asim Munir”. He added that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by winning the war with India. “During the 26th Amendment, 10 family members of mine were abducted, but my party (PTI) did not come to the rescue.” When he tendered his resignation, the Senate chairman said, “We will make you a senator again”. Senators Saifullah Abro and Naseema Ehsan are seated in the Senate. — YouTube/PTV Parliament The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl also expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. ‘Historic bill’ Shortly after the passage of the bill, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to the floor of the house and termed the amendment a “historic bill”, saying that it was an “unfinished agenda” of the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by almost all political parties. “There was a feeling to maintain balance, and thus a constitutional court is being formed for the betterment of the judiciary,” he said. Dar added that the rank of field marshal was now included in the Constitution, adding that space was created for the rank of a five-star general in all three military forces. “The seniority of the current SC judges and the chief justice would not be impacted by the amendment,” he clarified. Govt presents parliamentary committee’s report Earlier in the day, Naek tabled a report in the Senate detailing some changes made in the draft bill by the parliamentary committee. Chairman Gilani asked for the opposition members to be called to the house as well, so they could be present during the briefing. Naek told the house that the joint committee deliberated on the bill for two days and made “many changes”. Sharing further details, he said the bill proposed the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which the committee “unanimously” approved with some changes to the relevant clause. Outlining those changes, he said there would be equal representation of all provinces in the FCC, and it would also include a representative from the Islamabad High Court. Moving on to the second change, he said the initial draft of the bill stated that a judge could be nominated for the FCC after serving on the high court for seven years. The committee reduced this qualification merit for the FCC from seven to five years, he added. Naek further said that the committee also agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. However, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. Moreover, he continued, if multiple judges would take the oath on the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age. He added that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) was reconstituted under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, with the speaker being authorised to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate to become a member. The committee changed this to include a technocrat, Naek said. “So now, the speaker can nominate a woman, non-Muslim or technocrat who qualifies to be a member of Parliament for the JCP.” He highlighted that currently, the SC had suo motu powers and could invoke Article 183 of the Constitution to take up a case at its discretion. As for the FCC, “we have retained the suo motu powers […] but we would exercise these powers when an application is submitted. The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed”. On the transfer of judges, the PPP senator said that previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, judges could be transferred by the president, but the consent of the said judge was required, and two chief justices of the relevant high courts were consulted. “The amended bill has changed the method of transfers, as now, a judge will be transferred from one high court to another through the JCP, which was reconstituted under the 26th Amendment and has the representation of all — the executive, parliament, judges, civil society, and lawyers,” Naek said. Naek said that under Article 199 of the Constitution, an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided. This created a huge backlog, he remarked, adding that the interim order would now be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made until then. Senate debate The Senate session began shortly after 11am with Senator Manzoor Kakar presiding over the proceedings in the absence of Chairman Gilani. At the outset, he said some speeches regarding the constitutional amendment could not be delivered yesterday, and proceedings today would begin with those addresses. He then gave the floor to PML-N’s Agha Shahzaib Durrani, whose speech was repeatedly interrupted by the opposition benches. During his speech, Durrani mentioned that the opposition had questioned that what was the need for a constitutional court. He justified this need, citing the backlog of cases in the Supreme Court. Durrani also berated the opposition, particularly the PTI, for “abolishing the democracy” and “turning the President’s House into an ordinance factory” during its tenure. His speech was followed by that of PPP’s Zamir Hussain Ghumro, who rejected the opposition’s criticism that the 27th Amendment was a “9/11 on Pakistan“ . He defended the planned establishment of the constitutional court, alleging that the SC had not been performing its “original function, but enforcing fundamental rights, which is a function of the high courts”. “The Supreme Court has been interfering in [matters of] Parliament and the executive,” he claimed, further justifying the need for the constitutional court. “It will not only strengthen the independence of the judiciary but also the federation,” he argued. Regarding the proposed changes to Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces, he recalled the recent conflict with India in May . “The chief of army staff, the Field Marshal won a war for Pakistan,” he said, adding that he deserved immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests. “What is the problem with this? Do you want to drag your heroes through the streets and courts?” he questioned. He added that the PPP believed the 27th Amendment would be a “milestone in advancing democracy, the Constitution, and the 18th Amendment”. After Ghumro concluded his speech, PTI’s Fawzia Arshad pointed out that an opposition leader had still not been notified in the Senate. The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Shibli Faraz in August. Arshad said the pendency of the notification was a denial of legislative rights to the PTI. She also assailed the proposed 27th Amendment and its proponents, saying that “institutions are being trampled and their rights are being taken away”. For his part, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Amir Waliuddin Chishti said his party was promised changes to Articles 142 (advocate general for a province) and 140-A (local government) under the 27th Amendment. “Now, after two days, I am hearing that while the amendments came under discussion, it is being said that they may be included in the 28th Amendment,” he added. PML-N Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu also referred to the May conflict, saying, “The entire nation won the war. The media and opposition also won. Everyone did. But under whose leadership? General Syed Asim Munir sahib .” Senator Sindhu quipped that it was not as if some land was being named for the army chief, but only an honorary title was being bestowed on him. He claimed that all Commonwealth nations had officers who remained in uniform for life. He also highlighted Field Marshal Munir’s role in “trade and foreign affairs as he accompanied the prime minister” on multiple visits. The PML-N leader dismissed the concerns regarding the 27th Amendment as “frivolous and concocted”, asserting there was nothing contradictory to the Constitution in it. Later, Kakar paused the proceedings and said the house would meet again at 3.30pm. Speaking to Dawn on condition of anonymity, a key minister said the government planned to get the bill passed today, “no matter what.” Will ensure amendment does not pass: PTI Separately, PTI Senator Ali Zafar said while speaking to the media in Parliament that the opposition would ensure the amendment was not passed if the government did not have the requisite numbers. “It is possible they may not be able to table it today,” he said while speaking to the media. He further said that the opposition was against giving immunity from criminal proceedings to anyone. “We are saying that if anyone has committed a crime, be it a president or a governor, they should be punished according to the law and the Constitution,” he said. However, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar defended the inclusion of a clause for providing lifetime immunity to the president from criminal proceedings and arrests under the proposed amendment. “The heads of state enjoy immunity across the world. This is a choice, and this system prevails in the whole world […] I think there is no harm in this,” he said while speaking to the media. He also welcomed the premier’s decision not to pursue the clause for immunity. The minister further said the amendment was for “good governance”, improving the federation’s relationship with the provinces, and for strengthening defence“. He said, constitutional courts also existed in other parts of the world, adding that this was also included in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006. Tarar said the demand for constitutional courts was jointly made by the PML-N, PPP and the Awami National Party, and that the Constitution was a living document which continued to evolve. He asserted that the government had the requisite votes, terming the amendment “positive” and in line with international practices. MQM-P backs Article 243, reiterates call for LG powers In his address, Senator Faisal Subzwari, parliamentary leader for the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), said: “When you concede your space, those succeeding you get even less space.” As he looked towards the opposition benches, Subzwari expressed the wish that politicians were as concerned about merits and justice when they were in power themselves. He stressed that all highs had a downfall, adding that the remark was meant for everyone. Speaking on changes in Article 243, he said, “We wish that after the passage of this amendment […] the honour of the Pakistan Army, the defence of Pakistan and the state of Pakistan rises, especially during a time when India — much more powerful than us and with a more armed military — is present on our eastern front.” The MQM-P leader also mentioned the “dispute” on the western front with Afghanistan, and added that on such occasions, there was a need to “encourage and support the armed forces in every possible manner”. He criticised PTI’s Omar Ayub for making remarks in the National Assembly that doubted the military’s preparedness and arms supplies. On the “much-debated” changes being brought in the judiciary, Subzwari said the formation of the FCC should “bear fruit” and not remain limited to high courts. “What steps have been taken by the constitutional courts that will be formed or have been formed that will impact the ordinary petitioner?” We need to answer this,“ he said. Subzwari recalled the MQM-P’s demand for local bodies’ autonomy made in an amendment submitted in the NA last year. He noted that the matter was still with the relevant standing committee and said the MQM-P will approach other parties, including the PTI and the PPP, for it. He refuted the impression that empowering local governments (LGs) amounted to rolling back the 18th Amendment that provided provincial autonomy. The lawmaker stressed that giving LGs powers in the same way as provinces was to ensure that the citizens there received the resources distributed to them. “This is a case for Jacobabad and Kashmore, and of Sajidabad and Rahim Yar Khan, which are away from their provincial capitals,” he said. Subzwari acknowledged that the proposals made earlier on the National Finance Commission (NFC) shares — which were not included in the current amendment bill following the PPP’s opposition — needed a debate. He suggested that a certain share be allocated for provincial finance commissions in the NFC.",

      "summary_en": "The contentious bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment sailed through the Senate on Monday after 64 lawmakers voted in its favour, with members of the opposition staging a noisy walkout. The government and its coalition partners secured a two-thirds majority in the vote following the defection of two opposition members, leading to a total of 64 votes for the bill. The bill, which had stirred controversy in the country for weeks, was presented in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the proceedings. Initially, a clause-by-clause voting was carried out. Later, voting by division was conducted, with the entry and exit gates of the Senate closed as per the protocol. View this post on Instagram Before the passage of the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward Tarar’s table as he began to present it. Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber — paving the way for the smooth passage of the bill. A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s (NA) law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House. Following its approval by the Senate, the bill will also have to be voted on in the NA. The session had begun today but it was adjourned. The NA will now reconvene at 11am tomorrow (Tuesday). In the 336-member NA, the ruling coalition does enjoy a two-thirds majority. It has 233 members while the opposition holds 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM-P 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each. PTI senator resigns after voting in favour Senator Saifullah Abro of the PTI resigned shortly after voting in favour of the bill. Speaking on the floor of the upper house, the lawmaker said he “voted only for Syed Gen Asim Munir”. He added that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by winning the war with India. “During the 26th Amendment, 10 family members of mine were abducted, but my party (PTI) did not come to the rescue.” When he tendered his resignation, the Senate chairman said, “We will make you a senator again”. Senators Saifullah Abro and Naseema Ehsan are seated in the Senate. — YouTube/PTV Parliament The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl also expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction. ‘Historic bill’ Shortly after the passage of the bill, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to the floor of the house and termed the amendment a “historic bill”, saying that it was an “unfinished agenda” of the 2006 Charter of Democracy signed by almost all political parties. “There was a feeling to maintain balance, and thus a constitutional court is being formed for the betterment of the judiciary,” he said. Dar added that the rank of field marshal was now included in the Constitution, adding that space was created for the rank of a five-star general in all three military forces. “The seniority of the current SC judges and the chief justice would not be impacted by the amendment,” he clarified. Govt presents parliamentary committee’s report Earlier in the day, Naek tabled a report in the Senate detailing some changes made in the draft bill by the parliamentary committee.

He further said that the opposition was against giving immunity from criminal proceedings to anyone. “We are saying that if anyone has committed a crime, be it a president or a governor, they should be punished according to the law and the Constitution,” he said. However, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar defended the inclusion of a clause for providing lifetime immunity to the president from criminal proceedings and arrests under the proposed amendment. “The heads of state enjoy immunity across the world. This is a choice, and this system prevails in the whole world […] I think there is no harm in this,” he said while speaking to the media. He also welcomed the premier’s decision not to pursue the clause for immunity. The minister further said the amendment was for “good governance”, improving the federation’s relationship with the provinces, and for strengthening defence“. He said, constitutional courts also existed in other parts of the world, adding that this was also included in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006. Tarar said the demand for constitutional courts was jointly made by the PML-N, PPP and the Awami National Party, and that the Constitution was a living document which continued to evolve. He asserted that the government had the requisite votes, terming the amendment “positive” and in line with international practices. MQM-P backs Article 243, reiterates call for LG powers In his address, Senator Faisal Subzwari, parliamentary leader for the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), said: “When you concede your space, those succeeding you get even less space.” As he looked towards the opposition benches, Subzwari expressed the wish that politicians were as concerned about merits and justice when they were in power themselves. He stressed that all highs had a downfall, adding that the remark was meant for everyone. Speaking on changes in Article 243, he said, “We wish that after the passage of this amendment […] the honour of the Pakistan Army, the defence of Pakistan and the state of Pakistan rises, especially during a time when India — much more powerful than us and with a more armed military — is present on our eastern front.” The MQM-P leader also mentioned the “dispute” on the western front with Afghanistan, and added that on such occasions, there was a need to “encourage and support the armed forces in every possible manner”. He criticised PTI’s Omar Ayub for making remarks in the National Assembly that doubted the military’s preparedness and arms supplies. On the “much-debated” changes being brought in the judiciary, Subzwari said the formation of the FCC should “bear fruit” and not remain limited to high courts. “What steps have been taken by the constitutional courts that will be formed or have been formed that will impact the ordinary petitioner?” We need to answer this,“ he said. Subzwari recalled the MQM-P’s demand for local bodies’ autonomy made in an amendment submitted in the NA last year. He noted that the matter was still with the relevant standing committee and said the MQM-P will approach other parties, including the PTI and the PPP, for it. He refuted the impression that empowering local governments (LGs) amounted to rolling back the 18th Amendment that provided provincial autonomy. The lawmaker stressed that giving LGs powers in the same way as provinces was to ensure that the citizens there received the resources distributed to them. “This is a case for Jacobabad and Kashmore, and of Sajidabad and Rahim Yar Khan, which are away from their provincial capitals,” he said. Subzwari acknowledged that the proposals made earlier on the National Finance Commission (NFC) shares — which were not included in the current amendment bill following the PPP’s opposition — needed a debate. He suggested that a certain share be allocated for provincial finance commissions in the NFC.",

      "summary_orig": "The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday ordered the Punjab Wildlife Department to submit a report on the demolition of a pet market in the walled city within 30 days and decide on a framework to prevent such incidents from occurring again, according to the lawyer who filed the petition with the court. A demolition operation was carried out at a bird market in Lahore’s Bhati Chowk area, near Data Darbar last Friday by the Lahore Development Authority (LDA), with shopkeepers accusing the Punjab government of killing dozens of birds and other caged pets; allegations the government has denied. This incident led to public outrage as the animals were not moved during the demolition. Animal rights lawyer Altamush Saeed filed a petition with the LHC on Saturday, naming the Punjab government, the Punjab Wildlife and Fisheries Department and the LDA, as respondents. A press release stated that the court ordered the Wildlife Department to submit a “comprehensive report” on the matter. It added that LHC Judge Shehram Sarwar ordered the Wildlife Department to treat Saeed’s petition as a “formal representation” and submit a comprehensive report to the court on the demolition within 30 days. According to the lawyer, the department was ordered to include in its report the details and causes of the demolition, a concrete road map to ensure similar incidents do not happen in the future, criminal action against those responsible, and training and sensitivity programmes to promote “empathy and responsibility” towards animals within the Punjab government and its departments. The press release also stated that if the Wildlife Department does not submit the report within the 30-day deadline, they would be “brought back before the court under contempt proceedings”. “These deaths were entirely preventable. Had the [LDA] coordinated with the Wildlife Department, these animals could have been safely relocated,” the press release read. In separate comments to Dawn , Saeed stated that the department had an obligation to coordinate with the LDA to protect the animals at the market. “The legal issue is that [with] the demolition and everything that happened, the Wildlife Department had to be involved for the relocation of the animals,” he explained to Dawn . “That did not happen and that is why the animals died. “Secondly, there’s no accountability from the LDA as well, therefore sending this matter to Wildlife — which has the right authority and the legal authority under the Punjab Wildlife Act — to not only take criminal action, but also to devise some kind of framework that [ensures] this does not happen again.” Saeed noted that the department should have been involved from he beginning since they were the right authority to decide on the matter, adding that had the issue gone directly to the LDA, “we would have lost”. “You can clearly see that the LDA did everything unilaterally; the department does not have the jurisdiction to deal with wild animals, it also does not have the expertise,” Saeed stated. “We have no idea when the animals were relocated, we have no idea where they’re actually relocated. Secondly, it’s not in their (the LDA) legal domain to do so.” The petition — available with Dawn — requested that the court declare the actions of the LDA and the Lahore commissioner and DC’s actions “illegal if [the] killing of animals is proved and to ensure regardless [that] future projects of any kind do involve a safe animal evacuation or relocation program and no animal cruelty”. It further requested that six of the respondents launch an inquiry into the matter and publicly collect debris and rubble from the demolition site, in order to prove the presence of animals when the structure was torn down. “In the interim, do not allow any debris excavation without transparency to prevent [the] removal of evidence,” the petition read. It further requested that the court order the Punjab government “to hold ethics and empathy training on animal and human rights in light of Islam and the policy for government employees and [the] general public in line with Article 9, 9A and 25A of the constitution”.",

      "summary_orig": "Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday rubbished the notion that the status of incarcerated former premier Imran Khan had any bearing on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s withdrawal of proposed immunity for the top office as part of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Government senators Anusha Rahman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu had tabled a proposal for the 27th Amendment bill to extend the immunity currently enjoyed by the president under Article 248 of the Constitution to include the prime minister. The clause sought to extend presidential immunity to the prime minister, effectively barring criminal proceedings against the premier during the term in office. Article 248 of the Constitution stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office”. However, PM Shehbaz had ordered the clause’s withdrawal on Sunday, saying that the premier must remain “fully accountable”. Separately, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had said that PM Shehbaz told him earlier that “he had no interest in getting immunity”, owing to the executive nature of his role as the prime minister. Questioned in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’ today about speculation that the clause was withdrawn because it could potentially benefit the PTI founder, Sanaullah said: “No. If we had intended to do this, we could also have done it in a way that the benefit would apply only from today.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. He served as the prime minister from August 2018 till April 2022, when he was ousted through a vote of no-confidence. He said the prime minister made a very “democratic” decision and he should be congratulated for it. The premier’s aide added that the premier’s office was not a constitutional one but an executive and elected office, thus “it should remain answerable to the people”. PM Shehbaz was elected as the 24th premier of Pakistan in the 2024 general elections. Article 95 of the Constitution of Pakistan allows for a prime minister to be impeached via a no-confidence motion. It states: “A resolution for a vote of no-confidence moved by not less than twenty per centum of the total membership of the National Assembly may be passed against the Prime Minister by the National Assembly.” Issue of immunity Discussion also veered towards a post on X by renowned Islamic scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani, a former judge of the Federal Shariat Court, against immunity for anyone. “In our Constitution, previously, the president was granted protection during their tenure, which was against Islam. Now, granting anyone such protection for life is completely against the spirit of Sharia and the Constitution, and would be extremely shameful for the country … A heartfelt request to the members of Parliament is that they should not take this sin upon themselves.” Questioned about the senior scholar’s post, Sanaullah instead asked whether such immunity was not already present for the president, or was it being granted for the first time. He said the immunity would end if the president again accepted any public office. He said the president enjoyed immunity in his term of office since 1973 and such was the case for other heads of state around the world as well.",

Now, granting anyone such protection for life is completely against the spirit of Sharia and the Constitution, and would be extremely shameful for the country … A heartfelt request to the members of Parliament is that they should not take this sin upon themselves.” Questioned about the senior scholar’s post, Sanaullah instead asked whether such immunity was not already present for the president, or was it being granted for the first time. He said the immunity would end if the president again accepted any public office. He said the president enjoyed immunity in his term of office since 1973 and such was the case for other heads of state around the world as well.",
      "title": "Sanaullah rubbishes alleged connection between Imran Khan and PM immunity clause",
      "summary": "Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Monday rubbished the notion that the status of incarcerated former premier Imran Khan had any bearing on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s withdrawal of proposed immunity for the top office as part of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Government senators Anusha Rahman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu had tabled a proposal for the 27th Amendment bill to extend the immunity currently enjoyed by the president under Article 248 of the Constitution to include the prime minister. The clause sought to extend presidential immunity to the prime minister, effectively barring criminal proceedings against the premier during the term in office. Article 248 of the Constitution stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office”. However, PM Shehbaz had ordered the clause’s withdrawal on Sunday, saying that the premier must remain “fully accountable”. Separately, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar had said that PM Shehbaz told him earlier that “he had no interest in getting immunity”, owing to the executive nature of his role as the prime minister. Questioned in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’ today about speculation that the clause was withdrawn because it could potentially benefit the PTI founder, Sanaullah said: “No. If we had intended to do this, we could also have done it in a way that the benefit would apply only from today.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. He served as the prime minister from August 2018 till April 2022, when he was ousted through a vote of no-confidence. He said the prime minister made a very “democratic” decision and he should be congratulated for it. The premier’s aide added that the premier’s office was not a constitutional one but an executive and elected office, thus “it should remain answerable to the people”. PM Shehbaz was elected as the 24th premier of Pakistan in the 2024 general elections. Article 95 of the Constitution of Pakistan allows for a prime minister to be impeached via a no-confidence motion. It states: “A resolution for a vote of no-confidence moved by not less than twenty per centum of the total membership of the National Assembly may be passed against the Prime Minister by the National Assembly.” Issue of immunity Discussion also veered towards a post on X by renowned Islamic scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani, a former judge of the Federal Shariat Court, against immunity for anyone. “In our Constitution, previously, the president was granted protection during their tenure, which was against Islam.

      "summary_orig": "The government is set to table the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment in tomorrow’s National Assembly session after it sailed through the Senate kn Monday. A notification from the NA Secretariat for the orders of the day for Tuesday’s session said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar would table the bill. Today’s NA session was adjourned after being marred by ruckus from the treasury and opposition benches during speeches from each side. PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf was disrupted by shouting from the opposition benches as he began to speak in the NA. Speaking on the immunity for the president, he said this was standard practice in many countries for the head of state. Ashraf assailed the opposition, asking who was it to criticise the treasury benches when its ranks were filled with those who had violated the Constitution. As he continued to speak, PTI lawmakers chanted slogans of “Go Zardari go” and “Long live Imran Khan” while terming the former prime minister as “Raja rental”. The former premier said the opposition was only content when it was raising a hue and cry in the house, adding that treasury benches would react in a similar manner to any speaker from the other side. Taking the floor after the PPP leader, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the need for haste in the matter and said all stakeholders were not consulted and taken on board. Meanwhile, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi paid tribute to the army chief for “the respect God has granted us with in the world because of him and our martyrs”. The minister said Pakistan would fight every terrorist till they abandon militancy, whether they were in Pakistan, Afghanistan, or any other corner of the world. Earlier today, the government and its coalition partners secured a two-thirds majority in the Senate vote for the bill following the defection of two opposition members. The bill, which had stirred controversy in the country for weeks, was presented in the Senate by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani presided over the proceedings. Before the passage of the bill, opposition benches erupted in protest, chanting slogans against the government and its coalition partners. Lawmakers tore up copies of the bill and hurled them toward the Tarar’s table as he began to present it. Most opposition members then staged a walkout, while a few stayed briefly to continue sloganeering before exiting the chamber — paving the way for the smooth passage of the bill. A joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees — boycotted by the opposition — approved the 27th Constitutional Amendment bill with minor changes. Senate Standing Committee of Law and Justice Chairman Farooq H. Naek presented a report on those before the Upper House. Approval by parliamentary committees The bill, which was tabled by Tarar in the Senate on Saturday amid outcry from the opposition and hours after getting the federal cabinet’s nod, aims to set up a federal constitutional court and grant lifetime status to the field marshal rank. On Sunday, a joint meeting of the Senate and the National Assembly’s law and justice standing committees had app­roved the 27th Consti­tutional Amendment bill with minor changes amid a boycott by the opposition. Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, who also attended the meeting, said all key amendments, including changes to Article 243, which provides that the federal government “shall have control and command of the armed forces” and pertains to the military command structure, were amicably approved by both committees. Senator Naek, who was presiding over the meeting, said the bill was adopted with minor changes. He said that the committees empowered him and the law minister to make a couple of amendments. The committees, however, deferred the Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s (MQM) proposal, seeking to amend Article 140 that pertains to local governments, as well as the Awami National Party’s (ANP) recommendation for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The ANP had submitted a proposal to rename the province by removing ‘Khyber’, arguing that Khyber was a district and other provinces did not include district names in their titles. Likewise, the Balochistan National Party’s proposed amendment to increase the province’s seats in Parliament was also deferred. Earlier in the day, ANP’s Hidayatullah Khan told reporters that the committee had sought time until Monday to decide on his party’s suggestion for changing the name of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Meanwhile, the law minister told reporters it was dec­ided that provinces would be taken into confidence on changing KP’s name.",

      "title_orig": "‘Radical restructuring’: Justice Shah, retired judges, top lawyers urge CJP to summon full court on 27th Amendment",
      "summary_orig": "As the government made moves toward the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment , present and former judges and top lawyers on Monday urged Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi to summon a full court meeting to discuss the proposed legislation. The request came in a letter, dated November 9 and a copy of which is available with Dawn , that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi. It was also signed and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers. The letter said that the missive was being written “not in normal times but in times that presented the greatest threat to the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its establishment in 1956”. It termed the 27th Amendment Act as the “biggest and the most radical restructuring of the Federal Appellate Court structure since the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935”. “We say this without any fear of contradiction that no civilian or military government in Pakistan’s history has even tried, let alone succeeded, in relegating the Supreme Court of Pakistan as a subordinate court and permanently denude it of its constitutional jurisdiction, as is being done through the proposed Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025,” the lawyers and judges said in the letter. “If your Lordship is in agreement with us that this proposed amendment act is the biggest and most radical restructuring of the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its inception, then we would most respectfully request, and fully expect your Lordship, to call a full court meeting to discuss this proposed Amendment Act and to give an appropriate response to the federal government in the form of inputs and suggestions regarding this proposed amendment act,” they added. “We would respectfully not like to explain to your Lordship that the Supreme Court has every right and power to give its input to the federal government on any proposed amendment act,” the legal experts said, adding that the legislation proposes “radical restructuring” of SC’s basic essence, structure and its constitutional obligation to administer justice for all. The letter reiterated the call for an immediate full court meeting, noting that the Amendment was expected to be passed by November 11 (today) “or any day thereafter”. The lawyers and judges went on to add that in case this request was declined on the “pretext of neutrality or noninterference with legislation (which we consider to be reasons without any substance), then we would at\nleast expect you to accept and admit in a written response to us that you are now reconciled to be the last chief justice of Pakistan and now reconciled to accept the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan as the highest court in Pakistan”. “At least by this admission by you, we would no longer have any kind of expectation from your Lordship to be a defender of the Supreme Court,” they said. The letter requested that, as this was a matter of “utmost public importance”, a copy of the missive be released to the media. Besides Siddiqui and retired judges Alam and Akhtar, the letter was also endorsed by former attorney generals for Pakistan (AGP) Muneer A. Malik, Anwar Mansoor Khan; ex-presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Abid Shahid Zuberi, Ali Ahmad Kurd, Muhammad Akram Sheikh and Kanrani B. Amanullah; and SC advocates Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, Salahuddin Ahmed and Shabnam Nawaz Awan. Zuberi , Sheikh and Salahuddin are among the petitioners who have challenged the 26th Amendment, which had also faced great opposition from the legal fraternity at the time of its passage in October 2024. Kurd and other lawyers had vowed to launch a protest movement to reject that Amendment and “restore the judiciary’s independence”. Malik and Hosain had last month presented their arguments in the 26th Amendment case as counsels for the Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA) and veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak , respectively. Justice Shah’s letter to CJP Afridi Separately, Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah urged CJP Afridi to hold urgent institutional consultation regarding the 27th Amendment in a letter dated Nov 8. He urged the chief justice to engage with the executive and make it clear that no amendment affecting the judiciary would proceed without consulting judges of the constitutional courts. He also asked CJP Afridi to convene a full court meeting on the matter. Proposed judicial restructuring Shortly after its approval by the federal cabinet, the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate on Saturday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes. The Senate has convened for the third consecutive day today and is likely to greenlight the legislation, after which it will land in the National Assembly. Among the various changes proposed in the Amendment, many pertain to the judiciary, with the most notable being the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). The FCC will deal with constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the Supreme Court itself, which has led to many experts believing that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the SC as the country’s highest judicial forum. View this post on Instagram At the heart of the amendment is the creation of a new apex court, the FCC, building upon the constitutional benches formed under the 26th Amendment, which remains challenged before the SC. Even before the 27th Amendment gets the parliament’s nod, the government has already begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the FCC. Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the SC’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC. The names of Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Mus­arrat Hilali, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi from SC, along with SHC’s Justice K.K. Agha and Balochistan High Court’s Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, are also being discussed for inclusion in the FCC’s initial composition. Sources said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require an Act of Parliament. Inserted into the Constitution as Chapter 1A, the FCC would have its own chief justice — serving a fixed three-year term — and judges, who may be appointed from the SC, senior high court judges with at least seven years of experience, or very senior advocates with over two decades in practice. FCC judges would retire at the age of 68. The retirement age for SC judges currently is 65 as per Article 179 of the Constitution. The amendment further stipulates that the president may transfer a high court judge from one high court to another on the recommendation of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP). A judge of a high court who does not accept a transfer under this Article shall be deemed to have retired from his office. The FCC would assume some of the SC’s most significant powers. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil and criminal appeals only, while FCC decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself. The FCC would also hold exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between the Federation and provinces, or among provinces, and could, on its own motion, take up any case involving a “substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution“. Moreover, the FCC would take over the SC’s authority on cases concerning the enforcement of fundamental rights, appeals from high courts on constitutional matters, writ petitions under Article 199 (except family and rent cases), and even the president’s power to seek advisory opinions from the apex court.

      "summary_en": "As the government made moves toward the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment , present and former judges and top lawyers on Monday urged Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi to summon a full court meeting to discuss the proposed legislation. The request came in a letter, dated November 9 and a copy of which is available with Dawn , that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi. It was also signed and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers. The letter said that the missive was being written “not in normal times but in times that presented the greatest threat to the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its establishment in 1956”. It termed the 27th Amendment Act as the “biggest and the most radical restructuring of the Federal Appellate Court structure since the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935”. “We say this without any fear of contradiction that no civilian or military government in Pakistan’s history has even tried, let alone succeeded, in relegating the Supreme Court of Pakistan as a subordinate court and permanently denude it of its constitutional jurisdiction, as is being done through the proposed Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025,” the lawyers and judges said in the letter. “If your Lordship is in agreement with us that this proposed amendment act is the biggest and most radical restructuring of the Supreme Court of Pakistan since its inception, then we would most respectfully request, and fully expect your Lordship, to call a full court meeting to discuss this proposed Amendment Act and to give an appropriate response to the federal government in the form of inputs and suggestions regarding this proposed amendment act,” they added. “We would respectfully not like to explain to your Lordship that the Supreme Court has every right and power to give its input to the federal government on any proposed amendment act,” the legal experts said, adding that the legislation proposes “radical restructuring” of SC’s basic essence, structure and its constitutional obligation to administer justice for all. The letter reiterated the call for an immediate full court meeting, noting that the Amendment was expected to be passed by November 11 (today) “or any day thereafter”. The lawyers and judges went on to add that in case this request was declined on the “pretext of neutrality or noninterference with legislation (which we consider to be reasons without any substance), then we would at\nleast expect you to accept and admit in a written response to us that you are now reconciled to be the last chief justice of Pakistan and now reconciled to accept the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan as the highest court in Pakistan”. “At least by this admission by you, we would no longer have any kind of expectation from your Lordship to be a defender of the Supreme Court,” they said. The letter requested that, as this was a matter of “utmost public importance”, a copy of the missive be released to the media. Besides Siddiqui and retired judges Alam and Akhtar, the letter was also endorsed by former attorney generals for Pakistan (AGP) Muneer A. Malik, Anwar Mansoor Khan; ex-presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) Abid Shahid Zuberi, Ali Ahmad Kurd, Muhammad Akram Sheikh and Kanrani B. Amanullah; and SC advocates Khwaja Ahmad Hosain, Salahuddin Ahmed and Shabnam Nawaz Awan. Zuberi , Sheikh and Salahuddin are among the petitioners who have challenged the 26th Amendment, which had also faced great opposition from the legal fraternity at the time of its passage in October 2024. Kurd and other lawyers had vowed to launch a protest movement to reject that Amendment and “restore the judiciary’s independence”. Malik and Hosain had last month presented their arguments in the 26th Amendment case as counsels for the Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA) and veteran politician Afrasiab Khattak , respectively. Justice Shah’s letter to CJP Afridi Separately, Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah urged CJP Afridi to hold urgent institutional consultation regarding the 27th Amendment in a letter dated Nov 8. He urged the chief justice to engage with the executive and make it clear that no amendment affecting the judiciary would proceed without consulting judges of the constitutional courts. He also asked CJP Afridi to convene a full court meeting on the matter. Proposed judicial restructuring Shortly after its approval by the federal cabinet, the Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 was tabled in the Senate on Saturday amid the opposition’s outcry over the pace and scope of the proposed changes. The Senate has convened for the third consecutive day today and is likely to greenlight the legislation, after which it will land in the National Assembly. Among the various changes proposed in the Amendment, many pertain to the judiciary, with the most notable being the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC). The FCC will deal with constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the Supreme Court itself, which has led to many experts believing that the tw­­eaks would, in effect, dethrone the SC as the country’s highest judicial forum. View this post on Instagram At the heart of the amendment is the creation of a new apex court, the FCC, building upon the constitutional benches formed under the 26th Amendment, which remains challenged before the SC. Even before the 27th Amendment gets the parliament’s nod, the government has already begun restructuring the superior judiciary, shortlisting seven judges for appointment to the FCC. Justice Amin­uddin Khan, who presently heads the SC’s Constitutional Bench, is being considered for appointment as the chief justice of the FCC. The names of Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Mus­arrat Hilali, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi from SC, along with SHC’s Justice K.K.

      "summary_orig": "At least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday. The ISPR said the KP intelligence-based operations (IBO) were conducted between November 8-9. During an intelligence-based operation in the general area of Shawal in North Waziristan, eight terrorists were killed by the security forces. “During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location, eight Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” said the military’s media wing. In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij , mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. In the second IBO conducted in the Dara Adam Khel district of the province, 12 terrorists were killed after “an intense fire exchange”. The military’s media wing added that sanitisation operations were being conducted in the areas to “eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”. It added that under Operation Azm-i-Istehkam, approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan, the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan “will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. In a later post on X, the ISPR said security forces conducted an IBO in Kalat district on the night of Nov 1 on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna al-Hindustan ”. The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and resultantly, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell.” The ISPR said weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities. It added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any other “Indian sponsored terrorist” found in the area. In June last year, the federal government approved a reinvigorated and re-energised national counter-terrorism campaign, Operation Azm-i-Istehkam . On Oct 16, security for­ces killed 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP over the course of three days, the military’s media wing said. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities in the past year, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday assailed claims that national carrier Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA), flight operations and safety measures were not meeting international standards. On November 3, PIA’s flight operations were disrupted across the country after the engineers’ group refused to issue clearances to aircraft, claiming that they could not compromise on travel safety. The defence minister, whose portfolio includes aviation, wrote in an X post that any “propaganda targeting PIA, its flights’ safety and its operations is totally baseless”. “Safety is non-negotiable, but unqualified people cannot dictate it in the presence of Pakistani and international regulators,” he wrote. “PIA flight [operations] are strictly adhered to PCAA/international safety standards.” Asif said he fully backed the flag carrier’s efforts to “return to profitability and expand its network”, adding that PIA generated a per-day average of Rs600 million in revenue over the past three days, which he claimed was generated through a “regular domestic/international schedule without disruption”. “By spreading malicious news, they are trying to harm national interests and sabotage it,” he said, referring to those making the claims. “We have worked tirelessly over [the] last five years to revive PIA.” “PIA is now continuing to fly domestically as per schedule and covering coveted international destinations such as Toronto, Manchester, Paris, [Saudi Arabia], China and [the] Far East as per schedule. In future, more routes to Europe and North America shall also be operated,” he added. For nearly a year, engineers working at Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), represented by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP), have been raising their voices over what they describe as unfair treatment and safety concerns within the airline. Recently, however, the matter has escalated, turning into a protest, resulting in the delay of flights and leading to the suspension of a few SAEP officials. Last Monday, the aircraft engineers refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, because of which hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia. According to SAEP representatives, the protest was carried out over two primary issues: salary disparities as well as safety and the unavailability of spare parts. SAEP members claim that while pilots receive salary hikes, engineers’ pay remains stagnant. Moreover, the engineers claim they are often told to reuse old aircraft parts instead of being provided with new ones, a practice they say could compromise passenger safety.",

      "summary_orig": "Indian police detained dozens of people during a rare protest at the famed India Gate monument in New Delhi, who were demanding action to curb an annual scourge of toxic air swathing the capital and its surrounding region. Sunday’s protest by crowds of all ages holding banners and chanting slogans before police bundled them away was a scarce event, even though Delhi and the national capital region have battled such fumes every winter for years. “We have only one problem, and that is of clean air,” said Neha, a mask-wearing protester, who gave only one name. “This problem has been going on for many years, but no action is being taken,” she told news agency ANI , in which Reuters has a minority stake. Visuals from the agency showed police dragging protesters, some holding banners that read, “Breathing is killing us,” while others chanted slogans such as “Our right, clear air” into waiting buses before they were driven away. The city’s air quality index of 345 on Monday ranked as “very poor”, compared to ratings of “good” in the category from zero to 50, and “severe” in the range from 401 to 500, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. Police had called for the spot to be vacated as it was not a designated protest site, they told reporters earlier, while opposition leaders criticised the removal of the protesters. “The right to clean air is a basic human right,” Rahul Gandhi, leader of the Congress party that has ruled India for much of its history as an independent nation, said on X. “The right to peaceful protest is guaranteed by our constitution. Why are citizens … peacefully demanding clean air being treated like criminals?” The Delhi government was taking steps to prevent pollution, said its environment minister, Manjinder Singh Sirsa. “We will continue every possible effort to rid us of pollution,” he said in a statement from BJP Delhi on X. “This is the resolve of our government.” The state government is formed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. Winter shrouds the region in a thick haze as cold, heavy air traps construction dust, vehicular emissions, and smoke, bringing respiratory illnesses for many. Authorities’ cloud seeding efforts last month to trigger artificial rain and cut pollution levels failed to produce any rainfall.",

In a statement, a PIA spokesperson also disputed claims about aircraft safety put forward by the Society of Aircraft Eng­ineers of Pakistan (SAEP), which had maintained that its personnel could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “The body responsible for air safety in Pakistan is the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA), which regulates all airlines, including PIA, under the strictest international stan­dards and procedures. All matters concerning the use and replacement of parts, the fitness of aircraft for flight, and the routes, sche­dules, or changes thereto are under the direct purview of the PCAA and are executed only after seeking their approvals,” the spokesperson said. Referring to images of damage to an aircraft win­dscreen that circulated on the media, the spokesperson said that the use of steel tape for curing (drying) sealant after winds­creen repair was a routine matter. But, he maintained, an impression was wrongly created that “flights were being operated with a windscreen held together by tape”. The spokesperson also claimed that the PIA management had not taken administrative or retaliatory action against any engineer, adding that the dismissal of the body’s “self-styled” president and general secretary was the result of administrative proceedings ongoing for the past four months. However, the dismissal letter issued to both men last week stated they had been issued notices for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media. The two men were subsequently fired after they failed to appear before an enquiry committee. Published in Dawn, November 10th, 2025",
