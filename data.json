According to presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung, the leaders of seven major religious communities including Buddhism, Protestantism and Catholicism expressed their concerns on “the serious harms caused by illegitimate, heretical religious organizations including the Unification Church and Shincheonji,” during the meeting. “Such practices, including collusion between politics and religion, cause serious harm to people’s lives, and must be dealt with strictly,” the leaders were quoted as saying. Kang said the religious leaders urged the president that the public would support disbanding religious groups that harm the people and the country, and called for their assets to be used to compensate their victims.

The hearing took place at the Seoul Central District Court behind closed doors, with Yoon, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun and Yeo In-hyung, former head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command, in attendance. Yoon and the two others have been indicted on charges of aiding the enemy in connection to the alleged drone dispatch to North Korea's capital in October 2024. Special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team believes the alleged dispatch was aimed at inciting the North's retaliation, which could then be used as a pretext for Yoon's martial law declaration two months later. The team charged Yoon with \"benefiting the enemy in general,\" based on its judgment that the drone dispatch led to the leak of military secrets to the North when they allegedly crashed near Pyongyang. The court's bench said it would decide every session whether to proceed with the trial behind closed doors, citing state secrets",

      "summary_orig": "The government on Monday took strong exception to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi saying the state should provide evidence of Kabul’s soil being used against Pakistan. In a media interaction at the home of PTI leader Alamgir Khan on Sunday night, Afridi said that the state should give evidence for the claim that Afghanistan’s soil was being used for terrorism in Pakistan. He said that other countries also shared a border with Afghanistan but they did not have the same complaints. The clip was also shared by state broadcaster PTV on the social media platform X. In a post on X, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Afridi was speaking as Afghanistan’s “spokesperson“ which was highly “condemnable and shameful”. “The whole world has seen evidence of the Afghan Taliban regime’s support for terrorists, and there is also irrefutable evidence that Afghanistan’s soil is being used for terrorist activities,” Tarar said. “Sohail Afridi has reached the peak of lies and hypocrisy. The Pakistani nation has made immense sacrifices while fighting terrorists,“ he said. He added that whenever the party opened its mouth, they always facilitated terrorists. “Pakistan’s development is unacceptable to Fitna al Khawarij which is why Pakistan is targeted,” he said. The minister concluded that Afridi needed to “come to his senses”. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry said that it had been the PTI’s “consistent policy” to create “uncertainty” on national issues, adding that they also refrained from calling perpetrators of terrorism terrorists. “They are always reluctant to call terrorists terrorists and say things that spread doubt amongst the common man,“ he said. He also held neighbouring countries responsible for terrorism, saying that one was “investing” while the second was “implementing”. He took strong exception to Afridi’s remarks, saying: “The KP CM, once again, said in Karachi that we should provide the Afghan government with evidence of terrorist activities. “Do you still not know who’s behind terrorism?“ he asked. He said that at least two dozen countries had pointed out that Afghanistan’s soil was being used for terrorism. “They intentionally spread doubt. They do not want military operations. They do not want to expel illegal Afghans and want to negotiate instead of taking action,“ he said. “There must be a reason for this soft attitude,” Tallal said. “They have something in common, and I’ll say it on record: there has not been even a single attack on any PTI leader, worker, adviser, minister in the past 11 years,“ he alleged, criticising the party for ”spreading doubt“. “You create ambiguity in the minds of common people, so the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other groups may operate in KP and also get the sympathies of the common man,” the state minister added. Speaking about the PTI’s street movement, the state minister questioned whether party leaders had taken the time to meet with the families of martyrs. “You stand against the national narrative because you are a beneficiary,” Tallal said. Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal termed Afridi’s remarks “upsetting” and stated that KP witnessed the most terrorist incidents in the country. “As far as proof is concerned … when we had dialogue with them (Afghan Taliban) in Doha and Istanbul, Afghanistan did not deny that their soil is being used for cross-border terrorism, but they denied that they have control over it,” he said in a video statement posted to X. “Our demand was for them to take control of the situation.” The minister questioned whether the KP CM was acknowledging the sacrifices of security forces and civilians and noted that major terrorist attacks, including the bombing outside an Islamabad district court, were linked to Afghanistan. “If you mistakenly became the chief minister of a province facing such challenges, then please stop giving such upsetting and shameful statements,” Chaudhry said. “Your statement today is like rubbing salt in the wounds of the families of martyrs and slain civilians,” he added. The minister then noted that Pakistan had provided evidence and footage on the international stage, which showed terrorists crossing over from Afghanistan. “Pakistan remains a friendly nation to Afghanistan, but no country forms relations based on internal security,” he said. “We have served the Afghans for 40 years, housing 4 million Afghan refugees as our guests and brothers. There is still a large number of them here.” “However, Pakistan’s security and the safety of the people are our responsibility and we will fulfil it in any circumstance. Afghanistan also wants the Afghan Taliban regime to ensure that no terrorist group can use its soil to attack Pakistan in these cowardly acts,” Chaudhry added. “If they continue to attack, we will deal with them and send a message to Afghanistan telling them to stop engaging in this game.”",

In a post on X, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Afridi was speaking as Afghanistan’s “spokesperson“ which was highly “condemnable and shameful”. “The whole world has seen evidence of the Afghan Taliban regime’s support for terrorists, and there is also irrefutable evidence that Afghanistan’s soil is being used for terrorist activities,” Tarar said. “Sohail Afridi has reached the peak of lies and hypocrisy. The Pakistani nation has made immense sacrifices while fighting terrorists,“ he said. He added that whenever the party opened its mouth, they always facilitated terrorists. “Pakistan’s development is unacceptable to Fitna al Khawarij which is why Pakistan is targeted,” he said. The minister concluded that Afridi needed to “come to his senses”. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry said that it had been the PTI’s “consistent policy” to create “uncertainty” on national issues, adding that they also refrained from calling perpetrators of terrorism terrorists. “They are always reluctant to call terrorists terrorists and say things that spread doubt amongst the common man,“ he said. He also held neighbouring countries responsible for terrorism, saying that one was “investing” while the second was “implementing”. He took strong exception to Afridi’s remarks, saying: “The KP CM, once again, said in Karachi that we should provide the Afghan government with evidence of terrorist activities. “Do you still not know who’s behind terrorism?“ he asked. He said that at least two dozen countries had pointed out that Afghanistan’s soil was being used for terrorism. “They intentionally spread doubt. They do not want military operations. They do not want to expel illegal Afghans and want to negotiate instead of taking action,“ he said. “There must be a reason for this soft attitude,” Tallal said. “They have something in common, and I’ll say it on record: there has not been even a single attack on any PTI leader, worker, adviser, minister in the past 11 years,“ he alleged, criticising the party for ”spreading doubt“. “You create ambiguity in the minds of common people, so the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other groups may operate in KP and also get the sympathies of the common man,” the state minister added. Speaking about the PTI’s street movement, the state minister questioned whether party leaders had taken the time to meet with the families of martyrs. “You stand against the national narrative because you are a beneficiary,” Tallal said. Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal termed Afridi’s remarks “upsetting” and stated that KP witnessed the most terrorist incidents in the country. “As far as proof is concerned … when we had dialogue with them (Afghan Taliban) in Doha and Istanbul, Afghanistan did not deny that their soil is being used for cross-border terrorism, but they denied that they have control over it,” he said in a video statement posted to X. “Our demand was for them to take control of the situation.” The minister questioned whether the KP CM was acknowledging the sacrifices of security forces and civilians and noted that major terrorist attacks, including the bombing outside an Islamabad district court, were linked to Afghanistan. “If you mistakenly became the chief minister of a province facing such challenges, then please stop giving such upsetting and shameful statements,” Chaudhry said. “Your statement today is like rubbing salt in the wounds of the families of martyrs and slain civilians,” he added. The minister then noted that Pakistan had provided evidence and footage on the international stage, which showed terrorists crossing over from Afghanistan. “Pakistan remains a friendly nation to Afghanistan, but no country forms relations based on internal security,” he said. “We have served the Afghans for 40 years, housing 4 million Afghan refugees as our guests and brothers. There is still a large number of them here.” “However, Pakistan’s security and the safety of the people are our responsibility and we will fulfil it in any circumstance. Afghanistan also wants the Afghan Taliban regime to ensure that no terrorist group can use its soil to attack Pakistan in these cowardly acts,” Chaudhry added. “If they continue to attack, we will deal with them and send a message to Afghanistan telling them to stop engaging in this game.”",

      "summary_orig": "National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Monday sought proposals for the nomination of the opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament. The seat has been vacant since August 7 , following the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). While the opposition has accused the government of delaying the appo­intment despite them putting forward Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s name for the role, Sadiq has maintained that the delay was because the matter was sub judice. At the outset of Monday’s session, Sadiq reiterated his stance that he could not initiate the nomination process earlier as the matter was subjudice and the NA Secretariat had been made a party in the case. He said that after PTI’s Omar Ayub, the previous NA opposition leader, withdrew his petitions in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal, the nomination process could now be formally initiated. “This issue had to head towards resolution only then. We would have done so if we had not been made a party [to the case],” Sadiq said. Addressing the opposition benches, he said the proposals for nominating the opposition leader may be submitted in his chambers by 3pm tomorrow, as per Rule 39(ii) of the Rules of Procedures and Conduct of Business in the NA 2007. Sadiq stated that the nominations should be accompanied by the signatures of opposition members. The count will be made at 3pm on January 14, according to Rule 39(iii) of the NA rules, the speaker announced. The MNA having the greatest numerical strength after the signature of the members shall be declared as the opposition leader. Rule 39 confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it. However, the opposition had already submitted the name of Achakzai — who heads the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — to the speaker’s office rather than presenting it to the speaker personally. Speaking in the NA, Sadiq recalled that he had informed PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and opposition chief whip Malik Amir Dogar that the matter was sub judice when they had called on him in November 2025. He highlighted that he had written letters to the opposition on Nov 19, Dec 5 , Dec 19 and Dec 29 to “confirm the status”, following which Dogar submitted the required documents. Responding to him on the assembly floor, Dogar said he had submitted an application with the signatures of 76 opposition MNAs keeping in view Rule 39. “We are unanimously willing to provide verification however you want,” he said, reiterating that Achakzai was their choice as per PTI founder Imran Khan’s decision . Dogar assured the speaker that the opposition will fulfil the required process tomorrow, and requested him to formally notify the opposition leader immediately. PPP stages walkout over ‘ordinance’ issue Meanwhile, the ruling PML-N faced an embarrassment on the opening day of the new NA session when its key ally, the PPP, staged a walkout to register its protest over the alleged government move to issue an ordinance without President Asif Ali Zardari’s assent. The issue was raised by PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar while speaking on a point of order. “For the first time in Pakistan’s black legislative history, an ordinance has been promulgated with the approval or the signature of the president, which is shameful, against the Constitution,” he alleged, without specifying the said ordinance. The PPP leader said that they had not seen such a practice even during military dictatorships. The NA speaker gave the floor to Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to explain, but Qamar refused to hear it and led the walkout by his party members. Tarar requested the PPP lawmakers to return to the assembly, but to no avail. He explained that an ordinance was issued on advice and “there is no doubt that the president has to assent it [sic] ”. “We don’t say that we are going to pass an ordinance which has not been assented by the president. […] There is something circulating on social media,” Tarar said, adding that he would take up the issue with his ministry and would then inform the house. The law minister affirmed that the government had always respected the president. He noted that “nine or 10 bills and ordinances” were pending presidential assent, and the ministry came to know only on Sunday that President Zardari had given his assent to those bills. “Maybe it is a part of that or not a part of that,” Tarar added. He further highlighted that even though bills passed in a joint sitting were deemed to have been assented after 10 days without the president’s assent, the government had not applied that provision to certain legislation that had been pending approval for about a month. While Sadiq requested the law minister to go and bring back the PPP lawmakers to the assembly, PPP MNA Hussain Tariq returned to the house only to point out the lack of quorum. After a headcount, the NA speaker suspended the proceedings due to a lack of quorum. Subsequently, the session was adjourned till 11am on Tuesday, according to the NA’s official X account.",

      "summary_orig": "The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has rejected claims circulating on social media alleging that Pakistan is being used as a base or launch corridor to support the United States for a possible military strike on Iran, which has been rocked by protests in recent weeks. The ministry’s fact check account on X attributed the claims to “propaganda machineries in Afghanistan“ and Indian accounts, particularly identifying three handles — Khurasan Media Urdu , Baba Banaras and Afghan Defense . Among them, a post by Khurasan Media Urdu claimed that “special American aircraft have reached Pakistan for an attack on Iran”. The post also mentioned “unusual” flight activity of US aerial refuelling and surveillance aircraft between Pakistan and Iran. A post by Afghan Defense repeated the claim. Baba Banaras’ post made a similar claim, stating: “Multiple US reconnaissance aircraft and cargo planes with weapons landed at Dalbandin Airbase and Pasni Airbase of Pakistan. Looks like the game has been set for Iran.” The ministry’s fact check account said false claims had been made “that the US has moved aerial refuelling (KC-135R) and surveillance aircraft to Pakistan, that these aircraft are conducting unusual flights towards or into Iranian airspace, and that Pakistan is being used as a base or launch corridor to support US stealth fighters (F-35/F-22) for a possible imminent military strike on Iran”. The post added that while it was true that the activity of US aerial refuelling aircraft had increased, it was not from Pakistan. “ Reuters reported the US moved a large number of refuelling aircraft to Europe as Middle East tensions rose,” the ministry clarified, referring to a June 2025 report. It also referred to a June 2025 report by The Washington Post , which it said mentioned Pentagon dispatching “refuelling aircraft to European bases as posture expanded”. The ministry’s post further stated: “No credible outlet confirms that US KC-135R/ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) aircraft are operating in Pakistan.” It reiterated that “US refuelling aircraft movements have been reported, but mostly linked to Europe”. “No credible proof that US aircraft/ISR are based in Pakistan. No credible proof of Pakistan-to-Iran operational flights for strikes,” it added. It recalled that Pakistan had “publicly condemned US strikes on Iran” — ostensibly a reference to Islamabad’s stance during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, during which the US also carried strikes in Iran. “This clearly denied the ‘Pakistan is facilitating strikes’ story,” the information ministry said. “This is a reckless, blame-pushing narrative that tries to drag Pakistan into a US-Iran conflict without any verifiable evidence.” It said that the claim that “US aircraft arrived in Pakistan for Iran strikes’ is purely disinformation”. The claims have surfaced as tensions are growing between Iran and the US, with US President Donald Trump warning Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on ongoing protests in the Middle Eastern country. Iran subsequently issued stern statements in response. On Sunday, the Iranian government — which blames Washington and Tel Aviv for fomenting the unrest — warned the US of retaliation against its military bases and Israel if the Trump administration attacked the country over a crackdown on protesters. The same day, Trump said he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to action against the protests . He also said, “The leaders of Iran called [yesterday], … a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.” A subsequent statement by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“. “We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he added.",

It recalled that Pakistan had “publicly condemned US strikes on Iran” — ostensibly a reference to Islamabad’s stance during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, during which the US also carried strikes in Iran. “This clearly denied the ‘Pakistan is facilitating strikes’ story,” the information ministry said. “This is a reckless, blame-pushing narrative that tries to drag Pakistan into a US-Iran conflict without any verifiable evidence.” It said that the claim that “US aircraft arrived in Pakistan for Iran strikes’ is purely disinformation”. The claims have surfaced as tensions are growing between Iran and the US, with US President Donald Trump warning Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on ongoing protests in the Middle Eastern country. Iran subsequently issued stern statements in response. On Sunday, the Iranian government — which blames Washington and Tel Aviv for fomenting the unrest — warned the US of retaliation against its military bases and Israel if the Trump administration attacked the country over a crackdown on protesters. The same day, Trump said he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to action against the protests . He also said, “The leaders of Iran called [yesterday], … a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.” A subsequent statement by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“. “We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he added.",

      "summary_orig": "Referencing ‘teaching or discussion’ could give exemption from legislation Labor hopes to pass next week Get our breaking news email , free app or daily news podcast People accused of breaching the Albanese government’s new hate speech laws could argue their conduct was legal because they were quoting from a religious text, draft legislation shows. Extracts of the draft bill obtained by Guardian Australia show it will be illegal to publicly promote or incite hatred, or disseminate ideas of superiority or hatred towards of another person or group of people based on their race, colour, or national or ethnic origin. But within the draft bill is a proposed legal defence to the rule that states the legislation does not apply to an individual directly quoting a religious text. “[The offence] not apply to conduct that consists only of directly quoting from, or otherwise referencing, a religious text for the purpose of religious teaching or discussion,” the draft states. The government promised to tackle antisemitism, crack down on so-called “hate preachers” and hate speech following the alleged Bondi terror attack in December. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, is expected to have more to say about the plans early on Tuesday morning. Albanese on Monday confirmed parliament would sit for two days on 19 and 20 January to rush through the new laws. Parliament had been due to return for the year on 3 February. The sitting will include condolence motions for the 15 people killed at Bondi last month. The new laws will create serious offences for hate preachers, increase penalties for hate crimes, create a new racial vilification offence, introduce a new listing for prohibited hate groups, at a lower threshold than the terror group listing, as well as introduce provisions to establish the biggest gun buyback program since the Port Arthur massacre. The legislation will also ensure offenders driven by extremism will have that motivation factored into their sentencing, strengthen existing bans on prohibited symbols, and create a new offence for inciting hatred in order to intimidate or harass. The home affairs minister will have new powers to cancel or refuse visas. Crossbenchers are due to be briefed on the legislation on Tuesday. Some privately expressed concerns the major parties would use the secretive intelligence and security committee to limit genuine consultation on the plan. Labor and the Coalition shut out crossbench and independent members from serving on the committee. The attorney general, Michelle Rowland, said the laws would be “the toughest hate laws Australia has ever seen”. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "Iran is fully prepared for conflict but also ready for negotiations, its foreign minister said on Monday, as US President Donald Trump said the Iranian leadership was seeking talks after he threatened to intervene militarily over a crackdown on protests and that he was weighing a range of strong responses. The escalating protests in Iran, which began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, now pose one of the biggest challenges to the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Trump has warned Iran’s leaders that the United States would attack if security forces open fire on protesters, while Iranian authorities have accused the US and Israel of fomenting unrest. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Trump said the US may meet Iranian officials and was in contact with the opposition, as he weighed a range of strong responses, including military options, to the protests . He said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the US bombed in a 12-day war in June. “The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.” However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“. Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a US official told Reuters on Sunday. The Wall Street Journal has reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources. “The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options,” Trump told reporters. Following his statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on Monday that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“. “We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he said. Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf earlier warned Washington against “a miscalculation.” “Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards. Iran expresses deep concern over ‘increasing foreign interference’ Iran expressed deep concern regarding “increasing foreign interference in the country’s internal affairs and recent protests“, referring to the statements and remarks issued by Israel and the US. According to a statement issued by the Iranian Embassy in Islamabad on X, Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu made “blatantly interventionist statements regarding Iran’s internal developments and has portrayed himself as sympathetic to the Iranian people”. “Such claims are profoundly deceptive, particularly considering the aggressive actions of this regime against Iran, which have resulted in the killing of more than 1,100 Iranian citizens.” It further said Israel “seeks to exploit every opportunity to sow division within Iranian society and undermine national cohesion.” It termed the statements by Israel and “certain hardline American officials amount to incitement to violence, terrorism and criminal acts”. The statement also strongly condemned the “interventionist statements” made by the US president and other American officials regarding “Iran’s internal affairs”. “Such coercive and unlawful positions constitute a flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of UN Charter and international law, particularly the principle of sovereignty and non-intervention, and effectively amount to encouragement of violence and terrorism against Iranian citizens,” it added. The statement reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to its obligation under “international human rights law regarding respecting and protecting the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly guaranteed under the Constitution,” saying the “government recognised the lawful demands of peaceful protesters and started utilising all available capacities to address the demands”. However, it said, the distinction should be made between peaceful protest and riots or violent acts. As Iran is “fully committed to supporting and protecting the right of its citizens to peaceful and lawful protest, it is equally obliged to prevent threats to public security,“ the statement said. Near paralysis In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis. The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse. There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown. One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy. The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States. State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel. Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests. After three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday. Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”. The Iranian government on Sunday declared three days of national mourning for “martyrs” including members of the security forces killed. President Masoud Pezeshkian also urged Iranians to join a “national resistance march” Monday to denounce the violence. Trump says he will talk to Musk about restoring internet in Iran​ Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days. “He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran. Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday. Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’ The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic. “Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media. Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag. “The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said. In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah. The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations. The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Monday that the Sindh government had not upheld the honour of the ajrak and topi and criticised its treatment of its “guests”. The chief minister is currently on a visit to Karachi, where he staged a rally at the Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday. In an address to the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi on Monday, Afridi thanked all the SHCBA members for their warm welcome and generous hospitality, adding that people from all over Pakistan — including Pashtuns, Kashmiris, Balochis — of every school of thought were present there. In contrast to this welcome from the public, however, he decried the provincial government’s treatment of him and his guests in Karachi, saying that they had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi . “I think every Sindhi will fully condemn this,” he said amid an outcry of support from the crowd. The KP CM also criticised the fact that the constitution and law were being “toyed with,” saying that it was not only damaging institutions but the whole of Pakistan. “On one hand, they are selling our national assets — they auctioned PIA on OLX,” he said, referring to the recent auction of the national airline. “But here they have sold justice.” Afridi added that the general public at least had hope that the judiciary would provide them justice and stand with them. He said that, although three judges in Islamabad had issued an order that he be allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, “the jail superintendent picks up this order and throws it away”. “We are accused of protest politics,” he added. “But our Constitution allows us to do this, so we will do protest politics.” He further claimed that the judiciary was not cooperating with the party, adding that he had called the chief justice repeatedly but received no answer. “We are being put against the wall, so the only way left is for us to protest,” he said. The chief minister affirmed that he would always stand beside those who turned out in support of the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, saying, “We have to fight for our rights ourselves … we will not get freedom on a plate. “If we do not raise our voice, then more pressure will be put on us.” Afridi further said that the passport of one province’s chief minister had been blocked, saying that the people of the province were being discriminated against. However, he added that his leader, Imran, had always supported peaceful struggle. Regarding the economy, the KP CM said that it was facing a very bad situation, with people “fleeing” Pakistan while unemployment had risen to 7.1 per cent. “These people are building their properties abroad,” he said, adding, “These people are bound to answer to us and one day it will definitely happen”. The chief minister told the crowd that he had come to Karachi as his [Imran] leader had directed him to call for a street movement and that he hoped for “full support” from them. Expressing his thanks, he said, “I hope the rule of law will come to Pakistan one day.” ‘No Section 144 can stop us’: Salman Akram Raja Addressing the ceremony, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said, “We talk about the constitution, we talk about the law, this is our job. No section 144 can stop us”. “Today, our rights are being attacked again and again,” said the PTI general secretary. He stressed that the “living Constitution and law” must be restored. Raja also said that Karachi’s vote had been robbed “in an attempt to take away the rights of the people”. The PTI leader said that whenever the Constitution had been attacked, the SHC had been the first to raise its voice. “The Pakistani nation is alive, due to which the chief minister of KP has been elected,” he said. “If the vote is stolen in front of you, if the judiciary is attacked, how can we remain silent? We are an alive and proud people, we have to fight for our rights.” He added, “This country was not made for the elite. This country is a country of farmers, no matter which province they are from“. “We stand like a lead wall against oppression.” SHCBA President Jamali says lawyers will participate ‘fully’ in KP convention President of the High Court Bar Muhammad Haseeb Jamali, addressing the event, called Sindh a land of peace. “Along with peace, this land also belongs to those who have raised their voice against oppression,” he said. The president stressed that the bar would talk about its rights as it was independent and did not belong to any party. He added that every citizen of this country held equal opportunities under the law. Jamali further said that lawyers of the bar had protested the 26th Amendment, the 27th Amendment and the issue of Karoonjhar as they happened. “We are not part of any revenge politics, nor do we support it.” “Hold a convention in KP — we will participate in it fully,” he said. “This Pakistan is dear to all of us. Lawyers built the country; lawyers will save it,” he added. ‘Only want supremacy of Constitution’: Amir Nawaz Warraich Sindh Bar Council Member and head of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) Amir Nawaz Warraich, also addressed the ceremony, welcoming all those present. He said that when any bad time came about, the bar association raised its voice against it. “Whenever there is talk of supremacy of law and putting a curb on the Constitution, we raise our voice,” he said. “We do not support any party but only want the supremacy of the Constitution.” Warraich added that the KBA would continue to protest against the recently passed Constitutional Amendment until the Constitution was restored to its rightful form. Visit to Mazar-i-Quaid Earlier in the day, the KP chief minister paid a visit to Mazar-i-Quaid, where he had also criticised the Sindh government’s treatment of the PTI delegation. Speaking to the media, he called Sindhis a “proud nation” and said that the imposition of “such people” on a proud nation was a cruelty. “Punjab’s false government also did this; Sindh’s false government also did this,” he said. However, he said that the people of Pakistan were respectable and proud, and always treated the guests from any province with respect. “This is not even one per cent of Pakistan that does such actions,” he said. “The remaining 99pc of the Pakistani nation is extremely proud, brave, courageous and hospitable.” Salman Akram Raja also spoke to reporters at the mausoleum, saying that after “three excellent days” in Karachi, they had seen the public’s “love for democracy, for Imran Khan and for human rights” as well as the force of the state, including its refusal to allow them to hold a rally even after gaining permission. “This is all a part of Pakistan,” he said. “We are fighting for a beautiful Pakistan, for the realisation of the Quaid’s dream for Pakistan under Imran Khan’s leadership. “Today, we have come to renew our pledge that we will create that Pakistan.”",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN/LAKKI MARWAT: Six cops were martyred on Monday as police vehicles were targeted in two separate incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank and Lakki Marwat districts. “Six policemen were martyred in the IED blast,” said a statement from the Tank police spokesperson, adding that their armoured personnel carrier (APC) was targeted within the jurisdiction of the Gomal police station. “The blast occurred while the APC was on its way to Tank from the Gomal police station,” the statement added. The martyred included an additional station house officer (SHO), the police spokesperson said. The bodies were taken to the Tank District Headquarters Hospital by Rescue 1122. Police have sealed off the area and a “massive” security operation was underway, state-run APP reported. Separately, another IED blast took place near Darra Tang road in Lakki Marwat, which injured three police personnel, according to APP . According to a police statement, which did not specify the number of the wounded, a SHO and “police personnel were slightly injured and are now out of danger”. “ Fitna al Khwarij targeted the police APC with an IED explosion while they were patrolling near Jabar Khel on Darra Tang Road within the jurisdiction of the Saddar police station. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Subsequently, Lakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan reached the site of the incident and assessed the situation. A search operation was then launched in the area, the police statement said. It quoted DPO Nazir as saying, “These cowardly acts cannot lower our morale. The Lakki Marwat police are responding vigorously to every challenge and are ready to give every possible sacrifice for the public’s protection.” The officer asserted that the police were resolutely tackling Fitna al Khwarij , adding that security has been increased in the area. PM Shehbaz orders probe into Tank attack Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered an “immediate investigation” into the incident and directed that those responsible be brought to justice at the earliest, according to state-run Radio Pakistan . The premier reaffirmed the government’s commitment to completely eradicate terrorism from the country. President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed his deep grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the “terrorist attack”, a statement from his office said. He paid tribute to the cops’ “bravery and their passion to serve the country”. The president prayed for the martyrs’ elevated ranks and for patience for their families. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought an immediate report from the top police officials on the incident, a statement from his office said. He expressed his deep grief and anger, conveying his condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs. “The brave men of KP police embraced martyrdom to protect the lives and property of the people,” Kundi was quoted as saying, adding that he was proud of the martyrs. “These actions by Indian-backed Fitna al Khwarij cannot dampen our morale,” the governor asserted. The KP governor urged the PTI-run provincial government to “take practical steps to ensure peace in the province”. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also strongly condemned the attack and hailed the sacrifices of “five policemen”. “The courageous men of the police sacrificed their today for the nation’s peaceful tomorrow,” Naqvi was quoted as saying by his ministry. “The great sacrifices of the martyrs will always be remembered,” he added. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, in a statement condemning the blast, expressed deep sorrow over the martyrdom of six police personnel. The NA speaker paid rich tribute to the sacrifices of the law enforcement agencies in the fight against terrorism. “The martyrdom of police officials is an irreparable loss,” he said, adding that the entire nation was proud of its brave sons who stood against terrorism. The speaker also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured. “The nation stands shoulder to shoulder with its security forces in the fight against terrorism,” Sadiq affirmed. Recent attacks on LEAs Law enforcement personnel have increasingly come under attack in KP in recent weeks. On January 10, a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another CTD official was gunned down in Bannu. The day before, a policeman was martyred after gunmen attacked him in the Bajaur tribal district, while another died in Khyber when gunmen ambushed a car. Three cops were injured in Bannu on January 8 as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists”. Also in Bannu, a former tehsil nazim was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on January 6. Last month in December, five policemen were martyred when a police vehicle was ambushed in KP’s Karak district. Eight terrorists were killed in an operation launched to hunt down the attackers. On December 1, a head constable lost his life and five cops were injured in Lakki Marwat when a suicide bo­mber targeted a police vehicle.

Police have sealed off the area and a “massive” security operation was underway, state-run APP reported. Separately, another IED blast took place near Darra Tang road in Lakki Marwat, which injured three police personnel, according to APP . According to a police statement, which did not specify the number of the wounded, a SHO and “police personnel were slightly injured and are now out of danger”. “ Fitna al Khwarij targeted the police APC with an IED explosion while they were patrolling near Jabar Khel on Darra Tang Road within the jurisdiction of the Saddar police station. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Subsequently, Lakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan reached the site of the incident and assessed the situation. A search operation was then launched in the area, the police statement said. It quoted DPO Nazir as saying, “These cowardly acts cannot lower our morale. The Lakki Marwat police are responding vigorously to every challenge and are ready to give every possible sacrifice for the public’s protection.” The officer asserted that the police were resolutely tackling Fitna al Khwarij , adding that security has been increased in the area. PM Shehbaz orders probe into Tank attack Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered an “immediate investigation” into the incident and directed that those responsible be brought to justice at the earliest, according to state-run Radio Pakistan . The premier reaffirmed the government’s commitment to completely eradicate terrorism from the country. President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed his deep grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the “terrorist attack”, a statement from his office said. He paid tribute to the cops’ “bravery and their passion to serve the country”. The president prayed for the martyrs’ elevated ranks and for patience for their families. KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought an immediate report from the top police officials on the incident, a statement from his office said. He expressed his deep grief and anger, conveying his condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs. “The brave men of KP police embraced martyrdom to protect the lives and property of the people,” Kundi was quoted as saying, adding that he was proud of the martyrs. “These actions by Indian-backed Fitna al Khwarij cannot dampen our morale,” the governor asserted. The KP governor urged the PTI-run provincial government to “take practical steps to ensure peace in the province”. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also strongly condemned the attack and hailed the sacrifices of “five policemen”. “The courageous men of the police sacrificed their today for the nation’s peaceful tomorrow,” Naqvi was quoted as saying by his ministry. “The great sacrifices of the martyrs will always be remembered,” he added. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, in a statement condemning the blast, expressed deep sorrow over the martyrdom of six police personnel. The NA speaker paid rich tribute to the sacrifices of the law enforcement agencies in the fight against terrorism. “The martyrdom of police officials is an irreparable loss,” he said, adding that the entire nation was proud of its brave sons who stood against terrorism. The speaker also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured. “The nation stands shoulder to shoulder with its security forces in the fight against terrorism,” Sadiq affirmed. Recent attacks on LEAs Law enforcement personnel have increasingly come under attack in KP in recent weeks. On January 10, a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another CTD official was gunned down in Bannu. The day before, a policeman was martyred after gunmen attacked him in the Bajaur tribal district, while another died in Khyber when gunmen ambushed a car. Three cops were injured in Bannu on January 8 as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists”. Also in Bannu, a former tehsil nazim was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on January 6. Last month in December, five policemen were martyred when a police vehicle was ambushed in KP’s Karak district. Eight terrorists were killed in an operation launched to hunt down the attackers. On December 1, a head constable lost his life and five cops were injured in Lakki Marwat when a suicide bo­mber targeted a police vehicle. The same day, a police constable was gunned down by terrorists in Bannu.",

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari on Monday refuted claims by PTI leaders that different and unrelated videos were submitted for a forensic report about the May 9, 2023 riots. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident. “There are two separate videos [of KP CM] and they should not be confused. One of the videos must be from Zaman Park. However, the other one showing [him] vandalising and lighting fire has been deleted [from the social media account],” she said while addressing a press conference in Lahore. “When KP chief minister realised that an effort to rebellion which he termed as revolution failed, he deleted the videos [of May 9, 2023] from social media. However, the videos remained in the record,” said Bokhari. She further claimed their destination was the Corps Commander House, located very close to the Radio Pakistan building. However, they were denied entry there, so they entered the state media building, vandalised it, set fire, and destroyed the records there. In response to the conviction of identified suspects in May 9 cases, she said those involved in cases in Punjab have been convicted and they were serving their sentences in prison. “We don‘t have any political revenge against anyone,” she said, adding the cases on PML-N leadership in PTI’s tenure were politically motivated. Speaking on the PTI’s call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, the information minister said they planned a “new programme of anarchy to subjugate the state and make the law subservient to them, which cannot be made possible”. The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted. At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage. Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.",

      "summary_orig": "While Iran has grappled with widespread deadly protests for the past two weeks, Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, has once again emerged as an anti-government figurehead. The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, before turning against the authorities in Iran, who have governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. However, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States. Pahlavi has urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement. He has also hinted at his plans to return to Iran at a time that he believed was “very near”. He has even requested US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to get involved if force is used on protesters, to “be ready to intervene to help the people of Iran”. So what links does Pahlavi have to Iran’s history, and what are the stakes for him in establishing a role in the ongoing crisis? Born in Tehran on Oct 31, 1960, as the heir to the late Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza and Empress Farah Pahlavi, Reza Pahlavi was officially named crown prince at the age of seven. He has lived in exile since his father was ousted by the 1979 revolution , a year before he died. Iran’s ousted late shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. — photo courtesy Pahlavi Centenary As per his website , Pahlavi left Iran for jet fighter training in the United States Air Force in 1978. “During this same period, the building unrest in Iran led to the royal family’s departure in January 1979,” his website says about his father’s ouster. Pahlavi completed his higher education with a degree in political science from the University of Southern California. He volunteered to serve Iran’s military as a fighter pilot during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, but was declined by the Islamic regime. Pahlavi married Yasmine Etemad-Amini on June 12, 1986. They have three daughters (all of whom he has named as his heirs successively): Noor Pahlavi (born April 3, 1992), Iman Pahlavi (born Sept 12, 1993), and Farah Pahlavi (born Jan 17, 2004). The late shah’s heir has also authored three books: Gozashteh va Ayandeh (Kayhan Publishing, 2000); Winds of Change: The Future of Democracy in Iran (Regnery, 2002); and Iran: L’Heure du Choix [ Iran: The Deciding Hour ] (Denoël, 2009). Ties outside Iran Pahlavi’s website highlights that he remains in touch with “opposition groups, both inside and outside” Iran, and advocates for the establishment of a secular democracy in the country. “He calls for regime change through non-violent civil disobedience, and for a free and open referendum on a new government of Iran,” the website reads. While Iran and Israel are arch-enemies under the current regime, they both enjoyed warmer ties under Pahlavi’s father. In October last year, Israeli-funded online campaigns in the Persian language used fake social media personas and AI to boost Pahlavi’s image and destabilise the Iranian regime, parallel investigations by Israeli newspapers and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab found. During the 12-day Iran-Israel war last year, Pahlavi urged Khamenei to step down “for the sake of the Iranian people”. In a similar fashion, during the ongoing protests, the late shah’s son called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag , which protesters briefly succeeded in doing so in London.",

They have three daughters (all of whom he has named as his heirs successively): Noor Pahlavi (born April 3, 1992), Iman Pahlavi (born Sept 12, 1993), and Farah Pahlavi (born Jan 17, 2004). The late shah’s heir has also authored three books: Gozashteh va Ayandeh (Kayhan Publishing, 2000); Winds of Change: The Future of Democracy in Iran (Regnery, 2002); and Iran: L’Heure du Choix [ Iran: The Deciding Hour ] (Denoël, 2009). Ties outside Iran Pahlavi’s website highlights that he remains in touch with “opposition groups, both inside and outside” Iran, and advocates for the establishment of a secular democracy in the country. “He calls for regime change through non-violent civil disobedience, and for a free and open referendum on a new government of Iran,” the website reads. While Iran and Israel are arch-enemies under the current regime, they both enjoyed warmer ties under Pahlavi’s father. In October last year, Israeli-funded online campaigns in the Persian language used fake social media personas and AI to boost Pahlavi’s image and destabilise the Iranian regime, parallel investigations by Israeli newspapers and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab found. During the 12-day Iran-Israel war last year, Pahlavi urged Khamenei to step down “for the sake of the Iranian people”. In a similar fashion, during the ongoing protests, the late shah’s son called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag , which protesters briefly succeeded in doing so in London.",
      "title": "Who is Reza Pahlavi — and what are his links to Iran?",
      "summary": "While Iran has grappled with widespread deadly protests for the past two weeks, Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, has once again emerged as an anti-government figurehead. The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, before turning against the authorities in Iran, who have governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. However, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States. Pahlavi has urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement. He has also hinted at his plans to return to Iran at a time that he believed was “very near”. He has even requested US President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to get involved if force is used on protesters, to “be ready to intervene to help the people of Iran”. So what links does Pahlavi have to Iran’s history, and what are the stakes for him in establishing a role in the ongoing crisis? Born in Tehran on Oct 31, 1960, as the heir to the late Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza and Empress Farah Pahlavi, Reza Pahlavi was officially named crown prince at the age of seven. He has lived in exile since his father was ousted by the 1979 revolution , a year before he died. Iran’s ousted late shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. — photo courtesy Pahlavi Centenary As per his website , Pahlavi left Iran for jet fighter training in the United States Air Force in 1978. “During this same period, the building unrest in Iran led to the royal family’s departure in January 1979,” his website says about his father’s ouster. Pahlavi completed his higher education with a degree in political science from the University of Southern California. He volunteered to serve Iran’s military as a fighter pilot during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, but was declined by the Islamic regime. Pahlavi married Yasmine Etemad-Amini on June 12, 1986.

      "title_orig": "Trump vows to cut off Cuba’s oil after toppling Venezuelan ally Maduro",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump urged Cuba on Sunday to “make a deal” soon, pledging to cut off all oil and money flowing to the communist-run island after the toppling of Havana’s key ally, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The threatening social media post drew an angry retort from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who said “no one” would tell his country what to do. Washington has imposed economy-crippling sanctions on its island neighbour for decades, but Trump has ramped up the pressure in recent days. US special forces seized Maduro and his wife this month in a lightning raid that left dozens of the ousted Venezuelan president’s security personnel dead — many of whom were Cuban. Though Maduro’s allies have become interim leaders, Trump has claimed the United States now actually controls Venezuela through a US naval blockade of its vital oil sector. “THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. “I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.” He said, “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!” “Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week’s U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years.” Trump provided almost no details about what potential deal he referred to, or what such an arrangement would achieve. Asked about it later on Sunday, Trump told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he wanted people forced out of Cuba or who “left under duress” to be taken care of. “Most importantly, right now, we’re going to take care of the people that came from Cuba, that are American citizens, or in our country,” Trump said, without clarifying how this would be achieved under a deal with Havana. ‘Ready to fall’ A week ago, Trump stated that “Cuba is ready to fall,” noting that the island’s economic crisis was worsening and it would be difficult for Havana to “hold out” without receiving heavily subsidised Venezuelan oil. Earlier on Sunday, the president reposted a message that jokingly suggested US Secretary of State Marco Rubio — a child of Cuban immigrants who concurrently holds the posts of national security advisor, acting head of the US archives, and acting international aid administrator — could also become the president of Cuba. Trump shared that post with the comment: “Sounds good to me!” Cuba’s president rebuffed Trump’s threatening language, saying the Caribbean island’s residents were “ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.” “Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do,” Diaz-Canel wrote on X. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez also weighed in to stress that Cuba is within its rights to import fuel from any willing exporter, “without interference or subordination to the unilateral coercive measures of the United States.” ‘Talk, talk, talk’ A Cold War-era US trade embargo has cinched Cuba’s economy beginning in 1962, and since 2000 Havana has increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, the firebrand leftist Hugo Chavez. On Sunday in the streets of Havana, retiree Mercedes Simon seemed to dismiss the US leader’s latest bluster. “Trump is not going to touch Cuba,” the 65-year-old told AFP . “All the presidents talk, talk, talk” about Cuba, for decades, “but they don’t act.” Marcos Sanchez, a 21-year-old working in the restaurant business, said the two countries should find common ground, “without resorting to violence.” Trump’s provocative language on Cuba comes as the emboldened American leader has hinted he has other countries in his sights after capturing Maduro. Trump, who had openly sought last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has recently threatened Colombia, Mexico, Iran and Greenland. Some Republican US lawmakers on Sunday lauded Trump for his aggressive comments on Cuba, including Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart from Florida. “The tyranny in Cuba will not survive the second term of President Trump,” Diaz-Balart posted in Spanish on X, “and Cuba will finally be free after decades of misery, tragedy, and pain.”",

      "title": "Trump vows to cut off Cuba’s oil after toppling Venezuelan ally Maduro",
      "summary": "US President Donald Trump urged Cuba on Sunday to “make a deal” soon, pledging to cut off all oil and money flowing to the communist-run island after the toppling of Havana’s key ally, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The threatening social media post drew an angry retort from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who said “no one” would tell his country what to do. Washington has imposed economy-crippling sanctions on its island neighbour for decades, but Trump has ramped up the pressure in recent days. US special forces seized Maduro and his wife this month in a lightning raid that left dozens of the ousted Venezuelan president’s security personnel dead — many of whom were Cuban. Though Maduro’s allies have become interim leaders, Trump has claimed the United States now actually controls Venezuela through a US naval blockade of its vital oil sector. “THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. “I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.” He said, “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!” “Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week’s U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years.” Trump provided almost no details about what potential deal he referred to, or what such an arrangement would achieve. Asked about it later on Sunday, Trump told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he wanted people forced out of Cuba or who “left under duress” to be taken care of. “Most importantly, right now, we’re going to take care of the people that came from Cuba, that are American citizens, or in our country,” Trump said, without clarifying how this would be achieved under a deal with Havana. ‘Ready to fall’ A week ago, Trump stated that “Cuba is ready to fall,” noting that the island’s economic crisis was worsening and it would be difficult for Havana to “hold out” without receiving heavily subsidised Venezuelan oil. Earlier on Sunday, the president reposted a message that jokingly suggested US Secretary of State Marco Rubio — a child of Cuban immigrants who concurrently holds the posts of national security advisor, acting head of the US archives, and acting international aid administrator — could also become the president of Cuba. Trump shared that post with the comment: “Sounds good to me!” Cuba’s president rebuffed Trump’s threatening language, saying the Caribbean island’s residents were “ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.” “Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do,” Diaz-Canel wrote on X. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez also weighed in to stress that Cuba is within its rights to import fuel from any willing exporter, “without interference or subordination to the unilateral coercive measures of the United States.” ‘Talk, talk, talk’ A Cold War-era US trade embargo has cinched Cuba’s economy beginning in 1962, and since 2000 Havana has increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, the firebrand leftist Hugo Chavez.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: During ongoing operations against militants in Bannu, the Counter-Terrorism Department’s Bannu region, in coordination with local police, carried out a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO), killing two terrorists. According to police, the operation was conducted within the jurisdiction of Mirakhel Police Station on Jhandokhel Road near Shagi Machankhel. Acting on credible intelligence, CTD Bannu’s Special Weapons and Tactics teams, along with Bannu Police, cordoned off the area and launched the operation. During the action, the terrorists opened fire, prompting effective retaliatory fire by the police and CTD personnel. Following an exchange of fire, two terrorists were found dead during a search operation. They were identified as Suhail Khan alias Sangri and Ismail alias Usman. Police stated that both terrorists were involved in attacks on Sheikh Landik and Fateh Khel police check posts, in which eight police constables were injured. They were also involved in attacks on security forces’ convoys and an IED attack on the under-construction Rescue 1122 building. Weapons and ammunition recovered from the slain terrorists included two Kalashnikov rifles, one pistol, multiple rounds of ammunition, a motorcycle, two mobile phones, two national identity cards, and a card belonging to the proscribed TTP. Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, along with the Additional IG CTD, commended the Bannu Police and CTD SWAT teams for the successful operation. The IGP KP stated that intelligence-based targeted operations will continue uninterrupted across the province until terrorism is completely eliminated. In a separate incident, militants launched an attack on the Nala Kasho police checkpost, using light and heavy weapons. However, the attack was foiled after retaliatory action by police personnel. As soon as information about the attack was received, police contingents from Domel and Town Police Station, along with other security forces, immediately reached the site of the incident. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during 2025, according to the “Pakistan Security Report 2025” report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.",

      "summary_orig": "• Punjab forensic report calls videos genuine, profile photos matched • PTI leaders say clips unrelated to case; Azma terms evidence ‘irrefutable’ PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident. The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted. At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage. The authorities had provided the video clips and the pictures of CM Afridi, former provincial ministers Taimur Saleem Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, and two other PTI leaders, Irfan Saleem and Amir Khan Chamkani, for analysis. None of them had been nominated in the case. In the report, the PFSA gave its opinion on two points: whether the videos in the USB were genuine and whether the persons whose profile pictures had been shared appeared in the clips. It said the five individuals, including the CM, were seen in the clips, but did not clarify if the videos were related to the Radio Pakistan attack or any other event. It, however, said the clips were not edited except for the merger of multiple video clips of different camera views. A legal expert, privy to the case, said the investigating officer, after this ‘evidence’ could nominate more accused through a supplementary report to the ATC. However, the court can also take cognisance of the matter. Similarly, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) could also submit an application for the inclusion of the accused persons in light of the forensic report. ‘Unrelated clips’ Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad. PTI leader Taimur Jhagra said it was interesting that this campaign was against the CM and other individuals never nominated in this case. “The posts with screenshots are very interesting because they have nothing to do with Radio Pakistan. I believe the Punjab lab is simply commenting on whether it thinks the videos are genuine or not. My first video screenshot is of a video that is not even shot in Peshawar… The video is of my condemnation of Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, while in Islamabad,” he mentioned. The ATC has fixed Jan 26 for the next hearing in the trial. The ATC is conducting the trial, with 75 accused, including some present and former lawmakers, being indicted on June 3, 2025, on multiple counts. The FIR was registered at the East Cantonment police station on May 10, 2023. ‘Irrefutable evidence’ Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan and toll plazas by the PTI in Peshawar were part of a well-planned conspiracy, and “irrefutable evidence” has surfaced in the forensic report. Ms Bokhari said the report included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence. She stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting would be brought to justice.

Similarly, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) could also submit an application for the inclusion of the accused persons in light of the forensic report. ‘Unrelated clips’ Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad. PTI leader Taimur Jhagra said it was interesting that this campaign was against the CM and other individuals never nominated in this case. “The posts with screenshots are very interesting because they have nothing to do with Radio Pakistan. I believe the Punjab lab is simply commenting on whether it thinks the videos are genuine or not. My first video screenshot is of a video that is not even shot in Peshawar… The video is of my condemnation of Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, while in Islamabad,” he mentioned. The ATC has fixed Jan 26 for the next hearing in the trial. The ATC is conducting the trial, with 75 accused, including some present and former lawmakers, being indicted on June 3, 2025, on multiple counts. The FIR was registered at the East Cantonment police station on May 10, 2023. ‘Irrefutable evidence’ Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan and toll plazas by the PTI in Peshawar were part of a well-planned conspiracy, and “irrefutable evidence” has surfaced in the forensic report. Ms Bokhari said the report included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence. She stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting would be brought to justice.

      "summary_orig": "• PM-appointed panel calls for measures to improve ease of doing business • Seeks tariff overhaul to lift exports beyond $60bn in three years • Highlights cross-cutting barriers across 20 export products • Notes ‘policy unpredictability’ undermines investor, buyer confidence ISLAMABAD: A body constituted by the prime minister and led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal has called for urgent reforms to improve the ease of doing business and for a serious restructuring and rationalisation of tariffs — both energy prices and trade duties — to more than double exports to over $60 billion within three years. The committee was formed to devise a strategy for avoiding another IMF programme once the current $8.4bn arrangement expires at the end of 2027, amid mounting pressure from persistently weak economic indicators. According to synopses compiled after week-long consultations with public and private sector stakeholders from Jan 5 to 9, the panel concluded that the current state of affairs was not capable of driving a fast-growing population of 250 million towards sustained prosperity because of cross-cutting constra­ints affecting “all 20 priority export products and six export drivers”. Ironically, most of these constraints are generally well known, but the government’s inability, despite special interventions here and there, including through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), to create a conducive working environment in a fair, equitable, rule-based and transparent manner, has hampered sustainable growth path beyond stabilisation under a restrictive programme volunteered to the IMF. The plan proposed easing electricity and gas prices through debt refinancing and rationalising price build-ups. It was found that “export competitiveness is undermined by high and volatile energy costs, with electricity and gas tariffs remaining above regional benchmarks and subject to frequent changes”. It warned that volatility was inflating production costs across manufacturing, agro-processing, minerals, fisheries, and services, eroding margins and diverting orders to competing countries. The Planning Commission also pointed out that the cost of doing business in Pakistan remained “structurally high due to fragmented and distortionary taxation, inverted input tariffs, advance income tax deductions, delayed sales tax refunds and persistent working capital lockups”. It said these issues disproportionately affected exporters and were particularly binding for small and medium enterprises across manufacturing and agri-based value chains. The panel said that policy unpredictability was also weakening investment and buyer confidence. “Frequent changes in tax policy, energy pricing, tariff structures, export incentives and regulatory regimes, often announced late in the business cycle, constrain forward planning, capacity expansion and scaling, particularly around annual export order booking cycles,” it said. The synopses also highlighted institutional fragmentation and regulatory burdens. They said inconsistent definitions of SMEs across the State Bank of Pakistan, SMEDA, the Federal Board of Revenue and provincial authorities restricted access to finance, incentives and support schemes. Overlapping mandates, discretionary enforcement, excessive audits and weak inter-agency coordination increased compliance costs and uncertainty, the panel said. Moreover, exporters also faced weak domestic quality, testing and compliance infrastructure, increasing reliance on overseas laboratories for certification and testing, it said, adding: “This raises costs, lengthens lead times and elevates rejection risks in regulated export markets, constraining movement into higher value products and destinations.” Limited access to affordable finance was also highlighted as a constraint on upgrading and value addition. The panel said export credit, insurance, guarantees, and long-term financing instruments remained underdeveloped, while high interest rates, collateral requirements, and liquidity constraints curtailed SME investment in technology, compliance, and scaling. The committee also questioned the implementation of export facilitation and input schemes, including the Export Facilitation Scheme, saying procedural delays, higher input costs and working-capital pressures were limiting effective sourcing of raw materials and intermediate inputs. In addition, it cited logistics and trade facilitation bottlenecks, including high inland freight costs, underutilised rail, port congestion, slow customs clearance, inadequate cold-chain infrastructure and weak courier and postal systems for SMEs. It noted that at Port Qasim, the absence of dedicated export terminals, limited handling infrastructure, inadequate covered storage and constrained evacuation arrangements increased dwell time, handling costs and shipment uncertainty. It also pointed to skills gaps, low value addition and weak branding as barriers to moving into higher-value segments. Based on consultations, the Planning Commission is now collecting additional information through a private-sector survey to refine inputs and develop a data-driven, sector-specific technical roadmap to enhance exports under the Uraan Pakistan strategic plan. “Pakistan’s development, economic sovereignty and even national security now hinge on one thing: how fast we can grow our exports and move to an export-led growth model,” Mr Iqbal said at the conclusion of the consultations. He added that “the only way to break free from foreign crutches and avoid the next IMF programme is to rapidly increase our exports and build strong foreign exchange reserves”. The 20 products covered during these engagements included copper, gems and jewellery, software and IT services, fish and fish preparations, rice, fruits and vegetables, meat and meat preparations, guar gum and its products, handicrafts, textile and apparel, sports goods, leather and leather products, surgical instruments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cement, carpets and rugs, engineering goods, footwear, plastic material and cutlery. Pakistan currently exports about $30-35bn worth of goods, against Planning Commission estimates of an untapped annual potential of over $60bn. The findings and recommendations will be consolidated into product-wise diagnostics and a targeted facilitation framework for submission to the prime minister. Their implementation would be subject to clearance under the tight requirements of the IMF conditions. Published in Dawn, January 12th, 2026",
