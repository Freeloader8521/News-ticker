      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has agreed on a proposal to end the Gaza conflict and thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for their support of the plan. In less than two years, Israel’s onslaught on Gaza has killed at least 65,549 people and wounded 167,518, besides displacing millions from their areas. Earlier this month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement. Trump announced Netanyahu’s agreement to his plan at a press conference in Washington, DC, ahead of which the White House had released Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza. Addressing the press conference, Trump said this was a “big, big day”. “The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were\nwith us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a\nstatement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump stated. “They\nback this 100 per cent. “Things that have been going on for hundreds of years, thousands of years … at minimum, we are very, very close and beyond very close,” Trump said, thanking Netanyahu for his role in the peace process. “We worked well together, and have with many other countries, which is how this situation gets solved.” Trump said that he was aiming for peace in the Middle East at large, not just the Gaza Strip. He added that he and Netanyahu discussed issues like Iran, the Abraham Accords and ending the Gaza conflict. “This is part of the bigger picture, which is peace in the Middle East … let’s call it ‘eternal’ peace in the Middle East,” he said. @dawn.today United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is visiting the White House, is “very close” to agreeing on a deal to end the Gaza conflict. Addressing a press conference, Trump said this was a “big, big day”. “The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump stated. “They back this 100 per cent.” The US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for “trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction” in the region. Read more: https://www.dawn.com/news/1945467/ DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com “After extensive consultation with our friends and partners throughout the region, I am formally releasing our principles for peace,” Trump announced, adding that people “have really liked” them. “These are done with total consideration and working with the nations we are talking about,” he added. “I want to thank the leaders of many Arab and Muslim nations for their tremendous support in developing the proposal, as well as our allies in Europe. The US president also thanked Netanyahu for agreeing to the plan and for “trusting that if we work together, we can bring an end to the death and destruction” in the region. “If accepted by Hamas, this proposal calls for the release of all remaining hostages immediately, but in no case, more than 72 hours,” Trump said. “The hostages are coming back.” Trump said this means “an immediate end to the war itself”. “Under the plan, Arab and Muslim countries have committed … to demilitarise Gaza quickly, decommission the military capabilities of Hamas and all other terror organisations and we are relying on the countries we named and others  to deal with Hamas and I’m hearing Hamas wants to get this done too.” ‘New transitional authority’ Trump added that as part of the agreement, “terror infrastructure”, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, would be dismantled and local police forces would be trained in the Gaza Strip. “Working with the new transitional authority in Gaza, all parties will agree on a timeline for Israeli forces to withdraw in phases … no more shooting hopefully,” Trump stated. “Arab and Muslim nations need to be allowed a chance of fulfilling these commitments of dealing with Hamas. They are the one group I have not dealt with,” he added. “If Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible … I have a feeling that we’re going to have a positive answer, but if not, as you know Bibi (Netanyahu) you have my full backing to do what you have to do. The US president emphasised that ultimately, the goal is to eliminate any danger in the reason, which he attributed to Hamas. “To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for the creation of a new international oversight body,” he said, calling it the ‘Board of Peace’ and stating that it would be led by Arab leaders, Israel and Trump himself. “We’re going to do it right, we’re going to put leaders from other countries on and leaders who are very distinguished,” Trump said. “One of the people who wants to be on the Board is the UK former prime minister Tony Blair.” Trump said there would be more leaders and that their names would be announced in the coming days. He added that the World Bank would be charged with training and recruiting a new government made up of Palestinians and “highly qualified experts from around the world”. “Hamas and other terror organisations will play no role in the governance of Gaza, at all,” he stated. “It’s time to get our hostages back and try to build something very great and very important.” However, Trump noted that Netanyahu remains opposed to a Palestinian state but said what he is doing today would be good for Israel. He added that the Israeli public wanted an end to the fighting and the return of the hostages. “Some other countries have foolishly recognised a Palestinian state … but I think they’re very tired of what’s [been] going on for so many decades,” he said. “The people of Israel want it (an end to the fighting). “I challenge the Palestinians to take charge of their destiny,” Trump added. “If the Palestinian Authority does not complete my reforms … they only have themselves to blame.” ‘Maybe, Iran can join the Abraham Accords’ Trump added that this agreement would bring a sustainable, long-term peace and added that “maybe Iran can even get in there”, in relation to the Abraham Accords. “They could be a member,” Trump added. “I long ago said that Iran would be a member of the Accords. “This is the closest we’ve ever come to real peace.” “The leaders discussed a proposal for ending the war in Gaza, prospects for a more secure Middle East, and the need for greater understanding between their countries,” the White House said before a news conference with Trump and the Israeli prime minister. Trump added that Netanyahu expressed regret for an Israeli attack in Doha to Qatar’s leader in a three-way call in the Oval Office. “Bibi was talking to Prime Minister al-Thani of Qatar … they really had a heart-to-heart conversation,” the US president said. “We agreed to launch a formal trilateral mechanism between Israel, Qatar and the United States to begin a dialogue to enhance mutual security, correct misperceptions and avoid future misgivings.” Trump said it was time for Hamas to accept the terms of the proposal, noting that with their leadership mostly killed during the Gaza conflict, Hamas were “not the same people” the US was dealing with. “Everybody who wants to see an end to the violence and destruction should be united and calling for Hamas to accept the extremely fair proposal, so that we can end the war and get us back our hostages right now and have everlasting peace,” Trump declared. A new beginning for Gaza and the region: Netanyahu Taking the floor, Netanyahu thanked Trump for his hospitality and for his friendship and leadership. “While you focus at home on making America great again, your leadership abroad is changing the world for the better: ending wars and advancing peace,” the Israeli PM said. “I believe that today, we are taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East and I think beyond the Middle East — very important Muslim countries. “I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims,” Netanyahu said to Trump. “It will bring back to Israel all of our hostages, dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities and its political rule and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a joint press conference with US President Donald Trump (not pictured) in the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, DC, the US on September 29. — Reuters Netanyahu added that the plan would not have been achieved without the “courage and sacrifice of our incredibly brave soldiers”, calling the conflict “a war between civilisation and barbarism”. “We are taking the next step to win the war and expand the peace,” he stated. “Your (Trump’s) plan is consistent with the five principles my government set for the end of the war and the day after Hamas. “Here’s our plan: all of our hostages, both those who are alive and those who died, will return home immediately. Hamas will be disarmed. Gaza will be demilitarised. Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter for the foreseeable future. And lastly, Gaza will have a peaceful civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas, or the Palestinian Authority.” Netanyahu said that if Hamas agrees to the plan, the first step would be a “modest withdrawal” and the release of all hostages within 72 hours. “The next step will be the establishment of an international body charged with fully disarming Hamas and demilitarising Gaza,” he added, expressing appreciation for Trump leading the body. “If this international body succeeds, we will have permanently ended the war. Israel will conduct further withdrawals linked to the extent of disarmament and demilitarisation, but will remain within the security perimeter for the foreseeable future.” However, Netanyahu said that if Hamas rejects or violates the agreement, then Israel “will finish the job by itself”. “This can be done the easy way … or the hard way, but it will be done. We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done.” Netanyahu added that after Trump’s statement at the UN General Assembly, he was encouraged against recognising Palestine, stating that it would “reward terrorists, undermine security and endanger Israel’s very existence”. “I appreciate your (Trump’s) firm position that the PA can have no role in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,” he stated. Netanyahu said that there needs to be a fundamental change, which would include ending “pay-to-slay”, changing Palestinian textbooks that “teach hatred [of] Jews”, ending “lawfare” at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court and stopping incitement in the media among “many, many other reforms”. He added that Trump’s proposal presents a “practical and realistic path forward” in which Gaza would be administered by “those committed to genuine peace with Israel”. “I think this can be not only a new beginning for Gaza [but] a new beginning for the entire region,” the Israeli PM said, adding that the plan could reenergise the Abraham Accords. PM Shehbaz welcomes Gaza plan Earlier, PM Shehbaz said in a post on X that he welcomed Trump’s plan to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end. His statement came as the US president greeted Netanyahu at the White House for talks on the US-led peace plan. Before the meeting, Trump had told reporters he was “very confident” that there would be peace in Gaza. Asked if all parties were on board with his 21-point plan, he repeated, “very confident”. Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz posted on X: “I welcome President Trump’s 20-point [ sic ] plan to ensure an end to the war in Gaza. “I am also convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region,” the PM wrote. He added, “It is also my firm belief that President Trump is fully prepared to assist in whatever way necessary to make this extremely important and urgent understanding to become a reality.” PM Shehbaz also lauded “Trump’s leadership and [his] special envoy Steve Witkoff for their efforts in bringing an end to the nearly two-year-long conflict”. “I also strongly believe that the implementation of the two-state proposal is essential to ensure lasting peace in the region,” he added. Earlier in the day, he also spoke to Pakistani journalists in London, where he spoke about Trump’s meeting with Muslims leaders on Gaza in New York last week. The meeting on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia, who discussed Trump’s proposal for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. During his interaction with journalists in London today, PM Shehbaz “a very constructive discussion took place” at the meeting. He added, “As a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire.” Additional input from AFP and Reuters",

They are the one group I have not dealt with,” he added. “If Hamas rejects the deal, which is always possible … I have a feeling that we’re going to have a positive answer, but if not, as you know Bibi (Netanyahu) you have my full backing to do what you have to do. The US president emphasised that ultimately, the goal is to eliminate any danger in the reason, which he attributed to Hamas. “To ensure the success of this effort, my plan calls for the creation of a new international oversight body,” he said, calling it the ‘Board of Peace’ and stating that it would be led by Arab leaders, Israel and Trump himself. “We’re going to do it right, we’re going to put leaders from other countries on and leaders who are very distinguished,” Trump said. “One of the people who wants to be on the Board is the UK former prime minister Tony Blair.” Trump said there would be more leaders and that their names would be announced in the coming days. He added that the World Bank would be charged with training and recruiting a new government made up of Palestinians and “highly qualified experts from around the world”. “Hamas and other terror organisations will play no role in the governance of Gaza, at all,” he stated. “It’s time to get our hostages back and try to build something very great and very important.” However, Trump noted that Netanyahu remains opposed to a Palestinian state but said what he is doing today would be good for Israel. He added that the Israeli public wanted an end to the fighting and the return of the hostages. “Some other countries have foolishly recognised a Palestinian state … but I think they’re very tired of what’s [been] going on for so many decades,” he said. “The people of Israel want it (an end to the fighting). “I challenge the Palestinians to take charge of their destiny,” Trump added. “If the Palestinian Authority does not complete my reforms … they only have themselves to blame.” ‘Maybe, Iran can join the Abraham Accords’ Trump added that this agreement would bring a sustainable, long-term peace and added that “maybe Iran can even get in there”, in relation to the Abraham Accords. “They could be a member,” Trump added. “I long ago said that Iran would be a member of the Accords. “This is the closest we’ve ever come to real peace.” “The leaders discussed a proposal for ending the war in Gaza, prospects for a more secure Middle East, and the need for greater understanding between their countries,” the White House said before a news conference with Trump and the Israeli prime minister. Trump added that Netanyahu expressed regret for an Israeli attack in Doha to Qatar’s leader in a three-way call in the Oval Office. “Bibi was talking to Prime Minister al-Thani of Qatar … they really had a heart-to-heart conversation,” the US president said. “We agreed to launch a formal trilateral mechanism between Israel, Qatar and the United States to begin a dialogue to enhance mutual security, correct misperceptions and avoid future misgivings.” Trump said it was time for Hamas to accept the terms of the proposal, noting that with their leadership mostly killed during the Gaza conflict, Hamas were “not the same people” the US was dealing with. “Everybody who wants to see an end to the violence and destruction should be united and calling for Hamas to accept the extremely fair proposal, so that we can end the war and get us back our hostages right now and have everlasting peace,” Trump declared. A new beginning for Gaza and the region: Netanyahu Taking the floor, Netanyahu thanked Trump for his hospitality and for his friendship and leadership. “While you focus at home on making America great again, your leadership abroad is changing the world for the better: ending wars and advancing peace,” the Israeli PM said. “I believe that today, we are taking a critical step towards both ending the war in Gaza and setting the stage for dramatically advancing peace in the Middle East and I think beyond the Middle East — very important Muslim countries. “I support your plan to end the war in Gaza, which achieves our war aims,” Netanyahu said to Trump. “It will bring back to Israel all of our hostages, dismantle Hamas’ military capabilities and its political rule and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends a joint press conference with US President Donald Trump (not pictured) in the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, DC, the US on September 29. — Reuters Netanyahu added that the plan would not have been achieved without the “courage and sacrifice of our incredibly brave soldiers”, calling the conflict “a war between civilisation and barbarism”. “We are taking the next step to win the war and expand the peace,” he stated. “Your (Trump’s) plan is consistent with the five principles my government set for the end of the war and the day after Hamas. “Here’s our plan: all of our hostages, both those who are alive and those who died, will return home immediately. Hamas will be disarmed. Gaza will be demilitarised. Israel will retain security responsibility, including a security perimeter for the foreseeable future. And lastly, Gaza will have a peaceful civilian administration that is run neither by Hamas, or the Palestinian Authority.” Netanyahu said that if Hamas agrees to the plan, the first step would be a “modest withdrawal” and the release of all hostages within 72 hours. “The next step will be the establishment of an international body charged with fully disarming Hamas and demilitarising Gaza,” he added, expressing appreciation for Trump leading the body. “If this international body succeeds, we will have permanently ended the war. Israel will conduct further withdrawals linked to the extent of disarmament and demilitarisation, but will remain within the security perimeter for the foreseeable future.” However, Netanyahu said that if Hamas rejects or violates the agreement, then Israel “will finish the job by itself”. “This can be done the easy way … or the hard way, but it will be done. We prefer the easy way, but it has to be done.” Netanyahu added that after Trump’s statement at the UN General Assembly, he was encouraged against recognising Palestine, stating that it would “reward terrorists, undermine security and endanger Israel’s very existence”. “I appreciate your (Trump’s) firm position that the PA can have no role in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,” he stated. Netanyahu said that there needs to be a fundamental change, which would include ending “pay-to-slay”, changing Palestinian textbooks that “teach hatred [of] Jews”, ending “lawfare” at the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court and stopping incitement in the media among “many, many other reforms”. He added that Trump’s proposal presents a “practical and realistic path forward” in which Gaza would be administered by “those committed to genuine peace with Israel”. “I think this can be not only a new beginning for Gaza [but] a new beginning for the entire region,” the Israeli PM said, adding that the plan could reenergise the Abraham Accords. PM Shehbaz welcomes Gaza plan Earlier, PM Shehbaz said in a post on X that he welcomed Trump’s plan to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end. His statement came as the US president greeted Netanyahu at the White House for talks on the US-led peace plan. Before the meeting, Trump had told reporters he was “very confident” that there would be peace in Gaza. Asked if all parties were on board with his 21-point plan, he repeated, “very confident”. Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz posted on X: “I welcome President Trump’s 20-point [ sic ] plan to ensure an end to the war in Gaza. “I am also convinced that durable peace between the Palestinian people and Israel would be essential in bringing political stability and economic growth to the region,” the PM wrote. He added, “It is also my firm belief that President Trump is fully prepared to assist in whatever way necessary to make this extremely important and urgent understanding to become a reality.” PM Shehbaz also lauded “Trump’s leadership and [his] special envoy Steve Witkoff for their efforts in bringing an end to the nearly two-year-long conflict”. “I also strongly believe that the implementation of the two-state proposal is essential to ensure lasting peace in the region,” he added. Earlier in the day, he also spoke to Pakistani journalists in London, where he spoke about Trump’s meeting with Muslims leaders on Gaza in New York last week. The meeting on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly had brought together leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye, and Indonesia, who discussed Trump’s proposal for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. During his interaction with journalists in London today, PM Shehbaz “a very constructive discussion took place” at the meeting. He added, “As a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire.” Additional input from AFP and Reuters",

      "title_orig": "Who is Tony Blair, the man being touted to run Gaza post war",
      "summary_orig": "Tony Blair, the ex-prime minister who led Britain into a war based on what later turned out to be false claims, is now reportedly eyeing a key role in running post-war Gaza. According to a Financial Times , the former British premier is seeking a senior role in running the war-torn territory under a plan being prepared by US President Donald Trump’s administration. The report by the British daily quoted an anonymous source privy to the details as saying that Blair had been “proposed as the chair of the board of a ‘Gaza International Transitional Authority (Gita)’”. Meanwhile, a BBC report said this governing authority would have the support of the United Nations and Gulf countries. Blair would lead the body before handing back control to Palestinians, it added, and further quoted his office as saying that he would not support any proposal including the displacement of Gazans. Earlier, The Telegraph had reported that a plan — which also envisioned the establishment of Gita — prepared by the ex-PM’s Tony Blair Institute (TBI) for Gaza, had Trump’s backing. These reports emerged after Blair visited the White House in late August to participate in a meeting presided over by Trump. The meeting was called to discuss the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza, as well as post-war plans for the Palestinian territory. If these developments lead to Blair assuming a prominent role in governing the Gaza post war, the question may arise whether he is the right person for the job, particularly in light of his role in the 2003 Iraq war. Blair in office Blair won his first term in office in 1997 as his Labour party swept to power after a gap of 18 years . It marked the inception of Blair’s decade-long premiership, during which he would see two more electoral wins. A BBC report that outlined his tenure in the top office described the Labour party that came into power in 1997 as a “product of a tight-knit group” headed by Blair, his immediate successor in office, Gordon Brown, media chief Alastair Campbell, and British politician Peter Mandelson. The report further described Blair’s first cabinet as a “mix of old and new Labour figures” in which “the hard left was banished to the wilderness”. “And it quickly became clear that only Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown really mattered when it came to the big decisions […] Ministers seemed to come and go with dizzying speed, as the cabinet reshuffle became Blair’s signature move.” Blair’s government gave Britain 10 years of steady economic growth, boosted employment, poured money into schools and hospitals and brought peace to Northern Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement , to put it briefly. In 2004, his government also pressed ahead with plans to open the United Kingdom’s doors to Eastern European migrants. But there were downsides, too, especially in terms of foreign policy. Role in Iraq war One of the most significant factors defining Blair’s time in power was his role in the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq . He led Britain into the war — a move that has been singled out as his biggest failure as the premier. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001 in New York, Blair had expressed support for the US, saying the UK would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Washington. Two years later, the UK would join the US in launching a war in Iraq. The two main US-British arguments in favour of the war were that then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein possessed deployable weapons of mass destruction and posed an immediate or near-term threat to the region, as well as to the US and the UK. A BBC report report recalls that in 2003, “Blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for joining the US-led invasion to MPs and the wider public”. However, the caucus belli began evaporating soon. A Guardian report recounts that just around a month into the war, then-UK spy chief Sir John Scarlett went to Blair’s press secretary Alastair Campbell’s office and asked: “How difficult would it be if it transpired we do not find evidence of Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction programme?” Campbell’s reply was, “Very, very, very difficult.” The then-press secretary’s words would come true for Blair in the years to come when a public inquiry into Britain’s role in the Iraq war would release its findings. Led by John Chilcot, a five-member committee began investigating the matter in 2009 and conclude seven years later that Britain’s decision to go to war in Iraq was a failure born of flawed intelligence, lack of foresight and “wholly inadequate” planning. The Chilcot inquiry, as it came to be known, found that Blair’s decision in 2003 had a “far from satisfactory” legal basis and his case for military action was over-hyped. These findings were released nine years after Blair stepped down as the prime minister in 2007, with his popularity plunging, in which his decision to join the Iraq War seemingly played an instrumental role. The legacy Blair, who had told cheering supporters after his landslide victory in 1997: “A new dawn has broken”, went from being the most popular prime minister in British history to one of the least. When he came to power, his Downing Street residence was “Corporate Headquarters of Cool Britannia”. In 2007, as he prepared to step down, polls showed the British were affluent but disillusioned. The charismatic politician promising to be “purer than pure” ended up the first British prime minister to be quizzed by police in a criminal inquiry , as detectives probed to see if loans were offered to parties in exchange for state honours. On taking power, Blair had said: “Mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war.” But by the time he left office, from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Kosovo to Sierra Leone, he had sent British troops into battle more than any other preceding British prime minister since World War II. For novelist Robert Harris, the decade of Blair leading Britain was a tragedy. “Blair was of my generation, and this was our shot, if you like. I won’t say we’ve messed it up, but it perhaps hasn’t lived up to all the expectations of that rosy-fingered dawn of May 1, 1997.” And after 10 years interviewing and observing Blair, BBC documentary-maker Michael Cockerell had encapsulated the paradoxes of Blair’s emotional relationship with the British people. “It began when the charismatic prime minister swept people off their feet. But the early glow has long since dimmed, and at the end of the affair, both sides are sadder but wiser,” he had said. Quartet’s Middle East envoy After leaving Downing Street, Blair served as the Middle East envoy for a group of international powers, the Quartet, comprising the US, European Union, Russia and the United Nations. The group’s website says its mandate “is to help mediate Middle East peace negotiations and to support Palestinian economic development and institution building”. But according to a report by Al Jazeera , given his role in the Iraq war, Blair was not seen as the right person to facilitate peace in the Middle East right from the start. Francis Beckett, a political writer and co-author of ‘Blair Inc: The Man Behind the Mask’, pointed out to Al Jazeera that “most fatally of all, the difficulty was that when he went to meetings in the Middle East, nobody knew which Tony Blair they were seeing — whether it was Tony Blair the Quartet envoy or Tony Blair the patron of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation or Tony Blair the principle of the consultancy firm Tony Blair Associates”. Al Jazeera reported that Blair’s dealings after the end of his time as the prime minister included “advising Arab governments and consultancy work for the US investment bank JP Morgan”. These dealings, “reportedly netted him millions of pounds” and “left him exposed to accusations of greed from many hardened critics, including those from within the party he led from 1994 to 2007”. Blair’s reported plan for Gaza Blair quit as the Middle envoy for the Quartet in 2015 and set up a non-profit organisation , the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the very next year. According to The Telegraph , the same organisation has now come up with a proposal to establish “a temporary body to rule Gaza, with no displacement of civilians, and a multinational effort to prevent the resurgence of Hamas”. The British daily reported, citing sources, that the plan is known as the “day after”, on which Blair has been working since Israel began its genocide in Gaza in October 2023. The report details that the plan includes the establishment of a Property Rights Preservation Unit, “which would aim to strengthen the rights of Gazans who voluntarily leave the territory by giving them a right to return”. It also mentions the creation of Gita, which, it says, “would rule the post-war strip for several years before handing it over to the Palestinian Authority, which would be expected to undergo significant reforms beforehand”. Meanwhile, questions over Blair’s potential role in running Gaza after the war remain. A recent report by Al Jazeera highlighted: “Palestinian commentators have also said Blair failed them as (Middle East) peace envoy despite the quintessential British role in the conflict stretching over a century. They have argued that while he oversaw economic projects during his tenure, he did little to halt illegal Israeli settlement expansion and settler violence, or advance Palestinian statehood, with some even accusing him of impeding statehood as a friend of Israel.“",

Blair’s reported plan for Gaza Blair quit as the Middle envoy for the Quartet in 2015 and set up a non-profit organisation , the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the very next year. According to The Telegraph , the same organisation has now come up with a proposal to establish “a temporary body to rule Gaza, with no displacement of civilians, and a multinational effort to prevent the resurgence of Hamas”. The British daily reported, citing sources, that the plan is known as the “day after”, on which Blair has been working since Israel began its genocide in Gaza in October 2023. The report details that the plan includes the establishment of a Property Rights Preservation Unit, “which would aim to strengthen the rights of Gazans who voluntarily leave the territory by giving them a right to return”. It also mentions the creation of Gita, which, it says, “would rule the post-war strip for several years before handing it over to the Palestinian Authority, which would be expected to undergo significant reforms beforehand”. Meanwhile, questions over Blair’s potential role in running Gaza after the war remain. A recent report by Al Jazeera highlighted: “Palestinian commentators have also said Blair failed them as (Middle East) peace envoy despite the quintessential British role in the conflict stretching over a century. They have argued that while he oversaw economic projects during his tenure, he did little to halt illegal Israeli settlement expansion and settler violence, or advance Palestinian statehood, with some even accusing him of impeding statehood as a friend of Israel.“",

      "summary": "Tony Blair, the ex-prime minister who led Britain into a war based on what later turned out to be false claims, is now reportedly eyeing a key role in running post-war Gaza. According to a Financial Times , the former British premier is seeking a senior role in running the war-torn territory under a plan being prepared by US President Donald Trump’s administration. The report by the British daily quoted an anonymous source privy to the details as saying that Blair had been “proposed as the chair of the board of a ‘Gaza International Transitional Authority (Gita)’”. Meanwhile, a BBC report said this governing authority would have the support of the United Nations and Gulf countries. Blair would lead the body before handing back control to Palestinians, it added, and further quoted his office as saying that he would not support any proposal including the displacement of Gazans. Earlier, The Telegraph had reported that a plan — which also envisioned the establishment of Gita — prepared by the ex-PM’s Tony Blair Institute (TBI) for Gaza, had Trump’s backing. These reports emerged after Blair visited the White House in late August to participate in a meeting presided over by Trump. The meeting was called to discuss the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza, as well as post-war plans for the Palestinian territory. If these developments lead to Blair assuming a prominent role in governing the Gaza post war, the question may arise whether he is the right person for the job, particularly in light of his role in the 2003 Iraq war. Blair in office Blair won his first term in office in 1997 as his Labour party swept to power after a gap of 18 years . It marked the inception of Blair’s decade-long premiership, during which he would see two more electoral wins. A BBC report that outlined his tenure in the top office described the Labour party that came into power in 1997 as a “product of a tight-knit group” headed by Blair, his immediate successor in office, Gordon Brown, media chief Alastair Campbell, and British politician Peter Mandelson. The report further described Blair’s first cabinet as a “mix of old and new Labour figures” in which “the hard left was banished to the wilderness”. “And it quickly became clear that only Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown really mattered when it came to the big decisions […] Ministers seemed to come and go with dizzying speed, as the cabinet reshuffle became Blair’s signature move.” Blair’s government gave Britain 10 years of steady economic growth, boosted employment, poured money into schools and hospitals and brought peace to Northern Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement , to put it briefly. In 2004, his government also pressed ahead with plans to open the United Kingdom’s doors to Eastern European migrants. But there were downsides, too, especially in terms of foreign policy. Role in Iraq war One of the most significant factors defining Blair’s time in power was his role in the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq . He led Britain into the war — a move that has been singled out as his biggest failure as the premier. After the 9/11 attacks in 2001 in New York, Blair had expressed support for the US, saying the UK would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Washington. Two years later, the UK would join the US in launching a war in Iraq. The two main US-British arguments in favour of the war were that then-Iraqi president Saddam Hussein possessed deployable weapons of mass destruction and posed an immediate or near-term threat to the region, as well as to the US and the UK. A BBC report report recalls that in 2003, “Blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for joining the US-led invasion to MPs and the wider public”. However, the caucus belli began evaporating soon. A Guardian report recounts that just around a month into the war, then-UK spy chief Sir John Scarlett went to Blair’s press secretary Alastair Campbell’s office and asked: “How difficult would it be if it transpired we do not find evidence of Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction programme?” Campbell’s reply was, “Very, very, very difficult.” The then-press secretary’s words would come true for Blair in the years to come when a public inquiry into Britain’s role in the Iraq war would release its findings. Led by John Chilcot, a five-member committee began investigating the matter in 2009 and conclude seven years later that Britain’s decision to go to war in Iraq was a failure born of flawed intelligence, lack of foresight and “wholly inadequate” planning. The Chilcot inquiry, as it came to be known, found that Blair’s decision in 2003 had a “far from satisfactory” legal basis and his case for military action was over-hyped. These findings were released nine years after Blair stepped down as the prime minister in 2007, with his popularity plunging, in which his decision to join the Iraq War seemingly played an instrumental role. The legacy Blair, who had told cheering supporters after his landslide victory in 1997: “A new dawn has broken”, went from being the most popular prime minister in British history to one of the least. When he came to power, his Downing Street residence was “Corporate Headquarters of Cool Britannia”. In 2007, as he prepared to step down, polls showed the British were affluent but disillusioned. The charismatic politician promising to be “purer than pure” ended up the first British prime minister to be quizzed by police in a criminal inquiry , as detectives probed to see if loans were offered to parties in exchange for state honours. On taking power, Blair had said: “Mine is the first generation able to contemplate the possibility that we may live our entire lives without going to war or sending our children to war.” But by the time he left office, from Afghanistan to Iraq, from Kosovo to Sierra Leone, he had sent British troops into battle more than any other preceding British prime minister since World War II. For novelist Robert Harris, the decade of Blair leading Britain was a tragedy. “Blair was of my generation, and this was our shot, if you like. I won’t say we’ve messed it up, but it perhaps hasn’t lived up to all the expectations of that rosy-fingered dawn of May 1, 1997.” And after 10 years interviewing and observing Blair, BBC documentary-maker Michael Cockerell had encapsulated the paradoxes of Blair’s emotional relationship with the British people. “It began when the charismatic prime minister swept people off their feet. But the early glow has long since dimmed, and at the end of the affair, both sides are sadder but wiser,” he had said. Quartet’s Middle East envoy After leaving Downing Street, Blair served as the Middle East envoy for a group of international powers, the Quartet, comprising the US, European Union, Russia and the United Nations. The group’s website says its mandate “is to help mediate Middle East peace negotiations and to support Palestinian economic development and institution building”. But according to a report by Al Jazeera , given his role in the Iraq war, Blair was not seen as the right person to facilitate peace in the Middle East right from the start. Francis Beckett, a political writer and co-author of ‘Blair Inc: The Man Behind the Mask’, pointed out to Al Jazeera that “most fatally of all, the difficulty was that when he went to meetings in the Middle East, nobody knew which Tony Blair they were seeing — whether it was Tony Blair the Quartet envoy or Tony Blair the patron of the Tony Blair Faith Foundation or Tony Blair the principle of the consultancy firm Tony Blair Associates”. Al Jazeera reported that Blair’s dealings after the end of his time as the prime minister included “advising Arab governments and consultancy work for the US investment bank JP Morgan”. These dealings, “reportedly netted him millions of pounds” and “left him exposed to accusations of greed from many hardened critics, including those from within the party he led from 1994 to 2007”. Blair’s reported plan for Gaza Blair quit as the Middle envoy for the Quartet in 2015 and set up a non-profit organisation , the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, the very next year. According to The Telegraph , the same organisation has now come up with a proposal to establish “a temporary body to rule Gaza, with no displacement of civilians, and a multinational effort to prevent the resurgence of Hamas”.

It also mentions the creation of Gita, which, it says, “would rule the post-war strip for several years before handing it over to the Palestinian Authority, which would be expected to undergo significant reforms beforehand”. Meanwhile, questions over Blair’s potential role in running Gaza after the war remain.

      "summary_orig": "In her latest censure of the PPP, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday resurrected the issue of the contentious Cholistan canals project , saying the water that would have been diverted towards the desert belonged to her province. “If Punjab wants construct canals for its water, why are you bothered? It is Punjab’s water. It belongs to the people, farmers and fields of Punjab,” she said at the inauguration ceremony of an electric bus service in Faisalabad. “If I want to create canals, why do you object to it?” she questioned. “I wouldn’t have stolen water. I would have [used] them to create waterways and developed Cholistan,” she continued, taking a fresh jibe at her party’s coalition partner in the Centre. The now-shelved canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between the Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. The project aimed to irrigate a total of 4.8 million acres of barren land by constructing six canals — two each in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab. Five of those canals would have been built on the Indus River, while the sixth would have been constructed along the Sutlej River, supplying approximately 4,120 cusecs of water to irrigate the Cholistan desert in Punjab. Maryam and Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir had inaugurated the project to irrigate south Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh. What was being hailed as a game-changer for Punjab had triggered an uproar in Sindh, which believed the scheme would have further disturb the ecological balance in the province and deprived it of its mandated water share. After months of protests from various fragments of society as well as opposition from Sindh , the federal government had announced on April 23 that it was halting the project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the Council of Common Interests — a key body tasked with resolving power-sharing disputes between the federal and provincial governments. The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Then, on April 28, CCI meeting had endorsed the federal government’s move to halt the initiative until “mutual understanding” could be achieved among provinces. As Maryam resurrected the issue during her speech again, the Punjab CM mentioned flood relief and the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) — the latest cause of dispute between the PPP and PML-N over flood relief. The PPP and PML-N have lately been arguing over the means for flood relief, with the PPP insisting on the use of BISP and the PML-N disapproving the proposition. Reiterating her argument that funds given under the BISP were insufficient for flood relief, she, once again rejected the PPP’s proposition to seek international assistance to help people affected by recent floods in Punjab. “Keep your advice to yourself,” she rebuked, adding the seeking international help was not the only solution. “Punjab never interferes in your matters, so you don’t interfere in Punjab’s matters,” she said.",

It is Punjab’s water. It belongs to the people, farmers and fields of Punjab,” she said at the inauguration ceremony of an electric bus service in Faisalabad. “If I want to create canals, why do you object to it?” she questioned. “I wouldn’t have stolen water. I would have [used] them to create waterways and developed Cholistan,” she continued, taking a fresh jibe at her party’s coalition partner in the Centre. The now-shelved canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between the Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. The project aimed to irrigate a total of 4.8 million acres of barren land by constructing six canals — two each in Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab. Five of those canals would have been built on the Indus River, while the sixth would have been constructed along the Sutlej River, supplying approximately 4,120 cusecs of water to irrigate the Cholistan desert in Punjab. Maryam and Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir had inaugurated the project to irrigate south Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh. What was being hailed as a game-changer for Punjab had triggered an uproar in Sindh, which believed the scheme would have further disturb the ecological balance in the province and deprived it of its mandated water share. After months of protests from various fragments of society as well as opposition from Sindh , the federal government had announced on April 23 that it was halting the project until a consensus on the issue could be reached in the Council of Common Interests — a key body tasked with resolving power-sharing disputes between the federal and provincial governments. The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. Then, on April 28, CCI meeting had endorsed the federal government’s move to halt the initiative until “mutual understanding” could be achieved among provinces. As Maryam resurrected the issue during her speech again, the Punjab CM mentioned flood relief and the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) — the latest cause of dispute between the PPP and PML-N over flood relief. The PPP and PML-N have lately been arguing over the means for flood relief, with the PPP insisting on the use of BISP and the PML-N disapproving the proposition. Reiterating her argument that funds given under the BISP were insufficient for flood relief, she, once again rejected the PPP’s proposition to seek international assistance to help people affected by recent floods in Punjab. “Keep your advice to yourself,” she rebuked, adding the seeking international help was not the only solution. “Punjab never interferes in your matters, so you don’t interfere in Punjab’s matters,” she said.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday said his government nominated US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize because “he helped save the region from destruction” during a period of Pakistan-India escalation. The Pakistani government in June had decided to formally recommend US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize for his “decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership” to end the India-Pakistan escalation in May. The conflict began after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, launched airstrikes in Pakistan, and faced retaliation . Amid easing tensions following a ceasefire bet­ween India and Pakistan, Presi­dent Donald Trump claimed that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between the two nations. Responding to a reporter’s question about Pakistan nominating Trump for the Nobel Prize during a press conference in London today, the PM said, “Mr Trump eased tension between Pakistan and India and has saved the region from major destruction.” He emphasised that if Trump had not intervened in the Pakistan-India escalation, “there would be more destruction and loss of lives.” The premier added that Trump has eased tension between Ethiopia and Egypt, and even in Ukraine.” ‘Washington visit very fruitful’ Speaking about his recent meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, PM Shehbaz said that his visit to Washington “was very fruitful; it was very successful.” He said the best thing that happened was that in the UN building, President Trump co-chaired a meeting on Gaza, and he invited Pakistan, Qatar, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia. “There, a very constructive discussion took place, and as a result of that meeting, very soon, a positive result may come that in the Gaza war, there may be a ceasefire,” he said. “Since 2023 in Gaza, the market of oppression and tyranny has been heated, and innocent Muslims are being martyred, including children, mothers, sisters, and youngsters. I believe that this much cruelty and intensity has rarely been witnessed in modern times, and for that, alhamdulillah, we have raised a strong voice at the UN and expressed complete solidarity with our Palestinian brothers and sisters.” Conflict with India PM Shehbaz said that during his meeting with Trump, he also talked about the escalation with India, and how New Delhi weaponised the Indus Waters Treaty against the people of Pakistan. “[I talked about] the way our forces defeated India and, by the grace of Almighty Allah, made India learn a lesson which they will remember for a lifetime,” he said. “I also said that Pakistan won the war, by the grace of God, through our brave armed forces, who fought with great courage and outstanding professional equipment, led by Field Marshal Saeed Asim Munir, who led from the front and whose resolve was unwavering, and the entire nation was behind our own forces. “And our air forces, led by Air Marshal Zaheer Babar and his brave fighters, made a strong defence. The world came to realise that not only is Pakistan a nuclear power, but purely meant for our defence. And now the purpose: Pakistan is also very accomplished in traditional warfare, conservative warfare.” 2025 floods The premier said that while the country’s economy had become stabilised on a macro level, the effects of climate change were taking their toll. He talked about the massive floods in the country that have struck both the rural heartland and industrial centres for the first time in decades, causing billions of dollars in damage while straining food supplies, exports and a fragile economic recovery. “Unfortunately, due to climate change, which caused the recent floods, there has been much destruction,” he said. “In 2022, it caused devastation in Sindh; this time Punjab became the target of this flood due to which more than 1,000 people lost their lives, hundreds of thousands of people were injured, thousands of remote areas were submerged, farms were destroyed, and installations suffered immense damage, for which, at this time, we are collecting data to see how much loss has occurred. “But our spirits are high and we are facing this completely, and Inshallah we will overcome this and move forward,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Members of the Parliamentary Reporters Association of Pakistan (PRA) on Monday staged a mass walkout from a session of the National Assembly, over senior journalist Ijaz Ahmed allegedly being subjected to misbehaviour by PTI founder Imran Khan. According to Ahmed, who spoke to Dawn.com , the walkout was organised by the PRA Pakistan’s Election Committee. “[The] PTI founder hurled abuse at me for asking questions,” Ahmed said. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq directed Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to hold talks with PRA. During the walkout, the speaker noted that the PRA submitted a written complaint over the issue, which Tarar spoke about during his address. Later, the National Assembly released visuals of Ahmed meeting with Speaker Sadiq in his office. “It is your (reporters) right to protest and politics and journalism have a deep relationship,” the minister said, requesting that the reporters listen to what he has to say. “You have a valid complaint.” “A senior member of the PRA was involved in a verbal altercation at Adiala Jail with a senior leader who hurled foul language at him,” the law minister stated, not mentioning the PTI founder by name. “It is the job of reporters and journalists to criticise us and show us our reflection in the mirror. We should take this criticism to heart and not silence or attack them.” Tarar said that Ahmed requested the speaker’s office for permission to speak with Imran at Adiala and requested protection. “After the discussion and the way he (Ahmed) was abused, there was a social media onslaught targeting him,” Tarar added. “Posts said ‘Look at this man’s face’, ‘don’t forgive him’ and ‘look what he said about our Quaid ’. “This is a distinguished House and I must request that we behave democratically,” he said. “We need to prove through our own attitudes that we listen to other people and that there is room for decency and politics in this House.” PPP lawmaker Shazia Marri noted in her address that Ahmed is a renowned journalist in Islamabad and has links to Sindh. “In terms of his reporting, he is a decent journalist,” she said. “We may have differences of opinion, but in terms of his reporting and ethics, he is commendable.” Marri added that journalists expose problems plaguing the country and face issues while doing so. She also condemned people posting Ahmed’s face on social media and “making him a target of hate”. “We keep saying that they criticise politicians, but we criticise each other for not protecting journalists. Why do we forget to offer them protection?” After a recess, Ahmed himself spoke on the floor of the House and said that he had gone to Adiala Jail on the speaker’s request and heard from Khan about his treatment at Adiala Jail. “We told him that we would speak about this on the floor of the House,” Ahmed said. “He (Imran) had two demands: the first being that Ahmed speak about how no PTI members were part of an opposition delegation to visit him in jail. The other was that he wanted a resolution passed about this incident.” Imran also demanded that the Sindh government launch a “high-level investigation” into the murder of anchorperson Imtiaz Mir. Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) MNA Syed Aminul Haque, who was a part of the delegation, alleged that Imran hurled threats and foul language at Ahmed. “Immediately afterwards, we saw him being trolled on social and digital media,” Haque said, adding that the MQM condemned the incident. “People were trying to get his address and threaten his family. Journalists have a right to ask questions. People are free not to answer, but to threaten them and be rude is undemocratic.” A resolution was presented before the House condemning the verbal altercation and stating that not only did Imran use harsh language, but also launched a social media campaign against Ahmed and other senior journalists. It demanded that Ahmed and other journalists receive immediate protection, legal action be taken against those responsible and also condemned Mir’s murder in Karachi, demanding an investigation into the shooting. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, however, requested that the resolution not be presented because it would “ruin the atmosphere of the House”. “We pay tribute to the media; they have played a key role in highlighting our struggles and raising their voices for the people,” he said. “I was not able to meet [Imran] Khan sahib , so I wanted to know what happened. I reached to three of their (PRA) people. “A limited number of people are allowed at Adiala Jail,” he added. “We don’t know the exact words he used. We do not know what happened, we don’t even know what happens during jail trials.” The resolution was adopted after a vote, however, there was booing and hollering heard in the House. “If you are saying no, does that mean you are saying that what happened with Ijaz Ahmed was right?” Speaker Sadiq asked after the resolution was passed. Tarar took the floor once again, stating that he is one of those who has always tried to ensure that there is no pressure on the media. “We heard what the PTI chairman said and we will not say anything distressing, but a journalist came and spoke in parliament saying that he was called an ‘agent’,” he said. “We need to see how people who raise their voices are treated.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in May 9 cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act.",

      "summary_orig": "Emirati carrier Etihad Airways resumed flight operations to Peshawar on Monday, after a flight from Abu Dhabi landed at Bacha Khan International Airport, according to a statement from the Pakistan Aviation Authority (PAA). According to the statement, Etihad flight EY 276 from Abu Dhabi landed in Peshawar today and was welcomed with a traditional water salute by airport authorities, marking the first time the carrier has landed in the city since 2014. “Etihad Airways will now operate five weekly flights between Abu Dhabi and Peshawar on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday, departing [from] Peshawar as EY 277 at 8am,” the statement read. “These new connections provide passengers with greater choice, improved convenience, and enhanced global connectivity, reflecting PAA’s commitment to ensuring safe, efficient, and world-class airport operations,” it added. Etihad is the third international carrier to launch flight operations to Peshawar this year. In August, Flyadeal, the Saudi low-cost carrier, expanded its operations to Pakistan with inaugural flights landing in Islamabad and Peshawar. The aircraft from Riyadh landed ahead of schedule at 6:08am with 65 passengers on board and was accorded a traditional water salute. In May, Emirati low-cost airline Flydubai commenced operations at Bacha Khan International Airport, with the arrival of flight FZ-375 from Dubai. The inaugural flight carried 164 passengers and was welcomed with a celebratory water cannon salute. A cake-cutting ceremony followed, attended by senior officials, including the airport manager and representatives from Flydubai.",

      "summary_orig": "Sialkot police registered a first information report (FIR) on Monday against multiple suspects for allegedly vandalising the properties of and attacking the members of the Ahmadi community the previous night. The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com ,  was registered at Moutra police station on behalf of Sub-Inspector Amir Ali Sindhu. It invokes Sections 395 (punishment for dacoity), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharge of his duty), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy a house), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups), 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 324 (attempt to commit murder), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) and 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of a common object) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. In the FIR, the complainant said he, along with other policemen, was patrolling and checking security arrangements at Bhalowali Chowk on Sunday when they received reports around 8pm of some people having riled others up against the Ahmadi community and gathering them in large numbers at Piro Chak village. There were also reports of them looting and setting properties on fire. “When I reached the spot, around 200-250 people armed with weapons and sticks were present there,” he said, adding that upon seeing the police, they lunged toward them and snatched weapons from two of the policemen. According to the FIR, it was not possible for the police to immediately control the mob as law enforcement personnel were few in number. “So, I contacted the control room after which more personnel were sent,” the FIR quoted the complainant as saying. He added that there was commotion at the site of the incident as residents were “terrorised”. The complainant said the initial probe revealed that on September 21, a woman from the Ahmadi community had died in the village whose burial was not allowed. Meanwhile, he continued, “hatred on basis of religion and enmity” was promoted against the community, causing the law and order situation to deteriorate. Five people were injured during this, the complainant said, adding that they were sent to the hospital. The FIR said further facts of the incidents would become clear after the injured and affected people would be included in the inquiry. It alleged the suspects of “deliberately promoting enmity against the Ahmadi community”, hurting their sentiments, setting their properties on fire, looting them, opening fire on them with the intention to kill, attacking a police party and snatching weapons from them and spreading fear among the residents of the area where the incident took place. The complainant asked for an investigating officer to be assigned to probe the incident. Meanwhile, Sialkot District Police Officer (DPO) Faisal Shehzad told Dawn.com on Sunday night that eight people were injured in the incident, “five of whom are from the Ahmadi community and three from the TLP (Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan)”. He said among the injured from the Ahmadi community, one person was shot at, adding that condition of all the injured was stable. The DPO also said the issue began when the burial of an Ahmadi woman was not allowed at a graveyard established in 1945. Later, some members of the Ahmadi community tortured some others. Two cases were registered — one against the members of the Ahmadi community and another against their adversaries, he added. On Saturday, he continued, some members of the Ahmadi community “beat another person, following which TLP members set two to three of their farm houses and a shop on fire”. The official said they also “tortured” members of the Ahmadi community. “Anti-riot police were called and situation is now normal,” he said, adding that “a case will be registered against (members of) the TLP”. Sunday’s incident comes less than a months after 300 people were booked on terrorism charges in two cases for setting two worship places of the Ahmadi community on fire in Faisalabad. According to the FIRs, TLP ticket-holder Hafiz Rafaqat led the mob, which was armed with rods and bricks. Members of the community who tried to resist were severely beaten, leaving several injured. Previously in July, 51 people were arrested and 142 booked for attacking police and an Ahmadi place of worship in Daska. In April, a 46-year-old businessman was lynched when a few hundred supporters of the TLP had stormed a place of worship belonging to the Ahmadi community in Karachi’s Saddar area to prevent it from observing religious rituals.",

      "summary_orig": "Afghan political leaders and women activists on Monday opened a two-day dialogue in Islamabad to explore ways for “shaping a collective, regionally supported vision for Afghanistan’s peaceful future”, according to organisers. Pakistan and Afghanistan have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee and upgrading diplomatic ranks. This is the first ever gathering of political opponents of the Afghan Taliban since their takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, which organisers insist is “not against the Taliban government.” They argued that the primary aim of the moot was to “promote inclusive and constructive discussions among leaders, including men and women from diverse segments of society in Afghanistan, to develop a shared understanding and identify common principles for Afghanistan’s future stability, inclusivity, and peaceful settlement,” the organisers said in a statement. The dialogue was previously scheduled on Aug 25-26 but was postponed, apparently over criticism by some known personalities, including Zalmay Khalilzad, the former United States special envoy. Khalilzad had termed the meeting “unwise” due to the participation of some who oppose the Taliban. “Afghan citizens are entitled to their political views, but Pakistan’s seeming support of them by hosting their conference is hugely unwise and an intended provocation,” he wrote on X. Former Afghan parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi opposed the remarks, saying, “Isn’t it time to let us craft what is good for us?” The first day of the closed-door meeting was dedicated to Afghan leaders to “engage openly, exchange perspectives and define shared principles for stability, rule of law, and reaffirming the support to women’s rights and inclusion”, according to the organisers. Dawn.com has seen a list of 37 Afghans invited to the event. They were part of the previous governments of Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, including governors, ministers, lawmakers and women activists. A participant said some of the invitees were not attending the meeting due to visa issues. “The aim of this timely and important dialogue is to promote an inclusive dialogue among diverse groups of Afghan leaders (women and men) alongside Pakistani counterparts to foster inclusive dialogue, mutual understanding and lasting cooperation,” the organisers said. Women for Afghanistan (WFA) and the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (Sassi) University jointly held the first Regional Dialogue titled “Towards Unity and Trust”. Koofi, who leads WFA, lives in exile and has organised a series of meetings, mainly comprising women activists against the Taliban policies. She is one of the critics of Taliban rule. Dr Maria Sultan, a defence analyst, heads Sassi. On the second day, on September 30th, a Joint Pak-Afghan Session will hold “focused discussions aimed at building trust, identifying common ground and advancing a people-centric approach to address regional challenges”. The organisers, while explaining the objectives of the dialogue, say that the event is aimed at strengthening cooperation between Afghan and Pakistani leaders. The dialogue will also promote sustainable development, stability and peace rooted in shared values and highlight the importance of women’s participation and inclusive governance. The gathering would encourage regional cooperation with a focus on economic development and trust-building, the statement added. “The dialogue underscores a simple truth: peace between people leads to peace between nations. By prioritising dialogue, inclusivity and cooperation, WFA and SASSI University believe this initiative can pave the way for stronger, more mutually beneficial relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, grounded in unity and trust.“ In addition, the event will be helpful in fostering a deeper understanding between the people of the two nations for a more sustained development and peace in the region. “The commonality and the importance of the dialogue and the process stems from the need that Afghans must have the space to speak, engage and think together to promote their common values and interests for their country and their people,“ it added. The dialogue will also serve to identify common grounds for cooperation between Afghan leaders and their Pakistani counterparts on an engagement basis of developing people-centric approaches to find common solutions for regional challenges and to build trust and stability, the statement said. “We believe that a more people-centric approach focused on economic development and regional cooperation will lead to an enhanced and meaningful relationship between the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.” Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul in July, where an agreement was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity. Later that month, Dar said Pakistan received “recent assurances” from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be used for terrorism. Islamabad has repeatedly demanded that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). In January, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the only point of contention between the two countries was the presence of the TTP and cross-border attacks.",

Women for Afghanistan (WFA) and the South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (Sassi) University jointly held the first Regional Dialogue titled “Towards Unity and Trust”. Koofi, who leads WFA, lives in exile and has organised a series of meetings, mainly comprising women activists against the Taliban policies. She is one of the critics of Taliban rule. Dr Maria Sultan, a defence analyst, heads Sassi. On the second day, on September 30th, a Joint Pak-Afghan Session will hold “focused discussions aimed at building trust, identifying common ground and advancing a people-centric approach to address regional challenges”. The organisers, while explaining the objectives of the dialogue, say that the event is aimed at strengthening cooperation between Afghan and Pakistani leaders. The dialogue will also promote sustainable development, stability and peace rooted in shared values and highlight the importance of women’s participation and inclusive governance. The gathering would encourage regional cooperation with a focus on economic development and trust-building, the statement added. “The dialogue underscores a simple truth: peace between people leads to peace between nations. By prioritising dialogue, inclusivity and cooperation, WFA and SASSI University believe this initiative can pave the way for stronger, more mutually beneficial relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan, grounded in unity and trust.“ In addition, the event will be helpful in fostering a deeper understanding between the people of the two nations for a more sustained development and peace in the region. “The commonality and the importance of the dialogue and the process stems from the need that Afghans must have the space to speak, engage and think together to promote their common values and interests for their country and their people,“ it added. The dialogue will also serve to identify common grounds for cooperation between Afghan leaders and their Pakistani counterparts on an engagement basis of developing people-centric approaches to find common solutions for regional challenges and to build trust and stability, the statement said. “We believe that a more people-centric approach focused on economic development and regional cooperation will lead to an enhanced and meaningful relationship between the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.” Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul in July, where an agreement was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity. Later that month, Dar said Pakistan received “recent assurances” from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be used for terrorism. Islamabad has repeatedly demanded that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). In January, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the only point of contention between the two countries was the presence of the TTP and cross-border attacks.",

      "summary_orig": "Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Mohsin Naqvi on Monday warned India against “dragging war” into sports, saying that doing so only exposed the neighbouring country’s “desperation” in a response aimed at Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who politicised India’s Asia Cup final win against Pakistan. In a post on X on Sunday night, Modi had congratulated the Indian cricket team on scoring a win in the final against the Green Shirts, calling it a continuation of India’s Operation Sindoor — an operation that was launched against Pakistan during the four-day military conflict between the two countries in May. “ #OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he said. In response to Modi’s post, Naqvi said, “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”. “Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he said. The exchange also follows the Indian cricket team refusing to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. “I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said on Sunday night. PCB donates match fee to May 7 victims Separately, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday that it would donate the team’s match fees to the civilians martyred during the May 7 Indian attack on Pakistan, after India’s SuryaKumar Yadav announced that he would donate his match fee to victims on the Indian side. In a post on X, the the cricketing board said, “The Pakistan Cricket Team has dedicated its Asia Cup final match fees to the innocent victims martyred in the May 7 attack, in which civilians, including children, lost their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.” India’s actions ‘disrespected cricket’: Salman Agha Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Agha said that India’s actions had “disrespected cricket” while speaking to reporters after the match, accroding to AFP . “I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” Agha said. “If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.” “What they did today, a good team doesn’t do that. Good teams do what we have done. We waited for our medals and took them. “It’s been seen for the first time. I do not know where it will stop. What has happened in this tournament is bad for cricket,” he said. Meanwhile, Yadav claimed that India was “denied” the trophy, but then went on to say that the team “took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy”. “If you tell me about the trophies, my trophies are sitting in my dressing room — all the 14 players and support staff. They are the real trophies for me,” said Yadav. ‘Lack of sportsmanship’ Although the Pakistan-India matches went ahead despite calls from the Indian side to boycott them, all three were marred by controversy and high tensions between the two countries in the wake of their four-day military standoff in May. India displayed consistent hostility towards the Pakistan team throughout each of their clashes, including refusing to shake hands with the players at the end of the games. In addition, after the first victory against Pakistan on September 14, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was accused of politicising the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May, for which India blamed Islamabad without evidence. Naqvi had expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X and lodged a complaint with the ICC, which launched a probe into the remarks. Further, during the September 21 match , when the rivals met for the second time, Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the match. The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention . Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.",

Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he said. In response to Modi’s post, Naqvi said, “If war was your measure of pride, history already records your humiliating defeats at Pakistan’s hands,” in an apparent reference to Pakistan’s success during the conflict. He added that “no cricket match can rewrite that truth”. “Dragging war into sport only exposes desperation and disgraces the very spirit of the game,” he said. The exchange also follows the Indian cricket team refusing to collect the winners’ trophy from Naqvi, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. “I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said on Sunday night. PCB donates match fee to May 7 victims Separately, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Monday that it would donate the team’s match fees to the civilians martyred during the May 7 Indian attack on Pakistan, after India’s SuryaKumar Yadav announced that he would donate his match fee to victims on the Indian side. In a post on X, the the cricketing board said, “The Pakistan Cricket Team has dedicated its Asia Cup final match fees to the innocent victims martyred in the May 7 attack, in which civilians, including children, lost their lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families.” India’s actions ‘disrespected cricket’: Salman Agha Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Agha said that India’s actions had “disrespected cricket” while speaking to reporters after the match, accroding to AFP . “I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing,” Agha said. “If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.” “What they did today, a good team doesn’t do that. Good teams do what we have done. We waited for our medals and took them. “It’s been seen for the first time. I do not know where it will stop. What has happened in this tournament is bad for cricket,” he said. Meanwhile, Yadav claimed that India was “denied” the trophy, but then went on to say that the team “took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy”. “If you tell me about the trophies, my trophies are sitting in my dressing room — all the 14 players and support staff. They are the real trophies for me,” said Yadav. ‘Lack of sportsmanship’ Although the Pakistan-India matches went ahead despite calls from the Indian side to boycott them, all three were marred by controversy and high tensions between the two countries in the wake of their four-day military standoff in May. India displayed consistent hostility towards the Pakistan team throughout each of their clashes, including refusing to shake hands with the players at the end of the games. In addition, after the first victory against Pakistan on September 14, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was accused of politicising the win by dedicating it to the victims of the Pahalgam terrorist attack in May, for which India blamed Islamabad without evidence. Naqvi had expressed disappointment over the “lack of sportsmanship” in a post on X and lodged a complaint with the ICC, which launched a probe into the remarks. Further, during the September 21 match , when the rivals met for the second time, Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the match. The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention . Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement (SMDA), signed at Al Yamamah Palace on Sept 17, is an inflection point for the bilateral relationship as well as the broader region. The pact’s core commitment is unambiguous: an attack on one will be treated as an attack on both. That collective-defence clause matters in a region recalibrating its security architecture and hedging against external shocks. But the real test of this agreement lies in how Islamabad and Riyadh can pivot from security symbolism to a joint economic mission anchored in reform, productivity and strategic integration across the security, industrial, and technological domains. This requires Pakistan and Saudi Arabia working across multiple pillars to pursue economic, defence, and technological integration between the two economies. The strategy should be anchored in a clear economic agenda aligned with both countries’ need to reorient their economies. On the Saudi side, this reorientation requires investments in building a competitive industrial and digital ecosystem, and on the Pakistani side, the goal is to generate economic growth through sectors that expand the country’s ability to sustainably earn foreign exchange. Given this need, a Pakistani strategy that chases cheap loans, deferred oil payments or one-off discounts from Saudi Arabia in lieu of the SDMA would be futile and disastrous. The Saudis have clearly signalled that the era of handouts is over, and Pakistani policymakers should pay heed to this signalling. The need of the hour therefore is to pursue a strategy that plugs Pakistan into Saudi Arabia’s investment, technology and supply-chain ambitions. This would require doing the hard work at home to direct Saudi capital into sectors that deliver mutually beneficial outcomes for both nations. The big picture Within this context, the defence track can be a bridge to industrial cooperation and economic integration. As Dr Jamal Al Harbi, the Saudi Media Attaché in Islamabad put it in a recent article, the pact “includes defence industry collaboration, with potential for technology transfer and co-production of military equipment, as well as capacity building and training, building on the longstanding tradition of Pakistani military personnel working with Saudi forces.” This perspective points to a broader state of play between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, and if pursued effectively, the SDMA is likely to lead to a strategic embrace that links security with industrial production, technology cooperation, and defence integration. The first area of focus must be Pakistan’s energy markets, which remain trapped in a cycle of inefficiency, political paralysis, and circular debt. An ambitious deregulation programme to open the entire energy value chain, including oil, gas, refineries, and battery energy storage, would help attract Saudi capital under clear, rules-based frameworks. For this to work, Islamabad would need to commit to time-bound reforms, ensure predictable contract enforcement, and empower regulators while disempowering the administrative state that insists on running the energy ecosystem, to disastrous effects. This initiative should also look at emerging technologies in energy, including electric vehicles, battery energy storage, and decentralised grids. Such a programme would provide Riyadh the opportunity to acquire long-duration assets in Pakistan. It would also align with Vision 2030’s ambition to make Saudi Arabia an international investor in energy and industrial platforms, especially in emerging energy solutions. For Pakistan, it promises stable supplies, reduced fiscal pressure, and a credible pathway for private capital to flow into a critical sector that is in dire need of reforms. In addition, Saudi capital can support Pakistan to build a future ready clean energy ecosystem paired with electric vehicles and large-scale battery energy storage capabilities. Secondly, as articulated by Dr Al Harbi, the defence pact should evolve into industrial co-production. Aligning with Saudi Arabia’s defence-localisation targets, Pakistan can set up co-production hubs for drones, conventional platforms, secure communications, and cyber capabilities. These facilities would need to emphasise local content, testing and qualification labs, and joint research and development. Other partners could also be plugged into this framework — some of this is already being signalled — creating a regional defence industrial ecosystem over the coming years that would allow for diversification of supply-chains and greater interoperability. For Riyadh, this initiative would help diversify supply chains while advancing sovereign capabilities consistent with Vision 2030. For Pakistan, it provides industrial upgrading, skilled jobs, and technological gains that can spill over into other sectors and bilateral relationships. The third pillar is investment, particularly through the Public Investment Fund (PIF). In addition to the energy sector, PIF investments can be directed into Pakistan’s emerging critical minerals sectors, including copper, gold, and rare earths, as well as initiatives for defence cooperation. Pakistan is already collaborating with the United States on critical minerals and mining, and bringing in PIF would further diversify interests and investments in Pakistan. As Barrick Mining’s flagship Reko Diq project becomes operational, its success can be leveraged to access PIF investment for processing and value-add capabilities in the mining sector. For Saudi Arabia, such investments would help secure inputs for electric vehicles, defence systems, and clean-energy supply chains, while creating deal flow for PIF and companies like Ma’aden. For Pakistan, the flow of funds would lead to sustainable exports, adding to overall macroeconomic stability while lowering risk premium for finance and crowding in other investors. In addition, scaling up defence industrial capabilities would add to the country’s overall ability to defend itself and deter its rivals in the region. The fourth opportunity lies in skills and technology. Both countries need to build their capacities when it comes to artificial intelligence, fintech, cybersecurity, and data processing at scale. This initiative could be led through joint startup accelerators in Riyadh, Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad, along with reciprocal seed funds to support founders building products for the region. Such an initiative would help support Riyadh’s needs for securing access to a young and cost-effective talent pool that can power Vision 2030’s execution. For Pakistan, it would add further momentum to the country’s emerging information technology sector, creating middle-class jobs that earn foreign exchange while embedding the country’s technology firms in regional innovation. Opportunities for fintech The final pillar should seek to build joint capabilities around financial technology and inclusion. Pakistan is one of the largest recipients of remittances from Saudi Arabia, yet much of these flows remain expensive. A dedicated fintech vertical that is designed to cut financial friction within both economies, as well as in the flow of remittances, would be extremely impactful. In a world where Pakistani talent integrates with Saudi Arabia’s technology ecosystem, the increase in financial flows would require even greater investments in financial integration and innovation. By linking Saudi fintechs and banks directly with Pakistani institutions, and integrating instant payments, shared e-KYC, and robust AML protocols, both countries could benefit. Pakistan would see billions of dollars move into the formal economy, stabilising foreign-exchange reserves and improving worker welfare. Saudi Arabia would deepen its fintech ecosystem, while offering faster, more transparent channels for its expatriate community. The additional dividends through the development of credit histories for workers, wage-linked savings, and micro-insurance would create a virtuous cycle of financial inclusion. All of this, however, will remain aspirational unless anchored in credible execution. What Pakistan needs is the discipline to turn this defence pact into an economic one that advances reform, productivity, and integration into regional value chains. If pursued with clarity, the SMDA could be remembered not just as a security commitment, but as the moment Islamabad and Riyadh truly began to reshape their economies together through integration. But if leveraged to secure access to cheap financial bailouts and discounted oil, the SDMA is likely to lead to disappointing outcomes.

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Imran Nazir said on Monday that the province was extending the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign until Wednesday, hoping to achieve a target of 100 per cent. Earlier in September, Pakistan rolled out the HPV vaccine nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities. “Success rate in Punjab has been 72pc,” Punjab’s health minister said during an interview with Geo News show “Geo Pakistan”. “But we have not ended the campaign; instead, we have extended it for three days.” He added, “The primary reason is that if we administer this vaccine to our girls now, those aged 9 to 14 will get it for free. But after the campaign ends, people will have to pay money for it, and only 9-year-old girls will be able to get it free of charge.” Referring to the attacks on women health workers while administering vaccines in Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin district, the minister said he has ensured the suspects were arrested and that security measures have been put in place to protect health workers. In the latest incident this week, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor. He said the rate of refusals was greater at the beginning of the campaign, with only 250,000 girls receiving the vaccine on the first day. However, towards the end, the number of refusals dropped to 90,000 from 300,000 after counselling was provided through their teams. “More than 5.2 million girls have been vaccinated; however, our target was 7.2 million, which we hope to achieve by Wednesday,” the minister said.",

According to a statement issued on Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned the NA session at the Parliament House on Monday (today) at 5 pm. Before the sitting, a meeting of parliamentary leaders summoned by Speaker Ayaz Sadiq will be held at 4pm to finalise the agenda. Another highlight of the session would be PML-N leader Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry thanking the president for his address to both houses on March 10. The NA meeting comes amid disagreements between the PML-N and PPP on flood relief measures. Parliamentary experts believe that both sides will again exchange barbs regarding the proposed use of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to help flood victims — a move opposed by some in the government. The issue of current tensions in AJK and a protest scheduled for today (Monday) by the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee will also likely be discussed in the house. Govt to table three bills; speaker calls meeting ahead of session to ‘finalise’ agenda The government is also likely to take credit for its recent foreign policy achievements. Three bills to be moved The government is also expected to table three bills. On the first day, state minister for finance and revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani will move a bill for reforms of the regulatory regime applicable to business, trade and investment by removing complex regulatory requirements and to establish the Pakistan Regulatory Registry and Pakistan Business Portal (Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025). Senator Ahad Cheema will seek amendments to the Civil Servants Act 1973 through the Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill 2025. Housing minister Riaz Hussain Pirzada will table the Pakistan Infrastructure Deve­lopment and Assets Management Authority Bill 2025 for the establishment of the assets management authority. In a calling attention notice, MNA Riaz Fatyana will invite the attention of the minister-in-charge of the Cabinet Secretariat to the “poor performance” of the NDMA in Kamalia, Pir Mehal, Tandlianwala and Chichawatni in Toba Tek Singh during the recent floods. Likewise, MNA Anjum Aqeel Khan will invite the attention of the interior minister to the delay in payment to persons whose land was acquired by Islamabad CDA in sectors E-12, C-13, C-14, C-15, C-16 and H-16.

      "summary_orig": "The closing ceremony of the men’s Asia Cup descended into farce on Sunday as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from Asian Cricket Council chief Mohsin Naqvi, as politics continued to spill over the pitch. India had earlier beaten Pakistan by five wickets in the last over after a close contest to win a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, but they caused the post-final formalities to be inordinately delayed due to their refusal to budge from their stance. There were no customary handshakes between the teams after India refused, with tensions high from their previous two clashes in the competition, which witnessed political posturing and aggressive on-field behaviour. The Asia Cup saw the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Naqvi, who is also the Interior Minister, was supposed to present the winners’ trophy, but there were indications that India would resent that when their captain Suryakumar Yadav did not participate in the customary pre-toss photoshoot before the final. “I have been informed by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,” Simon Doull, who conducted the post-match presentation, said. When asked about his refusal to collect the trophy at the post-match press conference and their actions leading to the politicisation of the game, the Indian skipper declined to answer the question. The post-final ceremony saw Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha receive the runners-up trophy while Indian players Tilak Varma, Kuldeep Yadav and Abhishek Sharma collect their respective individual awards. India’s refusal to collect the trophy from Naqvi marks a historic low in the cricketing relations between the neighbours, with the game having acted as a stage for diplomacy in the past. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also made a political reference in his post on X congratulating the Indian team. “Operation Sindoor on the game’s field. Outcome is the same — India wins! Congrats to our cricketers,” he wrote. Suryakumar’s men had earlier capped a remarkable unbeaten run with their third victory against Pakistan at the Asia Cup. Put into bat, Pakistan could not capitalise on an 84-run opening stand between Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) and were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings. Pakistan lost their last nine wickets for 33 runs in a spectacular meltdown, with India’s left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) being the wrecker-in-chief. The Green Shirts struck back to leave India reeling at 20-3 with their top 3, including captain Suryakumar Yadav, back in the dugout. India lost their in-form opener Abhishek Sharma, also the tournament’s leading scorer, and the skipper inside the first 10 deliveries of their innings. Varma and Sanju Samson (24) got to rebuilding the innings. Even that recovery would not have been possible but for the reprieve Samson, then on 12, got when Hussain Talat dropped him in the deep. Abrar Ahmed dismissed Samson to break the 57-run stand, but Shivam Dube (33) combined with Varma to take India closer to the target before falling in the penultimate over. Needing 10 runs from the last over from Haris Rauf, Varma hit the second ball for a six to effectively seal India’s thrilling victory and triggering wild celebrations in the Indian camp. “It’s a tough pill to swallow,” Pakistan captain Salman said at the presentation ceremony. “We could not finish well in the batting. Bowling, we gave everything. If we could have finished well, it would have been a different story. “We could not rotate the strike properly, and we lost too many wickets. That was the reason we could not score what we wanted. We have to sort out our batting very soon. They bowled really well, outstandingly well. They needed 63 off six overs. I thought we had the game. The bowlers bowled really well; we have to give them credit, but the batting was a concern. “We fought really well. We are proud as a team. So much to look forward to, we will improve and come back stronger.”",
