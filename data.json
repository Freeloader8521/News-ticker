      "summary_orig": "Karachi police arrested 45 people participating in the Sindh Culture Day rally on Sunday, after people allegedly pelted police personnel with stones. South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that upon being attacked by participants, police responded with a baton charge and tear gas shelling. “We detained 45 people on Sharea Faisal,” DIG Raza said. “The South SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) is at the scene, and the situation is under control.” The DIG said that since the Red Zone has been closed, alternative traffic routes are being provided for citizens and commuters. He added that the law enforcers asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the main Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”. “They allegedly pelted stones on the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he said, adding that it prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them. According to police sources, participants at the rally were arguing with police over being stopped and that dispute escalated into stone-throwing. Asked as to why the law enforcers blocked the road at the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover, DIG Raza said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the Cultural Day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intend to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal. “In view of certain past untoward incidents, the law enforcers were asked to ensure that no participant was allowed to move beyond FTC under any circumstances, as the area ahead leads into the Red Zone, which contains sensitive installations. “Thus, the police and rangers were deployed at the FTC bridge to enforce the diversion and prevent any unauthorised movement.” Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took strict notice of the incident on Sharea Faisal and ordered immediate action against those involved, according to a statement from his office. In a phone call with the additional inspector general, Lanjar ordered, “Those damaging police vehicles and citizens’ property should be arrested immediately.” Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh. Raza recalled that in 2023, during Sindh Cultural Day celebrations, there were violent confrontations between law enforcers and protesters in which a first information report was also registered. Similarly, last year, Raza said a police van was damaged, and police personnel were manhandled, while some of the protestors managed to cross into the Red Zone and reached the KPC via Jinnah Bridge. “Around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached the Fawara Chowk and KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants,” he said.

      "title_orig": "PTI under fire as political figures show solidarity with armed forces, assail party for alleged conspiracy",
      "summary_orig": "Lawmakers from across the political spectrum closed ranks behind Pakistan’s armed forces on Sunday, criticising the PTI for what they described as an orchestrated attempt to malign state institutions and an alleged conspiracy against Pakistan. A day earlier, the PTI had lashed out at a press briefing by the military’s media wing, calling it “inappropriate and unfortunate” after the spokesperson accused incarcerated Imran Khan of being a “narcissist” and a “mentally ill person” who was edging into “ security threat ” territory through his persistent anti-army rhetoric. Taking to the X platform, PML-N leader and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal called Imran’s political rhetoric “a deeply irresponsible and dangerous trend that seeks to undermine Pakistan’s state institutions, weaken national cohesion, and erode public trust in the armed forces who defend our borders with courage and sacrifice.” “Political differences are part of any democracy—but when politics crosses the line into anti-state narrative building, deliberate misinformation, and attacks on the integrity of Pakistan’s Armed Forces and its leadership, it threatens the stability, security, and unity of the country,” he wrote. Iqbal added that no leader had the right to weaponise divisive rhetoric for personal gain at the cost of Pakistan’s national security. “The Pakistan Army is a professional, disciplined, and patriotic institution that has stood as the shield of this nation, from fighting terrorism to defending territorial sovereignty. “Attempting to malign the armed forces or create discord between the people and their defenders serves only the agenda of Pakistan’s enemies,” he said, adding that he “strongly condemned Imran’s “continued politics of hate, distortion, and incitement against the state and state institutions.” ‘Another conspiracy against Pakistan?’ — MQM-P The leadership of Muttah­ida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) also called out the PTI for “deviating from a political route and resorting to the politics of the streets to cause instability in the country”. “The PTI has continued its politics of hurling allegations, and instead of choosing the right forum to address those allegations, it used it to create political instability in the country,” MQM-P Chairman Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said during a press conference in Karachi. “During this time, when all parliamentarians on both sides of the spectrum should have stood with the armed forces, the leadership of the armed forces, and the political leadership of the country, a campaign was instead initiated over the last two days, giving way to fears that there might be some foreign elements involved in all of this,” he said. Siddiqui went on to say that all political parties could have different viewpoints and even different dreams for Pakistan’s future, “but whenever the country found itself in crisis, all political parties are seen to be standing together.” “Even when PTI needed us, all political parties, including us, stood with them. Did we ever say we would not speak to political forces despite being part of the political force ourselves?” he questioned. He continued: “So, I would also expect from the government that the anti-Pakistan rhetoric, and the campaign which is being led from outside Pakistan, should be carefully observed. Is this creating grounds for another conspiracy against Pakistan?” He said that MQM-P, for the sake of Pakistan’s dignity, honour, respect, and prosperity, invites all political parties to come and sit together and talk about it. “It is indeed the responsibility of all parties that if anyone is working against the interest of Pakistan, we should not only identify it, but also take action against it. “Today, there is democracy in Pakistan, so democratic forces should together tackle those who, under the guise of democracy, are harming Pakistan owing to their ego or at someone’s direction. There is a need for a joint, united struggle against all such attempts.” ‘Propaganda against armed forces in line with hostile agencies’ agenda’: — Bugti Balochistan Chief Minister and PPP leader Sarfaraz Bugti also assailed Imran for “spreading propaganda against the army and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies.” Speaking during a press conference in Islamabad, he said that today, the nation needed to stand with its security forces more than ever before, as two provinces were facing a serious insurgency. “In this situation, the nation has to choose, and the nation has chosen to stand with its forces. I can tell you about Balochistan, that the people of Balochistan have been with their forces, they are with the forces, and will be with the forces,” he asserted, adding that there was an urgent need to “abandon the narrative which was weakening the state.” Referring to Imran, he said, “The popular leader you talk about, his kids are in London and on the other hand, every single day, people’s sons in the Pakistan Army — the captains, the majors, and the colonels are sacrificing their lives for the sake of the country’s security and for our future. “Spreading propaganda against them and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies … this is an intelligence-driven war against Pakistan. Why are we becoming part of it? Our state should always be above our politics. Because if there is no state, there will be nothing.” ‘Had you listened to me then, we would not have anarchy, terrorism’: Hanif Abbasi Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi assailed Imran during a press conference in Rawalpindi, calling him a “threat to national security” and stating that had his claims about the ex-premier receiving funding from India and Israel been taken seriously, Pakistan would not be in the state it is now. “I filed a case against you,” Abbasi said, addressing the PTI founder and referring to a legal case about the PTI receiving foreign funding and “compromising” patriotism. “I had said that the PTI was receiving Indian and Israeli money. This was proven. I took the foreign funding case to the Supreme Court,” he added. “Had the decision been made then and had he (Imran) been disqualified, then there would not be anarchy or terrorism.” Echoing the words of Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the railways minister called Imran a “mental patient” and slammed him for a social media post against the armed forces. He also assailed Imran’s family for giving interviews to Afghan and Indian media. “His children appear on Afghan media, his sisters appear on Indian media. What’s going on here?” Abbasi asked. “You (Imran) have not been punished or mistreated. You cannot handle jail, and you’re threatening national security.” The minister added that Imran’s post targeted an entire institution rather than one person and added that since becoming an atomic power, Pakistan’s institutions have been targeted by foreign states. “If you were only against one person, you’d pray for martyrs, you would not say that MNAs going into NDU (National Defence University) are traitors because they met officers,” Abbasi stated. He then turned his attention to Imran’s sisters, who appeared on Indian media outlets to give interviews and were the target of criticism by the government for “defaming Pakistan”. The minister stated that the PTI founder’s sisters “said that the whole of India is crying for Imran Khan” and slammed them for “worshipping” the powers that be. “If they meet you, then all is good, but if they don’t, then you are ready to threaten our nation’s security,” Abbasi said. “Your true face has been exposed in front of the world — you targeted your heroes,” he added. “If you are against one person, that’s fine, but you targeted monuments to martyrs, GHQ, Corps Commander House. You did what our enemies hoped to achieve.“ “My point is that I cannot understand how someone who plays with our national security is a Pakistani. They can be a traitor or a mental patient, but not a Pakistani.” ‘Imran always stood firm for country’: PTI Reacting to Abbasi’s presser, PTI, in a statement, said that “it would be difficult for individuals like Abbasi to understand that Imran always stood firm for his country, its institutions, and the people of Pakistan at every forum.” “Imran Khan was the one who achieved diplomatic, military and narrative advantage over India and defended Pakistan’s stance at the global stage,” the statement said, adding that Imran strengthened the credibility of national institutions. “However government was trying to portray that every dissenting voice was against the state,” the statement added. Replying to allegations related to India and the Indian media, the PTI alleged that “Pakistan’s history was quite clear that the Sharif family had business dealings with Indian businessmen and personal relations with Narendra Modi.” The statement further claimed that Imran’s only “crime” was that he was “the most popular leader struggling for genuine freedom.” ‘Politically charged’ press conference During PTI’s Saturday press conference at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, PTI interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan said it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, after the DG ISPR called Imran “a mental patient“ for his constant anti-army rhetoric. Lt Gen Chaudhry said that whenever the PTI founder posted something on social media against the army chief, Indian media and the accounts linked to the Indian-intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were making the posts viral. “The Indian media is reporting against your army chief with such happiness. Who is providing this narrative to them? They air this narrative for hours. Why are they spending so much money on spreading the narrative of this delusional mindset of this narcissist? There is one reason, because he (Imran) is speaking against the army and its chief. He is talking about creating a rift between the Pakistani army and the public,” the DG ISPR said. In response, Gohar said that “ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction, adding there was still time for tone to be eased and for steps to improve the current situation.” The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role. He added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but the ISPR chief’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”. On the other hand, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said Imran was not a national security threat, but he had kept the people united. “Do not drive away the people of Pakistan; they stand with Imran Khan and the PTI,” he said, adding that there were many narratives in the country, including along ethnic and sectarian lines, yet Imran had rejected all of them to stand with the narrative of Pakistan. “For God’s sake, don’t do this. You will not be able to minus Imran Khan, but God forbid if you do, it will be very difficult to keep this country’s interests united.” He termed the ISPR DG’s press conference “unfortunate” and added that the party will not answer the accusation and charges levelled against the PTI founder. “Today we are being told that the country’s most popular leader is a national security threat, which is ridiculous, but this has not been said for the first time.”",

Iqbal added that no leader had the right to weaponise divisive rhetoric for personal gain at the cost of Pakistan’s national security. “The Pakistan Army is a professional, disciplined, and patriotic institution that has stood as the shield of this nation, from fighting terrorism to defending territorial sovereignty. “Attempting to malign the armed forces or create discord between the people and their defenders serves only the agenda of Pakistan’s enemies,” he said, adding that he “strongly condemned Imran’s “continued politics of hate, distortion, and incitement against the state and state institutions.” ‘Another conspiracy against Pakistan?’ — MQM-P The leadership of Muttah­ida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) also called out the PTI for “deviating from a political route and resorting to the politics of the streets to cause instability in the country”. “The PTI has continued its politics of hurling allegations, and instead of choosing the right forum to address those allegations, it used it to create political instability in the country,” MQM-P Chairman Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said during a press conference in Karachi. “During this time, when all parliamentarians on both sides of the spectrum should have stood with the armed forces, the leadership of the armed forces, and the political leadership of the country, a campaign was instead initiated over the last two days, giving way to fears that there might be some foreign elements involved in all of this,” he said. Siddiqui went on to say that all political parties could have different viewpoints and even different dreams for Pakistan’s future, “but whenever the country found itself in crisis, all political parties are seen to be standing together.” “Even when PTI needed us, all political parties, including us, stood with them. Did we ever say we would not speak to political forces despite being part of the political force ourselves?” he questioned. He continued: “So, I would also expect from the government that the anti-Pakistan rhetoric, and the campaign which is being led from outside Pakistan, should be carefully observed. Is this creating grounds for another conspiracy against Pakistan?” He said that MQM-P, for the sake of Pakistan’s dignity, honour, respect, and prosperity, invites all political parties to come and sit together and talk about it. “It is indeed the responsibility of all parties that if anyone is working against the interest of Pakistan, we should not only identify it, but also take action against it. “Today, there is democracy in Pakistan, so democratic forces should together tackle those who, under the guise of democracy, are harming Pakistan owing to their ego or at someone’s direction. There is a need for a joint, united struggle against all such attempts.” ‘Propaganda against armed forces in line with hostile agencies’ agenda’: — Bugti Balochistan Chief Minister and PPP leader Sarfaraz Bugti also assailed Imran for “spreading propaganda against the army and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies.” Speaking during a press conference in Islamabad, he said that today, the nation needed to stand with its security forces more than ever before, as two provinces were facing a serious insurgency. “In this situation, the nation has to choose, and the nation has chosen to stand with its forces. I can tell you about Balochistan, that the people of Balochistan have been with their forces, they are with the forces, and will be with the forces,” he asserted, adding that there was an urgent need to “abandon the narrative which was weakening the state.” Referring to Imran, he said, “The popular leader you talk about, his kids are in London and on the other hand, every single day, people’s sons in the Pakistan Army — the captains, the majors, and the colonels are sacrificing their lives for the sake of the country’s security and for our future. “Spreading propaganda against them and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies … this is an intelligence-driven war against Pakistan. Why are we becoming part of it? Our state should always be above our politics. Because if there is no state, there will be nothing.” ‘Had you listened to me then, we would not have anarchy, terrorism’: Hanif Abbasi Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi assailed Imran during a press conference in Rawalpindi, calling him a “threat to national security” and stating that had his claims about the ex-premier receiving funding from India and Israel been taken seriously, Pakistan would not be in the state it is now. “I filed a case against you,” Abbasi said, addressing the PTI founder and referring to a legal case about the PTI receiving foreign funding and “compromising” patriotism. “I had said that the PTI was receiving Indian and Israeli money. This was proven. I took the foreign funding case to the Supreme Court,” he added. “Had the decision been made then and had he (Imran) been disqualified, then there would not be anarchy or terrorism.” Echoing the words of Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the railways minister called Imran a “mental patient” and slammed him for a social media post against the armed forces. He also assailed Imran’s family for giving interviews to Afghan and Indian media. “His children appear on Afghan media, his sisters appear on Indian media. What’s going on here?” Abbasi asked. “You (Imran) have not been punished or mistreated. You cannot handle jail, and you’re threatening national security.” The minister added that Imran’s post targeted an entire institution rather than one person and added that since becoming an atomic power, Pakistan’s institutions have been targeted by foreign states. “If you were only against one person, you’d pray for martyrs, you would not say that MNAs going into NDU (National Defence University) are traitors because they met officers,” Abbasi stated. He then turned his attention to Imran’s sisters, who appeared on Indian media outlets to give interviews and were the target of criticism by the government for “defaming Pakistan”. The minister stated that the PTI founder’s sisters “said that the whole of India is crying for Imran Khan” and slammed them for “worshipping” the powers that be. “If they meet you, then all is good, but if they don’t, then you are ready to threaten our nation’s security,” Abbasi said. “Your true face has been exposed in front of the world — you targeted your heroes,” he added. “If you are against one person, that’s fine, but you targeted monuments to martyrs, GHQ, Corps Commander House. You did what our enemies hoped to achieve.“ “My point is that I cannot understand how someone who plays with our national security is a Pakistani. They can be a traitor or a mental patient, but not a Pakistani.” ‘Imran always stood firm for country’: PTI Reacting to Abbasi’s presser, PTI, in a statement, said that “it would be difficult for individuals like Abbasi to understand that Imran always stood firm for his country, its institutions, and the people of Pakistan at every forum.” “Imran Khan was the one who achieved diplomatic, military and narrative advantage over India and defended Pakistan’s stance at the global stage,” the statement said, adding that Imran strengthened the credibility of national institutions. “However government was trying to portray that every dissenting voice was against the state,” the statement added. Replying to allegations related to India and the Indian media, the PTI alleged that “Pakistan’s history was quite clear that the Sharif family had business dealings with Indian businessmen and personal relations with Narendra Modi.” The statement further claimed that Imran’s only “crime” was that he was “the most popular leader struggling for genuine freedom.” ‘Politically charged’ press conference During PTI’s Saturday press conference at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, PTI interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan said it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, after the DG ISPR called Imran “a mental patient“ for his constant anti-army rhetoric. Lt Gen Chaudhry said that whenever the PTI founder posted something on social media against the army chief, Indian media and the accounts linked to the Indian-intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were making the posts viral. “The Indian media is reporting against your army chief with such happiness. Who is providing this narrative to them? They air this narrative for hours. Why are they spending so much money on spreading the narrative of this delusional mindset of this narcissist? There is one reason, because he (Imran) is speaking against the army and its chief. He is talking about creating a rift between the Pakistani army and the public,” the DG ISPR said. In response, Gohar said that “ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction, adding there was still time for tone to be eased and for steps to improve the current situation.” The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role. He added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but the ISPR chief’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”. On the other hand, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said Imran was not a national security threat, but he had kept the people united. “Do not drive away the people of Pakistan; they stand with Imran Khan and the PTI,” he said, adding that there were many narratives in the country, including along ethnic and sectarian lines, yet Imran had rejected all of them to stand with the narrative of Pakistan. “For God’s sake, don’t do this. You will not be able to minus Imran Khan, but God forbid if you do, it will be very difficult to keep this country’s interests united.” He termed the ISPR DG’s press conference “unfortunate” and added that the party will not answer the accusation and charges levelled against the PTI founder. “Today we are being told that the country’s most popular leader is a national security threat, which is ridiculous, but this has not been said for the first time.”",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have killed 12 terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the Kalat district of Balochistan, the military’s media affairs wing said on Sunday. According to the statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the IBO was conducted on Saturday on the reported presence of “terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Hindustan ”. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR statement detailed that during the operation yesterday, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 12 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were found in the terrorists’ possession, it said, adding that they had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area as [a] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under [the] vision [of] ‘Azm-i- Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Yesterday, a statement issued by the ISPR had said that 14 terrorists had been killed in three separate intelligence-based IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Balochistan’s Tank. Earlier this week, security forces had killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district. President, PM laud forces for successful operation in Kalat President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Kalat, state-run Radio Pakistan reported. The president, in his statement, said the state of Pakistan was “fully capable of taking enemies of peace to their end at all costs.” He reiterated that the “resolve of the nation will foil every conspiracy of Fitna al Hindustan .” In his statement, PM Shehbaz said security forces were “achieving great successes against terrorism under the vision of Azm-e-Istehkam.” “The nation is united against terrorism and is determined to completely eradicate all forms of this menace from the country,” the report quoted him as saying.",

      "title_orig": "Sri Lanka issues landslide warnings as cyclone toll hits 618",
      "summary_orig": "Sri Lankan authorities issued fresh landslide warnings on Sunday with rains lashing areas already devastated by a powerful cyclone, as the death toll rose to 618. A chain of tropical storms and monsoonal rains has battered Southeast and South Asia, setting off landslides, flooding vast tracts and cutting off communities from Sumatra island’s rainforests to the highland plantations of Sri Lanka. At least 1,812 people have been killed in the natural disasters rolling across Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam over the past two weeks. Indonesia’s president on Sunday vowed to step up aid, with demonstrators rallying after the country’s death toll surpassed 900. More than two million people in Sri Lanka — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected by last week’s floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, the worst on the island this century. The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said monsoon storms were adding more rain and making hillsides unstable, including in the central mountainous region and the north-western midlands. Helicopters and planes were being used on Sunday to supply communities cut off by landslides in the centre of the country. The Sri Lanka Air Force said it had received a planeload of relief supplies from Myanmar on Sunday, the latest batch of foreign aid. The government has confirmed 618 dead — 464 from the lush tea-growing central region — while 209 people remain unaccounted for. The number of people in state-run camps had dropped to 100,000 from a peak of 225,000 as floodwaters receded across the island by Sunday, the DMC said. More than 75,000 homes were damaged, including close to 5,000 that were completely destroyed, it added. ‘Disaster tourism’ In Indonesia, President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday flew back to Sumatra’s hard-hit Aceh province, with a ministry saying his visit was “to ensure the acceleration of emergency response and recovery in affected areas”. The Indonesian government has so far shrugged off calls to declare a national disaster, which would free up resources and help government agencies coordinate their response. The toll in Indonesia on Sunday remained at 916 dead, with 274 still missing. Prabowo will also “monitor the distribution of aid, the evacuation process of residents, and measures to reopen road access,” the Ministry of the State Secretariat said. “The government emphasises that the handling of the floods in Aceh is a national priority and all resources are being mobilised to expedite the recovery of community conditions,” it added in a statement.

      "summary_en": "Sri Lankan authorities issued fresh landslide warnings on Sunday with rains lashing areas already devastated by a powerful cyclone, as the death toll rose to 618. A chain of tropical storms and monsoonal rains has battered Southeast and South Asia, setting off landslides, flooding vast tracts and cutting off communities from Sumatra island’s rainforests to the highland plantations of Sri Lanka. At least 1,812 people have been killed in the natural disasters rolling across Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam over the past two weeks. Indonesia’s president on Sunday vowed to step up aid, with demonstrators rallying after the country’s death toll surpassed 900. More than two million people in Sri Lanka — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected by last week’s floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, the worst on the island this century. The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said monsoon storms were adding more rain and making hillsides unstable, including in the central mountainous region and the north-western midlands. Helicopters and planes were being used on Sunday to supply communities cut off by landslides in the centre of the country. The Sri Lanka Air Force said it had received a planeload of relief supplies from Myanmar on Sunday, the latest batch of foreign aid. The government has confirmed 618 dead — 464 from the lush tea-growing central region — while 209 people remain unaccounted for. The number of people in state-run camps had dropped to 100,000 from a peak of 225,000 as floodwaters receded across the island by Sunday, the DMC said. More than 75,000 homes were damaged, including close to 5,000 that were completely destroyed, it added. ‘Disaster tourism’ In Indonesia, President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday flew back to Sumatra’s hard-hit Aceh province, with a ministry saying his visit was “to ensure the acceleration of emergency response and recovery in affected areas”. The Indonesian government has so far shrugged off calls to declare a national disaster, which would free up resources and help government agencies coordinate their response. The toll in Indonesia on Sunday remained at 916 dead, with 274 still missing. Prabowo will also “monitor the distribution of aid, the evacuation process of residents, and measures to reopen road access,” the Ministry of the State Secretariat said. “The government emphasises that the handling of the floods in Aceh is a national priority and all resources are being mobilised to expedite the recovery of community conditions,” it added in a statement. Speaking shortly after arriving in the capital Banda Aceh, Prabowo promised that “we will put all our efforts into this, and later we will repair all the bridges, hopefully within one or two weeks”. Many survivors said their greatest need remained clean drinking water.

      "summary_orig": "TOBA TEK SINGH: The Faisalabad FIA immigration officials have offloaded 13 passengers, including three women, who were illegally traveling to Europe on the pretext of Umrah. Those who were offloaded belong to Faisalabad. An FIA spokesperson said on Saturday that all of the passengers were going to Jeddah by flight number FZ 356 from Faisalabad airport; however, they were stopped during clearance on the basis of their suspicious movements and evidence. The passengers included Hamza Ali, Zeeshan Ali, Samiullah, Shiraz Hassan, Imran Waris, Bilal Hassan, Syed Yasin Hussain, Muhammad Rizwan, Ghulam Rasool, Haq Nawaz, Faizal Bibi, Zahida Bibi and Sardaran Bibi. He said there were reports that female passengers were being used as shields to travel to Europe through Saudi Arabia from various airports on Umrah visas. During the investigation, suspicious international phone calls were detected which were made from the passengers’ mobile phones. He also added that calls from the phones of offloaded passengers were also detected which were made to an agent identified as Sajid Ali and chats were made with him related to their next illegal journey to Egypt and Libya. According to the initial investigation, the passengers stated that they were planning to travel from Libya to Europe by boat. The FIA Anti-Human Trafficking Circle has been handed over the custody of offloaded 13 passengers for investigation and legal action. Meanwhile, FIA arrested two persons for violation of Copyright Act. An official said that FIA Corporate Crime Circle team raided Sargodha Road and arrested both suspects Mazhar Ali and Arqam Ali from whom a large quantity of fake products of known registered companies were also recovered. ACCIDENT: A youth died after he was hit by a speeding car near Tin Pullian Wala Adda on Shorkot Cantonment Road on Saturday. Rescue 1122 said deceased identified as Amanullah (19) of Mauza Bhangoo was crossing the road when a car ran over him as a result he was critically injured. He was shifted to Shorkot THQ hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.The car driver sped away after the accident. SUSPENDED: Faisalabad Commissioner Raja Jehangir Anwar suspended secretary of union council No 70 of Pirmahal tehsil, Syed Zeeshan Haider, due to his failure to eliminate stray dogs in UC villages which caused rising dog-bite cases. During his visit to Pirmahal tehsil on Saturday, people complained to the commissioner that a number of children and senior citizens had been bitten by the rabid dogs. He also warned the assistant director (local government) to boost municipal services in all 17 rural UCs in the tehsil, including focussing on dog culling and sanitation. The commissioner took notice of the poor condition of the cleanliness in Pirmahal THQ hospital and asked the MS to improve cleanliness within seven days otherwise action be taken against him. He set the Dec 31 deadline for the contractor to complete the construction of trauma centre in the hospital. During the briefing, he was informed that after the completion of 20-bed trauma centre the total number of beds will increase to 50. He also directed the assistant commissioner to deploy additional janitors for cleaning the hospital and submit him report. He said the general bus stand at Pirmahal is in bad shape and its essential repairs would be done by District Council funds. The commissioner also visited the Lyallpur Museum at Faisalabad along with its Chairman Board of Governors Dr Amir Sarfraz. On this occasion, it was decided to expand the Lyallpur Museum and the commissioner said that it is necessary to display more than 5,000 artifacts already kept in stock in the museum. He sought an expansion plan from the curator of the museum and said that the facilities for visitors will be upgraded. He said that the maintenance issues in the museum should be resolved within two weeks. He visited the galleries containing the history of the region.

      "summary_orig": "THE Balochistan government’s decision to abolish the Levies force was part of a broader state strategy to “harmonise” internal security institutions in response to critical national security challenges. On similar grounds, a federal constabulary was established. This restructuring process has been ongoing on federal and provincial levels, driven by the growing difficulty faced by premier security institutions in countering ‘foreign-influenced threats’, terrorism, and violent extremism. What this process actually means for the future of law-enforcement agencies (LEAs) in Pakistan remains an open and pressing question. Will the centralisation and standardisation of security structures lead to more capable, accountable, and coordinated institutions, or will they further complicate the landscape of security governance? This is a question that will matter significantly in the coming years. A few former police officers and security experts view this harmonisation process as occurring in parallel with global trends toward modernising security institutions, enhancing investigative capacity, strengthening responses to organised crime, and adopting new technologies. Yet, Pakistan’s context remains burdened by deep structural problems, the police culture of moral policing, extortionist practices, and low public trust. These dynamics complicate any attempt at reform, raising concerns about whether organisational restructuring alone can transform entrenched attitudes and practices. In this context, when state institutions burden LEAs with national security-related tasks, particularly those related to terrorism, violent extremism, and so-called foreign-influenced threats, the logic of security governance becomes more complex. The term ‘foreign-influenced threats’ is vague, yet many among the security institutions increasingly interpret it through the lens of rising political mobilisation by movements such as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee in Balochistan, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement in KP, and the Joint Action Committees (JACs) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB). These movements are often framed by security actors as being funded or influenced by foreign forces, including diaspora networks, and therefore as presenting risks to national security. Political analysts and movement leaders reject this framing, arguing that the state’s anxieties are instead rooted in fears of popular uprisings similar to those witnessed in Bangladesh and Nepal . Although Gen Z-led movements are gaining momentum globally, the uprisings in Bangladesh and Nepal were interpreted by segments of South Asian power elites as externally engineered, including by the US and Pakistan. Regardless of the accuracy of such interpretations, these narratives have contributed to shaping Pakistan’s internal security architecture. Will centralisation and standardisation of security structures lead to more capable institutions? For example, when the federal government an­­n­­ounced the transformation of the Frontier Con­stabulary into a ‘nationwide federal force’, its int­e­nded mandate included operating across all provinces, Islamabad, AJK, and GB. One explanation for this expansive jurisdiction is the state’s perception that local police forces in AJK and GB have been unable to contain the JAC protests , neces­­­sitating a more centralised coercive capacity. This harmonisation process was formalised with the establishment of the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre under the National Counter Terrorism Authority. The creation of Niftac was described as a step towards realising Nacta’s original objectives. In practice, however, Niftac has eclipsed Nacta, undermining its status and institutional relevance, despite expanding its footprint across all provinces. The irony is that a wing of Nacta has become so large that it has effectively subsumed the parent organisation. If state institutions had wished to establish Niftac as an independent body, they could have done so and subsequently merged it with Nacta. But Nacta was created through an act of parliament, meaning that any restructuring would have required legislative amendment and public debate. The more expedient strategy, therefore, was to create Niftac as a ‘wing’ of Nacta — while granting it a mandate that far exceeded that of the original authority. Another development is the government’s plan to establish a National Cybersecurity Authority under the Cybersecurity Act, 2025 , recognising that cybersecurity has become an integral component of the internal security domain. The merger of the Levies into the police in Balochistan has raised significant questions, as competing narratives continue to shape the debate. Critics argue that the Levies, despite limited resources and personnel, have historically performed better than the police across a vast and difficult terrain. They point to home department data showing that crime rates in Levies-administered areas are lower than in police-administered zones. This performance gap is particularly striking given the disparity in force size: the Levies operate with roughly 28,000 personnel, whereas the police have more than 42,000. Most political parties in Balochistan have therefore rejected the merger, insisting that effective local security structures should not be dismantled merely for administrative uniformity. They also fear that the decision is driven less by performance considerations and more by the state’s anxieties over a rising insurgency and its desire to centralise coercive authority. As mentioned, the purpose of harmonising the internal security infrastructure appears to be countering terrorism and violent extremism-related threats. Beyond that, it is increasingly aimed at addressing broader national security risks, including espionage, identifying actors linked to foreign influences, whether political, regional, or otherwise, and responding to activities deemed harmful to national security. However, significant grey areas exist within this domain. Under such an expansive framework, any political or social movement can easily be labelled as ‘foreign-influenced’ rather than a legitimate, locally supported mobilisation. This appro­ach extends across both kinetic and non-kinetic domains, yet what remains missing is recognition that many of these responsibilities traditionally fall within the core mandate of LEAs, particularly the police, whose primary functions are crime prevention and ensuring public safety and security. The irony is that LEAs, especially the police, have drifted far from their foundational roles. Their increasing focus on moral policing and coercive enforcement has become more regressive, extra-constitutional, and marred by institutional corruption that continues to deepen. The police have neither developed the capability to understand nor the capacity to implement their functions under evolving security paradigms. In the process, they have forgotten their core public-service mission. While the roots of moral policing lie in the colonial era, its contemporary manifestation is influenced not only by state practices but also by the growing pressure of religiously motivated violent groups within society.

The term ‘foreign-influenced threats’ is vague, yet many among the security institutions increasingly interpret it through the lens of rising political mobilisation by movements such as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee in Balochistan, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement in KP, and the Joint Action Committees (JACs) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB). These movements are often framed by security actors as being funded or influenced by foreign forces, including diaspora networks, and therefore as presenting risks to national security. Political analysts and movement leaders reject this framing, arguing that the state’s anxieties are instead rooted in fears of popular uprisings similar to those witnessed in Bangladesh and Nepal . Although Gen Z-led movements are gaining momentum globally, the uprisings in Bangladesh and Nepal were interpreted by segments of South Asian power elites as externally engineered, including by the US and Pakistan. Regardless of the accuracy of such interpretations, these narratives have contributed to shaping Pakistan’s internal security architecture. Will centralisation and standardisation of security structures lead to more capable institutions? For example, when the federal government an­­n­­ounced the transformation of the Frontier Con­stabulary into a ‘nationwide federal force’, its int­e­nded mandate included operating across all provinces, Islamabad, AJK, and GB. One explanation for this expansive jurisdiction is the state’s perception that local police forces in AJK and GB have been unable to contain the JAC protests , neces­­­sitating a more centralised coercive capacity. This harmonisation process was formalised with the establishment of the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre under the National Counter Terrorism Authority. The creation of Niftac was described as a step towards realising Nacta’s original objectives. In practice, however, Niftac has eclipsed Nacta, undermining its status and institutional relevance, despite expanding its footprint across all provinces. The irony is that a wing of Nacta has become so large that it has effectively subsumed the parent organisation. If state institutions had wished to establish Niftac as an independent body, they could have done so and subsequently merged it with Nacta. But Nacta was created through an act of parliament, meaning that any restructuring would have required legislative amendment and public debate. The more expedient strategy, therefore, was to create Niftac as a ‘wing’ of Nacta — while granting it a mandate that far exceeded that of the original authority. Another development is the government’s plan to establish a National Cybersecurity Authority under the Cybersecurity Act, 2025 , recognising that cybersecurity has become an integral component of the internal security domain. The merger of the Levies into the police in Balochistan has raised significant questions, as competing narratives continue to shape the debate. Critics argue that the Levies, despite limited resources and personnel, have historically performed better than the police across a vast and difficult terrain. They point to home department data showing that crime rates in Levies-administered areas are lower than in police-administered zones. This performance gap is particularly striking given the disparity in force size: the Levies operate with roughly 28,000 personnel, whereas the police have more than 42,000. Most political parties in Balochistan have therefore rejected the merger, insisting that effective local security structures should not be dismantled merely for administrative uniformity. They also fear that the decision is driven less by performance considerations and more by the state’s anxieties over a rising insurgency and its desire to centralise coercive authority. As mentioned, the purpose of harmonising the internal security infrastructure appears to be countering terrorism and violent extremism-related threats. Beyond that, it is increasingly aimed at addressing broader national security risks, including espionage, identifying actors linked to foreign influences, whether political, regional, or otherwise, and responding to activities deemed harmful to national security. However, significant grey areas exist within this domain. Under such an expansive framework, any political or social movement can easily be labelled as ‘foreign-influenced’ rather than a legitimate, locally supported mobilisation. This appro­ach extends across both kinetic and non-kinetic domains, yet what remains missing is recognition that many of these responsibilities traditionally fall within the core mandate of LEAs, particularly the police, whose primary functions are crime prevention and ensuring public safety and security. The irony is that LEAs, especially the police, have drifted far from their foundational roles. Their increasing focus on moral policing and coercive enforcement has become more regressive, extra-constitutional, and marred by institutional corruption that continues to deepen. The police have neither developed the capability to understand nor the capacity to implement their functions under evolving security paradigms. In the process, they have forgotten their core public-service mission. While the roots of moral policing lie in the colonial era, its contemporary manifestation is influenced not only by state practices but also by the growing pressure of religiously motivated violent groups within society.

      "summary_orig": "• DC confirms fighting between Pakistani forces and Afghan Taliban has stopped • SSP says security measures taken, situation is under control QUETTA: Calm returned to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border at Chaman on Saturday after heavy clashes occurred between the two sides a day earlier. At least three civilians were injured in the clashes last night and were shifted to the district hospital in Chaman. On the Afg­han side, five people were inju­red, according to Afghan government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat. According to officials, Afghan forces fired mortar shells on the Badani area, prompting security forces to retaliate. However, Afg­han Taliban spokesperson Zabi­hullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding. Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, confirmed the clashes. “A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the Chaman border. An immediate, befitting [and] intense response has been given by our armed forces,” he wrote in a post on X early Saturday morning. “Pakistan remains fully alert [and] committed to ensuring its territorial integrity [and] the safety [of] our citizens,” he added. ‘Fighting has stopped’ Chaman Deputy Commissioner Habibullah Bangulzai confirmed that fighting between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban had stopped. He said that immediately after the Taliban attack, an emergency was declared at Chaman District Hospital. However, the deputy commissioner did not comment on the human or property losses. SSP Chaman Abdullah Cheema said all security measures had been taken and the situation was under control. Sources said a mortar shell lan­ded on a house and exploded, inj­uring a couple and their daughter. The residents of the area said that a large number of families living in border villages were shifted to Chaman city. “Heavy fighting started at 10pm and continued for over two hours,” an official of the local administration said. The clash comes amid stalled negotiations between Pakis­tan and Afghanistan after three rounds of talks in Istanbul could not yield any results. Border clashes first broke out between the two nations on Oct 11. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. Pak-Afghan talks Soon after the clashes on Oct 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha. Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators from Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on Nov 6. But on Nov 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.

The acting US ambassador, who called on the interior minister, offered her country’s full technical assistance for counter-narcotics operations and efforts to curb illegal immigration. The meeting also focused on strengthening collaboration in intelligence sharing. Speaking on the occasion, Mr Naqvi said that Pakistan had a clear and firm policy regarding illegal immigration. He added said the identification of drug trafficking cases at airports remained a top priority. “State-of-the-art scanning machines are being installed at all major airports across the country.” The minister reaffirmed that the country was strictly implementing a zero-tolerance policy against narcotics. “Even today, drugs originating from Afghanistan are reaching dozens of countries and destroying young generations,” he noted, adding that US technical support to bolster Pakistan’s counter-narcotics capabilities would be welcomed. On the prime minister’s directive, the National Narcotics Coordination Centre would be set up soon, the interior minister informed the envoy. ANF performance During the meeting, a detailed briefing was given on the Anti-Narcotics Force’s (ANF) performance and ongoing operations across the country. It was shared that under the annual counter-narcotics campaign, 134 tonnes of narcotics were seized, 2,001 suspects — including 75 foreign nationals — were arrested, and drugs worth $12.797 billion were confiscated. It was further informed that in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh, 110 Afghan nationals were arrested and 40,659 acres of land were cleared to maintain a “poppy-free status”. Ms Baker appreciated the performance of the ANF and said that the United States placed special importance on its relations with Pakistan and would continue cooperation in all areas. The interior minister said Pakistan-US relations were vital for promoting peace and stability in the region, and that Islamabad was committed to further strengthening their long-standing bilateral ties.

      "title_orig": "‘Imran Khan not a security threat’: PTI deplores ‘ridiculous’ allegations, laments democracy’s backward slide",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI emphatically deplored “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson against ex-premier Imran Khan, saying he was “not a security threat”, and lamented the weakening of democracy in the country following the passage of recent constitutional amendments. In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”. Responding to the DG ISPR’s accusations in a press conference today at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “Do not drive away the people of Pakistan, they stand with Imran Khan and the PTI. Imran Khan is not a national security threat. He has kept the people united.” Raja said there were many narratives in the country, including along ethnic and sectarian lines, yet Imran had rejected all of them to stand with the narrative of Pakistan, along with PTI’s supporters and voters. “For God’s sake, don’t do this. You will not be able to minus Imran Khan, but God forbid if you do, it will be very difficult to keep this country’s interests united. If you attack KP and remove its elected government to install an unelected setup, then you yourselves will be responsible for the conditions that follow.” Raja termed the DG ISPR’s press conference “unfortunate” and added that the party will not answer the accusation and charges levelled against the PTI founder. “Today we are being told that the country’s most popular leader is a national security threat, which is ridiculous, but this has not been said for the first time.” Referring to the establishment’s manoeuvring against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s, Raja said: “The institutions decided again and again that any popular leader of the people is a national security threat and it is necessary to remove them from the scene, but this did not happen. You cannot remove them from the hearts of the people through your decisions. The nation has always been aware and there is a reason it is standing behind Imran Khan. We are not mad, we know who has always been in control in this country.” Raja elaborated that he wanted to set the context for everyone, noting that there have been countless times in the country’s history when it was pushed from democracy toward force and authoritarianism. Referring to previous military dictatorships in the country, he said prosperity was always promised, and yet, they all ultimately failed. The general secretary of the party said it was claimed multiple times during the past that democracy, law and the Constitution does not suit the country, and needs a stick, but the “ruler always left it weaker than before”. Raja lamented that the party was frequently criticised as a ragtag group without understanding of affairs and what heights the country was being taken towards. However, the PTI secretary general questioned whether the country needed to be forcibly developed through the use of power, noting that if this were the case, it would have already happened during previous periods of military rule. Raja said there was a need for a “grand dialogue”, given the country’s current situation, and that the nation needed to be involved lest the past repeat itself. “There will be no change, and we will go backwards.” Referring to the constitutional amendments and the subjugation of the judiciary, he said the development was not even comparable to anything under previous eras of military rule. Slamming censorship in the country, the senior PTI leader said that anyone speaking freely could be subject to the Peca law, inquiries, and more, referring to the trial proceedings of husband-and-wife lawyer duo Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha. Raja said the PTI was ready to talk, but the people of KP and their chief minister should never be mocked or denigrated. “Don’t put the future of the country or KP at stake in this battle of narratives. This is a very sensitive area, take the people along in the conditions that are there at the moment and the state of terrorism. The PTI is the biggest force in the country that can take it towards betterment.” The PTI secretary general also seemingly criticised the party’s social media wing and supporters, who he said called the party out to respond or answer why it was not taking action. “We are sitting because the country is dear to us and we don’t want discord in the country,” Raja added. He said the party and Imran would take every step required for the benefit of the country. “It is very easy to respond to the brick with a stone but we will not do it because the country’s benefit is not in this.” Former National Assembly speaker and PTI MNA Asad Qaiser also voiced a complaint with the DG ISPR’s remarks. “There is great anger and heightened emotions in our province. Your words should have been appropriate. We think such words should be desisted from and will also demand that they are retracted because a whole society and province think it has been disrespected.” Barrister Gohar calls for easing of ‘tone’ PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali criticised the DG ISPR’s remarks, calling them “inappropriate and wrong” and saying it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister. Gohar said that “there is an enemy of ours” who would be pleased by press conferences against each other, adding that this was why he had earlier said today’s would not be a confrontational press conference. PTI Chairman said the party wanted to clarify that “some people are trying to incite fighting between the workers of a major party and members of a major institution”. Gohar said such incidents should never occur, warning that “the beginning of any great destruction is always due to a few inappropriate words”. He added that ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction. The PTI leader said there was still time for “tone to be eased” and for steps to improve the current situation. He called for Tuesday’s meeting with Imran to be allowed without restriction and urged that no politics be made over the ex-premier’s meetings with his sisters. He maintained that the country deserved to prosper and grow, but if the current tense atmosphere and attitude continued, “then it won’t be minus-one, but minus-everyone, which should not happen”. At the start of the press conference, Gohar welcomed everyone to what he said would be an “unusual” press briefing in response to the military spokesperson’s remarks against the PTI founder, saying it would have a “different tone”. “We are not going to do a confrontational press conference or to respond to a brick with a stone, but it is very important to tell some facts to the people as charges have been levelled at us.” He claimed that the PTI was the country’s largest political party and its leader was Imran, with the support of 70 per cent of the nation. “It is necessary to tell the people what has happened to us in the recent past. From 180 seats, we were reduced to 91 seats, and now we are left with 76. Reserved seats were taken and there was violence against women and children. The injustices against us are a tale of their own.” Barrister Gohar said the party had continued to endure in order to uphold democracy, adding that the PTI’s stance was rooted in democracy, peace and the rule of law, and that Imran Khan had always maintained that both Pakistan and its army belong to the people. The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role. The PTI chairman added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but yesterday’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”. Referring to Imran’s pending cases and delayed proceedings, he said the party began with a position of calling for his release and was now reduced to asking for meetings to be permitted with the PTI founder. “All that we endured was for the sake of democracy and the country, but we say, if such conditions continue and such treatment with each other continues, then democracy will be the one to face the biggest loss.”",

The PTI is the biggest force in the country that can take it towards betterment.” The PTI secretary general also seemingly criticised the party’s social media wing and supporters, who he said called the party out to respond or answer why it was not taking action. “We are sitting because the country is dear to us and we don’t want discord in the country,” Raja added. He said the party and Imran would take every step required for the benefit of the country. “It is very easy to respond to the brick with a stone but we will not do it because the country’s benefit is not in this.” Former National Assembly speaker and PTI MNA Asad Qaiser also voiced a complaint with the DG ISPR’s remarks. “There is great anger and heightened emotions in our province. Your words should have been appropriate. We think such words should be desisted from and will also demand that they are retracted because a whole society and province think it has been disrespected.” Barrister Gohar calls for easing of ‘tone’ PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali criticised the DG ISPR’s remarks, calling them “inappropriate and wrong” and saying it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister. Gohar said that “there is an enemy of ours” who would be pleased by press conferences against each other, adding that this was why he had earlier said today’s would not be a confrontational press conference. PTI Chairman said the party wanted to clarify that “some people are trying to incite fighting between the workers of a major party and members of a major institution”. Gohar said such incidents should never occur, warning that “the beginning of any great destruction is always due to a few inappropriate words”. He added that ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction. The PTI leader said there was still time for “tone to be eased” and for steps to improve the current situation. He called for Tuesday’s meeting with Imran to be allowed without restriction and urged that no politics be made over the ex-premier’s meetings with his sisters. He maintained that the country deserved to prosper and grow, but if the current tense atmosphere and attitude continued, “then it won’t be minus-one, but minus-everyone, which should not happen”. At the start of the press conference, Gohar welcomed everyone to what he said would be an “unusual” press briefing in response to the military spokesperson’s remarks against the PTI founder, saying it would have a “different tone”. “We are not going to do a confrontational press conference or to respond to a brick with a stone, but it is very important to tell some facts to the people as charges have been levelled at us.” He claimed that the PTI was the country’s largest political party and its leader was Imran, with the support of 70 per cent of the nation. “It is necessary to tell the people what has happened to us in the recent past. From 180 seats, we were reduced to 91 seats, and now we are left with 76. Reserved seats were taken and there was violence against women and children. The injustices against us are a tale of their own.” Barrister Gohar said the party had continued to endure in order to uphold democracy, adding that the PTI’s stance was rooted in democracy, peace and the rule of law, and that Imran Khan had always maintained that both Pakistan and its army belong to the people. The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role. The PTI chairman added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but yesterday’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”. Referring to Imran’s pending cases and delayed proceedings, he said the party began with a position of calling for his release and was now reduced to asking for meetings to be permitted with the PTI founder. “All that we endured was for the sake of democracy and the country, but we say, if such conditions continue and such treatment with each other continues, then democracy will be the one to face the biggest loss.”",
