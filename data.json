      "summary_orig": "A joint team of police and military investigators has imposed travel bans on three civilian suspects accused of involvement in alleged drone flights to North Korea, sources said Friday. The suspects include a graduate student in his 30s, surnamed Oh, who claimed to have flown the drones, an individual, surnamed Jang, suspected of building them, and a third person known to have worked at a drone manufacturing company set up by the other two, according to the sources. The joint investigation was launched last week after North Korea claimed South Korea infringed on its sovereignty with drone incursions in September and on Jan. 4. South Korea's military has denied involvement, saying it does not operate the drone models in question. The suspects are accused of flying a drone bound for North Korea from Ganghwa County, just west of Seoul.

      "summary_orig": "A group of 73 South Korean suspects who had been detained in Cambodia over alleged involvement in online scam operations was returned home Friday on a chartered flight to face investigation, marking the nation's largest repatriation of criminal suspects from a single country. The suspects had been detained in Cambodia after a joint investigation between South Korean and Cambodian police, and are accused of swindling a total of 48.6 billion won ($33.1 million) from 869 South Korean victims, according to Cheong Wa Dae. They were immediately placed under custody after boarding the plane with court-issued warrants and transferred to local police agencies nationwide for further investigation. Police plan to file for warrants to extend their detention. As police escorted the suspects through the airport, most of them appeared to be men in their 20s and 30s, and wearing short-sleeve shirts and shorts, apparently due to the warm weather in Cambodia.

      "summary_orig": "In a joint parliamentary session held on Friday, lawmakers from both houses of the parliament passed a resolution expressing solidarity with the victims of Karachi’s Gul Plaza inferno, calling on the Sindh government to introduce “systemic reforms” ensuring that the tragedy is not repeated. Friday’s session was summoned by President Asif Ali Zardari a day earlier, and was presided over by National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq. The fire that erupted at Gul Plaza last week has left at least 67 people dead in its wake. The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. In the resolution passed today, the parliament expressed solidarity with the families of the victims and took note of the “reported shortcomings that turned an accident into a mass tragedy,” calling for systemic reforms. “The Parliament offers its heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families of the deceased and prays for the swift recovery of the injured,” the resolution read. It also paid tribute to firefighter Furqan Ali , who embraced martyrdom while battling the deadly fire. In the joint resolution, the parliament urged the Sindh government to “ensure compensation to the families of victims and immediate recovery of the businesses affected.” “Immediately undertake a city-wide emergency fire-risk audit of all commercial and residential buildings,” the resolution read, adding that the number of fire stations and firefighting equipment should be increased as well. It also called upon the federal government to “facilitate and provide necessary support to the Provincial Government of Sindh in this crisis situation.” The parliament vowed to “stand in unanimous solidarity with the people of Karachi and the victims’ families in this hour of immense grief”. It further demanded that “lasting action” should be taken so that “lives lost in Gul Plaza will not go in vain.” Senator Sherry Rehman calls on govt to play its part PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in her address to the joint session, expressed support for the resolution, calling on the federal government to play its part in supporting Karachi. “Gul Plaza tragedy has been heartbreaking for all of us,” she said, adding that it was particularly difficult for “families who were awaiting the recovery of their loved ones’ bodies”. During her address, the PPP leader underscored the need for readjusting resources as per population. Taking note of MQM-P’s demand of handing over Karachi to the federal government, she said, “PPP has many, many contributions to Karachi, and while everyone has a right to criticise, do not add fuel to the fire”. She urged MQM-P to “not engage in politics over dead bodies, rather help us in the recovery efforts”. Joint session passes 3 bills The session also saw the passage of three bills, including the Daanish Schools Authority Bill 2025, the Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025. President Zardari returned these bills last month despite their passage by the Senate and the NA. A day earlier, according to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, the government had already taken other allied parties into confidence on the matter and assured them that all three bills would be passed in the joint sitting. Also during the session, the opposition staged a protest as its members, led by leaders of the opposition in the NA and Senate, Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, respectively, gathered in front of the speaker’s dais. The session was adjourned for an indefinite period. JUI-F seeks discussion on Board of Peace Meanwhile, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Senator Kamran Murtaza submitted an adjournment motion in the Senate, seeking discussion on Pakistan joining US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking the parliament or cabinet into confidence. On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other world leaders signed the charter for the “ Board of Peace ” headed by Trump, who has billed the body as a platform for resolving international conflicts. In a post on X, the JUI-F Senator said, “An adjournment motion has been submitted in the Senate on behalf of JUI-F regarding Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace.” “The House may adjourn its normal business in order to discuss an issue of public importance, whereby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. issued a statement, i.e. ‘Pakistan will join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace to help achieve lasting peace in Gaza’ without taking the Parliament into confidence or without placing the matter before the Cabinet,” the motion read. It added that such an approach was “against the saying of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.” Achakzai condemns Imaan and Hadi’s arrest Opposition leader in the NA Achakzai, while speaking in the National Assembly today, condemned the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, stating that “targeting political dissenters violated the Constitution”. The couple was arrested earlier today in Islamabad while they were reportedly en route to the district courts. Achakzai stressed that the “freedom of expression and basic civil rights were being continuously curtailed in the country”. “Using the law to protect the interests of a powerful class was unfortunate,” Acahkzai maintained, adding that such acts “severely undermined the public’s trust in state institutions”. Achakzai demanded their release, calling for a “transparent and impartial” investigation into the arrest.",

      "summary_orig": "Activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday in Islamabad while they were reportedly en route to the district courts. Former minister and Imaan’s mother, Shireen Mazari, confirmed in a series of posts on X that her daughter had been arrested by police personnel, saying that she and her husband “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations.” The former lawmaker claimed that no first information report (FIR) was shown by the police and the bar association “sadly could do nothing”. “Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!” Mazari added in a post on X. Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court today in the controversial tweets case, in which Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Afzal Majoka had issued arrest warrants on January 16. The couple have been evading arrest , taking refuge in the office of Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) President Wajid Ali Gilani for two consecutive nights. Mazari also shared videos showing police vehicles trailing the lawyers’ car, with officers stopping the vehicle and opening its doors. In a separate post, Mazari claimed the police “used violence on the bar leaders, [including] breaking the windows of the car, etc”. “All [because] the Twitter case had been exposed and more embarrassment would have followed in further [cross-examination] today,” the former minister said, referring to the case against Imaan and Hadi over controversial social media posts. “Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari alleged in another post. ‘Illegal and unconstitutional move’ The ex-minister shared a video message of Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) President Wajid Ali Gilani, who was with Imaan at the time of the arrest. “We spoke to the authorities yesterday and other institutions, and they made a commitment that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha will not be arrested and will be given safe passage to go to the district court,” said the bar president in a video posted on X. He said that, fearing arrest, the lawyers went to IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfaraz Dogar and “informed him that there was a possibility we would be stopped; however, the chief justice did not hold court today.” Gilani said Imaan and Hadi, along with their lawyers, were on their way to the sessions court when their vehicles came “under attack by police” as soon as they passed by Serena Chowk. The IHCBA president claimed that the police subjected the lawyers to violence and broke the vehicles’ windows, forcing Imaan and Hadi out of the car. He further said that male personnel grabbed Imaan and pushed her into the police vehicle. Gilani also alleged that the police officials “pushed down [IHCBA] Secretary Manzoor Jajja and beat him”. He called on the lawyers of both the IHC and the sessions court to reach the Sitara Market Women’s Police Station — where he said Imaan was being held — and observe a strike. “The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani asserted. Calling it a “very major incident for Islamabad”, Gilani emphasised that lawyers “guard the country’s integrity and law”. The IHCBA, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrest of the lawyer couple. The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike for Friday, while the IBC called on lawyers to observe a strike on Saturday. The IBA added that it held an emergency meeting in light of the “illegal and unconstitutional move” to arrest the duo. The body called on authorities to “immediately release” the arrested lawyers. “The Islamabad Bar Association believes that every Pakistani has the right to defend themselves in the court,” the statement read, terming the arrest a “violation of fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and law”. The IBC condemned the “highly reprehensible conduct, including misbehaviour, assault and torture, perpetrated by the police officials” against Gilani and Jajja during the incident. It considered such actions “to be a blatant misuse of authority, aimed at harassing advocates and creating an atmosphere of fear and coercion within the legal community”. The IBC demanded Imaan and Hadi’s unconditional release, a transparent and independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved, and “strict disciplinary action against all those responsible for the misbehaviour, high-handedness and use of force”. Cases against the duo The main case against Imaan and Hadi, which pertains to a controversial social media post, stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad. They were indicted in the case on October 30 last year. ADSJ Majoka had issued arrest warrants for the couple on January 16, a day after cancelling their interim bail following repeated non-appearances. Subsequently, Imaan and Hadi challenged their arrest orders before the IHC. The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Earlier this week, a case dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo, about a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). The IHC has granted them pre-arrest bail in the case. Separately, on Thursday, Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra dismissed Imaan and Hadi’s pre-arrest bail applications in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025.",

      "summary_orig": "President Donald Trump said a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely, even after downplaying the prospect of imminent military action and saying Tehran appeared interested in talks. Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The prospect of immediate American action seemed to recede in recent days, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance. On his way back from the World Economic Forum in Davos, the president told reporters on Air Force One the United States was sending a “massive fleet” toward Iran “just in case.” “We’re watching Iran,” he said. “I’d rather not see anything happen but we’re watching them very closely.” Addressing the WEF on Thursday, Trump said the United States attacked Iranian uranium enrichment sites last year to prevent Tehran from making a nuclear weapon. Iran denies its nuclear programme is aimed at seeking the bomb. “Can’t let that happen,” Trump said, adding: “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.” The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had also warned Washington Thursday that the force had its “ finger on the trigger .” A fortnight of protests starting in late December shook Iran’s leadership under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but the movement has petered out in the face of a crackdown, accompanied by an unprecedented internet blackout. Last week, Trump pulled back from a threat to strike Iran over its deadly crackdown on the protests after the White House said Tehran had halted planned executions of demonstrators. In a standoff marked by seesawing rhetoric, Trump had on Tuesday warned Iran’s leaders the United States would “wipe them off the face of this Earth” if there was any attack on his life in response to a strike targeting Khamenei. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in a speech Thursday, accused the United States and Israel of stoking the protests as a “cowardly revenge… for the defeat in the 12-Day War”. ‘Legitimate targets’ Guards commander General Mohammad Pakpour warned Israel and the United States “to avoid any miscalculations” and learn from “what they learned in the 12-day imposed war, so that they do not face a more painful and regrettable fate”. “The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief,” he was quoted by state television on the IRGC’s national day. General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, head of Iran’s joint command headquarters, meanwhile, warned that if America attacked, “all US interests, bases and centres of influence” would be “legitimate targets” for Iranian forces.",

Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The prospect of immediate American action seemed to recede in recent days, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance.

      "summary_orig": "Activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday in Islamabad while they were reportedly en route to the district courts. In the wake of the arrest, journalists and parliamentarians issued strong condemnations and urged justice for the two lawyers. Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court today in the controversial tweets case, after failing to appear yesterday despite repeated summons. Opposition Leader Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said in a post on X that the arrest of the lawyers on their way to court “highlighted the troubling pattern of state overreach and procedural irregularities that undermine the principles of fair trial and due process enshrined in Pakistani laws and international conventions”. “Such actions by the state not only expose institutional weaknesses but risk a complete judicial breakdown, eroding public trust in the rule of law,” he said. The opposition leader added that Imaan and Hadi should be immediately presented for bail and allowed to defend themselves. “Stop silencing dissent and the advocates of human rights,” Abbas said. Former PTI federal minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, despite disagreeing with Imaan’s views, also criticised the arrest. “While I find Imaan Mazari’s views on Balochistan to be foolishly misdirected, no individual should face state repression for their opinions,” he said. Hussain said that the lawyers’ repeated arrests highlighted “the growing irrelevance of professional legal bodies” and called on lawyers “to reclaim their agency and restore the ‘red line’ around their freedom and dignity”. Former senator Afrasiab Khattak called the arrest “a brazen attack by the usurpers on human rights and rule of law”. “But fascist tactics can’t save the usurpers from wrath of the people who will definitely make them accountable,” he added. Meanwhile, former member of parliament Bushra Gohar also condemned the incident, saying, “Speaking up for human rights and standing against oppression isn’t a crime.” Barrister Khadija Siddiqi said on social media that the Islamabad police had allegedly manhandled the lawyers and “forcibly dragged them to arrest them”, while phones recording the arrest had been seized by the police. Siddiqui called it an “abhorrent state of affairs, an absolute shame and disgrace for the Islamabad Bar president”. “No condemnation can be enough!” she said. Dawn ’s foreign affairs and national security correspondent Baqir Sajjad said, “Under international human rights conventions, every person deserves a fair trial and due process. “Denying this and state overreach in under-trial cases expose weakness, not strength. Those facing court must always be given a real chance to defend themselves. Justice demands no less.” He added that judicial compromises and breakdowns did not serve anyone, but rather eroded judicial independence, trust and the rule of law. “Principles aren’t optional,” Sajjad added. Journalist Arifa Noor called on the government to condemn the incident, calling it “absolutely pathetic”. “Will the government and its allies condemn this and make some effort, any effort, to get Imaan and Hadi released?” she said, reposting footage of the arrest posted by Maryam Nawaz Khan. Journalist Mariana Baabar said that the judiciary was trampling its own laws by not producing first information reports (FIRs), saying that Hadi and Imaan were “prepared. Unafraid.” Meanwhile, journalist Asma Sherazi said, “This shows the weakness of (the) government, not Imaan and Hadi. Release them and don’t make mockery of justice.” Journalist Ahmad Noorani also called the incident “highly condemnable”. Journalist Hamid Mir said that the arrest of Imaan and Hadi “will make this couple more powerful and more respectable”.",

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: With hundreds of displaced families stranded on the road due to prolonged registration process, the Khyber district administration on Thursday suspended the evacuation of more families from Tirah valley due to heavy snowfall that began in early hours of the day. A note issued by Khyber House in Peshawar asked Tirah families to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather. It added that the process of evacuation and registration would restart after weather improvement. Sources in Tirah had earlier informed that law-enforcement agencies made announcements in the valley about speedy evacuation of families as the Jan 25 deadline for displacement neared. Stranded families complain they had sleepless nights on the road Announcements caused panic and worry among Tirah families as the weather turned hostile and LEAs wanted them to leave without delay. Gul Mand Khan, who reached Bara on Wednesday evening, told Dawn that it took him and his extended family six days to cover 110 kilometres from Bagh Markaz to Bara. He alleged that the convoy of four vehicles his family travelled in was subjected to prolonged and unnecessary delays at Dwa Thoye, Sandana, Paindi Cheena and later at Mandai Kas in Bara, so they had sleepless nights. “Though my family was provided with four tokens for transport fare at the Bagh Markaz in Tirah by Bara tehsildar Daud Khan on departure from the valley on Jan 16, it took us three days to cover a mere distance of 15 kilometres up to Dwa Thoye where they’re denied transport fare on the pretext that the said amount would be paid to them in Paindi Cheena registration centre,” he insisted. The displaced person said that on arrival in Pandi Cheena after a 24-hour journey, the family was informed that payment would be disbursed at the Mandai Kas centre in Bara. “At Mandai Kas, we’re told to offload luggage from vehicles and take the elderly family members along with women and children to their second homes in Bara and return to collect transport fare the next day,” he said. Mr Khanadded that he was paid fare for just one vehicle, with the rest of the promised amount being withheld on the pretext of verification from the 24-member jirga of Tirah elders despite the issuance of stamped tokens by the district administration in Tirah. Turab Ali, a social worker from the Sipah tribe, told Dawn from the Sandana centre over phone that heavy snowfall has blocked all roads, with the registration process being completely halted and hundreds of families stranded on the road. He said most families had got stuck near the Dwa Thoye centre, facing acute shortage of food and warm clothing. “It is now becoming a human tragedy as the stranded families are without food while they are forced to stay in their vehicles in extreme cold weather without having adequate facilities,” he said. Two children reportedly lost lives and three people suffered injuries as three vehicles carrying them skidded off the road due to slippery conditions on the way from Tirah to Bara. Turab Ali feared more casualties if the vehicles stranded at Dwa Thoye and other areas were not immediately cleared. He said displaced families were fast losing hope of receiving any immediate relief from authorities. Qari Said Faqir, a Malakdinkhel resident in Tirah, accused the district administration of being involved in the sale of fake tokens for transport fare. He claimed that Bara tehsildar stationed at Bagh Maidan Markaz was responsible for issuing tokens but he didn’t have any records of the tokens issued as they’re sold to unauthorised people in Paindi Cheena and Mandai Kas centres. The resident alleged that neither the district administration nor the two parliamentarians from Bara didn’t ensure smooth evacuation of thousands of families from Tirah.

He alleged that the convoy of four vehicles his family travelled in was subjected to prolonged and unnecessary delays at Dwa Thoye, Sandana, Paindi Cheena and later at Mandai Kas in Bara, so they had sleepless nights. “Though my family was provided with four tokens for transport fare at the Bagh Markaz in Tirah by Bara tehsildar Daud Khan on departure from the valley on Jan 16, it took us three days to cover a mere distance of 15 kilometres up to Dwa Thoye where they’re denied transport fare on the pretext that the said amount would be paid to them in Paindi Cheena registration centre,” he insisted. The displaced person said that on arrival in Pandi Cheena after a 24-hour journey, the family was informed that payment would be disbursed at the Mandai Kas centre in Bara. “At Mandai Kas, we’re told to offload luggage from vehicles and take the elderly family members along with women and children to their second homes in Bara and return to collect transport fare the next day,” he said. Mr Khanadded that he was paid fare for just one vehicle, with the rest of the promised amount being withheld on the pretext of verification from the 24-member jirga of Tirah elders despite the issuance of stamped tokens by the district administration in Tirah. Turab Ali, a social worker from the Sipah tribe, told Dawn from the Sandana centre over phone that heavy snowfall has blocked all roads, with the registration process being completely halted and hundreds of families stranded on the road. He said most families had got stuck near the Dwa Thoye centre, facing acute shortage of food and warm clothing. “It is now becoming a human tragedy as the stranded families are without food while they are forced to stay in their vehicles in extreme cold weather without having adequate facilities,” he said. Two children reportedly lost lives and three people suffered injuries as three vehicles carrying them skidded off the road due to slippery conditions on the way from Tirah to Bara. Turab Ali feared more casualties if the vehicles stranded at Dwa Thoye and other areas were not immediately cleared. He said displaced families were fast losing hope of receiving any immediate relief from authorities. Qari Said Faqir, a Malakdinkhel resident in Tirah, accused the district administration of being involved in the sale of fake tokens for transport fare. He claimed that Bara tehsildar stationed at Bagh Maidan Markaz was responsible for issuing tokens but he didn’t have any records of the tokens issued as they’re sold to unauthorised people in Paindi Cheena and Mandai Kas centres. The resident alleged that neither the district administration nor the two parliamentarians from Bara didn’t ensure smooth evacuation of thousands of families from Tirah.

      "summary": "KHYBER: With hundreds of displaced families stranded on the road due to prolonged registration process, the Khyber district administration on Thursday suspended the evacuation of more families from Tirah valley due to heavy snowfall that began in early hours of the day. A note issued by Khyber House in Peshawar asked Tirah families to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather. It added that the process of evacuation and registration would restart after weather improvement. Sources in Tirah had earlier informed that law-enforcement agencies made announcements in the valley about speedy evacuation of families as the Jan 25 deadline for displacement neared.

      "summary_orig": "India hopes next month’s T20 World Cup will bolster its credentials as a global sports host — and the country’s Olympic ambitions — but preparations have been rocked by a diplomatic row with Bangladesh and accusations of political interference. With barely two weeks until the tournament, Bangladesh have effectively been forced out after the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected a request to move their matches from India to co-hosts Sri Lanka, citing security concerns. “Our only demand is to play the World Cup  but not in India,” Bangladesh Cricket Board President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters on Thursday, adding that without a change of venue, the team would not participate . India is preparing to host the 2030 Commonwealth Games in Ahmedabad, seen as a stepping stone to the 2036 Olympics . But the chaotic build-up to the T20 World Cup has cast a shadow over those ambitions, especially with cricket returning to the Olympic Games at Los Angeles 2028. The T20 World Cup schedule was delayed and not released until December and now it appears Scotland could have to be drafted to replace Bangladesh just days before the opening match on February 7. ‘No one to challenge’ “Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation. If a country of nearly 200 million people misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a huge audience,” Bulbul added. “Cricket is entering the Olympics in 2028, Brisbane in 2032, India is bidding for 2036. Excluding a major cricket-loving country like Bangladesh would be a failure.” The ICC said it had found “no credible or verifiable threat” to move Bangladesh’s games, and was committed to “safeguarding the collective interests of the global game”. But that global game is dominated by India, where cricket is woven deep into culture, the economy and politics. South Asia accounts for about 90 per cent of cricket’s billion-plus fans, with India generating roughly three-quarters of the sport’s global income. India’s supremacy stems from the outsized revenues of its BCCI cricket board, flush with cash from its role as custodian of the most popular sport in the world’s most populous country. Sports journalist Pradeep Magazine wrote in the Tribune , an Indian daily, that the BCCI’s “staggering revenues… gives it unimaginable control over decision-making in cricketing affairs of the world”. “There is no one to challenge India’s hegemony.” ICC chairman Jay Shah is the son of Amit Shah, India’s powerful interior minister, and right-hand man of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ‘A political issue’ “Cricket has been captured completely by politics in a way that it never has been before,” Indian sports journalist Sharda Ugra told AFP . “The Bangladesh issue has reached where it has because it’s a political issue.” Political relations between India and Bangladesh have soured since a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled Sheikh Hasina, now a convicted fugitive hosted by old ally New Delhi. But matters escalated after the India Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders were ordered by India’s BCCI board to drop Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman, triggering fury in Dhaka. Rahman’s removal followed online outrage by right-wing Indian Hindus who invoked alleged attacks on a fellow community in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Dhaka maintains that Indian media had exaggerated the scale of the violence. Bangladesh’s interim government sports adviser Asif Nazrul said that “no one should have a monopoly” over cricket. “If the ICC truly wants to be a global organisation, and if the ICC does not rise and sit at India’s command, then we must be given the opportunity to play in the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka,” Nazrul said. Bangladesh wanted to follow the example of Pakistan, who will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under a deal hatched after India refused to travel to Islamabad for the 2025 Champions Trophy and all their games were moved in Dubai. “There is no one in the ICC who can stand up to anything that the BCCI says or does,” said Ugra. “The BCCI and the ICC are the same thing at the moment.” Header image: Bangladesh line up for the anthem for the Bangladesh vs Sri Lanka men’s T20 Asia Cup match in Abu Dhabi on September 13, 2025. — AFP/File",

      "summary_orig": "• Israeli strikes kill five Palestinians in Gaza • Hamas condemns US sanctions on non-government organisations DAVOS: Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt will reopen next week after largely being shut during the Israel-Hamas war, the Palestinian technocrat leader backed by Washington to administer the enclave announced on Thursday. Ali Shaath made the announcement by video link during an event in Davos hosted by President Donald Trump, who convened a group of leaders to formally launch a “Board of Peace” initially focused on cementing Gaza’s ceasefire. A key unfulfilled element of the ceasefire, brokered by Trump in October, has been the reopening of Gaza’s main gateway to the world to allow the entry and exit of Palestinians. “I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions. For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate. It is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity,” Shaath said. “Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and to the war,” Shaath said. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has controlled the Rafah crossing since 2024. The ceasefire deal left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, including the area that abuts the border crossing. Hamas controls the remainder of the enclave. Israeli strikes kill five In the Gaza Strip, health officials said Israeli air strikes on Thursday killed five people in the enclave. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the violence, the latest to fray the October truce accord. Israel has continued to carry out air and artillery strikes in Gaza. Health officials at Al Shifa Hos­pital, Gaza’s largest, said four Pale­stinians were killed by Israeli tank shelling in the Zeitoun suburb of eastern Gaza City. A fifth person was killed by Israeli fire in Khan Yunis in the south, health officials said. A day earlier, Israeli fire killed 11 people including two boys and three journalists, health officials said. On Thursday, Palestinians in Gaza held funerals for the three journalists, who press advocates said had been using a drone to film tents housing displaced people. US sanctions on NGOs Hamas on Thursday condemned as “unjust” a move by the United States to sanction Palestinian associations which Washington accused of having links to the movement. The US on Wednesday imposed sanctions on six nonprofit organisations working in the Gaza Strip, which the Treasury Department said “claim to provide medical care to Palestinian civilians but in fact support the military wing of Hamas”. It also announced sanctions on a group of Palestinians involved in civilian flotillas that aim to break Israel’s sea blockade on Gaza to bring in humanitarian aid. The Treasury Department said the Popular Conference for Palestinians Abroad has been “a main organiser” of the flotillas and charged that it was “clandestinely acting on behalf of Hamas”. “We view these decisions as unjust and oppressive,” Hamas said in a statement, suggesting the sanctions were incited by Israel as a fight against the Palestinian “national cause”. All the organisations were accused of “secret ties to Hamas” in the US Treasury statement. The sanctions will block any assets the groups have in the United States and criminalise transactions with them. Hamas called on Washington to walk back its decision.

      "summary_en": "• Israeli strikes kill five Palestinians in Gaza • Hamas condemns US sanctions on non-government organisations DAVOS: Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt will reopen next week after largely being shut during the Israel-Hamas war, the Palestinian technocrat leader backed by Washington to administer the enclave announced on Thursday. Ali Shaath made the announcement by video link during an event in Davos hosted by President Donald Trump, who convened a group of leaders to formally launch a “Board of Peace” initially focused on cementing Gaza’s ceasefire. A key unfulfilled element of the ceasefire, brokered by Trump in October, has been the reopening of Gaza’s main gateway to the world to allow the entry and exit of Palestinians. “I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions. For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate. It is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity,” Shaath said. “Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and to the war,” Shaath said. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has controlled the Rafah crossing since 2024. The ceasefire deal left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, including the area that abuts the border crossing. Hamas controls the remainder of the enclave. Israeli strikes kill five In the Gaza Strip, health officials said Israeli air strikes on Thursday killed five people in the enclave. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the violence, the latest to fray the October truce accord. Israel has continued to carry out air and artillery strikes in Gaza. Health officials at Al Shifa Hos­pital, Gaza’s largest, said four Pale­stinians were killed by Israeli tank shelling in the Zeitoun suburb of eastern Gaza City. A fifth person was killed by Israeli fire in Khan Yunis in the south, health officials said. A day earlier, Israeli fire killed 11 people including two boys and three journalists, health officials said. On Thursday, Palestinians in Gaza held funerals for the three journalists, who press advocates said had been using a drone to film tents housing displaced people. US sanctions on NGOs Hamas on Thursday condemned as “unjust” a move by the United States to sanction Palestinian associations which Washington accused of having links to the movement. The US on Wednesday imposed sanctions on six nonprofit organisations working in the Gaza Strip, which the Treasury Department said “claim to provide medical care to Palestinian civilians but in fact support the military wing of Hamas”. It also announced sanctions on a group of Palestinians involved in civilian flotillas that aim to break Israel’s sea blockade on Gaza to bring in humanitarian aid. The Treasury Department said the Popular Conference for Palestinians Abroad has been “a main organiser” of the flotillas and charged that it was “clandestinely acting on behalf of Hamas”. “We view these decisions as unjust and oppressive,” Hamas said in a statement, suggesting the sanctions were incited by Israel as a fight against the Palestinian “national cause”. All the organisations were accused of “secret ties to Hamas” in the US Treasury statement. The sanctions will block any assets the groups have in the United States and criminalise transactions with them. Hamas called on Washington to walk back its decision.

      "title_orig": "Iran warns ‘finger on trigger’ as Trump claims Tehran wants talks",
      "summary_orig": "• Iran’s top commander says forces are ‘more prepared than ever’ • Trump calls end to Russia-Ukraine war after ‘positive’ meeting with Zelensky • Washington claims permanent Greenland access is secured; Dan­ish PM denies talks on island’s sovereignty PARIS : The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards warned Washington on Thur­sday that his force has its “finger on the trigger” following mass protests, even as US President Donald Trump insisted the Islamic Republic appears ready for negotiations. Gen Mohammad Pakpour, the Guards’ commander, cautioned Israel and the United States “to avoid any miscalculations by learning from historical experiences and what they learned in the 12-day imposed war”. “The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief [Khamenei] — a leader dearer than their own lives,” Pakpour said in a statement quoted by state television. While the prospect of immediate American action against Tehran appeared to recede this week, tensions remain high. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said the US struck Iranian uranium enrichment sites last year to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. “Can’t let that happen,” Trump said. “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.” Gen Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, who leads the Iranian joint command headquarters, warned that if the US attacks, “all US interests, bases and centres of influence” would become “legitimate targets”. Trump had on Tuesday warned Iran’s leaders the US would “wipe them off the face of this earth” if there was any attack on his life in response to a strike targeting Khamenei. The warnings come as Iranian leadership faces the aftermath of protests that began in late December. A violent crackdown has quelled the movement, accompanied by what the monitor NetBlocks called a “national kill-switch” internet blackout now in its second week. Iranian authorities on Wednesday released their first official toll from recent protests, stating 3,117 people were killed. Trump-Zelensky meeting Separately, Trump declared that Russia’s war on Kyiv “has to end” after holding a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos on Thursday. Following the discussion, Zelensky reported progress on peace talk negotiations and discussions regarding air defence supplies. When asked by reporters what his message was for Russian President Vladimir Putin — who is scheduled to meet with a US envoy in Mos­cow later — Trump was direct. “This war has to end,” Trump said. He described the encounter with the Ukrainian leader as positive. Zelensky characterised the talks with his US counterpart as “productive”. Writing on the social media platform X, he indicated that diplomatic efforts between the two nations are intensifying. Greenland deal Meanwhile, Trump said he had secured total and permanent US access to Greenland in a deal with Nato, whose head said allies would have to step up their commitment to Arctic security to ward off threats from Russia and China. The development came as Trump backed off tariff threats and dismissed seizing Greenland by force, reducing tension in transatlantic relations. “It’s really being negotiated now, the details of it,” Trump told Fox Business Network from the World Economic Forum. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told Reuters in Davos it’s now up to senior commanders to handle extra security details. “I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026,” he said. While the news triggered a rebound in European markets, officials remain cautious. Dan­ish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen clarified that while security talks are progres­sing, no negotiations occurred regarding sovereignty over the semi-autonomous territory. “It is still a difficult and serious situation, but progress has also been made in the sense that we have now got things where they need to be. Namely that we can discuss how we promote common security in the Arctic region,” Frederiksen said. Published in Dawn, January 23rd, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• City admin to monitor festival using drones, safe city cameras for compliance • Nearly 2,500 kite sellers, traders and associations apply for registration LAHORE: The Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has imposed a ban on kite flying in public parks and greenbelts on Basant, as the Lahore administration decided to digitally monitor the three-day festival, starting Feb 6, to ensure compliance. PHA Managing Director Raja Mansoor Ahmad said the decision was made to ensure that kite flying and related celebrations did not harm trees and other park infrastructure. “Since the Basant festival is being held for three days in Lahore alone, the arrival of a number of people from other cities of Punjab, other provinces and abroad is expected here for kite flying and other related activities. In such a situation, the people may rush for the public parks and green areas for kite flying and other related celebrations…” he told Dawn. He said the decision was made to prevent any untoward incident, including damage to the plants, greenbelts and other infrastructure. “Lahore, in addition to its huge number of permanent residents, may also have a considerable number of people from other cities and countries starting from the Feb 4 evening, since Feb 5 is also a public holiday (Youm-i-Kashmir),” he added. “The parks would remain open to the people, but they wouldn’t be allowed for kite flying,” he said, adding that the PHA enforcement staff has been put on high alert. According to an official notification by the PHA, the directors concerned have been asked to ensure strict implementation of the ban within their respective zones. The authority emphasised that any violation of these instructions will be considered unacceptable, and in case of any damage or untoward incident, the respective director would be held responsible. Digital monitoring Meanwhile, the city district administration said that strict digital monitoring of Basant would be carried out through drone cameras and the Lahore Safe City Authority’s cameras. A control room would be set up at the DC office. It was revealed in a meeting presided over by Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali Ijaz. “Kite flying will only be allowed from Feb 6 to 8, whereas the material will be sold through registered dealers alone,” the DC said while speaking on the occasion. He said that kites bigger than the ap­­pro­ved sizes will be prohibited. More­over, none of the bikers would be allowed to drive without safety wires. Basant would only be allowed at specific grounds or no­­tified rooftops, including in the Walled City or other locations across the district. Registration of kite manufacturers On the other hand, as many as 2,437 kite manufacturers, sellers, traders and associations have applied for registration with the city administration for the festival. According to a document seen by Dawn , as many as 1,334 kite sellers applied for registration till Jan 22, 2026. Out of this, 161 applications were currently in process, whereas 1,107 had been approved. A total of 838 kite manufacturers applied for registration, 697 applications had been approved, whereas 85 were in process. However, 51 applications were rejected. Similarly, 250 kite traders applied for registration, out of which 19 applications were in process and 223 had been appro­ved. Eight applications were rejected. Moreover, 18 kite flying associations applied for registration, of which 12 were approved, two are in process, while four applications were rejected. It is pertinent to mention that the provincial government decided in December last year to celebrate a limited Basant in Lahore with strict conditions. Published in Dawn, January 23rd, 2026",

      "title_orig": "Death toll of deadly fire at Karachi’s Gul Plaza reaches 67",
      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The death toll of the deadly fire at Karachi’s Gul Plaza reached 67 on Thursday as rescuers continued to comb through the wreckage of the gutted building. Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed issued a list of 67 individuals, only seven of which had been identified. Earlier in the day, she had issued a list confirming the deaths of 50 people. A separate statement issued by the Sindh health department spokesperson also said that the post-mortem examination of 67 bodies had been conducted. The updated death toll comes a day after officials found the bodies of 30 people from a single shop on the mezzanine floor. The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards. Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that urban search and rescue teams were conducting a search operation with the help of a thermal imaging camera (TIC). “Urban search and rescue teams are working at the incident site and using specialised tools and cutters,” he said. The official said that the camera detected heat up to 1,500°C. However, the temperature of the shopping mall was higher, affecting the remains of the victims, he regretted. He said that officials had never experienced such an incident in recent memory, adding that cooling work had been ongoing for the past three days. He said that the building’s structure was dilapidated, due to which authorities were exercising extreme caution during the search operation. He said that there was no way inside the buildings due to which rescue workers cut through the walls, which triggered “vibrations”. Therefore, the work, which should have taken 10 to 20 minutes to finish, took between one and two hours. He said that a team from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) had also visited the plaza. According to the Rescue 1122 spokesperson, the SBCA informed them that the building would be demolished after the search operation was completed. Sources familiar with the preliminary findings of the committee tasked with investigating the devastating fire told Dawn that the blaze started from a shop selling artificial flowers on the ground floor due to the alleged negligence of the owner. They said the shop owner had been traced and interviewed and he told investigators that his two minor sons were playing in the shop while he was away. While playing, they lit a match and threw it into the shop without putting it out before leaving, the sources said. As a result, the shop caught fire due to the presence of combustible material, the sources added. An official told Dawn on the condition of anonymity that the shop owner’s account was also corroborated by other witnesses. He said that since it was an accident, the owner or his sons had not been detained. Relatives criticise pace of rescue operation Relatives of those still missing have criticised the slow operation at the three-storey plaza, where rescuers are scouring the wreckage for human remains. Faraz Ali, whose father and 26-year-old brother were inside the mall, told AFP he wants “the bodies to be recovered and handed over to their rightful families”. “That is all so that the families may receive something, some comfort, some peace. At least let us see them one last time, in whatever condition they are, so that we may say our final goodbye,” the 28-year-old said. Some families also staged a protest outside Gul Plaza on Thursday, criticising the slow pace of the operation. The protestors said that almost six days had passed but their children were still buried under the debris. SBCA begins fire safety assessments The SBCA, meanwhile, said it had initiated fire safety assessments in Karachi on the directives of Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah. A statement issued by SBCA Director General (DG) Muzammil Halepoto’s office said fire safety arrangements in 35 of the city’s buildings, including both residential and commercial ones, had been carried out. It quoted Halepoto as saying that the “functionality of firefighting and emergency systems” was being assessed in the exercise and notices for corrective measures would be issued to the owners of buildings with faulty fire safety systems. Halepoto further stated that fire safety notices had been issued for 266 buildings in Karachi, which also included those covered in a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) survey . He recalled that the KMC had also issued directives to builders, building owners and unions in January 2024 to ensure fire safety. The official warned that buildings lacking firefighting tools and safety measures within the given time would be sealed. The SBCA DG asserted that fire safety assessments would continue in the city to ensure emergency preparedness. Additional input from AFP",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other world leaders on Thursday signed the charter for the “ Board of Peace ” headed by United States President Donald Trump, who has billed the body as a platform for resolving international conflicts. Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year war on the Palestinian enclave, the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts. A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — gathered on stage with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland to put their names to the founding charter of the body. Trump — who is the chairman of the Board of Peace — said they were “in most cases very popular leaders, some cases not so popular”. “That’s the way it goes in life,” he said. “Congratulations, President Trump. The charter is now in full force, and the Board of Peace is now an official international organisation,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “Every one of them are friends of mine. I like every single one of them,” Trump said about the signatories. “Just about every country wants to be a part of it. We sent out the letters a couple of days ago and countries that are here just happened to be in Davos,” he said. The US president declared, “Everybody in this room is a star […] There’s a reason that you’re here. When you use that inspired genius for peace, the opposite of peace has no chance.” Trump officials also unveiled ambitious plans for a “New Gaza” during the ceremony, with the US leader describing the devastated Palestinian territory as “great real estate.” Referring to the signatories at the outset of his speech, Trump said, “Each and every one of you, we are truly honoured by your presence today. Leaders of countries, in most cases, very popular leaders; in some cases, not so popular.” Among those seated in the audience was PM Shehbaz. Pakistan on Wednesday had accepted Trump’s invitation to join the Board of Peace. After Trump’s address, the heads of various countries took turns to sign the board’s charter. Permanent members must also pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay to play” version of the UN Security Council. While Trump’s plan had sparked concerns that he wants the board to rival the United Nations (UN), the US president said the body will work “in conjunction” with the UN. Officials from Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan also signed the document with Trump. Apart from the US, no other permanent member of the UNSC — the five nations with the most say over international law and diplomacy since the end of World War Two — has so far committed to join. France has declined to join. Britain said on Thursday it was not joining at present. China has not yet said whether it will do so. However, the Board of Peace’s potential membership has been controversial, with Trump inviting Israel’s PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Netanyahu has said Israel will join the board, but he was not at the ceremony. Trump had also invited Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine four years ago. While the US president said Putin had agreed to join, the Russian leader said he was still studying the invitation. Reuters could not immediately spot any representatives from governments of top global powers or from Israel or the Palestinian Authority (PA) at the signing ceremony. ‘End’ of Hamas if it doesn’t disarm: Trump During his speech, the US president also said that Hamas must disarm under the Gaza ceasefire deal or it will be the “end” of the Palestinian movement. “They have to give up their weapons, and if they don’t do that, it’s going to be the end of them,” Trump said. “We’re committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,” he affirmed, adding that “we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza”. “Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do, and we’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,” the US president said, adding that the combination of the Board of Peace and the UN could be “very, very unique for the world”. Trump recalled that under Phase 1 of the ceasefire plan, “we have painstakingly […] maintained the Gaza ceasefire, delivered record levels of humanitarian aid”. “We’ve given aid, you know, you used to hear that all the people were starving and it was terrible. You don’t hear that anymore,” he insisted, highlighting the release of 20 Israeli captives and the bodies of most of the deceased ones. The US president asserted: “The first steps toward a brighter day for the Middle East and a much safer future for the world are unfolding before your very eyes. “Together we are in a position to have an incredible chance — I don’t even call it a chance, it’s gonna happen — to end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region, and for the whole region of the world, because I’m calling the world a region.” Trump also claimed that Iran wants to hold talks with the US, and that Washington was willing to do so. “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.” He also recalled the US strikes on Iran’s uranium enrichment sites in June 2025.“Can’t let that happen,” he said, referring to the US’s stance that Tehran plans to build nuclear weapons. ‘New Gaza’ plans A large part of the ceremony was devoted to talking about its plans for shattered Gaza. US businessman Jared Kushner speaks as a “Gaza Timeline” is displayed on a giant screen at the “Board of Peace” meeting during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit in Davos on Jan 22, 2026. — AFP Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a former property developer like the president, showed slides of what he billed as a “master plan” for Gaza’s reconstruction. The slides included maps of new settlements in the Gaza Strip and artist renderings of gleaming seafront hotels and apartments under the caption “New Gaza”. “It could be a hope. It could be a destination,” Kushner said. Kushner said the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal would address funding for reconstruction in the territory, which lies mostly in ruins, as well as disarmament by Hamas, one of the most intractable unresolved issues. “If Hamas doesn’t demilitarise, that would be what holds this plan back,” Kushner said. “The next 100 days, we’re going to continue to just be heads down and focused on making sure this is implemented. We continue to be focused on humanitarian aid, humanitarian shelter, but then creating the conditions to move forward.” Focus right now on Gaza: Rubio US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff also spoke on the occasion. In his speech, Rubio highlighted that Trump was “willing to talk to or engage with anyone in the interest of peace”. He stressed, “Now we have this Board of Peace … [its] possibilities are endless. Obviously, with a focus first and foremost on making sure this peace deal in Gaza becomes enduring. “I know this president has it as his highest priority and will give everything that he has to make sure that this is successful.” The US secretary of state asserted: “This is not just a Board of Peace but a board of action, just like President Trump is a president of action.” Rubio emphasised that the “focus is right now on Gaza and making sure that the […] vision for the future of Gaza […] of the region, is not just possible and promising, but it is our destiny”. He further said it would serve as an example of “what’s possible for other places and other conflicts that seem impossible to solve right now”. “Many others who are going to join … are not in town today or they have to go through some procedure internally in their own country because of constitutional limitations, but others will join,” Rubio added. Brazen disregard for int’l law, human rights: Amnesty Meanwhile, Amnesty International termed the ceremony marking the Board of Peace’s establishment a “brazen disregard for international law and human rights”. “It also represents a stark new manifestation of the escalating assault on United Nations mechanisms, international justice institutions and universal norms,” the rights body said in a statement on X. Amnesty further noted: “At the direction of its to-be chairman, President Trump, with its membership comprised of US allies including a few heads of state he has personally invited, the putative mechanism is fundamentally at odds with the international legal system that underpins the global order. “It is a slap in the face of decades of efforts to strengthen global governance through adherence to universal values and greater equality between member states and derails legitimate efforts to address the current system’s limitations and gaps.” Amnesty emphasised that now was “precisely the moment that international law must be upheld, defended and enforced; not abandoned in favour of ad hoc arrangements shaped and distorted by political and economic interests, personal ambition or vanity”. Rafah crossing to open ‘in both directions’: Palestinian official The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip will reopen in both directions next week, said Ali Shaath , the newly-appointed administrator of the Palestinian territory under the US-backed plan. The reopening of the crossing is part of the Gaza truce plan announced by Trump in October, but it has remained closed so far. “I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions,” Shaath, a former PA deputy minister, said at the Board of Peace launch ceremony. “For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate; it is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity. Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and the world,” Shaath said. As part of the truce plan, Shaath was named to head a committee of 15 Palestinian technocrats to oversee the day-to-day administration of Gaza. Additional input from Reuters",

The charter is now in full force, and the Board of Peace is now an official international organisation,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. “Every one of them are friends of mine. I like every single one of them,” Trump said about the signatories. “Just about every country wants to be a part of it. We sent out the letters a couple of days ago and countries that are here just happened to be in Davos,” he said. The US president declared, “Everybody in this room is a star […] There’s a reason that you’re here. When you use that inspired genius for peace, the opposite of peace has no chance.” Trump officials also unveiled ambitious plans for a “New Gaza” during the ceremony, with the US leader describing the devastated Palestinian territory as “great real estate.” Referring to the signatories at the outset of his speech, Trump said, “Each and every one of you, we are truly honoured by your presence today. Leaders of countries, in most cases, very popular leaders; in some cases, not so popular.” Among those seated in the audience was PM Shehbaz. Pakistan on Wednesday had accepted Trump’s invitation to join the Board of Peace. After Trump’s address, the heads of various countries took turns to sign the board’s charter. Permanent members must also pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay to play” version of the UN Security Council. While Trump’s plan had sparked concerns that he wants the board to rival the United Nations (UN), the US president said the body will work “in conjunction” with the UN. Officials from Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan also signed the document with Trump. Apart from the US, no other permanent member of the UNSC — the five nations with the most say over international law and diplomacy since the end of World War Two — has so far committed to join. France has declined to join. Britain said on Thursday it was not joining at present. China has not yet said whether it will do so. However, the Board of Peace’s potential membership has been controversial, with Trump inviting Israel’s PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Gaza. Netanyahu has said Israel will join the board, but he was not at the ceremony. Trump had also invited Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine four years ago. While the US president said Putin had agreed to join, the Russian leader said he was still studying the invitation. Reuters could not immediately spot any representatives from governments of top global powers or from Israel or the Palestinian Authority (PA) at the signing ceremony. ‘End’ of Hamas if it doesn’t disarm: Trump During his speech, the US president also said that Hamas must disarm under the Gaza ceasefire deal or it will be the “end” of the Palestinian movement. “They have to give up their weapons, and if they don’t do that, it’s going to be the end of them,” Trump said. “We’re committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,” he affirmed, adding that “we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza”. “Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do, and we’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,” the US president said, adding that the combination of the Board of Peace and the UN could be “very, very unique for the world”. Trump recalled that under Phase 1 of the ceasefire plan, “we have painstakingly […] maintained the Gaza ceasefire, delivered record levels of humanitarian aid”. “We’ve given aid, you know, you used to hear that all the people were starving and it was terrible. You don’t hear that anymore,” he insisted, highlighting the release of 20 Israeli captives and the bodies of most of the deceased ones. The US president asserted: “The first steps toward a brighter day for the Middle East and a much safer future for the world are unfolding before your very eyes. “Together we are in a position to have an incredible chance — I don’t even call it a chance, it’s gonna happen — to end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region, and for the whole region of the world, because I’m calling the world a region.” Trump also claimed that Iran wants to hold talks with the US, and that Washington was willing to do so. “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.” He also recalled the US strikes on Iran’s uranium enrichment sites in June 2025.“Can’t let that happen,” he said, referring to the US’s stance that Tehran plans to build nuclear weapons. ‘New Gaza’ plans A large part of the ceremony was devoted to talking about its plans for shattered Gaza. US businessman Jared Kushner speaks as a “Gaza Timeline” is displayed on a giant screen at the “Board of Peace” meeting during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit in Davos on Jan 22, 2026. — AFP Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, a former property developer like the president, showed slides of what he billed as a “master plan” for Gaza’s reconstruction. The slides included maps of new settlements in the Gaza Strip and artist renderings of gleaming seafront hotels and apartments under the caption “New Gaza”. “It could be a hope. It could be a destination,” Kushner said. Kushner said the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal would address funding for reconstruction in the territory, which lies mostly in ruins, as well as disarmament by Hamas, one of the most intractable unresolved issues. “If Hamas doesn’t demilitarise, that would be what holds this plan back,” Kushner said. “The next 100 days, we’re going to continue to just be heads down and focused on making sure this is implemented. We continue to be focused on humanitarian aid, humanitarian shelter, but then creating the conditions to move forward.” Focus right now on Gaza: Rubio US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff also spoke on the occasion. In his speech, Rubio highlighted that Trump was “willing to talk to or engage with anyone in the interest of peace”. He stressed, “Now we have this Board of Peace … [its] possibilities are endless. Obviously, with a focus first and foremost on making sure this peace deal in Gaza becomes enduring. “I know this president has it as his highest priority and will give everything that he has to make sure that this is successful.” The US secretary of state asserted: “This is not just a Board of Peace but a board of action, just like President Trump is a president of action.” Rubio emphasised that the “focus is right now on Gaza and making sure that the […] vision for the future of Gaza […] of the region, is not just possible and promising, but it is our destiny”. He further said it would serve as an example of “what’s possible for other places and other conflicts that seem impossible to solve right now”. “Many others who are going to join … are not in town today or they have to go through some procedure internally in their own country because of constitutional limitations, but others will join,” Rubio added. Brazen disregard for int’l law, human rights: Amnesty Meanwhile, Amnesty International termed the ceremony marking the Board of Peace’s establishment a “brazen disregard for international law and human rights”. “It also represents a stark new manifestation of the escalating assault on United Nations mechanisms, international justice institutions and universal norms,” the rights body said in a statement on X. Amnesty further noted: “At the direction of its to-be chairman, President Trump, with its membership comprised of US allies including a few heads of state he has personally invited, the putative mechanism is fundamentally at odds with the international legal system that underpins the global order. “It is a slap in the face of decades of efforts to strengthen global governance through adherence to universal values and greater equality between member states and derails legitimate efforts to address the current system’s limitations and gaps.” Amnesty emphasised that now was “precisely the moment that international law must be upheld, defended and enforced; not abandoned in favour of ad hoc arrangements shaped and distorted by political and economic interests, personal ambition or vanity”. Rafah crossing to open ‘in both directions’: Palestinian official The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip will reopen in both directions next week, said Ali Shaath , the newly-appointed administrator of the Palestinian territory under the US-backed plan. The reopening of the crossing is part of the Gaza truce plan announced by Trump in October, but it has remained closed so far. “I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions,” Shaath, a former PA deputy minister, said at the Board of Peace launch ceremony. “For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate; it is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity. Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and the world,” Shaath said. As part of the truce plan, Shaath was named to head a committee of 15 Palestinian technocrats to oversee the day-to-day administration of Gaza. Additional input from Reuters",

      "summary": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other world leaders on Thursday signed the charter for the “ Board of Peace ” headed by United States President Donald Trump, who has billed the body as a platform for resolving international conflicts. Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year war on the Palestinian enclave, the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts. A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — gathered on stage with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland to put their names to the founding charter of the body.
