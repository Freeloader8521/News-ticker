Although no security incidents have been reported, military officials say the breach has renewed scrutiny of how personal parcels are managed on and around military installations. The issue came to light after reports that some soldiers had entered building numbers, unit names and personal identifiers into the company’s delivery app to ensure accurate drop-offs. One junior officer said that troops had routinely listed a brigade, battalion and building number, along with names and ranks, because broader addresses often resulted in packages being sent to the wrong location.

      "summary_orig": "Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said on Thursday that a man arrested by the US police last week in Delaware after he was found in possession of a handgun, ammunition and written plans for an attack was not of Pakistani origin and was an Afghan. “He is not [a] Pakistani national or [of] Pakistan origin. He is an Afghan, spent a few years as a refugee [in Pakistan] and then went to the US, where he spent most of his life,” Andrabi said in a statement shared with journalists. His clarification came after several media reports, including those from Indian and American news outlets, identified the suspect as a man of Pakistani origin. A USA Today report said the arrested man, Luqman Khan, was a Pakistan-born US citizen, who was arrested on November 24. Similarly, reports by the New York Post and India’s Hindustan Times and Times of India , among others, also identified him as a Pakistani immigrant. According to a report by The Associated Press from earlier today, which also does not identify Khan as a man of Pakistani origin, the suspect was a student of the University of Delaware. Meanwhile, a press release issued by the US Department of Justice on Dec 1 detailing charges against Khan identified him as a resident of Delaware’s Wilmington city and did not make any mention of his nationality. It said that Khan was stopped by police at a traffic stop on November 24, and when he refused to comply, was arrested. “During their investigation, officers discovered in Khan’s vehicle a .357 caliber Glock handgun loaded with 27 rounds,” it said. It added that officials also discovered a handwritten notebook, in which Khan discussed “additional weapons and firearms, how they could be used in an attack, and how law enforcement detection could be avoided once an attack was carried out”. “The notebook referenced a member of the University of Delaware’s Police Department by name, and included a layout of a building with entry and exit points under which the words ‘UD Police Station’ were printed,” it said. It added that later, law enforcement searched his residence and recovered “a Glock 19 9mm handgun equipped with an illegal machinegun conversion device, commonly called a ‘switch’”. “Law enforcement also recovered a .556 rifle with a scope and a red dot sight, eleven more extended magazines, hollow point rounds of ammunition, and a two-plate tactical vest equipped with a single ballistic plate,” the department said. According to the Department of Justice press release, Khan was charged with illegally possessing a machine gun on November 26. “If convicted of the charge, Khan faces a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment. If Khan is ultimately convicted, a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors,” it said.",

      "summary_orig": "KHYBER: The militancy-hit residents of Tirah Valley and Upper Bara have blasted the elected representatives for failing to address their grievances since their return to their homes in 2015 and 2022, respectively. MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani, who is also chairman of the District Development Advisory Committee, are yet to visit upper Bara, residents complained, saying they were now pinning their hopes on new Chief Minister Suhail Afridi, who also belongs to Bara. The Khyber district administration and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority also have failed to complete the assessment survey of the damaged houses while residents are compelled to either live in dilapidated houses or have taken shelter in temporary abodes to get through harsh winter. Most of the displaced families returned to Tirah back in 2015 and 2016, while families from Upper Bara localities were allowed to go back in 2022 after the region was de-notified. Complain survey of damaged houses not completed, forcing them to live in dilapidated structures Ironically, more than 2,500 families from the region with mostly hailing from Upper Bara were not given the status of internally displaced persons at the time of their forced displacement and were thus deprived of most of the facilities and assistance pledged by the disaster management authorities to IDPs of other regions. Residents Dawn spoke to presented a long list of their problems, which they had been facing since their return, with immediate reconstruction of their fully and partially damaged homes as their urgent requirement. They said they were still awaiting provision of drinking water, electricity, rehabilitation of health and educational facilities, repair of damaged irrigation channels, provision of quality seeds along with modern agricultural machinery and tools, construction of bridges over Bara River and creation of jobs for local unemployed youth. Khalil Khan, a social activist, told Dawn that literacy rate in most parts of Tirah was rapidly declining due to absence of formal schooling, while people faced extreme difficulties in acquiring better health facilities due to nonexistence of a well-equipped hospital in the entire valley. The Type-D Hospital, announced in 2015 by then Governor Sardar Mehtab Ahmad Khan was yet to be constructed, he lamented and added most people either relied on private clinics or took patients to Bara, Jamrud and Peshawar hospitals. He warned Tirah youth could easily fall prey to insinuations of terrorist groups as they were mostly uneducated and thus unemployed. “It’s time Tirah youth were engaged in productive activities by imparting them skills development training and recruiting them to police and other departments,” he suggested. Suhbat Shah Afridi, a resident of Upper Bara, said they had so far received limited assistance from some NGOs while the security forces stationed in the region also helped execute certain development schemes. He, however, regretted that parliamentarians were yet to announce any development project. “The provincial government shall encourage NOGs to initiate mega projects for our region to alleviate the sufferings of the returned families,” he demanded. “At present, it seems our region is not included in the domain of the government departments and thus we have no or little access to the basic facilities of life,” he stated.

      "summary_orig": "ACHIEVING true national cohesion is not possible unless Pakistanis of all confessional backgrounds are ensured their fundamental rights. Sadly, over the decades we have witnessed the space for non-Muslim minorities shrink considerably. This has been manifested in the form of prejudice and discrimination that these communities face, while in worse instances, non-Muslim citizens, their properties and places of worship have come under violent attack from extremists. The state has pledged after every such atrocity to protect minorities and crack down on extremism. Yet to achieve both goals, institutional responses are required, and the state has a mixed report card in this area. In a related development, the National Commission for Minorities Rights Bill, 2025, was passed by parliament on Tuesday in order to create a proper framework to address the issues of non-Muslim citizens. The federal law minister told parliament that the commission would look into issues such as forced conversions, job quotas, sanitation workers’ rights and other “matters of dignity”. The bill’s passage faced significant opposition from both religious and mainstream parties over its proviso that it would have ‘overriding effect’ — meaning that when passed, it would have precedence over previous laws. Many felt this would dilute earlier laws which concerned the Ahmadi community. In order to get the legislation passed, that clause, as well as suo motu powers for the minorities commission, were dropped. While theological matters are best left to scholars and ulema, when it comes to basic constitutional protections, the fundamental rights of all communities must be protected and guaranteed.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Wednes­day petitioned the Isla­mabad High Cou­rt (IHC) to allow doctors from Shaukat Khanum Me­­morial Cancer Hospital (SKMCH) to examine ‘ailing’ PTI fou­n­d­­er and ex-premier Imran Khan for accurate diagnosis and better treatment. The petitioner argued that Mr Khan was facing “multiple health complications” and “required assessment from specialist doctors”. He claimed that the PTI founder had been jailed as a political victim under alleged pressure from the government and, therefore, was entitled to quality medical facilities in the interest of justice. The Punjab government has been made a respondent in the petition through its prison department. The IHC has fixed the petition for hearing and sought records from relevant authorities. Plea moved by KP CM says ex-premier facing multiple health complications The plea comes a day after Mr Khan’s sister, Uzma Khanum, dispelled rumours regarding her brother’s health following a supervised meeting with him in Adiala jail. Speaking to the media, she said the former premier was “perfectly fine”, though “extremely angry” and alleging that he and his wife Bushra Bibi were being subjected to “mental torture” by confining them to a small room and denied communication for weeks. She said her brother complained that he had not been allowed to meet anyone for four weeks and was confined to his cell most of the day with minimal time outdoors. The meeting lasted around 30 minutes and was held under strict monitoring without mobile devices. Weekly protests Separately, Aleema Khanum announ­ced that she and Uzma would stage a sit-in outside Adiala jail on Tuesdays until six family members and six lawyers were allowed visitation, while PTI workers would hold their own sit-in on Thursdays. PTI supporters had staged demonstrations outside the jail and the IHC a day earlier to protest restrictions on the former prime minister’s visitation rights, claiming that no one had been allowed to meet him or Bushra Bibi since Oct 27. Islam­abad and Rawalpindi administrations had imposed Section 144 ahead of the protests. Four protesters remanded to jail Meanwhile, Judicial Magistrate Shahzad Khan on Wednesday sent four PTI workers to Adiala jail on judicial remand after they were arrested for violating the ban imposed on gatherings in twin cities by staging protests. According to the police, the accused were detained from Sector G-14 and were found in possession of PTI flags, badges and photographs of Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi. An FIR was registered at Sumbal police station, and the police told the magistrate that further investigation was underway. Published in Dawn, December 4th, 2025",

The clash over the crossing underscores the desperate reality for Gaza’s population, who have been trapped under an intensifying siege since the Israeli military seized the Palestinian side of the terminal in May 2024. While Israel’s Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) said the crossing would open in the “coming days” exclusively for the exit of residents, Egypt denied any such agreement exists, refusing to facilitate what critics fear is the forced displacement of Palestinians. “If an agreement is reached to open the crossing, it will be in both directions, to enter and exit the Gaza Strip,” Egypt’s State Information Service said in a statement, insisting on adherence to the terms of the US-brokered peace plan which mandates full humanitarian access. The Rafah crossing, the only vital artery to the outside world for the residents of Gaza not controlled directly by Israel, has been shuttered for months, strangling the flow of life-saving aid. COGAT claimed the operation would be supervised by an EU Border Assistance Mission, mirroring a mechanism from a brief truce in early 2025. However, European diplomatic sources indicated that previous preparations to open the crossing were delayed, prolonging the suffering of civilians. While COGAT claimed convoys are passing through the nearby Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing, humanitarian actors on the ground described the aid volume as pitifully inadequate compared to the scale of devastation. UN sources in Cairo revealed that while agreements promised 600 trucks daily, Israeli restrictions have kept that number at just over 100. “The vast majority of cargo entering is food, while essential goods like tents and medical equipment are still denied or face significant delays,” the UN sources said. Residents stranded For the Palestinians inside Gaza, the continued closure of the territory’s main gateway is a death sentence, particularly for the sick and wounded. At least 16,500 patients in the war-ravaged enclave urgently require medical care outside the strip, according to the United Nations. Since the Israeli military seized control of the border zone and shut down movement, the vast majority of these patients have been left stranded without access to specialised treatment. The situation has drawn pleas from medical officials who witness preventable deaths daily. Hani Isleem, an official with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), warned that the current trickle of medical evacuations is negligible. “The need is really huge,” Isleem said. He noted that the numbers accepted by foreign countries so far remain “just a drop in the ocean.” The World Health Organisation estimates that more than 8,000 patients have been evacuated since Oct 2023, but thousands more remain trapped. Isleem said the official count of 16,500 seeking treatment is likely a severe underestimate, placing the true figure three to four times higher. More than 900 people have died while waiting for evacuations since the war began, a statistic Isleem called a conservative estimate. Another truce violation Beyond the humanitarian catastrophe, the ceasefire remains fragile as bloodshed continues. On Wednesday, health officials at Al-Ahli Hospital reported that two Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire in the Zeitoun suburb of Gaza City. Diplomatic efforts are currently stalled over Israel’s refusal to fully reopen the border until the bodies of deceased prisoners are returned. Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad have already released 20 living prisoners and 26 bodies in exchange for roughly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Meanwhile, Islamic Jihad said it handed over a body to the Red Cross, found during a search in northern Gaza. The refusal to open the border for incoming aid constitutes a violation of the framework envisioned to end the conflict. Published in Dawn, December 4th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab visited the grieving family of a three-year-old boy who fell into an open manhole and drowned in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Wednesday night, assuring them of an impartial inquiry and action against those found negligent. The body of the boy, who drowned in an open manhole near Nipa in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night, was found on Monday, around 15 hours after the incident occurred. The child’s tragic death, particularly the lack of cooperation from relevant civic agencies to launch an immediate search, had angered relatives and area residents, who staged a protest on University Road on Sunday night and again during the day on Monday. On Tuesday, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials. A post by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation on X on Wednesday night said the mayor visited the boy’s family and extended his condolences. “An impartial inquiry will be conducted, and anyone found negligent will face action. We will take structured measures to prevent such incidents in the future,” the post quoted the mayor as saying. Addressing a press conference after meeting the family, the mayor termed the incident a “painful, shameful loss” and said he had no words to describe it adequately. “I say I seek forgiveness, it was my fault … I believe as mayor I was not successful, for which I am expressing my remorse.” He said the response by the government, administration and authorities should be “prompt and appropriate” to prevent anyone else falling victim to the same circumstances in the future. Wahab added he did not want to get bogged down in a “blame game” and said he accepted responsibility, since bickering over the matter would not solve the issue. The mayor further stated that he was relaying the sentiment from the top level of the provincial government and the PPP leadership that the reasons and issues that led to the death of the toddler would no longer be tolerated, and that action was now being taken. KMC report attributes death to ‘carelessness’ of BRT, department store officials A report by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) on the incident attributed the incident to the “carelessness” of officials from the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service and a department store adjacent to where the incident took place, it emerged earlier today. The report by the KMC, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said that the department had received instructions from the Karachi mayor and the municipal commissioner to initiate an operation for recovering the body of the child from the drain located in front of Chase Departmental Store in Nipa. It said that following the retrieval of the child’s body, “the site was meticulously inspected to ascertain the exact cause of the drowning”. According to the report, the inspection found the ongoing BRT construction work at the location to be a “significant contributing factor”. “Based on reports from the concerned inspector and area residents, the BRT construction has resulted in the severe damage and disruption of the entire drainage system, which runs from Nipa towards Aziz Bhatti Park,” it said. “It was observed that, at most locations, the drains were covered with temporary two-by-two-foot square covers. Unfortunately, one of these covers was reportedly left open in front of the Chase Departmental Store,” it said. “It is pertinent to mention that the procedure of covering cleaning pits with two-by-two-foot square covers from Nipa to Aziz Bhatti Park road is a non-standard practice never implemented by KMC at any location,” it said. It further stressed that BRT service officials had failed to formally notify or obtain clearance from KMC before carrying out excavation work. “These pits were excavated by BRT officials and subsequently paved over during road construction,” the report said. In light of those facts, the report concluded that the incident occurred due to the “carelessness of both the concerned BRT officials and the management of Chase Departmental Store” as “neither took adequate measures to secure the open drain”. It should be mentioned that the construction of the BRT’s Red Line project has turned the city’s major arteries, including one of the busiest thoroughfares, University Road, into construction zones. The report added that under the monitoring of the deputy commissioner for District East, the assistant commissioner of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, and BRT engineers, the excavated pits had been refilled to maintain the flow of traffic.",

      "title_orig": "Frustration in Indonesia as flood survivors await aid, toll crosses 700",
      "summary_orig": "Officials in Indonesia and Sri Lanka battled on Wednesday to reach survivors of deadly flooding in remote, cut-off regions as the toll in the disaster that hit four countries topped 1,500. In Indonesia, survivors expressed growing frustration about the slow pace of rescue efforts and aid delivery, as humanitarian groups warned the scale of the challenge was almost unprecedented, even in a country that has faced no shortage of natural disasters. Monsoon rains paired with two tropical storm systems dumped record deluges across Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia’s Sumatra, southern Thailand and northern Malaysia last week. In Indonesia, 770 were confirmed dead, the country’s disaster management agency said on Wednesday, revising the toll down from 812 it announced earlier in the day. Another 463 people are also missing. Information is only trickling in as many regions remain physically cut off by flood damage, isolated by electricity and communications failures, or both. “It’s very challenging logistically to respond,” said Ade Soekadis, executive director of aid group Mercy Corps Indonesia. “The extent of the damage and the size of the affected area is really huge.” The group is hoping to send hygiene equipment and water, both from Jakarta and locally. He said reports of food and water shortages were already “very concerning” and the situation will be “more problematic as time goes by”. ‘Like an earthquake’ At an evacuation centre in Pandan, 52-year-old Reinaro Waruwu told AFP he was “disappointed” in the government’s immediate response and the slow arrival of aid. “Some waited a day and night before receiving help, so they couldn’t be saved,” he said, surrounded by evacuees sitting on mats on the floor in the hall-turned-shelter. “I am frustrated, it doesn’t need to be said twice,” he added. He described the floodwaters and landslides as unprecedented. “It came like an earthquake … I thought ‘Well, if I am going to die, then so be it,’” he said, beginning to sob heavily. Traumatised, he could not even eat on arrival, and food has only been patchily available, though vegetables arriving on Tuesday offered a “semblance of hope”, he said. Nearby, Hamida Telaumbaunua, 37, described watching her entire kitchen swept away by floodwaters. “My heart … this was the first time I experienced such a flood,” she said. Her home was lost entirely, along with everything but the few possessions she took when she left. “It’s hard to think about what lies ahead. Maybe as long as we’re still here, it’s okay, but later … I don’t know what will happen.” In North Aceh, 30-year-old M. Atar said some areas were only just becoming accessible as roads were cleared. “We are in dire need of clean water. Very much in need,” he said. The weather system that hit Indonesia also brought heavy rains to Thailand, killing at least 267 people, authorities said today, and Malaysia, where two people were killed. Sri Lanka ‘open’ for tourists Though floods are common in Asia during the monsoon season, climate change is making heavy rain events more frequent because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. Warmer oceans can also turbocharge storm systems. A separate weather system, Cyclone Ditwah, brought torrential rain and deadly floods and landslides to much of Sri Lanka last week. At least 474 people were killed, and authorities have estimated the disaster’s cost at up to $7 billion. Another 356 people are unaccounted for, including in some of the hardest-hit regions that remain largely inaccessible. Officials said laws that allow a person to be declared dead only after being missing for six months could be shortened to expedite the issuance of death certificates. The government has said it will offer 25,000 rupees ($83) to families to help clean their homes. Those who lost homes will receive up to $8,000. On the outskirts of Colombo, RMV Lalith was beginning the clean-up at his two-storey home. “We managed to salvage some furniture by moving it upstairs, but the kitchen is a mess,” he told AFP , as a relative helped push mud out of the living room. People affected by floods collect their belongings from the railway tracks after drying them following Cyclone Ditwah Kandy, Sri Lanka, December 3. — Reuters Despite the disaster, the tourism-reliant country welcomed a luxury cruiseliner to Colombo port on Tuesday, authorities said. The arrival sends “a clear message to the world: Sri Lanka is safe, open, and ready to embrace visitors once again”, the country’s tourist board said. PM Shehbaz offers flood relief support to President Prabowo Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif conveyed Pakistan’s deep condolences and solidarity to Indonesia during a telephonic conversation with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. “The prime minister extended heartfelt sympathy on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan, calling the devastation a tragic human loss that Pakistan deeply mourns,” said a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office. Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support, PM Shehbaz assured President Prabowo that the country was ready to provide all possible relief and humanitarian assistance. He offered to share Pakistan’s extensive experience in handling large-scale natural disasters, including emergency response, rehabilitation, and reconstruction efforts. Highlighting the shared vulnerability of both countries to climate-induced calamities, the premier underscored the need for stronger bilateral cooperation in disaster preparedness, crisis management and climate resilience. President Prabowo expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s message of solidarity and informed PM Shehbaz that Indonesian authorities had acted swiftly and effectively to manage the unfolding crisis. The premier said he looked forward to welcoming President Prabowo to Pakistan during his scheduled official visit next week. He noted that the visit would provide an important opportunity for both leaders to strengthen diplomatic ties and expand cooperation across all areas of mutual interest.",

Information is only trickling in as many regions remain physically cut off by flood damage, isolated by electricity and communications failures, or both. “It’s very challenging logistically to respond,” said Ade Soekadis, executive director of aid group Mercy Corps Indonesia. “The extent of the damage and the size of the affected area is really huge.” The group is hoping to send hygiene equipment and water, both from Jakarta and locally. He said reports of food and water shortages were already “very concerning” and the situation will be “more problematic as time goes by”. ‘Like an earthquake’ At an evacuation centre in Pandan, 52-year-old Reinaro Waruwu told AFP he was “disappointed” in the government’s immediate response and the slow arrival of aid. “Some waited a day and night before receiving help, so they couldn’t be saved,” he said, surrounded by evacuees sitting on mats on the floor in the hall-turned-shelter. “I am frustrated, it doesn’t need to be said twice,” he added. He described the floodwaters and landslides as unprecedented. “It came like an earthquake … I thought ‘Well, if I am going to die, then so be it,’” he said, beginning to sob heavily. Traumatised, he could not even eat on arrival, and food has only been patchily available, though vegetables arriving on Tuesday offered a “semblance of hope”, he said. Nearby, Hamida Telaumbaunua, 37, described watching her entire kitchen swept away by floodwaters. “My heart … this was the first time I experienced such a flood,” she said. Her home was lost entirely, along with everything but the few possessions she took when she left. “It’s hard to think about what lies ahead. Maybe as long as we’re still here, it’s okay, but later … I don’t know what will happen.” In North Aceh, 30-year-old M. Atar said some areas were only just becoming accessible as roads were cleared. “We are in dire need of clean water. Very much in need,” he said. The weather system that hit Indonesia also brought heavy rains to Thailand, killing at least 267 people, authorities said today, and Malaysia, where two people were killed. Sri Lanka ‘open’ for tourists Though floods are common in Asia during the monsoon season, climate change is making heavy rain events more frequent because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. Warmer oceans can also turbocharge storm systems. A separate weather system, Cyclone Ditwah, brought torrential rain and deadly floods and landslides to much of Sri Lanka last week. At least 474 people were killed, and authorities have estimated the disaster’s cost at up to $7 billion. Another 356 people are unaccounted for, including in some of the hardest-hit regions that remain largely inaccessible. Officials said laws that allow a person to be declared dead only after being missing for six months could be shortened to expedite the issuance of death certificates. The government has said it will offer 25,000 rupees ($83) to families to help clean their homes. Those who lost homes will receive up to $8,000. On the outskirts of Colombo, RMV Lalith was beginning the clean-up at his two-storey home. “We managed to salvage some furniture by moving it upstairs, but the kitchen is a mess,” he told AFP , as a relative helped push mud out of the living room. People affected by floods collect their belongings from the railway tracks after drying them following Cyclone Ditwah Kandy, Sri Lanka, December 3. — Reuters Despite the disaster, the tourism-reliant country welcomed a luxury cruiseliner to Colombo port on Tuesday, authorities said. The arrival sends “a clear message to the world: Sri Lanka is safe, open, and ready to embrace visitors once again”, the country’s tourist board said. PM Shehbaz offers flood relief support to President Prabowo Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif conveyed Pakistan’s deep condolences and solidarity to Indonesia during a telephonic conversation with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. “The prime minister extended heartfelt sympathy on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan, calling the devastation a tragic human loss that Pakistan deeply mourns,” said a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office. Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support, PM Shehbaz assured President Prabowo that the country was ready to provide all possible relief and humanitarian assistance. He offered to share Pakistan’s extensive experience in handling large-scale natural disasters, including emergency response, rehabilitation, and reconstruction efforts. Highlighting the shared vulnerability of both countries to climate-induced calamities, the premier underscored the need for stronger bilateral cooperation in disaster preparedness, crisis management and climate resilience. President Prabowo expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s message of solidarity and informed PM Shehbaz that Indonesian authorities had acted swiftly and effectively to manage the unfolding crisis. The premier said he looked forward to welcoming President Prabowo to Pakistan during his scheduled official visit next week. He noted that the visit would provide an important opportunity for both leaders to strengthen diplomatic ties and expand cooperation across all areas of mutual interest.",

      "summary_orig": "Chief of the Army (COAS) Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir expressed satisfaction on Wednesday with the “robust defence collaboration” underway between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies , with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad. In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. A statement posted on X by state broadcaster PTV News said COAS Munir met Royal Saudi Land Forces (RSLF) Commander Lieutenant General Fahad Bin Saud Al-Johani at the General Headquarters. “COAS expressed satisfaction on robust defence collaboration between the two countries and emphasised upon the need for continued cooperation in training, capacity building, and intelligence sharing. Commander RSLF acknowledged the professionalism of Pakistan Army and appreciated the positive role played by Pakistan in regional peace and stability,” the press release said. It added that matters of mutual interest, regional security and avenues for enhanced bilateral defence cooperation were also discussed with both sides reiterating their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations. The army chief also separately met Bahrain National Guard Commander General Shaikh Mohammad Bin Isa Bin Salman Al Khalifa, with both sides reaffirming their resolve to enhance existing military-to-military ties. They also discussed matters of mutual interest, regional security, and bilateral defence cooperation. “The visiting dignitary appreciated the professionalism of Pakistan Army and acknowledged its role in regional peace and stability. COAS highlighted long-standing brotherly relations between the two nations and expressed Pakistan’s continued support for Bahrain in all domains.”",

Ukraine | The coming days may be “pivotal” for talks to end the war in Ukraine , the EU’s top diplomat said, as Volodymyr Zelenskyy met Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday and the US envoy Steve Witkoff flew out to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday.

The UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, has urged Washington to investigate, saying there was “strong evidence” of “extrajudicial” killings.
