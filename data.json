      "title_orig": "Afghan Taliban regime completely responsible for breakdown of Istanbul talks: Info Minister Tarar",
      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Wednesday that the Afghan Taliban regime was to blame for the breakdown of talks between Islamabad and Kabul as the two countries engaged in a lengthy round of dialogue to try and achieve a permanent ceasefire and cessation of terrorist attacks originating from Afghan soil. Pakistan witnessed a rapid deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with both sides engaging in recent border skirmishes , counter-statements and allegations . The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Afghan Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire , as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But earlier today, Tarar announced that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. Elaborating more on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, the information minister said: “The Afghan Taliban regime is completely responsible for the breakdown of the talks. “When irrefutable evidence was given to them and their soil is being used against Pakistan’s sovereignty and for terrorist activities, and their people are involved with the TTP, then why are they resorting to evasion?” The information minister added that Pakistan was thankful to Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating the talks, but said the Afghan Taliban had failed to agree on a unified agenda to stop terror attacks and take action against the groups responsible. “How much more can we tolerate it?” When asked about whether a ceasefire still existed after the failure of the talks, Tarar said: “Hope always remains for diplomatic efforts and it should always be there. Hope always remains in global issues that some diplomatic sources and matters will go towards peace, but rest assured: if their soil is used and we give them evidence of that, then Pakistan always has the right to respond for its self-defence.” Questioned about the Taliban negotiators giving a verbal agreement but not a written undertaking to take action against the TTP, Tarar said that hesitating from signing the written agreement amounted to “hypocrisy” and asked if it was not evidence that “they want to support terrorists and are doing so”. He questioned what more proof did the world need that the Afghan Taliban were not willing to stop terrorist activities and had malicious intent. “Their word can’t be trusted, and their ill intent has come out openly. Why were they present in India when they conspired to attack Pakistan’s border?” He said only “time will tell” how matters progressed from here on and border trade would remain shut for the time being due to the deadlock. “A final decision will be made in the next few days on what will be the future of all this.” Conventional and proxy warfare advantage Reiterating Pakistan’s military and diplomatic performance in the conflict against India , the information minister said about Afghanistan: “What do they think? Can they damage Pakistan through such activities? Absolutely not!” He said there was no match between Pakistan and Afghanistan in terms of conventional warfare, adding that “we will defeat them in proxy war[fare] too”. When asked about the alleged threats made by the Taliban regime of striking Islamabad amid the current escalation, Tarar derided what he said was “propaganda warfare” and said Pakistan was not only effectively responding to it but would give a befitting response to it. He maintained that said that the “unholy alliance” of Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan would be snuffed out, while referring to the Afghan foreign minister’s remarks in India about occupied Kashmir during his visit to the country. “Rest assured, if they attack through the border, or their soil is used, and we will present evidence of it before the world, it will be befittingly responded to. There will always be a response to attacking Pakistan or harming it; enough is enough. How long will they take Pakistan for granted?” He added that, as per the UN Charter and international law, Pakistan had a right to respond if there was a direct or indirect attack on its territory and it could present evidence for it. The minister questioned whether any other country would exhibit such restraint and give such leeway to the Afghan Taliban in the face of such attacks. Tarar elaborated that the Pakistani state had a clear stance that Afghan soil should not be used for attacks on the former’s territory, nor should terrorists be facilitated by the latter; the movement of terrorists from the neighbouring country should also stop by respecting the integrity of international territorial borders and the interim Afghan authorities should take concrete action against terrorist elements. The minister said there was a consensus in Pakistan that the above activities should stop. “Since the Afghan Taliban regime came to power, it has completely supported the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan join their formations.” “Whenever there is an attack or terrorist activity in Pakistan, we show the whole nation and the world on television that Afghan nationals are oftentimes involved in them.” He added that Pakistan had always desired peace and had played a constructive role, adding that the Taliban had violated the Doha agreement before as well and let down all parties to the deal. “I think the Taliban regime does not have the support of the Afghan nation or the people. They want a war economy, but can’t sustain it.”",

      "summary_orig": "At least 13 people, including two police officials, were injured as two separate attacks were reported in Balochistan on Wednesday, according to local officials. A grenade attack on a police mobile was reported along the national highway in the province’s Dera Murad Jamali area, which injured 13 people, including 2 officers. According to police officials, unknown suspects attacked the vehicle while it was patrolling along the highway. Immediately after the attack, police and law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area and started an investigation into the incident, while security in the area was tightened. Civil Hospital Dera Murad Jamali Medical Superintendent Dr Naseer Ahmed Imrani confirmed that 13 people, including two policemen, were injured in the attack and transported to the facility. “A woman and two children are also among the injured, who are being provided medical assistance,” Imrani said. “The police have started investigating the incident.” Meanwhile, Nasirabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ghulam Sarwar Bhiyo told local journalists that unidentified suspects fired four rockets at Jaffar Express on the railway track near Nutal. “The attack was on the Jaffar Express, but fortunately, there was no loss of life,” he said. “FC and police personnel immediately retaliated, as a result of which the attackers fled the scene.” Police officials said that the incident took place at Altafabad, where four rockets were fired, but the train safely reached Dera Murad Jamali railway station. Security forces reached the area and established a cordon to sanitise the incident site. “The Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail have been sent to Jacobabad after clearance from Dera Murad Jamali,” SSP Bhiyo said. “After the incident, security forces have further tightened security around the railway track.”",

      "summary_orig": "At least six Pakistan Army soldiers, including a captain, were martyred, while seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the general area of Dogar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kurram district, the military’s media wing said on Wednesday. According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operation was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Fitna al Khawarij , a term designating members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of [the] operation, seven Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the statement read. However, Captain Noman Saleem (24, resident of Mianwali), Havaldar Amjad Ali (39, resident of Swabi), Naik Waqas Ahmad (36, resident of Rawalpindi), Sepoy Aijaz Ali (23, resident of Shikarpur), Sepoy Muhammad Waleed (23, resident of Jhelum) and Sepoy Muhammad Shahbaz (32, resident of Khairpur) were all martyred in the gun battle. Captain Noman was “a brave young medical officer who, besides performing the duties of medical care, also fought gallantly and embraced shahadat (martyrdom) along with his five men,” the statement added. “[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as relentless counter terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm e Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. On Sunday, security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, according to the ISPR. “Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij , including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said.",

      "summary_orig": "PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Wednesday said that the party would stand with Pakistan if hostilities with Afghanistan resume. Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent weeks, which saw border skirmishes, counter-statements and and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . Responding to a question on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, Gohar said that the PTI would stand with Pakistan in case hostilities with Afghanistan erupt once again, like they did during Islamabad’s brief war with India in May. “We will stand with Pakistan like we did during the war with India, Afghanistan will not be any different,” he said. “But I will say that Pakistan has to live with its neighbours and it’s in its best interest to live peacefully.” The PTI chairman quoted a saying in relation to the Afghan situation: “The one who has the most at stake must exhaust all avenues.” “We have a lot at stake; if Afghanistan has a dialogue going, we need to try other avenues until we reach a consensus,” he stated. “As far as the Afghanistan situation is concerned, it is a serious one, because the Taliban do not completely control the country.” “If the Afghan Taliban attacked Pakistan, obviously, the response would be like with India, but that does not mean that talking stops during war. Dialogue should happen by all means, but right now, especially, nations friendly to Pakistan should try and use their influence and talk to the Taliban.” The PTI chairman also noted that Pakistan has the right to defend itself under the UN Charter, but that “Afghanistan has the same right”. “As neighbours, we need to understand each other,” he said. For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. They, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.",

      "title_orig": "Hurricane Melissa, strongest storm ever to hit Jamaica, roars onward into Cuba",
      "summary_orig": "Hurricane Melissa unleashed devastation in Jamaica as the strongest storm on record ever to hit the Caribbean island nation, and roared later on Wednesday into eastern Cuba, smashing the city of Santiago and flooding rural land. A Category 5 storm with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour when it barrelled into Jamaica, Melissa had been downgraded to a still dangerous Category 3 when it hit Cuba with sustained winds of 120mph, the US National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said. “Life-threatening storm surge, flash flooding and landslides, and damaging hurricane winds are ongoing this morning,” the centre said. The historic storm blasted western Jamaica, demolishing homes, knocking down swathes of trees and washing out roadways. Authorities did not yet release details of fatalities but said they expected loss of life. Eyewitness reports and videos on social media from Jamaica showed vehicles destroyed by flying debris, hotel doors blown off hinges and roofs scattered across neighborhoods. Video of the airport in Montego Bay showed inundated seating areas, broken glass and collapsed ceilings. The storm was expected to weaken some as it crossed Cuba but would remain a dangerous hurricane upon reaching the Bahamas. In eastern Cuba, around 735,000 people were evacuated from homes as the storm approached, authorities said. By mid-morning, President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Cuba had already suffered extensive damage and warned residents against letting down their guard, urging them to remain sheltered. ‘Some loss of life expected,’ Jamaican leader says In southwestern Jamaica, the parish of St Elizabeth was left “underwater”, an official said, with more than 500,000 residents without power. “The reports that we have had so far would include damage to hospitals, significant damage to residential property, housing and commercial property as well, and damage to our road infrastructure,” Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said on CNN after the storm had passed. The government had not yet received news of any confirmed deaths from the storm, but given the strength of the hurricane and the extent of the damage, “we are expecting that there would be some loss of life,” Holness said. “It was so crazy. Like a freight train trying to come to a stop for eight hours,” said Journie Ealey, 34, a US tourist on vacation in Jamaica, reached by phone. “I’ve never experienced anything like this before.” Meteorologists at AccuWeather said Melissa ranked as the third most intense hurricane observed in the Caribbean, after Wilma in 2005 and Gilbert in 1988 — the last major storm to make landfall in Jamaica. Scientists say hurricanes are intensifying faster with greater frequency as a result of warming ocean waters caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Many Caribbean leaders have called on wealthy, heavy-polluting nations to provide reparations in the form of aid or debt relief to tropical island countries. Melissa’s winds subsided as the storm drifted past the mountains of Jamaica, lashing highland communities vulnerable to landslides and flooding. “Our country has been ravaged by Hurricane Melissa but we will rebuild and we will do so even better than before,” Prime Minister Holness said earlier today. US President Donald Trump said today he was prepared to assist Jamaica’s recovery. The State Department said it would send search-and-rescue teams. In the Bahamas, next in line after Cuba in Melissa’s path to the northeast, the government ordered evacuations of residents in southern portions of that archipelago. Farther to the east, the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic had faced days of torrential downpours leading to at least four deaths, authorities there said. A man inspects plastic sheets serving as roofs for makeshift homes during heavy rains brought by the outer bands of Hurricane Melissa, at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints shelter in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. October 29. — Reuters Cuba hit View after the passage of Hurricane Melissa in Santiago de Cuba city, Cuba, October 29. — AFP The storm’s centre, churning with violent wind gusts over 125mph and heavy rain, slammed early today into Guama, a rural, mountainous area 25 miles west of Santiago de Cuba, the island’s second most populous city. The storm pressed on north-northeast across eastern Cuba. Authorities had shut down power to virtually all of eastern Cuba, evacuated vulnerable areas and had asked residents to shelter in place in the provincial capital Santiago, a city of 400,000 people. A family salvages belongings from the rubble of their home after it collapsed during Hurricane Melissa’s passage through Santiago de Cuba, Cuba, October 29. — AFP Photos and videos posted earlier today on local media and eyewitness accounts in the city laid bare a chaotic scene, with downed power lines, shattered windows, trees and debris littering roadways. In more rural areas to the west, videos showed torrents of brown rainwater rushing down roads through dark towns at the base of Cuba’s Sierra Maestra mountains. As the storm passed, winds remained too strong by mid-morning for residents to venture onto the streets. Authorities reported widespread flooding of lowland areas earlier today from Santiago to Guantanamo, where upwards of 35 per cent of the population had been evacuated. A resident slides over part of the roof of his house, damaged by Hurricane Melissa, in Santiago de Cuba, Cuba October 29. — AFP The timing could hardly be worse for the communist-run Caribbean island, already suffering from food, fuel, electricity and medicine shortages that have complicated life, prompting record-breaking emigration since 2021. President Diaz-Canel said Cuba had mobilized 2,500 electric line workers who would begin recovery immediately following the storm’s passage across the island later today. The hurricane was not expected to directly affect the capital Havana.",

      "summary_orig": "Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia had successfully tested the Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo that military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions by triggering vast radioactive ocean swells. As United States President Donald Trump has toughened both his rhetoric and his stance on Russia, Putin has publicly flexed his nuclear muscles with the test of a new Burevestnik cruise missile on October 21 and nuclear launch drills on October 22. There are few confirmed details about the Poseidon, named after the ancient Greek god of the sea, but it is essentially a nuclear-capable cross between a torpedo and a drone. Putin, over tea and cakes at a hospital in Moscow with Russian soldiers wounded in the Ukraine war, said the test had taken place on Tuesday. “For the first time, we managed not only to launch it with a launch engine from a carrier submarine, but also to launch the nuclear power unit on which this device passed a certain amount of time,” Putin said. “There is nothing like this,” he said, adding there was no way to intercept the Poseidon, which analysts believe has a range of 10,000 kilometres and can travel at about 185km per hour. The Burevestnik and Poseidon tests are intended to send a clear message that Russia, in Putin’s words, will never bow to Western pressure over the war in Ukraine . For Trump, who has called Russia a “ paper tiger ” for failing to swiftly subdue Ukraine, the message is that Russia remains a global military competitor, especially on nuclear weapons, and that Moscow’s overtures on nuclear arms control should be acted on. Poseidon and the new nuclear arms race The Poseidon is a new weapon that has appeared amid what Putin has cast as a global arms race — primarily between the United States, Russia and China — to modernise and develop their nuclear arsenals. Poseidon, known in Nato as Kanyon, is 20 metres long, 1.8 metres in diameter and weighs 100 tonnes, according to Russian media. Arms control experts say the weapon breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules. They have estimated it would carry a two megaton warhead and perhaps is powered with a liquid-metal-cooled reactor. Putin said Poseidon’s power exceeded that of “even our most promising Sarmat intercontinental-range missile”, which is known as SS-X-29, or Satan II. Since first announcing the Poseidon and Burevestnik in 2018, Putin has cast them as a response to US moves to build a missile defence shield after Washington in 2001 unilaterally withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, as well as to Nato’s eastern enlargement. After Russia’s test of the Burevestnik, Trump said Putin should end the war in Ukraine instead of testing a nuclear-powered missile.",

      "summary_orig": "Posts from pro-Afghan and Indian users on social media platform X on Wednesday were sharing a video claiming it showed Russian President Vladimir Putin warning Pakistan’s army and offering support to Afghanistan amid the current tensions between the two countries. However, the video is dubbed over and has nothing to do with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Pakistan is witnessing a deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with recent border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of Oct 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied. For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But earlier today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. Today, a video of the Russian president was shared by an Afghan user on X with the following caption: “Breaking news: Putin’s warning to Pakistan’s military regime. We are ready to provide all kinds of military and civilian assistance to the people of Afghanistan when needed. We do not want anyone to disrupt the peace of Afghans.” The audio of the video was in Persian and the transcription is provided below: “They are encouraging Islamabad to pressure the oppressed people of Afghanistan. Their goal is clear, to break Afghanistan, to prevent the formation of a state in Kabul and to create a circle of siege against Russia, Iran and China. But we know this scenario very well and we will not allow history to repeat itself.“ Russia stands by the people of Afghanistan, the people who have been victims of occupation for decades, but still have not given up. I openly declare that any threat to the integrity of Afghanistan’s territory, any threat to the stability and the security of the region, including political and legal support, and if necessary, even military support, should be understood that Pakistan has serious consequences. We do not want this country to be turned into a battlefield of great powers. But if the Pakistani army or its opposition groups want to invade Afghanistan, not only from Kabul, but also from other places, they will be able to do so. We told Washington in the past, and I will repeat it again, to stop the movement of the region. They have been defeated in Ukraine, they have been trapped in the Middle East, and now they are looking for a solution in Central Russia.\nThis is our territory, not your territory. Afghanistan is a small country, but with a big heart. The Afghan people will stand up against terrorism and occupation, and today they will stand up against rape. We consider this standing as a legitimate right. Russia welcomes any economic, security and defence cooperation with Kabul. We are ready to strengthen our military and information infrastructure to defend the borders of Afghanistan.” The post gained 22,000 views. Several other pro-Afghan and pro-Indian accounts on X also shared the same video with similar claims as can be seen here here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here , collectively gaining 171,000 views. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter amid ongoing tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. A keyword search conducted to corroborate whether Putin had actually uttered any such remarks yielded no news reports from credible mainstream Russian, international, Pakistani or Afghan media outlets. Analysing the audio of the video using forensic tool DeepFake-Total, which detects potential manipulation throughout the audio spectrum, showed a Fake-O-Meter score of 82.3 per cent. The score indicates a very high probability of AI-generated or synthetically altered content. A reverse image search using keyframes from the clip led to a Reuters YouTube video uploaded on October 24, 2025, titled: “Putin says new US sanctions won’t affect Russia’s economy | REUTERS” that notably featured the same background, location and clothing as the viral clip. The video showed Putin addressing reporters during a media briefing in Moscow in which he said he would not bow to pressure from the United States or any other country after US President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest oil companies. A keyword search further led to a Reuters news report published on October 23, 2025, titled “Putin defiant after Trump sanctions Russian oil companies over Ukraine”. As per the report, Putin had criticised sanctions on its oil companies by the US and said they would not significantly affect the Russian economy while talked up Russia’s importance to the global market. He had warned that a sharp supply drop would push up prices and be uncomfortable for countries such as the US. The article made no mention of Pakistan, Afghanistan or any related warning by Putin. The same story was also reported the same day by Al Jazeera , confirming that the media address was focused solely on Russia’s economic response to US sanctions and the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral clip shows Russian President Vladimir Putin warning Pakistan while expressing support for Afghanistan amid the tensions between the two countries is false . The clip is doctored and has been dubbed over through AI-generated audio. This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.",

      "summary_orig": "Air India’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Campbell Wilson acknowledged on Wednesday that airspace closures posed a challenge to the airline’s timely performance. The airline has faced delayed jet deliveries and airspace closures due to geopolitical tensions, including bans imposed by Islamabad since April , when tensions with New Delhi intensified. “Airspace constraints are a challenge to on-time performance,” CEO Wilson said at an Aviation India event in India’s capital city, speaking publicly for the first time since the June crash of the Boeing Dreamliner in Ahmedabad. “We’re always looking at how we can keep improving,” CEO Wilson stated. “This year will be quite challenging from a business perspective … We’re also working with the investigators,” he added. On April 24, in response to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect. India and Pakistan fought their fiercest military conflict in decades in May, sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in India-occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people . New Delhi, without evidence, alleged that Islamabad backed the attack. Pakistan denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe . Since then, the two nuclear-armed neighbours have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines, with Islamabad most recently extending the ban till November 24. According to a company letter seen by Reuters , Air India expects to face around $600 million in additional costs if the ban from Pakistan’s airspace lasts for a year. Other Indian airlines, including IndiGo, also face higher fuel costs and longer journey times as they reroute international flights. Meanwhile, the Pakis­tan Airports Authority (PAA) also reported a shortfall of Rs4.1 billion in August, just over two months after closing its airspace to Indian-registered aircraft. The delay in jet deliveries and airspace restrictions have weighed on Air India’s performance as it strives to recover from the plane crash of June 12 that killed 260 people . The Tata Group-owned carrier has been facing intense scrutiny ever since the crash, from warning notices for running planes without checking emergency equipment to not changing engine parts in time and forging records, along with other lapses related to crew fatigue management. India’s air accident investigating agency published an interim report earlier this year saying the plane’s fuel engine switches had almost simultaneously flipped from run to cutoff just after takeoff.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump on Wednesday once again praised both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir while reiterating his role in ending a four-day conflict between Pakistan and India in May. Earlier this month, Trump had thanked PM Shehbaz and COAS Munir, his “favourite”, for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza. He had also called both of them “great people” while offering to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Today, while addressing a luncheon at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) — which is being hosted in Gyeongju, South Korea this year — Trump talked about both Pakistan and India, as well as the conflict between the countries earlier this year. “I’m doing a trade deal with India and I have great respect and love as you know for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said. “Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the Field Marshal — they have a Field Marshal. You know why he’s a Field Marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy too. “And so I know them all. And I’m reading that seven planes were shot down — they’re going at it and they’re really starting to go, and it’s a big thing. These are two nuclear nations and they’re really going at it,” Trump said. The US president went on to say that he called Modi and said: “We can’t make a trade deal with you. ‘No, no, we must make a trade deal’. I said, “No we can’t. You’re starting a war with Pakistan, we’re not gonna do it.” He added that he then had a similar conversation with Pakistan’s leadership.\n“I said, ‘We’re not gonna do trade with you because you’re fighting with India’. “And they said, ‘No no no … you should let us fight’. They both said that. You know, they’re warring. They’re strong people.” Trump then called Modi the “nicest looking guy”, and proceeded to do an impression of the Indian leader while adding that “he’s a killer” and “tough as hell”. “But after a while — and they’re good people — and after literally two days, they called up and they said, ‘We understand’. And they stopped fighting. How is that? Isn’t that amazing? “You think Biden would’ve done that? I don’t think so,” he tacked on. “Most people wouldn’t have thought of it.” He said, “We’re doing deals. So you add an extra sentence and you say, ‘You have to stop shooting at each other’. Seven planes were shot down … and they stopped the war.” The president attributed the success to his aggressive approach with tariffs , saying, “I said I was going to put 250 per cent tariffs on each country, which means that you’ll never do business … within 48 hours, we had no war, no people killed,” he said. Meanwhile, the May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Wednesday received its first-ever shipment of US crude with the cargo arriving at Cnergyico’s offshore terminal, marking a new chapter in Pak-US trade relations. The cargo arrived aboard the Suezmax vessel MT Pegasus and docked at Cnergyico’s Single Point Mooring (SPM) port situated on the coast of Balochistan. In August, it was reported that Cnergyico will import 1 million barrels of oil from Vitol this month. “The arrival of Pakistan’s first-ever US crude oil cargo marks an important milestone for the country’s energy sector and for Cnergyico,” Vice Chairman of Cnergyico Pk Limited Usama Qureshi told Dawn.com . “This first shipment will be followed by another in mid-November and a third in January 2026,” he stated, adding that collectively, “these three cargoes are expected to improve Pakistan’s trade balance with the United States by around $200 million”. Qureshi said the SPM facility, the country’s only offshore crude handling terminal, can efficiently receive large vessels, reduce logistics costs, and enhance refinery operations. “These imports not only diversify Pakistan’s crude supply but also strengthen bilateral trade ties and contribute to the country’s long-term energy security,” the vice chairman added. In September, Cnergyico had ordered a second shipment of US crude after finding its debut purchase commercially viable, according to its vice chairman, paving the way for more imports. In 2023, Cnergyico had imported the country’s first private-sector shipment of Russian crude oil, taking advantage of Moscow’s discounts on its oil exports.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned the Taliban regime on Wednesday that Islamabad would strike “deep into Afghanistan” if Afghan soil was used to launch terror attacks on Pakistan. In a pre-dawn announcement , Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the latest round of talks between the two countries in Turkiye, which aimed to address cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghan soil, “failed to bring about any workable solution”. “We will conduct strikes, we definitely will,” Asif told reporters at Parliament House, when asked about the options available for Pakistan in case of cross-border attacks from Afghanistan. “If their territory is used and they violate our territory, then, if we need to go deep into Afghanistan to retaliate, we surely will,” he added. Earlier, when the second round of talks had begun between the two sides on Oct 25, Asif had warned that failure to reach an agreement would mean “open war”. Speaking about the recently collapsed talks today, Asif said, “Kabul was not sincere at any level for any arrangement. On the directives of India and by becoming its proxy, Fitna al-Hindustan wants to leverage its position over Pakistan through Afghanistan.” He added, “The entire leadership of Kabul is playing in the hands of India.” The minister noted that working groups from both Pakistan and Afghanistan were present in Istanbul. He added that despite an agreement being close, Kabul prevented it. “Again and again, whenever something was finalised and an agreement was drafted — this happened three or four times I think — they contacted Kabul and a ‘no’ came from Kabul, because of which we could not reach an agreement with them,” Asif detailed. He further said that if those in Kabul had chosen the path of confrontation, then “so be it”. Speaking further about the persistent issues during the recent dialogue, Asif said the other side acknowledged that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) must be stopped from carrying out attacks and “that they use our (Afghan) soil”. “They were agreeing with everything but were not ready to give in writing,” the defence minister said. Responding to a query, Asif stated that including TTP in the talks was not discussed. “Even if they had said so, it would have been a total refusal from us,” he asserted. The minister went on to say that even the mediators — Qatar and Turkiye — now knew of the “ futoor (infirmity)” in Kabul’s intentions. “We made this attempt with full sincerity so that Pakistan and Afghanistan can live in peace as good neighbours. “But if they have handed over their reins to Delhi, then this will be difficult,” he added. “It can only be prayed, [but] there’s no medicine,” Asif quipped, when asked about the likelihood of better sense prevailing. ‘Afghanistan does not fulfil definition of state’ The minister said the legitimate status of the Afghan Taliban as the government was not clear and did not have international recognition, except for a few countries. “That government does not have its writ in the entire Afghanistan. Afghanistan is practically shattered into pieces, where one or the other influential terrorist group … there is a congregation of international terrorism there,” Asif said. The defence minister said Afghanistan neither “fulfils the definition of a state” nor did the interim administration consider it so. “They are the ones who are involved in the killings, and they are taking financial benefits by being the rulers.” Asked whether the Afghan Taliban were taking their country towards a similar situation as the United States’ military operation in Tora Bora in December 2001, Asif said, “It is definitely a possibility.” ‘Test our resolve and capabilities at your own peril’ Asif’s latest remarks come hours after he issued a strongly worded warning to the Taliban rulers in Kabul, telling them to test Islamabad’s resolve at their\n“own peril and doom” if they wished to do so. “We have borne your treachery and mockery for too long, but no more. Any terrorist attack or any suicide bombing inside Pakistan shall give you the bitter taste of such misadventures. Be rest assured and test our resolve and capabilities, if you wish so, at your own peril and doom,” Asif posted on social media platform X. The defence minister said that Pakistan had indulged in talks to give peace a chance on the request of brotherly countries, who were persistently being beseeched by the rulers in Kabul, however, “venomous statements by certain Afghan officials clearly reflect the devious and splintered mindset of Taliban regime”. “Let me assure them that Pakistan does not require to employ even a fraction of its full arsenal to completely obliterate the Taliban regime and push them back to the caves for hiding. If they wish so, the repeat of the scenes of their rout at Tora Bora , with their tails between the legs, would surely be a spectacle to watch for the people of the region.” Asif further accused the Taliban rulers in Kabul of “blindly pushing Afghanistan into yet another conflict, just to retain its usurped rule and maintain the war economy that sustains them”. “Despite fully knowing their inherent limitations and hollowness of their war cries, they are beating the war drums to maintain their crumbling facade. If the Afghan Taliban regime is madly hell-bent upon ruining Afghanistan and its innocent people once again, then so be it,” he said. In his post, Asif also referred to the phrase “graveyard of empires” used for Afghanistan in connection with the historical instances of several nations failing to conquer the country. “As far as the narrative of ‘graveyard of empires’, Pakistan certainly doesn’t claim it to be an empire but Afghanistan is definitely a graveyard, surely for its own people. Never a graveyard of empires but certainly a playground of empires you have been throughout history,” Asif commented. He said the “war mongers amongst the Taliban regime, who have vested interests in the continuation of instability in the region, should know that they have probably misread our resolve and courage”. “If the Taliban regime wants to fight us, the world will Insha Allah (God willing) see that their threats are only performative circus!” UN expresses concern over talk failure In a separate development, the United Nations voiced concern over the collapse of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, hoping that the “fighting will not renew”. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric was asked about the collapse of the negotiations and whether it was a concern for the UN. “Yes, it is, of course. We very much hope that even if the talks are on pause, the fighting will not renew,” he told reporters at the regular noon briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, APP reported. From border skirmishes to talk failure Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties in recent days, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied . For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from the Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha , which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. The information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by India-abetted“ terrorists. “The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said. The statement from the information minister came hours after Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations.

      "title_orig": "‘Pakistan, Iran partners in regional peace and stability,’ Naqvi says in meeting with President Pezeshkian",
      "summary_orig": "Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday hailed Iran and Pakistan as partners in maintaining regional peace and stability during a meeting with President Masoud Pezeshkian. Pakistan and Iran agreed in August that peace and prosperity in their border regions hinged on effectively combating terrorism. The nearly 900-kilometre border between the two countries has long faced security threats from proscribed groups, such as Jaish al-Adl and the Balochistan Liberation Army. Pakistan and Iran share close ties but persistent issues, including terrorism, smuggling, and mutual accusations of harbouring militants, have periodically strained relations. The interior minister is currently on a visit to Iran at a time of sustained tension with two of Pakistan’s neighbours, Iran and Afghanistan. A press release issued today said he met President Pezeshkian, with the two discussing bilateral and bilateral cooperation. “Iran and Pakistan are partners in regional peace and stability,” the press release quoted Naqvi as saying, adding that he conveyed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s “message of goodwill” to President Pezeshkian. The interior minister also briefed the Iranian president on matters related to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, with Pezeshkian offering to play a “fraternal role” in easing the tensions between the two countries. President Pezeshkian said Iran attached “special importance” to its relations with Pakistan and it could not forget the “immense support” from Islamabad. Expressing satisfaction over bilateral relations, the Iranian president stressed the need for enhanced cooperation between the two countries to take advantage of vast opportunities. Islamabad and Tehran’s renewed commitment to maintaining regional peace comes at a time when Pakistan is witnessing a deterioration in ties with Afghanistan, with recent border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations. The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied. For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations. After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks, which were being mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But earlier today, Tarar announced in a post on X that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. Meetings with Iranian security officials Naqvi also held separate meetings with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Ardeshir Larijani and Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni during his visit to Tehran. Naqvi and Larijani discussed ways to strengthen bilateral relations and enhance cooperation in the field of security. The meeting focused on counterterrorism, anti-narcotics efforts, and improved border management between the two, with both sides emphasising the need for closer collaboration and institutional linkages to address shared challenges. “We are keen to expand cooperation with Iran, especially in the areas of security and counter-narcotics,” Naqvi said. Secretary Larijani described the positive progress in bilateral relations as “encouraging and constructive”. In a separate meeting, the two interior ministers discussed expanding mutual cooperation on internal security matters. Naqvi congratulated his Iranian counterpart on the successful hosting of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) Ministerial Conference, terming it a “significant milestone with far-reaching implications” for member states. “We wish to benefit from each other’s experiences on internal security matters,” Naqvi said, extending an invitation to Momeni to visit Pakistan. Accepting the invitation, Momeni said he would soon travel to Islamabad and also thanked Naqvi for Pakistan’s participation in the ECO conference. Interior Secretary Khurram Agha, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Muhammad Mudassir Tipu, senior officials from Iran’s interior ministry and diplomatic representatives were also present during the meetings.",

      "title_orig": "Pakistan calls for cessation of Gaza ceasefire violations after Israeli strikes kill over 100",
      "summary_orig": "Pakistan on Wednesday called for the immediate cessation of Gaza ceasefire violations by Israel after the latter’s strike on the Palestinian enclave killed more than 100 people. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 104 people were killed after Israel carried out air strikes on the Palestinian territory yesterday, accusing Hamas of violating the truce by killing a soldier, which the group denied. The renewed Israeli bombardment prompted strong condemnation from Pakistan, one of the eight Muslim countries that worked with the United States on President Donald Trump’s peace plan . “Pakistan strongly condemns the renewed attacks by the Israeli occupying forces in Gaza, which have reportedly resulted in civilian casualties,” the Foreign Office said in a statement. “These actions constitute a clear and flagrant violation of international law, as well as a breach of the recently concluded peace agreement,” the FO said, warning that such “aggressive measures by the Israeli occupation forces threaten to undermine the international efforts aimed at establishing durable peace and stability in the region”. “Pakistan calls upon the international community to ensure an immediate cessation of ceasefire violations by the Israeli occupation forces,” it added. The statement reiterated Pakistan’s principled position for the establishment of an independent State of Palestine based on the pre-June 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. “At least 101 fatalities were brought to hospitals, including 35 children and a number of women and elderly, as a result of Israeli air strikes in less than 12 hours,” said Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency. “The Israeli strikes targeted tents for displaced people, homes and the vicinity of a hospital in the Strip,” Bassal told AFP . The agency’s toll was confirmed by an AFP tally of reports from medical officials at five Gaza hospitals that received the dead and wounded. The territory’s main Al-Shifa hospital said one of the strikes hit its backyard. Al-Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp. “We had just started to breathe again, trying to rebuild our lives, when the bombardment came back,” said Khadija al-Husni, who lives in a tent at a school in the Al-Shati refugee camp. “It’s a crime. Either there is a truce or a war — it can’t be both. The children couldn’t sleep; they thought the war was over.” Gaza civil defence agency’s Bassal called the strikes “a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”. However, Trump insisted that “nothing“ would jeopardise the truce he helped broker. During a trip to Asia, the US president defended the actions of its longtime ally Israel, saying, “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back.” The Israeli military said today it had reinstated the Gaza ceasefire, claiming that “dozens of terror targets and terrorists were struck”. It said its military forces and the Israel Security Agency, also known as Shin Bet, “struck 30 terrorists holding command positions” within fighter groups operating in Gaza. Israel warns Hamas leadership will have no immunity Separately, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz warned Hamas leaders today that they would have no immunity after a wave of Israeli air strikes on Gaza, which Tel Aviv said was carried out in response to an attack on its troops. “There will be no immunity for anyone in the leadership of the terrorist organisation Hamas — neither for those in suits nor for those hiding in tunnels,” Katz said, referring to several Hamas political leaders residing in Doha. “Whoever raises a hand against an [Israeli] soldier, his hand will be severed. The [Israeli military] has been instructed to act decisively against every Hamas target and will continue to do so.” Qatar has played a key mediating role in indirect talks between Israel and Hamas since the outbreak of the war in October 2023, and is among the guarantors of the fragile peace deal, along with the US, Egypt, and Turkiye. On September 9, Israel targeted Hamas negotiators in Doha, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack triggered widespread condemnation and drew a rebuke from Trump as well. Weeks later, Israel and Hamas accepted a 20-point peace plan presented by Trump that called for the release of Gaza hostages and Palestinian prisoners, as well as a ceasefire after two years of deadly conflict. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will head to Turkiye next week to attend a meeting of the foreign ministers of the eight countries that worked on the Gaza peace plan to discuss the next steps. Officials have said Pakistan is expected to announce soon whether it will contribute troops to the International Stabilisation Force being assembled for Gaza. The reported chances of Islamabad doing so have raised questions among Pakistani politicians and journalists.",

      "summary_orig": "A constitutional bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Peshawar High Court (PHC) to decide PTI leader Shibli Faraz’s appeal against his disqualification as a senator. Faraz, along with former National Assembly opposition leader Omar Ayub, first approached the PHC. However, it had decided to adjourn sine die (for indefinite period) the pleas, directing the petitioners to first surrender before the competent court. Later, the PTI leaders challenged the high court’s decision before the SC. Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, a five-member CB resumed proceedings on Shibli’s appeal, after Ayub had withdrawn his during the last hearing on Monday. The bench also included Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Shakeel Ahmad. Faraz’s appeal challenges the PHC’s decision to indefinitely adjourn its hearings on his petition against the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) notification de-seating him as the Senate opposition leader. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared as the counsel for Faraz, while Additional Attorney General for Pakistan (AAG) Aamir Rehman represented the state. “We were removed by the election commission with great disgrace,” Gohar contended as the hearing began. He requested that a stay order be issued on the ECP notification removing his client as a member of the upper house of Parliament, thereby halting the by-election on the vacant seat. Responding to Justice Rizvi’s question, Gohar replied that a by-election on just one Senate seat was to be held tomorrow. Justice Rizvi also wondered why Faraz was seeking a stay order on the by-election when the PTI had also nominated candidates. Subsequently, the bench dismissed Gohar’s request, stating that it would not interfere in the by-election process. A by-election to fill the general seat of the Senate from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been scheduled for tomorrow (Thursday). PTI-backed Khurram Zeeshan and Irfan Saleem are contesting against PPP’s Nisar Khan and independent candidates Taj Mohammad Afridi and Abid Khan Yousafzai. During the hearing, the ECP lawyer contended that convicts needed to surrender before a court prior to seeking any relief. Justice Mazhar asked whether the PHC had decided on the maintainability of Faraz’s petition, to which Gohar replied that the court had not disposed of the case. “We cannot do anything in this case at this point,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. AAG Rehman also stated that the PHC should have decided the case. Here, the ECP lawyer said the PHC had observed that the petitioners were seeking to evade the law. At this, Justice Mandokhail asked, “Do the petitioners come to the PHC? If they do, then why are they not arrested there?” The AAG responded that the petitioners “should have also come to the Supreme Court but they did not”. Justice Mandokhail noted that the case before the bench only pertained to rights, to which AAG Rehman replied, “Rights are directly related to punishment. The petitioner was convicted by an anti-terrorism court.” Justice Rizvi remarked, “The Peshawar High Court wrote 31 pages instead of a short order. It should have simply written a paragraph.” After hearing the arguments of all the parties, the bench struck down the PHC order to adjourn its hearings for an indefinite period and ordered the high court to hear the respondents and decide Faraz’s petition. Subsequently, the bench disposed of the PTI leader’s appeal. PHC denies relief On July 31, Faraz, along with Ayub and other lawmakers, was sentenced to 10 years in jail by a Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) for his involvement in the riots. Subsequently, he was disqualified as the Senate opposition leader under Article 63(1h) (disqualification from parliament due to conviction) of the Constitution. On Aug 25, a Faisalabad ATC again sentenced Faraz and Ayub, among others, to 10 years in prison in a case involving an attack on PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah’s residence during the May 9 protests. The PTI leaders had challenged their disqualifications before the PHC, which initially allowed them interim relief by restraining the ECP from taking any action against them. However, the PHC earlier this month denied the duo, as well as then-MNA Abdul Latif Chitrali, any relief. It ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court and adjourned the petitions for an indefinite period, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats. The court recalled multiple stay orders issued earlier, wherein the ECP , the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker were directed not to proceed further on their impugned notifications. Ayub withdrew his appeal before the SC against his denotification as the NA opposition leader, on the grounds that Mehmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated for the role. Polling on the Haripur (NA-18) seat left vacant due to Ayub’s disqualification will be held on November 23, the ECP has said. According to Gohar, Ayub’s wife would contest the by-election for the seat vacated by her husband.",

Justice Mazhar asked whether the PHC had decided on the maintainability of Faraz’s petition, to which Gohar replied that the court had not disposed of the case. “We cannot do anything in this case at this point,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. AAG Rehman also stated that the PHC should have decided the case. Here, the ECP lawyer said the PHC had observed that the petitioners were seeking to evade the law. At this, Justice Mandokhail asked, “Do the petitioners come to the PHC? If they do, then why are they not arrested there?” The AAG responded that the petitioners “should have also come to the Supreme Court but they did not”. Justice Mandokhail noted that the case before the bench only pertained to rights, to which AAG Rehman replied, “Rights are directly related to punishment. The petitioner was convicted by an anti-terrorism court.” Justice Rizvi remarked, “The Peshawar High Court wrote 31 pages instead of a short order. It should have simply written a paragraph.” After hearing the arguments of all the parties, the bench struck down the PHC order to adjourn its hearings for an indefinite period and ordered the high court to hear the respondents and decide Faraz’s petition. Subsequently, the bench disposed of the PTI leader’s appeal. PHC denies relief On July 31, Faraz, along with Ayub and other lawmakers, was sentenced to 10 years in jail by a Faisalabad anti-terrorism court (ATC) for his involvement in the riots. Subsequently, he was disqualified as the Senate opposition leader under Article 63(1h) (disqualification from parliament due to conviction) of the Constitution. On Aug 25, a Faisalabad ATC again sentenced Faraz and Ayub, among others, to 10 years in prison in a case involving an attack on PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah’s residence during the May 9 protests. The PTI leaders had challenged their disqualifications before the PHC, which initially allowed them interim relief by restraining the ECP from taking any action against them. However, the PHC earlier this month denied the duo, as well as then-MNA Abdul Latif Chitrali, any relief. It ordered them to first surrender before the relevant court and adjourned the petitions for an indefinite period, allowing the ECP to fill the vacant seats. The court recalled multiple stay orders issued earlier, wherein the ECP , the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker were directed not to proceed further on their impugned notifications. Ayub withdrew his appeal before the SC against his denotification as the NA opposition leader, on the grounds that Mehmood Khan Achakzai had been nominated for the role. Polling on the Haripur (NA-18) seat left vacant due to Ayub’s disqualification will be held on November 23, the ECP has said. According to Gohar, Ayub’s wife would contest the by-election for the seat vacated by her husband.",

      "summary_orig": "An Islamabad district and sessions court on Wednesday upheld a non-bailable arrest warrant issued for former Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur around a week ago over his continued absence from the hearings of a 2016 arms and liquor case. Arrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024 , September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025 , Sept 10, 2025 and October 21, 2025 . During today’s hearing, too, both Gandapur and his lawyer, Raja Zahoor-ul-Hassan, failed to appear in court. Subsequently, Judge Mubashir Hassan Chishti upheld the court’s previous order and directed the relevant authorities to arrest and present Gandapur in the court. The court adjourned the hearing till November 11. Arms and liquor case The case dates back to Oct 30, 2016, when Islamabad police said they had recovered five Kalashnikov rifles, a pistol, six magazines, a bulletproof vest, alcohol and three tear gas shells from then-KP revenue minister Gandapur’s car outside Bani Gala, where the residence of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan is located. The incident had taken place against the backdrop of authorities preventing PTI supporters from reaching Bani Gala on Imran’s call to execute a plan to ‘lockdown’ the capital later on Nov 2. Gandapur had denied the police allegations, asserting that he was travelling with two licensed Kalashnikov rifles and that the vehicle contained a valid arms licence. He further claimed that the liquor bottle in question actually contained honey. Subsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the federal capital’s Bhara Kahu police station. During a previous hearing, Gandapur, while speaking to the media outside the courtroom, had dismissed the case as “politically motivated.” “There is nothing in this case. I wasn’t even present when it was filed, and the vehicle in question wasn’t mine,” he had claimed.",

      "title_orig": "Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina warns of mass voter boycott as her party barred from election",
      "summary_orig": "Millions of supporters of Bangladesh’s Awami League will boycott next year’s national election, after the party was barred from contesting the polls, ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told Reuters on Wednesday from her exile in New Delhi. Hasina, 78, said she would not return to Bangladesh under any government formed after elections that exclude her party, and plans to remain in India, where she fled in August 2024 following a deadly student-led uprising. An interim government headed by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus has governed Bangladesh since Hasina’s ouster and has pledged to hold elections next February. “The ban on the Awami League is not only unjust, it is self-defeating,” Hasina said in emailed responses to Reuters . “The next government must have electoral legitimacy. Millions of people support the Awami League, so as things stand, they will not vote. You cannot disenfranchise millions of people if you want a political system that works.” Hopes Awami League will be allowed to contest Bangladesh has over 126 million registered voters. The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have long dominated the country’s politics, and the BNP is widely expected to win the upcoming vote. The Election Commission suspended the Awami League’s registration in May. Earlier, the Yunus-led government banned all party activities, citing national security threats and war crimes investigations into senior Awami League leaders. “We are not asking Awami League voters to support other parties,” Hasina said. “We still hope common sense will prevail and we will be allowed to contest the election ourselves.” She did not say if she or anyone else on her behalf was holding any back-channel talks with Bangladeshi authorities to let the Awami League participate in the polls. Separately, in comments to AFP , Hasina also warned that holding elections without her party was “sowing the seeds” of further division in her country. Hasina, credited with transforming Bangladesh’s economy but accused of human rights abuses and suppressing dissent, won a fourth consecutive term in 2024. That election was boycotted by the main opposition, whose top leaders were either jailed or in exile. The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court, has concluded proceedings against Hasina, who faces charges of crimes against humanity over the violent crackdown on student protests in mid-2024. According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most from gunfire by security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence. Prosecutors also allege she oversaw enforced disappearances and torture of opposition activists through clandestine detention centres run by security agencies. A verdict is expected on November 13. Hasina denied the charges, saying she was not personally involved in the use of lethal force or other alleged crimes. “These proceedings are a politically motivated charade,” she said. “They’ve been brought by kangaroo courts, with guilty verdicts a foregone conclusion. I was mostly denied prior notice or any meaningful opportunity to defend myself.” While, in written responses to AFP , Hasina also condemned her crimes against humanity trial as a “jurisprudential joke” No plans to return home yet Despite the political turmoil, Hasina said the Awami League would eventually return to play a role in Bangladesh’s future — whether in government or opposition — and that her family need not lead it. Her son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, who lives in Washington, told Reuters last year he might consider leading the party if asked. “It’s really not about me or my family,” Hasina said. “For Bangladesh to achieve the future we all want, there must be a return to constitutional rule and political stability. No single person or family defines our country’s future.“ Hasina, whose father and three brothers were killed in a 1975 military coup while she and her sister were abroad, said she lives freely in Delhi but remains cautious given her family’s violent history. A few months ago, a Reuters reporter saw Hasina taking a quiet stroll through Delhi’s historic Lodhi Garden, accompanied by two individuals who appeared to be her personal security detail. She acknowledged passersby with a nod as some recognised her. “I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” she said. Hasina’s departure triggered targeted violence against Awami League workers, though the streets have since remained largely calm. However, clashes erupted earlier this month during the signing of a charter for state reform. ‘Open fire on crowds’ Hasina was defended by a state-appointed lawyer, but said she would only recognise an “impartial” process, such as one at the ICC. “The charge that I personally directed security forces to open fire on crowds is bogus,” she told AFP , although she admitted that “some mistakes were certainly made within the chain of command”. “But on the whole, the decisions made by senior government officials were proportionate in nature, made in good faith and intended to minimise the loss of life.” The prosecution, who insist the trial was fair, have played audio tapes verified by police that suggested Hasina directly ordered her security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters. Hasina claimed the recordings had been “taken out of context”. She also pointed to a crackdown on her loyalists since her fall, including when security forces in February launched “ Operation Devil Hunt ”, arresting thousands accused of trying to “destabilise” the country. At the same time, she gave no information on the fate of the hundreds, if not thousands, of missing victims reported to have vanished into secret detention centres during her rule. Earlier this month, lawyers for the Awami League requested that the ICC investigate reported “retaliatory violence”. This includes allegations of “beatings and lynchings” which have “no realistic prospect” of being prosecuted in Bangladesh, senior British barrister Steven Powles KC said in a statement. As for the future, when asked by AFP if she plans a return to politics, Hasina replied: “My priority is the welfare and stability of Bangladesh.”",

No single person or family defines our country’s future.“ Hasina, whose father and three brothers were killed in a 1975 military coup while she and her sister were abroad, said she lives freely in Delhi but remains cautious given her family’s violent history. A few months ago, a Reuters reporter saw Hasina taking a quiet stroll through Delhi’s historic Lodhi Garden, accompanied by two individuals who appeared to be her personal security detail. She acknowledged passersby with a nod as some recognised her. “I would of course love to go home, so long as the government there was legitimate, the constitution was being upheld, and law and order genuinely prevailed,” she said. Hasina’s departure triggered targeted violence against Awami League workers, though the streets have since remained largely calm. However, clashes erupted earlier this month during the signing of a charter for state reform. ‘Open fire on crowds’ Hasina was defended by a state-appointed lawyer, but said she would only recognise an “impartial” process, such as one at the ICC. “The charge that I personally directed security forces to open fire on crowds is bogus,” she told AFP , although she admitted that “some mistakes were certainly made within the chain of command”. “But on the whole, the decisions made by senior government officials were proportionate in nature, made in good faith and intended to minimise the loss of life.” The prosecution, who insist the trial was fair, have played audio tapes verified by police that suggested Hasina directly ordered her security forces to “use lethal weapons” against protesters. Hasina claimed the recordings had been “taken out of context”. She also pointed to a crackdown on her loyalists since her fall, including when security forces in February launched “ Operation Devil Hunt ”, arresting thousands accused of trying to “destabilise” the country. At the same time, she gave no information on the fate of the hundreds, if not thousands, of missing victims reported to have vanished into secret detention centres during her rule. Earlier this month, lawyers for the Awami League requested that the ICC investigate reported “retaliatory violence”. This includes allegations of “beatings and lynchings” which have “no realistic prospect” of being prosecuted in Bangladesh, senior British barrister Steven Powles KC said in a statement. As for the future, when asked by AFP if she plans a return to politics, Hasina replied: “My priority is the welfare and stability of Bangladesh.”",

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump said on Wednesday “nothing” would jeopardise the ceasefire in Gaza, after Israel carried out air strikes on the Palestinian territory accusing Hamas of violating the truce, which the group denied. Gaza’s civil defence agency said that Israeli attacks had killed at least 50 people, including 22 children, and wounded around 200. “At least 50 killed, including 22 children and a number of women and children, as a result of the ongoing Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip since last night,” Mahmud Bassal, spokesman for the agency, told AFP . Around 200 people were wounded “in a clear and flagrant violation of the ceasefire agreement”, he said, calling the situation in Gaza “catastrophic and terrifying”. Trump defended Israel’s actions on Wednesday, saying it “should hit back” if Israeli soldiers were killed, but added that “nothing’s going to jeopardise” to truce. “They killed an Israeli soldier. So the Israelis hit back. And they should hit back,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his tour of Asia. US Vice President JD Vance said the ceasefire was holding despite the “skirmishes”. “We know that Hamas or somebody else within Gaza attacked an IDF soldier …\nbut I think the president’s peace is going to hold,” he said. A Palestinian man inspects the site of an overnight Israeli strike on a house in Gaza City on Oct 29, 2025. — Reuters Yesterday, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered “ powerful strikes ” on Gaza, after his Defence Minister Israel Katz accused Hamas of attacking Israeli troops in the enclave. While Katz did not say where the troops were attacked, Hamas said its fighters had “no connection to the shooting incident in Rafah” and reaffirmed its commitment to the US-brokered ceasefire . The Israeli military said today that a soldier was killed during fighting in southern Gaza. Escalations Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least three strikes were carried out, while the territory’s main Al Shifa hospital said one hit its backyard. Al Awda Hospital said it had received several bodies, including those of four children, killed in the bombing of Gaza’s central Nuseirat refugee camp. Hamas announced it would delay handing over the body of another hostage, due on Tuesday, saying Israeli “escalation will hinder the search, excavation, and recovery of the bodies”. A row over the last remaining bodies of deceased hostages has threatened to derail the ceasefire agreement. Israel accuses Hamas of reneging by not returning them, but the Palestinian group says it will take time to locate the remains buried in Gaza’s war-ravaged ruins. Hamas later said on Telegram it had found the bodies of two hostages on Tuesday, but did not specify when it would hand them over. ‘Act decisively’ Hamas came under mounting pressure on Monday after it returned the partial remains of a previously recovered captive, which Israel said was a breach of the truce. Hamas had said the remains were the 16th of 28 hostage bodies it had agreed to return under the ceasefire deal, which came into effect on October 10. But Israeli forensic examination determined Hamas had in fact handed over partial remains of a hostage whose body had already been brought back to Israel around two years ago, according to Netanyahu’s office. Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian accused Hamas of staging the discovery of the remains. “Hamas dug a hole in the ground yesterday, placed the partial remains …\ninside of it, covered it back up with dirt, and handed it over to the Red Cross,” she told journalists. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the government to “act decisively against these violations” and accused Hamas of knowing the location of the missing hostages. ‘We want to rest’ On the ground in Gaza, 60-year-old Abdul-Hayy al-Hajj Ahmed told AFP he was afraid the bombing would start again. “Now they accuse Hamas of stalling, and that is a pretext for renewed escalation and war,” he said. “We want to rest. I believe the war will come back. “ Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem rejected claims the group knows where the remaining bodies are, arguing that Israel’s two-year military campaign had left locations unrecognisable. “The movement (Hamas) is determined to hand over the bodies of the Israeli captives as soon as possible once they are located,” he told AFP . The Palestinian group has already returned all 20 living hostages as agreed in the ceasefire deal. Hamas members carry a dead body during a search for deceased hostages seized by Hamas during the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel, in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, on Oct 28, 2025. — Reuters Hamas’s October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures. Israel’s subsequent relentless assault on Gaza killed at least 68,531 people, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry. Despite the ceasefire, the toll has continued to climb as more bodies are found under the rubble.",

      "title_orig": "Pak-Afghan talks in Istanbul failed to bring about any workable solution, says information minister",
      "summary_orig": "Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said early on Wednesday that the latest round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul “failed to bring about any workable solution”, adding that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. After days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan, the two countries had come together for a dialogue in Doha which had resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. Last week, the second round of talks between the two sides had begun in the Turkish capital. In a post on social media platform X early on Wednesday, the information minister said that Pakistan had repeatedly engaged with the Afghan Taliban regarding “persistent cross-border terrorism” by Indian-abetted Fitna-al-Khawarij and Indian proxy Fitna-al-Hindustan . Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. “The Afghan Taliban regime have been asked time and again to fulfil their written commitments to Pakistan and to the international community in the Doha Agreement. However, Pakistan’s fervent efforts proved futile due to the Afghan Taliban regime’s unabated support to anti-Pakistan terrorists,” Tarar said. “Since the Taliban regime bears no responsibility towards the people of Afghanistan and thrives on a war economy, it desires to drag and mire the Afghan people into a needless war,” he said. The minister asserted that Pakistan had always desired, advocated, and sacrificed for the peace and prosperity of the people of Afghanistan. “In the same spirit, Pakistan has held countless rounds of talks and parleys with the Afghan Taliban regime but, unfortunately, they have always remained indifferent to Pakistan’s losses. Sadly, after sustaining such huge losses of men and material for four long years, Pakistan’s patience has run its course,” he said. He said that in an effort to “give peace a chance” and at the request of Qatar and Turkiye, Pakistan engaged with the Afghan Taliban earlier in Doha and then in Istanbul on a single-point agenda — soliciting action by the Afghan Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan soil by terrorist organisations as a “training-cum-logistics base and jump off point for terrorist activities in Pakistan”. He thanked Qatar and Turkiye for facilitating this dialogue and their efforts in convincing Kabul to “desist from the use of terror proxies as leverage against Pakistan”, but said that the neighbouring country repeatedly deviated from the core issue. “Over the last four days of dialogue, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against [militant] organisations and terrorists. “Sufficient and irrefutable evidence was provided by Pakistan which was acknowledged by Afghan Taliban and the hosts, however, regrettably, the Afghan side gave no assurance,” the minister said. “The Afghan side kept deviating from the core issue, evading the key point upon which the dialogue process was initiated. Instead of accepting any responsibility, the Afghan Taliban resorted to blame game, deflection and ruses. The dialogue thus failed to bring about any workable solution,” he said. The minister again thanked the government of Qatar, Turkiye as well as those of other friendly states for their efforts to “bring about a peaceful solution to the problem of terrorism, for the prosperity and security of the two countries and the region at large”. “The security of its people is of paramount importance to Pakistan. We will continue to take all possible measures necessary to protect our people from the menace of terrorism and assure them that the government of Pakistan will continue to employ all the resources which are required in this regard to decimate the terrorists, their sanctuaries, their abetters and supporters,” he said. The statement from the information minister came hours after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that an agreement was about to be reached with Kabul, but Afghan negotiators backpedalled after contacting Kabul during the negotiations. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath ’, the defence minister stated that negotiators had backpedalled on an agreement “four or five times” after receiving instructions from Kabul. “Whenever we got close to an agreement — either in the last four days or last week — when negotiators reported to Kabul, then there was intervention and the agreement was withdrawn,” he said. “I believe that the negotiations were sabotaged. We had an agreement, but then they called Kabul and backpedalled from the deal.” “I would compliment their delegation, but the people in Kabul pulling the strings and staging the puppet show are being controlled by Delhi,” he added. The defence minister believed that the Kabul government lacked authority, as it had been “penetrated” by India, which was using Afghanistan to stage a proxy war against Pakistan. “India is compensating for its defeat on their western border through Kabul. The junta there (in Afghanistan) has elements that have visited India and visited their temples,” Asif said. “India wants to engage in a low-intensity war with Pakistan. To achieve this, they are using Kabul.” When asked to comment on threats by Afghanistan that they would “attack Islamabad” in the event of further hostilities, Asif replied: “If Afghanistan even looks at Islamabad, we will gouge their eyes out. “They can employ the use of terrorists and they already are. Over the past four years, they have been using terrorists.” “There should be no doubt that Kabul is responsible for terrorism in Pakistan. Kabul is a tool for Delhi. If they want to, God forbid, attack Islamabad, we will give a befitting response. A response 50 times stronger,” the defence minister said. Turkiye, Qatar step in to salvage talks On Tuesday, Turkish and Qatari mediators had tried to salvage negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan’s Taliban regime after the talks briefly collapsed over what officials described as “unbridgeable differences”. A Pakistani security source told reporters that the talks had “collapsed following the Afghan Taliban’s lack of commitment and seriousness to address terrorism-related issues, as well as their refusal to provide any written guarantees”. From the Afghan side, journalists were informed that the negotiations had ended “inconclusively”, with officials in Kabul accusing the Pakistani delegation of “improper conduct” and making “demands that are unacceptable to Afghanistan”. However, within hours of those reports emerging, the rupture had reportedly been repaired. By noon negotiators were back at the table following intense diplomatic efforts by Turkish and Qatari mediators, who pressed both sides to return for what officials described as a “final attempt” to achieve at least a limited agreement. “The negotiations in Istanbul have resumed at the insistence of the host country and the other mediator,” a Pakistani official confirmed, adding that talks continued late into the evening. Diplomatic sources said the Afghan Taliban delegation’s stance had shifted multiple times over the course of four days, often due to fresh instructions from Kabul. “They came close to a deal four or five times,” one official said, “but each time, new guidance from Afghanistan scuttled the progress.” The divisions within the Taliban’s ranks, split among factions based in Kandahar, Kabul, and Khost was cited as another reason. “If the Kandahar group agrees at some point, the differences of the Kabul group come to the fore,” a source briefed on the negotiations said. Adding to the complications, the Afghan side reportedly introduced a new demand, insisting that Pakistan should prevent US drones from entering Afghan airspace from Pakistani territory. Observers noted the irony that many of those drones originated from Qatar, which itself is mediating the Istanbul dialogue. Despite the latest setback, Turkish and Qatari officials were said to have worked intensively to keep the process alive, warning both sides that the collapse of the talks could lead to renewed border tensions. Pak­istani officials reiterated their long-standing position that no agreement would be acceptable without verifia­ble guarantees that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism against Pakistan. “Our stance has been consi­stent,” a senior security source said. “Without concrete assurances on counterterrorism, there can be no deal.”",
