The hearing took place at the Seoul Central District Court behind closed doors, with Yoon, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun and Yeo In-hyung, former head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command, in attendance. Yoon and the two others have been indicted on charges of aiding the enemy in connection to the alleged drone dispatch to North Korea's capital in October 2024. Special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team believes the alleged dispatch was aimed at inciting the North's retaliation, which could then be used as a pretext for Yoon's martial law declaration two months later. The team charged Yoon with \"benefiting the enemy in general,\" based on its judgment that the drone dispatch led to the leak of military secrets to the North when they allegedly crashed near Pyongyang. The court's bench said it would decide every session whether to proceed with the trial behind closed doors, citing state secrets",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump urged Cuba on Sunday to “make a deal” soon, pledging to cut off all oil and money flowing to the communist-run island after the toppling of Havana’s key ally, Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The threatening social media post drew an angry retort from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who said “no one” would tell his country what to do. Washington has imposed economy-crippling sanctions on its island neighbour for decades, but Trump has ramped up the pressure in recent days. US special forces seized Maduro and his wife this month in a lightning raid that left dozens of the ousted Venezuelan president’s security personnel dead — many of whom were Cuban. Though Maduro’s allies have become interim leaders, Trump has claimed the United States now actually controls Venezuela through a US naval blockade of its vital oil sector. “THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. “I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.” He said, “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!” “Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week’s U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years.” Trump provided almost no details about what potential deal he referred to, or what such an arrangement would achieve. Asked about it later on Sunday, Trump told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he wanted people forced out of Cuba or who “left under duress” to be taken care of. “Most importantly, right now, we’re going to take care of the people that came from Cuba, that are American citizens, or in our country,” Trump said, without clarifying how this would be achieved under a deal with Havana. ‘Ready to fall’ A week ago, Trump stated that “Cuba is ready to fall,” noting that the island’s economic crisis was worsening and it would be difficult for Havana to “hold out” without receiving heavily subsidised Venezuelan oil. Earlier on Sunday, the president reposted a message that jokingly suggested US Secretary of State Marco Rubio — a child of Cuban immigrants who concurrently holds the posts of national security advisor, acting head of the US archives, and acting international aid administrator — could also become the president of Cuba. Trump shared that post with the comment: “Sounds good to me!” Cuba’s president rebuffed Trump’s threatening language, saying the Caribbean island’s residents were “ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.” “Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do,” Diaz-Canel wrote on X. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez also weighed in to stress that Cuba is within its rights to import fuel from any willing exporter, “without interference or subordination to the unilateral coercive measures of the United States.” ‘Talk, talk, talk’ A Cold War-era US trade embargo has cinched Cuba’s economy beginning in 1962, and since 2000 Havana has increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, the firebrand leftist Hugo Chavez. On Sunday in the streets of Havana, retiree Mercedes Simon seemed to dismiss the US leader’s latest bluster. “Trump is not going to touch Cuba,” the 65-year-old told AFP . “All the presidents talk, talk, talk” about Cuba, for decades, “but they don’t act.” Marcos Sanchez, a 21-year-old working in the restaurant business, said the two countries should find common ground, “without resorting to violence.” Trump’s provocative language on Cuba comes as the emboldened American leader has hinted he has other countries in his sights after capturing Maduro. Trump, who had openly sought last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has recently threatened Colombia, Mexico, Iran and Greenland. Some Republican US lawmakers on Sunday lauded Trump for his aggressive comments on Cuba, including Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart from Florida. “The tyranny in Cuba will not survive the second term of President Trump,” Diaz-Balart posted in Spanish on X, “and Cuba will finally be free after decades of misery, tragedy, and pain.”",

      "title_orig": "Trump says Iran ‘wants to negotiate’ and meeting ‘being set up’",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Iran’s leadership had called seeking “to negotiate” after his threats of military action amid mass anti-government protests in the Islamic Republic. “The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.” However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“. With Iran’s government facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to get involved if force is used on protesters. Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests, and Reuters was unable to independently verify tallies of rights groups. The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, before turning against the authorities in Iran, which has governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Near paralysis In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis. The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse. There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown. One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy. The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States. State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel. But after three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday. Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”. The Iranian government on Sunday declared three days of national mourning for “martyrs” including members of the security forces killed. President Masoud Pezeshkian also urged Iranians to join a “national resistance march” Monday to denounce the violence. In response to Trump’s repeated threats to intervene, Iran’s parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said Iran would hit back, calling US military and shipping “legitimate targets” in comments broadcast by state TV. Trump says he will talk to Musk about restoring internet in Iran​ Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days. “He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran. Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday. Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’ The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic. “Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media. Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag. “The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said. In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah. The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations. The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.",

Near paralysis In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis. The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse. There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown. One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy. The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States. State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel. But after three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday. Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”. The Iranian government on Sunday declared three days of national mourning for “martyrs” including members of the security forces killed. President Masoud Pezeshkian also urged Iranians to join a “national resistance march” Monday to denounce the violence. In response to Trump’s repeated threats to intervene, Iran’s parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said Iran would hit back, calling US military and shipping “legitimate targets” in comments broadcast by state TV. Trump says he will talk to Musk about restoring internet in Iran​ Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days. “He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran. Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday. Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’ The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic. “Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media. Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag. “The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said. In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah. The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations. The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.",

      "summary": "US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Iran’s leadership had called seeking “to negotiate” after his threats of military action amid mass anti-government protests in the Islamic Republic. “The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.” However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“. With Iran’s government facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to get involved if force is used on protesters.

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: During ongoing operations against militants in Bannu, the Counter-Terrorism Department’s Bannu region, in coordination with local police, carried out a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO), killing two terrorists. According to police, the operation was conducted within the jurisdiction of Mirakhel Police Station on Jhandokhel Road near Shagi Machankhel. Acting on credible intelligence, CTD Bannu’s Special Weapons and Tactics teams, along with Bannu Police, cordoned off the area and launched the operation. During the action, the terrorists opened fire, prompting effective retaliatory fire by the police and CTD personnel. Following an exchange of fire, two terrorists were found dead during a search operation. They were identified as Suhail Khan alias Sangri and Ismail alias Usman. Police stated that both terrorists were involved in attacks on Sheikh Landik and Fateh Khel police check posts, in which eight police constables were injured. They were also involved in attacks on security forces’ convoys and an IED attack on the under-construction Rescue 1122 building. Weapons and ammunition recovered from the slain terrorists included two Kalashnikov rifles, one pistol, multiple rounds of ammunition, a motorcycle, two mobile phones, two national identity cards, and a card belonging to the proscribed TTP. Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, along with the Additional IG CTD, commended the Bannu Police and CTD SWAT teams for the successful operation. The IGP KP stated that intelligence-based targeted operations will continue uninterrupted across the province until terrorism is completely eliminated. In a separate incident, militants launched an attack on the Nala Kasho police checkpost, using light and heavy weapons. However, the attack was foiled after retaliatory action by police personnel. As soon as information about the attack was received, police contingents from Domel and Town Police Station, along with other security forces, immediately reached the site of the incident. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during 2025, according to the “Pakistan Security Report 2025” report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.",

      "summary_orig": "Despite complaints by some disgruntled residents, the Pakistani government has always endeavored to take cognizance of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) issues and resolve them. Sost Dry Port in GB is a crucial trade hub, primarily facilitating trade between China and Pakistan. Recently, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) issued statutory regulatory order (SRO) 2488 ostensibly to placate the protests of some residents of GB. The SRO states, “Sales tax, income tax, and federal excise duty payable on imports covered under this notification shall not be levied”. The notified SRO — which could damage the textile sector — was issued on January 1, 2026. As per the SRO, “The benefit of non-levy of sales tax, income tax, and federal excise duty shall be extended by the Collector of Customs on a ‘first come, first serve’ basis within the approved quota limit for goods imported for consumption within the GB region”. The icing on the cake is that “The GB government shall ensure that all goods imported under this notification are exclusively used within [its] territory”. How? Does GB administration have the critical mass to ‘ensure’ that the facility will not be abused? In addition, “Special procedures shall also be devised by the FBR to effectively identify, track, and clear goods which are imported via Sost for the rest of the country from the goods cleared under this notification.” But, how effective have policies like this been in the past? ‘Past experience clearly demonstrates that similar region-specific tax concession regimes have been repeatedly misused’ The SRO covers every item and gives carte blanche to GB traders to buy whatever they want from China and get it cleared at Sost Dry Port. Notwithstanding the fact that bilateral trade figures between Pakistan and China are heavily tilted in favour of China, this new open permission could further widen the trade gap. The SRO specified, “The cumulative amounts of sales tax, income tax, and federal excise duty as chargeable under the Sales Tax, 1990 (VII of 1990), Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, and Federal Excise Act, 2005 shall not exceed the limit of Rs4 billion in a fiscal year, as calculated in the Customs Computerised Clearance System.” A generous and merciful assurance for the trade and industry of Pakistan. Facilitating and encouraging residents are responsibilities of the state, but the modus operandi should always be that other provinces or areas should not be affected. The draft SRO was issued at the fag end of 2025 and, surprisingly, the FBR only allowed three days for objections or comments (25th was a national holiday, 26th was a Friday when establishments in many areas remained closed or worked half the day, and 27th was a Saturday). Trade and Industry representatives are up in arms and term this SRO as sounding the death knell for Pakistani industries. Take textile, for example. There are 236 importable textile items. Anwer Aziz, Regional Chairman, All Pakistan Textile Processing Mills Association, took exception to allowing textile products, especially those manufactured domestically and sold to local and foreign customers. As an example, he remarked that unbleached and bleached fabrics will enjoy the benefits of the SRO. Mr Aziz asked, “How many textile processing mills are based in GB?” He added that despite so-called firewalls to check the inflow of imports, there is no guarantee that these fabrics would not find a way to Faisalabad, Lahore, or Karachi, as is the norm under the Afghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement. Although facilitating GB traders is welcomed, the point is that this facility should also be provided for local manufacturers to sell to GB under exempted sales tax and other taxes. If the cap of Rs4bn is enforced, then local goods could be categorised as ‘exports’ to GB and enjoy the exemptions. There is always the apprehension that this cap could be enhanced in the future to mollify protestors. A senior industrialist noted that the Rs4bn exemptions translate into imports of Rs16–18bn, about $65m. Do GB denizens have the capacity to buy this imported quantity? Anjum Nisar, former chairman of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry, said, “Past experience clearly demonstrates that similar region-specific tax concession regimes have been repeatedly misused. Earlier exemptions granted to erstwhile federally and provincially administered tribal regions were also subject to conditions and monitoring requirements, yet duty- and tax-free goods found their way across the country, damaging local industries, and causing significant revenue losses.” The writer is the President of the Employers Federation of Pakistan.

      "summary_orig": "OVERTHROWING governments in Latin America has long been the US practice from a familiar playbook. The US has for decades intervened by military force to oust governments and assassinate leaders in the Western Hemisphere. More often than not, it has succeeded. Sometimes it has failed, as in trying to kill and remove Fidel Castro in Cuba epitomised by the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. This triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis that drove the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war. The US-backed coup in Chile in 1973 involved the assassination of its elected Marxist president Salvador Allende and installation of a brutal regime under Gen Augusto Pinochet. Another CIA-sponsored coup deposed Guatemala’s elected government in 1954. In 1989, the US invaded Panama to oust Manuel Noriega, capture and extradite him to stand trial in America. The US-led invasion of Grenada overthrew its government in 1983. Over 40 US interventions are said to have ‘succeeded’ in the past century and a half. This includes the invasion and capture in the mid-19th century of over half of Mexican territory. The US also engineered regime change and toppled governments in countries beyond Latin America — Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Against the backdrop of this predatory history, the US attack on Venezuela ordered by President Donald Trump followed a well-trodden path. But that didn’t make it any less egregious. President Nicolás Maduro was captured by American forces and taken to the US for trial. The armed intervention was illegal — a breach of international law and norms and violation of Venezuela’s sovereignty. It sent shock waves across the world and invited condemnation from many countries, while legal experts and some Democratic lawmakers called it an “act of war”. Five Latin American countries and Spain issued a joint statement which said, US actions “constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security”. It expressed concern about any “external appropriation of natural or strategic resources”. Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodríguez declared, “we will not be anyone’s colony”. In a blatant display of imperial ambition, Trump vowed to run Venezuela, “take back” its oil and have American oil companies exploit its oil resources. Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves. This laid bare a key motivation of the intervention, which was not strategic deterrence against drug traffickers but commercial aggrandisement. It was a throwback to the past, when in the so-called ‘banana wars’, US-armed interventions sought to secure its commercial interests. Above all, Trump’s action was about establishing dominance over the Western Hemisphere, signalling Washington would dictate policy there and control its resources. Trump seeks sole control of the Western Hemisphere and its resources. The US military action came after months of escalating pressure on Maduro who Trump accused of links with drug smugglers without offering evidence. He also blamed Maduro for the influx of Venezuelan migrants into the US. Maduro’s offer for talks on narco-trafficking and oil was spurned by Washington. Instead, the US carried out strikes on Venezuelan vessels alleged to be transporting drugs and imposed a naval blockade to enforce an embargo on oil exports. Maduro accused Washington of aiming to overthrow him and take control of his country’s vast oil reserves. The attack on Venezuela can be understood in the context of the Trump administration’s recently released National Security Strategy (NSS). This made enforcing the so-called ‘Trump corollary’ of the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere a top priority. The original doctrine was to prevent European recolonisation and communist influence in the region. The ‘Trump corollary’ or ‘Donroe doctrine’ is designed to assert a proprietary claim and exclude China (whose trade and investment influence has been growing in Latin America) and other “non-Hemispheric” powers. Trump doesn’t just want the Hemisphere to be in Washington’s sphere of influence but for the US to have sole and exclusive control over its natural resources. For all Trump’s earlier claims about non-intervention in the internal affairs of countries, also reiterated in the NSS, he has made regime change his policy. He issued warnings to Cuba, Columbia and Mexico about possible action and separately to Iran while repeating the threat to seize Greenland. The latter elicited a response from Denmark that such action will spell the end of Nato. America’s experience with regime change has hardly been edifying, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya. It has always ended badly for the US and brought grief and suffering to those countries and shed so much of their blood. When the US tried to ‘run Iraq’ it proved a disaster. No wonder that a majority of Americans express fears about the US getting ‘too involved’ in the South American country, according to a Reuters / Ipsos poll. Alarmingly, the survey also found two-thirds of Republicans supported the attack. In the UN Security Council emergency meeting called to discuss Venezuela, the US was roundly condemned by China and Russia as well as American allies. Washington was accused of taking the world back to an “era of lawlessness” and undermining the “foundation of world order”. Pakistan’s envoy warned that “unilateral military” actions can lead to “unpredictable and uncontrolled outcomes” for years. The Trump administration is unconcerned by international criticism. How Trump proposes to “run Venezuela” is the key question. As for his plan to “take over” oil resources, he announced that Venezuelan authorities will hand over up to 50 million barrels of sanctioned crude to the US. The money earned from its sale will be controlled by him. But for American oil companies to reap a bonanza is not simple, given Venezuela’s poor oil infrastructure and need for massive investment. Already US oil giant ExxonMobil has told Trump Venezuela is “uninvestable” without major changes. A private investor is cited in the Financial Times as saying , “No one wants to go in there when a random tweet can change the entire foreign policy of the country”. The US may have bitten off more than it can chew. Venezuela can descend into chaos and greater regional instability can ensue with the US squandering whatever goodwill it has in the Hemisphere. As the New York Times put it in its editorial , Trump’s action represents “a dangerous and illegal approach to America’s place in the world”. Once again, the tactical success of the US action in Venezuela is likely to end in strategic failure. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN. Published in Dawn, January 12th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "• Punjab forensic report calls videos genuine, profile photos matched • PTI leaders say clips unrelated to case; Azma terms evidence ‘irrefutable’ PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident. The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted. At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage. The authorities had provided the video clips and the pictures of CM Afridi, former provincial ministers Taimur Saleem Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, and two other PTI leaders, Irfan Saleem and Amir Khan Chamkani, for analysis. None of them had been nominated in the case. In the report, the PFSA gave its opinion on two points: whether the videos in the USB were genuine and whether the persons whose profile pictures had been shared appeared in the clips. It said the five individuals, including the CM, were seen in the clips, but did not clarify if the videos were related to the Radio Pakistan attack or any other event. It, however, said the clips were not edited except for the merger of multiple video clips of different camera views. A legal expert, privy to the case, said the investigating officer, after this ‘evidence’ could nominate more accused through a supplementary report to the ATC. However, the court can also take cognisance of the matter. Similarly, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) could also submit an application for the inclusion of the accused persons in light of the forensic report. ‘Unrelated clips’ Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad. PTI leader Taimur Jhagra said it was interesting that this campaign was against the CM and other individuals never nominated in this case. “The posts with screenshots are very interesting because they have nothing to do with Radio Pakistan. I believe the Punjab lab is simply commenting on whether it thinks the videos are genuine or not. My first video screenshot is of a video that is not even shot in Peshawar… The video is of my condemnation of Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, while in Islamabad,” he mentioned. The ATC has fixed Jan 26 for the next hearing in the trial. The ATC is conducting the trial, with 75 accused, including some present and former lawmakers, being indicted on June 3, 2025, on multiple counts. The FIR was registered at the East Cantonment police station on May 10, 2023. ‘Irrefutable evidence’ Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan and toll plazas by the PTI in Peshawar were part of a well-planned conspiracy, and “irrefutable evidence” has surfaced in the forensic report. Ms Bokhari said the report included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence. She stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting would be brought to justice.

      "summary_orig": "• PM-appointed panel calls for measures to improve ease of doing business • Seeks tariff overhaul to lift exports beyond $60bn in three years • Highlights cross-cutting barriers across 20 export products • Notes ‘policy unpredictability’ undermines investor, buyer confidence ISLAMABAD: A body constituted by the prime minister and led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal has called for urgent reforms to improve the ease of doing business and for a serious restructuring and rationalisation of tariffs — both energy prices and trade duties — to more than double exports to over $60 billion within three years. The committee was formed to devise a strategy for avoiding another IMF programme once the current $8.4bn arrangement expires at the end of 2027, amid mounting pressure from persistently weak economic indicators. According to synopses compiled after week-long consultations with public and private sector stakeholders from Jan 5 to 9, the panel concluded that the current state of affairs was not capable of driving a fast-growing population of 250 million towards sustained prosperity because of cross-cutting constra­ints affecting “all 20 priority export products and six export drivers”. Ironically, most of these constraints are generally well known, but the government’s inability, despite special interventions here and there, including through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), to create a conducive working environment in a fair, equitable, rule-based and transparent manner, has hampered sustainable growth path beyond stabilisation under a restrictive programme volunteered to the IMF. The plan proposed easing electricity and gas prices through debt refinancing and rationalising price build-ups. It was found that “export competitiveness is undermined by high and volatile energy costs, with electricity and gas tariffs remaining above regional benchmarks and subject to frequent changes”. It warned that volatility was inflating production costs across manufacturing, agro-processing, minerals, fisheries, and services, eroding margins and diverting orders to competing countries. The Planning Commission also pointed out that the cost of doing business in Pakistan remained “structurally high due to fragmented and distortionary taxation, inverted input tariffs, advance income tax deductions, delayed sales tax refunds and persistent working capital lockups”. It said these issues disproportionately affected exporters and were particularly binding for small and medium enterprises across manufacturing and agri-based value chains. The panel said that policy unpredictability was also weakening investment and buyer confidence. “Frequent changes in tax policy, energy pricing, tariff structures, export incentives and regulatory regimes, often announced late in the business cycle, constrain forward planning, capacity expansion and scaling, particularly around annual export order booking cycles,” it said. The synopses also highlighted institutional fragmentation and regulatory burdens. They said inconsistent definitions of SMEs across the State Bank of Pakistan, SMEDA, the Federal Board of Revenue and provincial authorities restricted access to finance, incentives and support schemes. Overlapping mandates, discretionary enforcement, excessive audits and weak inter-agency coordination increased compliance costs and uncertainty, the panel said. Moreover, exporters also faced weak domestic quality, testing and compliance infrastructure, increasing reliance on overseas laboratories for certification and testing, it said, adding: “This raises costs, lengthens lead times and elevates rejection risks in regulated export markets, constraining movement into higher value products and destinations.” Limited access to affordable finance was also highlighted as a constraint on upgrading and value addition. The panel said export credit, insurance, guarantees, and long-term financing instruments remained underdeveloped, while high interest rates, collateral requirements, and liquidity constraints curtailed SME investment in technology, compliance, and scaling. The committee also questioned the implementation of export facilitation and input schemes, including the Export Facilitation Scheme, saying procedural delays, higher input costs and working-capital pressures were limiting effective sourcing of raw materials and intermediate inputs. In addition, it cited logistics and trade facilitation bottlenecks, including high inland freight costs, underutilised rail, port congestion, slow customs clearance, inadequate cold-chain infrastructure and weak courier and postal systems for SMEs. It noted that at Port Qasim, the absence of dedicated export terminals, limited handling infrastructure, inadequate covered storage and constrained evacuation arrangements increased dwell time, handling costs and shipment uncertainty. It also pointed to skills gaps, low value addition and weak branding as barriers to moving into higher-value segments. Based on consultations, the Planning Commission is now collecting additional information through a private-sector survey to refine inputs and develop a data-driven, sector-specific technical roadmap to enhance exports under the Uraan Pakistan strategic plan. “Pakistan’s development, economic sovereignty and even national security now hinge on one thing: how fast we can grow our exports and move to an export-led growth model,” Mr Iqbal said at the conclusion of the consultations. He added that “the only way to break free from foreign crutches and avoid the next IMF programme is to rapidly increase our exports and build strong foreign exchange reserves”. The 20 products covered during these engagements included copper, gems and jewellery, software and IT services, fish and fish preparations, rice, fruits and vegetables, meat and meat preparations, guar gum and its products, handicrafts, textile and apparel, sports goods, leather and leather products, surgical instruments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cement, carpets and rugs, engineering goods, footwear, plastic material and cutlery. Pakistan currently exports about $30-35bn worth of goods, against Planning Commission estimates of an untapped annual potential of over $60bn. The findings and recommendations will be consolidated into product-wise diagnostics and a targeted facilitation framework for submission to the prime minister. Their implementation would be subject to clearance under the tight requirements of the IMF conditions. Published in Dawn, January 12th, 2026",

It noted that at Port Qasim, the absence of dedicated export terminals, limited handling infrastructure, inadequate covered storage and constrained evacuation arrangements increased dwell time, handling costs and shipment uncertainty. It also pointed to skills gaps, low value addition and weak branding as barriers to moving into higher-value segments. Based on consultations, the Planning Commission is now collecting additional information through a private-sector survey to refine inputs and develop a data-driven, sector-specific technical roadmap to enhance exports under the Uraan Pakistan strategic plan. “Pakistan’s development, economic sovereignty and even national security now hinge on one thing: how fast we can grow our exports and move to an export-led growth model,” Mr Iqbal said at the conclusion of the consultations. He added that “the only way to break free from foreign crutches and avoid the next IMF programme is to rapidly increase our exports and build strong foreign exchange reserves”. The 20 products covered during these engagements included copper, gems and jewellery, software and IT services, fish and fish preparations, rice, fruits and vegetables, meat and meat preparations, guar gum and its products, handicrafts, textile and apparel, sports goods, leather and leather products, surgical instruments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cement, carpets and rugs, engineering goods, footwear, plastic material and cutlery. Pakistan currently exports about $30-35bn worth of goods, against Planning Commission estimates of an untapped annual potential of over $60bn. The findings and recommendations will be consolidated into product-wise diagnostics and a targeted facilitation framework for submission to the prime minister.

      "summary": "• PM-appointed panel calls for measures to improve ease of doing business • Seeks tariff overhaul to lift exports beyond $60bn in three years • Highlights cross-cutting barriers across 20 export products • Notes ‘policy unpredictability’ undermines investor, buyer confidence ISLAMABAD: A body constituted by the prime minister and led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal has called for urgent reforms to improve the ease of doing business and for a serious restructuring and rationalisation of tariffs — both energy prices and trade duties — to more than double exports to over $60 billion within three years. The committee was formed to devise a strategy for avoiding another IMF programme once the current $8.4bn arrangement expires at the end of 2027, amid mounting pressure from persistently weak economic indicators. According to synopses compiled after week-long consultations with public and private sector stakeholders from Jan 5 to 9, the panel concluded that the current state of affairs was not capable of driving a fast-growing population of 250 million towards sustained prosperity because of cross-cutting constra­ints affecting “all 20 priority export products and six export drivers”. Ironically, most of these constraints are generally well known, but the government’s inability, despite special interventions here and there, including through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), to create a conducive working environment in a fair, equitable, rule-based and transparent manner, has hampered sustainable growth path beyond stabilisation under a restrictive programme volunteered to the IMF. The plan proposed easing electricity and gas prices through debt refinancing and rationalising price build-ups. It was found that “export competitiveness is undermined by high and volatile energy costs, with electricity and gas tariffs remaining above regional benchmarks and subject to frequent changes”. It warned that volatility was inflating production costs across manufacturing, agro-processing, minerals, fisheries, and services, eroding margins and diverting orders to competing countries. The Planning Commission also pointed out that the cost of doing business in Pakistan remained “structurally high due to fragmented and distortionary taxation, inverted input tariffs, advance income tax deductions, delayed sales tax refunds and persistent working capital lockups”. It said these issues disproportionately affected exporters and were particularly binding for small and medium enterprises across manufacturing and agri-based value chains. The panel said that policy unpredictability was also weakening investment and buyer confidence. “Frequent changes in tax policy, energy pricing, tariff structures, export incentives and regulatory regimes, often announced late in the business cycle, constrain forward planning, capacity expansion and scaling, particularly around annual export order booking cycles,” it said. The synopses also highlighted institutional fragmentation and regulatory burdens. They said inconsistent definitions of SMEs across the State Bank of Pakistan, SMEDA, the Federal Board of Revenue and provincial authorities restricted access to finance, incentives and support schemes. Overlapping mandates, discretionary enforcement, excessive audits and weak inter-agency coordination increased compliance costs and uncertainty, the panel said. Moreover, exporters also faced weak domestic quality, testing and compliance infrastructure, increasing reliance on overseas laboratories for certification and testing, it said, adding: “This raises costs, lengthens lead times and elevates rejection risks in regulated export markets, constraining movement into higher value products and destinations.” Limited access to affordable finance was also highlighted as a constraint on upgrading and value addition. The panel said export credit, insurance, guarantees, and long-term financing instruments remained underdeveloped, while high interest rates, collateral requirements, and liquidity constraints curtailed SME investment in technology, compliance, and scaling. The committee also questioned the implementation of export facilitation and input schemes, including the Export Facilitation Scheme, saying procedural delays, higher input costs and working-capital pressures were limiting effective sourcing of raw materials and intermediate inputs. In addition, it cited logistics and trade facilitation bottlenecks, including high inland freight costs, underutilised rail, port congestion, slow customs clearance, inadequate cold-chain infrastructure and weak courier and postal systems for SMEs. It noted that at Port Qasim, the absence of dedicated export terminals, limited handling infrastructure, inadequate covered storage and constrained evacuation arrangements increased dwell time, handling costs and shipment uncertainty.

      "title_orig": "India beat New Zealand in first ODI as Kohli misses out on ton",
      "summary_orig": "India beat New Zealand by four wickets in the first one-day international in Vadodara on Sunday, where the in-form Virat Kohli fell agonisingly short of his 54th ODI hundred. The 37-year-old batting maestro, who had scored 376 in his last four ODI innings, anchored India’s chase of 301 with a sublime knock of 93 featuring eight boundaries and a six, but he was dismissed by Kyle Jamieson when a landmark century was within reach. The Vadodara crowd’s disappointment was palpable as their hero departed, but they rose to applaud Kohli, who achieved another milestone by becoming the second-highest run scorer in international cricket across all formats. With his 77th ODI fifty, Kohli moved on to 28,068 runs and surpassed Sri Lankan great Kumar Sangakkara (28,016) to sit behind only Indian icon Sachin Tendulkar’s 34,357. “If I look back at my whole journey, it’s nothing short of a dream come true for me,” Kohli said on moving one step closer to his mentor Tendulkar. “I’ve always known my abilities, how much ability I had when I came in, and I had to work for a lot more to get to the place I am today. God has blessed me with way too much for me to complain about anything. “I always look back at my whole journey with a lot of grace, a lot of gratitude in my heart, and I feel proud about it.” NZ openers frustrate India Earlier, India won the toss and elected to field, factoring in dew conditions for the second innings, but New Zealand’s openers Devon Conway (56) and Henry Nicholls (62) frustrated the hosts with a commanding 117-run opening stand. Harshit Rana provided the breakthrough, striking twice in consecutive overs to dismiss both openers and apply the brakes on New Zealand’s scoring rate. The middle order failed to capitalise on promising starts, with only Daryl Mitchell making a significant contribution, while skipper Michael Bracewell was run out from a direct hit by Shreyas Iyer. Mitchell blazed his way to 84 with five boundaries and three sixes before being trapped leg-before to Prasidh Krishna while attempting another big shot. Kristian Clarke’s unbeaten 24 helped New Zealand add 50 runs in the final five overs to reach 300. Kohli and Gill build parnership India’s chase got off to a rocky start when opener Rohit Sharma fell for 26, but Kohli and captain Shubman Gill steadied the ship with a crucial 118-run partnership. “I’m not thinking about the milestones at all. If we were batting first today, I would have probably gone harder. Even with the chase, because there was a total on the board, I had to kind of buckle down and play the situation,” Kohli added. Gill contributed a patient 56 but fell shortly after receiving treatment on his back before Jamieson (4-41) then turned the match on its head with a devastating spell. He removed Ravindra Jadeja in the same over as Kohli before clean-bowling Iyer for 49, his off stump knocked out of the ground as India slumped to 242-5. Enter Rana, who counter-attacked brilliantly and was fortunate to survive a dropped catch at long-on when on 12. He made New Zealand pay, scoring 29 before being caught behind, keeping India in the hunt. With pressure mounting and India needing to maintain a run-a-ball rate, KL Rahul held his nerve to guide the hosts home with an unbeaten 29, sealing victory with two fours and a six in the penultimate over. The victory gives India a 1-0 lead in the series ahead of the second game in Rajkot on Wednesday.",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday briefly addressed hundreds gathered near Mazar-i-Quaid for the party’s rally, while the PTI claimed it faced hurdles in reaching the venue and its supporters were met with shelling by the police. The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue , saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid. During the day, PTI supporters gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the police employed shelling. Disturbances were also reported near Numaish Chowrangi as police dispersed crowds, while media vehicles were also vandalised. “I am deeply grateful to all Pakistanis and the people of Sindh for honouring us with enormous respect and esteem,” CM Afridi said while addressing a huge crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid late on Sunday night. “We can never forget the respect we received from the people of Sindh. But you all must not forgive the Sindh government for the disrespect they have shown towards the Sindhi cap and Ajrak,” the PTI leader added. “We will not allow anyone to steal our mandate, to snatch our rights, or to further keep our leader Imran Khan sahib in prison wrongfully,” Afridi said. The KP CM said: “Those who used to say ‘we will end PTI’ and who were thinking that Imran Khan’s politics will be eradicated, they should come here and see these youngsters here. “They should consider that these people have come for only a jalsa , then what will happen the day my leader (Imran Khan) issues a formal call for a street movement,” he added. “You must stand prepared against this oppression and fascism. Whenever my leader issues a call, we will act as per his wishes,” the PTI leader said. Afridi reiterated his claims of the Sindh government “leaving us stranded on deserted roads in the dark of the night” while returning from Hyderabad to Karachi. However, a provincial minister refuted the claims, saying that a police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”. “Shelling was also done at our sisters, children, workers here […] all routes were blocked, police baton-charged [supporters],” CM Afridi claimed in his brief address. The chief minister further alleged that “they (authorities) also damaged the media’s vehicles”. Afridi said the Sindh government “repeated” what its Punjab counterpart had done when he visited Lahore last month, calling both governments “fake”. The gathering was a part of the KP CM’s four-day visit to Sindh, who is leading his party’s street mobilisation movement. “God willing, our next stop will be Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and we will continue the same momentum in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” CM Afridi announced. The KP CM also raised slogans of “every chowk is D-Chowk”. ‘Delays due to obstructions, public welcomes’ Earlier at 7:44pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said CM Afridi’s convoy was facing delays “due to obstructions at various places, and the public’s affection, welcomes and responses at numerous places”. At around 9pm, Sheikh said the KP CM would reach the venue in five minutes, and lashed out at the Sindh police and government for their actions. At around 10:30pm, he shared footage of the caravan at Numaish Chowrangi, where Afridi also addressed the crowd. The PTI also shared visuals of the welcome accorded to the party caravan by their supporters in Baldia Town and Ittehad Town‘s Khyber Chowk. At around 6:40pm, the PTI said the Sindh police had “attempted to prevent” CM Afridi’s convoy from moving forward, but the party leaders “had the path reopened with the help of party workers”. The video showed party leaders, including Shafiullah Jan, speaking to the police before the convoy’s vehicles were allowed to move ahead. The PTI also shared videos of hundreds gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah by the evening, with supporters chanting “ Jiye Imran ” and “ Tera yaar, mera yaar, Qaidi No. 804 ”. In a video recorded while on his way to the venue, Afridi said his convoy would reach Mazar-i-Quaid after going through Baldia Town, Keamari, Banaras Chowk, Golimar and Gurumandir so PTI supporters could join the caravan. Former MNA Faheem Khan said , “Ten of our vehicles were intercepted. But no worries; I am reaching the rally venue with another vehicle equipped with a sound system.” In a statement on X, the PTI hailed the public for its “historic display of public power and expression of love for Imran Khan”. “Despite all the fascism, violence, arrests and obstructions by the Sindh government through its police, thousands of people have gathered inside and around Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah and on the surrounding streets at the moment,” it said. “This is the scene that serves as a clear message to those with fascist mindsets that public power cannot be stopped by walls and batons,” the PTI asserted. “This gathering is a renewal of the pledge that we are ready to give every sacrifice for Imran Khan, Pakistan, true freedom, supremacy of the Constitution and law, independence of the judiciary, and our basic rights.” Shelling, roadblocks at venue: PTI Shortly after 4pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared a video on X wherein a woman said police have resorted to shelling at party supporters at “Mazar-i-Quaid’s garden”. Video footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed multiple police vans at Bagh-i-Jinnah and cops employing shelling, with people gathered there retaliating by pelting stones. Pictures from Numaish Chowrangi showed cops with batons detaining multiple individuals as PTI supporters gathered to make their way to Bagh-i-Jinnah.

People push aside containers that had been placed to block a route in Karachi. — Shakil Adil/ White Star The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — an ally of the PTI under an opposition alliance — also said its leader Allama Sadiq Jafri and others had reached “Jinnah Ground”, possibly referring to Bagh-i-Jinnah. PTI spokesperson Mohammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn that police had blocked roads and were not allowing party workers to enter Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the government had previously allowed the party to hold the rally. He reiterated his allegation that police had blocked roads in various areas and were preventing PTI workers from reaching the new venue of Mazar-i-Quaid’s VIP gate as well. Bozdar said CM Afridi would pay his respects at the mausoleum and later on, he would address party workers from a truck, the arrangements for which had been completed. ‘Attack’ on mediapersons Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of an “attack“ on Aaj News ’ vehicle near Gurumandir Chowrangi. He also directed the East district senior superintendent of police (SSP) to immediately provide details on “police action”. “Miscreant elements will be dealt with firmly. We will not let anyone sabotage law and order,” Lanjar asserted. The minister said the perpetrators would be arrested by tracing them using the modern monitoring system. A vehicle of Aaj News with a badly damaged windshield. — Shakil Adil/ White Star In a statement, PTI’s Bozdar also condemned the attack on mediapersons and said action should be taken if someone had “attacked the media”. “The PTI’s workers are peaceful. No one is allowed to take the law into their hands,” he stated. “The media is the public’s voice; attacks on media will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he added. The board members of Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the “attack of a charged crowd on media; violence against journalists, cameramen and staff; and damage caused to DSNGs”. “How can this group declare themselves pro-democratic after attacking the media?” said a joint statement by KUJ President Ejaz Ahmad and others. “What message did they try to convey by targeting the media?” The KUJ demanded that the Sindh government trace the perpetrators through CCTV footage and bring them to justice. The Crime Reporters Association (CRA) also strongly condemned the vandalism incidents, adding that there was a “clash between political workers and police” during coverage at Bagh-i-Jinnah. “Media representatives busy in fulfilling their duties got caught in the middle of this chaos and were targeted, while the vehicles (DSNGs) and equipment of many media houses were damaged,” the CRA stated. Sindh government spokesperson Sadia Javed, in a statement, said there were “attacks on multiple news channels’ vehicles and pelting”. The vehicles of GNN and Aaj News were among those damaged, while a worker of Channel 5 was reportedly assaulted. In his statement, PPP Karachi General Secretary Rauf Ahmed Nagori alleged that PTI workers “vandalised citizen vehicles during their protest”. PTI changes rally venue The PTI had initially planned to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah, and the PPP-led Sindh government had even issued a no-objection certificate for it despite objections from the PML-N. But the party blamed the Sindh administration for “wasting their time” and announced that the public meeting would now be held in front of the Quaid’s mausoleum. Mazar-i-Quaid and Bagh-i-JInnah situated opposite it. — screengrab via Google Maps In a video statement, Sheikh criticised the Sindh government for allegedly blocking the rally. He recalled that Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had welcomed the KP CM at the Karachi airport and presented a Sindh cap and Ajrak to him. “Was that a pretence?” he questioned, slamming the Sindh government for its “shamelessness”. On the party’s decision to hold a gathering outside one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid, he said, “Holding a rally at a public gate does not block any route.” Sheikh alleged the NOC for the rally had been deliberately delayed, further questioning that when the Sindh government had granted permission for the rally, “why was our vendor beaten and made to flee?” He decried that the PPP was no longer late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s party. “Police brutality and blocking of roads cannot dampen the morale of the people,” PTI Karachi President Raja Azhar said in a statement, adding that the rally would prove to be the “public’s referendum against cruelty”. Similarly, party member Faheem Khan urged people to participate in the rally and termed the alleged blocking of roads “an attack on the rights of the people”. Late on Saturday, Sheikh said that while the PTI had announced Mazar-i-Quaid as the venue as the NOC had not been issued by then, the party had again decided to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah after getting the permission. PTI alleges arrests at Bagh-i-Jinnah Separately, the PTI alleged that authorities had raided Bagh-i-Jinnah, subjected its workers to violence and also arrested several of them. Party spokesperson Bozdar, while speaking to Dawn , alleged that when workers reached Bagh-i-Jinnah around 2am on Sunday for rally arrangements and preparations, around 15 to 20 police mobiles reached the spot and law enforcement personnel resorted to baton-charge. They detained over a dozen PTI workers, he claimed. At around 2:30am, PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui posted on X that the Sindh government wasted their time as the deputy commissioner East had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) on Saturday evening at 6:30pm. “The public power witnessed in Karachi yesterday has frightened them; they can’t decide what to do now. The people of Karachi will be at the Mazar-i-Quaid public gate at 2pm with our guest, the chief minister of KP, Sohail Afridi. We will hold a public meeting at the VIP gate at 2pm,” she stated. But the Sindh home minister warned of strict action if any public meeting was held on the road. “No one is allowed to challenge the writ of the government,” Lanjar said in a statement. In one of her posts at around 4:30am, Siddiqui said that containers had been parked around Jinnah Ground and police personnel were present at the site in large numbers. In another post, she alleged police had “attacked” Bagh-i-Jinnah, arrested several PTI workers, and their belongings had been confiscated. Similarly, Sheikh said in a post on X at around 2:30am that “this fascism against peaceful workers was unfortunate. The PPP and Sindh government, which harp about democracy, should feel ashamed“. In other posts, he decried the alleged police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah and claimed PTI workers had been subjected to violence. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media at Karachi Press Club today, decried the “barbarity” that PTI members had been subjected to. “Cars were smashed, and two dozen members have been detained unlawfully. A lawyer of ours was detained this morning at Bagh-i-Jinnah. It is cordoned off by police right now,” he said, adding that the PTI had the NOC for the rally. “So the rally will happen,” he asserted. In response to a Dawn query, police sources denied detaining any PTI workers this morning and said they just removed them from Mazar-i-Quaid. The sources said police took action to disperse the party workers, alleging that they had blocked a main road. The sources also said that while there would be no restriction on the movement of KP CM Afridi, PTI workers would not be allowed at Mazar-i-Quaid. KP CM claims routes blocked from Hyderabad to Karachi Earlier on Sunday, CM Afridi claimed in a post on X that “upon my return from Hyderabad, all routes for me and my entire team have been blocked. For the past four hours, I’ve been switching between different routes. At 4:23am, we’ve now set off toward Karachi on a deserted road“. “The Sindh government is not only playing with my life but also with the lives of my team members,” he said, warning that the precedent of such treatment being meted out to the CM of one province in other provinces would “prove highly detrimental in the near future”. “Pakistan belongs to all of us. Do not spread hatred here to such an extent that it becomes impossible to return from that point. Fake democratic forces are not leaving any stone unturned in this. This is extremely shameful,” he said. However, Hyderabad SSP Adeel Chandio told Dawn that “no obstruction was created in the convoy and rally of KP CM in Hyderabad until he left the city”. “And he left the city safely,” he added. Later, in a video message shared on PTI’s X account, the CM said: “We reached Karachi around 7:15pm […] We will definitely hold a rally today. It took us seven and a half hours to reach Karachi from Hyderabad. “They had blocked the route at different places and we were compelled to travel on a deserted route. This was tantamount to putting my and my team’s lives at risk, as anything could have happened there.” He urged Karachiites to come out for the rally today, adding that “they (the Sindh government) are afraid of the rally, but it will be held”. Raja also posted on X that he had reached Karachi from Hyderabad after “seven hours, driving through jungles in the CM KPK’s vehicle”. “Motorway closed. The fascist state lost its nerve after seeing the massive response of the people, given two days of freedom and human dignity,” he said. PTI not abiding by assurances, claims Sharjeel Inam From the Sindh government, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon maintained that his provincial government had warmly welcomed Afridi and provided him with complete security. “The post of chief minister is a constitutional post and constitutional posts have been fully respected,” he said in a statement, maintaining that the PTI was in constant touch with the Sindh government. He then accused the opposition party of “not abiding by the assurances” it had given, but did not specify any guarantees. “It was clearly said on the very first day that they are allowed to hold a rally. It is inappropriate to make allegations against the Sindh government despite this,” he said, maintaining that no one had stopped the PTI from holding a rally in the ground. However, the manner in which rallies and processions were being taken out on the roads was causing severe traffic disruption and common citizens were facing difficulties, he said. “Karachi is a metropolitan city; traffic problems arise here even when a few hundred people gather,” he said. “We want the KP chief minister to complete his visit in a peaceful manner.” He said that PTI workers should not take the law into their own hands and should follow the guidelines given by the government. The movement of common people should not be affected and violation of laws should be avoided, he added. Memon said a security alert had also been issued regarding the rally, and a security plan had been devised. “Unfortunately, the security plan is not being followed,” he claimed, further maintaining that complete security had been provided by Sindh police in connection with the rally. “In view of security concerns, the instructions of the Sindh government should be followed, and only routes allocated by the government should be used,” he said. Memon claimed that the route designated for the PTI in Hyderabad had not been followed and they took a route of their own choice. “It is not correct to say that the convoy of the chief minister of KP was stopped on its return from Hyderabad,” he said. “The place where the convoy faced difficulty is the National Highway Authority bridge, where traffic congestions are frequent.” More to follow Additional input by Mohammad Hussain Khan",

      "summary_en": "KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday briefly addressed hundreds gathered near Mazar-i-Quaid for the party’s rally, while the PTI claimed it faced hurdles in reaching the venue and its supporters were met with shelling by the police. The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue , saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid. During the day, PTI supporters gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the police employed shelling. Disturbances were also reported near Numaish Chowrangi as police dispersed crowds, while media vehicles were also vandalised. “I am deeply grateful to all Pakistanis and the people of Sindh for honouring us with enormous respect and esteem,” CM Afridi said while addressing a huge crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid late on Sunday night. “We can never forget the respect we received from the people of Sindh. But you all must not forgive the Sindh government for the disrespect they have shown towards the Sindhi cap and Ajrak,” the PTI leader added. “We will not allow anyone to steal our mandate, to snatch our rights, or to further keep our leader Imran Khan sahib in prison wrongfully,” Afridi said. The KP CM said: “Those who used to say ‘we will end PTI’ and who were thinking that Imran Khan’s politics will be eradicated, they should come here and see these youngsters here. “They should consider that these people have come for only a jalsa , then what will happen the day my leader (Imran Khan) issues a formal call for a street movement,” he added. “You must stand prepared against this oppression and fascism.

The KP CM said: “Those who used to say ‘we will end PTI’ and who were thinking that Imran Khan’s politics will be eradicated, they should come here and see these youngsters here. “They should consider that these people have come for only a jalsa , then what will happen the day my leader (Imran Khan) issues a formal call for a street movement,” he added. “You must stand prepared against this oppression and fascism. Whenever my leader issues a call, we will act as per his wishes,” the PTI leader said. Afridi reiterated his claims of the Sindh government “leaving us stranded on deserted roads in the dark of the night” while returning from Hyderabad to Karachi. However, a provincial minister refuted the claims, saying that a police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”. “Shelling was also done at our sisters, children, workers here […] all routes were blocked, police baton-charged [supporters],” CM Afridi claimed in his brief address. The chief minister further alleged that “they (authorities) also damaged the media’s vehicles”. Afridi said the Sindh government “repeated” what its Punjab counterpart had done when he visited Lahore last month, calling both governments “fake”. The gathering was a part of the KP CM’s four-day visit to Sindh, who is leading his party’s street mobilisation movement. “God willing, our next stop will be Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and we will continue the same momentum in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” CM Afridi announced. The KP CM also raised slogans of “every chowk is D-Chowk”. ‘Delays due to obstructions, public welcomes’ Earlier at 7:44pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said CM Afridi’s convoy was facing delays “due to obstructions at various places, and the public’s affection, welcomes and responses at numerous places”. At around 9pm, Sheikh said the KP CM would reach the venue in five minutes, and lashed out at the Sindh police and government for their actions. At around 10:30pm, he shared footage of the caravan at Numaish Chowrangi, where Afridi also addressed the crowd. The PTI also shared visuals of the welcome accorded to the party caravan by their supporters in Baldia Town and Ittehad Town‘s Khyber Chowk. At around 6:40pm, the PTI said the Sindh police had “attempted to prevent” CM Afridi’s convoy from moving forward, but the party leaders “had the path reopened with the help of party workers”. The video showed party leaders, including Shafiullah Jan, speaking to the police before the convoy’s vehicles were allowed to move ahead. The PTI also shared videos of hundreds gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah by the evening, with supporters chanting “ Jiye Imran ” and “ Tera yaar, mera yaar, Qaidi No. 804 ”. In a video recorded while on his way to the venue, Afridi said his convoy would reach Mazar-i-Quaid after going through Baldia Town, Keamari, Banaras Chowk, Golimar and Gurumandir so PTI supporters could join the caravan. Former MNA Faheem Khan said , “Ten of our vehicles were intercepted. But no worries; I am reaching the rally venue with another vehicle equipped with a sound system.” In a statement on X, the PTI hailed the public for its “historic display of public power and expression of love for Imran Khan”. “Despite all the fascism, violence, arrests and obstructions by the Sindh government through its police, thousands of people have gathered inside and around Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah and on the surrounding streets at the moment,” it said. “This is the scene that serves as a clear message to those with fascist mindsets that public power cannot be stopped by walls and batons,” the PTI asserted. “This gathering is a renewal of the pledge that we are ready to give every sacrifice for Imran Khan, Pakistan, true freedom, supremacy of the Constitution and law, independence of the judiciary, and our basic rights.” Shelling, roadblocks at venue: PTI Shortly after 4pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared a video on X wherein a woman said police have resorted to shelling at party supporters at “Mazar-i-Quaid’s garden”. Video footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed multiple police vans at Bagh-i-Jinnah and cops employing shelling, with people gathered there retaliating by pelting stones. Pictures from Numaish Chowrangi showed cops with batons detaining multiple individuals as PTI supporters gathered to make their way to Bagh-i-Jinnah.

People push aside containers that had been placed to block a route in Karachi. — Shakil Adil/ White Star The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — an ally of the PTI under an opposition alliance — also said its leader Allama Sadiq Jafri and others had reached “Jinnah Ground”, possibly referring to Bagh-i-Jinnah. PTI spokesperson Mohammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn that police had blocked roads and were not allowing party workers to enter Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the government had previously allowed the party to hold the rally. He reiterated his allegation that police had blocked roads in various areas and were preventing PTI workers from reaching the new venue of Mazar-i-Quaid’s VIP gate as well. Bozdar said CM Afridi would pay his respects at the mausoleum and later on, he would address party workers from a truck, the arrangements for which had been completed. ‘Attack’ on mediapersons Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of an “attack“ on Aaj News ’ vehicle near Gurumandir Chowrangi. He also directed the East district senior superintendent of police (SSP) to immediately provide details on “police action”. “Miscreant elements will be dealt with firmly. We will not let anyone sabotage law and order,” Lanjar asserted. The minister said the perpetrators would be arrested by tracing them using the modern monitoring system. A vehicle of Aaj News with a badly damaged windshield. — Shakil Adil/ White Star In a statement, PTI’s Bozdar also condemned the attack on mediapersons and said action should be taken if someone had “attacked the media”. “The PTI’s workers are peaceful. No one is allowed to take the law into their hands,” he stated. “The media is the public’s voice; attacks on media will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he added. The board members of Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the “attack of a charged crowd on media; violence against journalists, cameramen and staff; and damage caused to DSNGs”. “How can this group declare themselves pro-democratic after attacking the media?” said a joint statement by KUJ President Ejaz Ahmad and others. “What message did they try to convey by targeting the media?” The KUJ demanded that the Sindh government trace the perpetrators through CCTV footage and bring them to justice. The Crime Reporters Association (CRA) also strongly condemned the vandalism incidents, adding that there was a “clash between political workers and police” during coverage at Bagh-i-Jinnah. “Media representatives busy in fulfilling their duties got caught in the middle of this chaos and were targeted, while the vehicles (DSNGs) and equipment of many media houses were damaged,” the CRA stated. Sindh government spokesperson Sadia Javed, in a statement, said there were “attacks on multiple news channels’ vehicles and pelting”. The vehicles of GNN and Aaj News were among those damaged, while a worker of Channel 5 was reportedly assaulted. In his statement, PPP Karachi General Secretary Rauf Ahmed Nagori alleged that PTI workers “vandalised citizen vehicles during their protest”. PTI changes rally venue The PTI had initially planned to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah, and the PPP-led Sindh government had even issued a no-objection certificate for it despite objections from the PML-N. But the party blamed the Sindh administration for “wasting their time” and announced that the public meeting would now be held in front of the Quaid’s mausoleum. Mazar-i-Quaid and Bagh-i-JInnah situated opposite it. — screengrab via Google Maps In a video statement, Sheikh criticised the Sindh government for allegedly blocking the rally. He recalled that Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had welcomed the KP CM at the Karachi airport and presented a Sindh cap and Ajrak to him. “Was that a pretence?” he questioned, slamming the Sindh government for its “shamelessness”. On the party’s decision to hold a gathering outside one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid, he said, “Holding a rally at a public gate does not block any route.” Sheikh alleged the NOC for the rally had been deliberately delayed, further questioning that when the Sindh government had granted permission for the rally, “why was our vendor beaten and made to flee?” He decried that the PPP was no longer late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s party. “Police brutality and blocking of roads cannot dampen the morale of the people,” PTI Karachi President Raja Azhar said in a statement, adding that the rally would prove to be the “public’s referendum against cruelty”. Similarly, party member Faheem Khan urged people to participate in the rally and termed the alleged blocking of roads “an attack on the rights of the people”. Late on Saturday, Sheikh said that while the PTI had announced Mazar-i-Quaid as the venue as the NOC had not been issued by then, the party had again decided to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah after getting the permission. PTI alleges arrests at Bagh-i-Jinnah Separately, the PTI alleged that authorities had raided Bagh-i-Jinnah, subjected its workers to violence and also arrested several of them. Party spokesperson Bozdar, while speaking to Dawn , alleged that when workers reached Bagh-i-Jinnah around 2am on Sunday for rally arrangements and preparations, around 15 to 20 police mobiles reached the spot and law enforcement personnel resorted to baton-charge. They detained over a dozen PTI workers, he claimed. At around 2:30am, PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui posted on X that the Sindh government wasted their time as the deputy commissioner East had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) on Saturday evening at 6:30pm. “The public power witnessed in Karachi yesterday has frightened them; they can’t decide what to do now. The people of Karachi will be at the Mazar-i-Quaid public gate at 2pm with our guest, the chief minister of KP, Sohail Afridi. We will hold a public meeting at the VIP gate at 2pm,” she stated. But the Sindh home minister warned of strict action if any public meeting was held on the road. “No one is allowed to challenge the writ of the government,” Lanjar said in a statement. In one of her posts at around 4:30am, Siddiqui said that containers had been parked around Jinnah Ground and police personnel were present at the site in large numbers. In another post, she alleged police had “attacked” Bagh-i-Jinnah, arrested several PTI workers, and their belongings had been confiscated. Similarly, Sheikh said in a post on X at around 2:30am that “this fascism against peaceful workers was unfortunate. The PPP and Sindh government, which harp about democracy, should feel ashamed“. In other posts, he decried the alleged police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah and claimed PTI workers had been subjected to violence. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media at Karachi Press Club today, decried the “barbarity” that PTI members had been subjected to. “Cars were smashed, and two dozen members have been detained unlawfully. A lawyer of ours was detained this morning at Bagh-i-Jinnah. It is cordoned off by police right now,” he said, adding that the PTI had the NOC for the rally. “So the rally will happen,” he asserted. In response to a Dawn query, police sources denied detaining any PTI workers this morning and said they just removed them from Mazar-i-Quaid. The sources said police took action to disperse the party workers, alleging that they had blocked a main road. The sources also said that while there would be no restriction on the movement of KP CM Afridi, PTI workers would not be allowed at Mazar-i-Quaid. KP CM claims routes blocked from Hyderabad to Karachi Earlier on Sunday, CM Afridi claimed in a post on X that “upon my return from Hyderabad, all routes for me and my entire team have been blocked. For the past four hours, I’ve been switching between different routes. At 4:23am, we’ve now set off toward Karachi on a deserted road“. “The Sindh government is not only playing with my life but also with the lives of my team members,” he said, warning that the precedent of such treatment being meted out to the CM of one province in other provinces would “prove highly detrimental in the near future”. “Pakistan belongs to all of us. Do not spread hatred here to such an extent that it becomes impossible to return from that point. Fake democratic forces are not leaving any stone unturned in this. This is extremely shameful,” he said. However, Hyderabad SSP Adeel Chandio told Dawn that “no obstruction was created in the convoy and rally of KP CM in Hyderabad until he left the city”. “And he left the city safely,” he added. Later, in a video message shared on PTI’s X account, the CM said: “We reached Karachi around 7:15pm […] We will definitely hold a rally today. It took us seven and a half hours to reach Karachi from Hyderabad. “They had blocked the route at different places and we were compelled to travel on a deserted route. This was tantamount to putting my and my team’s lives at risk, as anything could have happened there.” He urged Karachiites to come out for the rally today, adding that “they (the Sindh government) are afraid of the rally, but it will be held”. Raja also posted on X that he had reached Karachi from Hyderabad after “seven hours, driving through jungles in the CM KPK’s vehicle”. “Motorway closed. The fascist state lost its nerve after seeing the massive response of the people, given two days of freedom and human dignity,” he said. PTI not abiding by assurances, claims Sharjeel Inam From the Sindh government, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon maintained that his provincial government had warmly welcomed Afridi and provided him with complete security. “The post of chief minister is a constitutional post and constitutional posts have been fully respected,” he said in a statement, maintaining that the PTI was in constant touch with the Sindh government. He then accused the opposition party of “not abiding by the assurances” it had given, but did not specify any guarantees. “It was clearly said on the very first day that they are allowed to hold a rally. It is inappropriate to make allegations against the Sindh government despite this,” he said, maintaining that no one had stopped the PTI from holding a rally in the ground. However, the manner in which rallies and processions were being taken out on the roads was causing severe traffic disruption and common citizens were facing difficulties, he said. “Karachi is a metropolitan city; traffic problems arise here even when a few hundred people gather,” he said. “We want the KP chief minister to complete his visit in a peaceful manner.” He said that PTI workers should not take the law into their own hands and should follow the guidelines given by the government. The movement of common people should not be affected and violation of laws should be avoided, he added. Memon said a security alert had also been issued regarding the rally, and a security plan had been devised. “Unfortunately, the security plan is not being followed,” he claimed, further maintaining that complete security had been provided by Sindh police in connection with the rally. “In view of security concerns, the instructions of the Sindh government should be followed, and only routes allocated by the government should be used,” he said. Memon claimed that the route designated for the PTI in Hyderabad had not been followed and they took a route of their own choice. “It is not correct to say that the convoy of the chief minister of KP was stopped on its return from Hyderabad,” he said. “The place where the convoy faced difficulty is the National Highway Authority bridge, where traffic congestions are frequent.” More to follow Additional input by Mohammad Hussain Khan",

      "title_orig": "PPP’s Nasir Shah ‘apologises’ to KP CM Afridi for any unpleasant incident during Sindh visit",
      "summary_orig": "Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah on Sunday tendered an apology to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi for any “unpleasant incident” that he may have faced during his ongoing visit to Sindh. His statements came after the PTI claimed its convoy was facing hurdles while on its way to Mazar-i-Quaid for a rally, and CM Afridi said he had to use risky routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad. “I personally apologise if something [unpleasant] happened somewhere, as this should not happen,” Shah said during Geo News ’ programme ‘Naya Pakistan’. ’’He is the chief minister of a province and whatever we did, the welcome and all, was in respect of the people of KP as he had their mandate,“ the PPP leader added. Asked about the apparent change in the Sindh government’s attitude , Shah highlighted that the guests were “welcomed and taken care of”. He noted that the PTI sought permission to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah from the Sindh government “even though it falls under the federal government’s jurisdiction”. He acknowledged that the PTI “adopted the proper procedure” to seek a no-objection certificate (NOC), which he said also caused delays. Then, the minister said, the issues arose when the NOC got delayed by about 1-1.5 hours, and the PTI announced that they would “hold the rally on a road”. Shah added that the Sindh government had even offered the PTI to connect them to their vendors if the preparations were lacking. The minister then pointed out CM Afridi’s “certain” statements, including one about President Asif Ali Zardari’s politics. “There are no differences. Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari sahib and President Asif Ali Zardari sahib are our PPP, the Sindh government. There is one stance,” he asserted. Shah added that if President Zardari did not wish so, the PTI guests would not have been welcomed at the airport or facilitated. He said the PTI started making harsh statements, which also upset party members who noted the criticism despite offering them support. Asked about the police action against PTI workers at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the early hours of Sunday, Shah said an inquiry was underway about what led to it. He said the PTI was being urged to arrange the setup in the ground, but they were insistent on holding a gathering on the road. On CM Afridi’s claims about his convoy being forced to take dangerous routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad, Shah said: “He had complete protocol, and as per the security threat issued, he was brought via the safest routes. “Those were the safest routes, and police protection was with him,“ the PPP leader asserted. “How could he have returned if there were pickets and if roads were blocked?” Shah asked rhetorically. “As per the reports the administration has given, this protocol was adopted for their security and safety,“ the minister replied to a question about the police pickets set up. On reports of shelling at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the day despite the NOC, Shah said, “Something unpleasant happened there.” Criticising Zardari is our democratic right: Qaiser Responding to Shah on the same show, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “We think that Sindh’s people and government respect democracy and […] they respect their opponents.” He acknowledged that the PTI had differences with the PPP and concerns about it. “In our opinion, the illegitimate government in power right now is so because of their support,” he said. “The legislation that they are doing. [Criticising it] is our stance. It is our democratic right to have whatever stance we want,” Qaiser stressed. To a question raised by the host, Qaiser responded: “You and he (Shah) both understand what is happening from where. Will a democratic political party take instructions in this manner? Will we not have a say?” Qaiser said the PTI respected the PPP, adding: “Even if you say that we criticised Zardari sahib , that is our democratic right.” “Will this attitude continue? Is this democracy? […] Tell me, what unlawful [incident] has occurred over the past two days?“ Qaiser asked. He stressed the vendors needed two to three days to make arrangements at the venue, adding that there was “no lighting” at Bagh-i-Jinnah and that the Sindh government would be responsible for any unfortunate incident. Responding to Qaiser, Shah pointed out the welcome accorded to CM Afridi on Friday, asking if it would have been given “if there were some instructions from somewhere”. Shah also denied that the PPP “changed its strategy” because of the PML-N reportedly being criticised for its attitude towards the KP CM during his Lahore visit . Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.",

Is this democracy? […] Tell me, what unlawful [incident] has occurred over the past two days?“ Qaiser asked. He stressed the vendors needed two to three days to make arrangements at the venue, adding that there was “no lighting” at Bagh-i-Jinnah and that the Sindh government would be responsible for any unfortunate incident. Responding to Qaiser, Shah pointed out the welcome accorded to CM Afridi on Friday, asking if it would have been given “if there were some instructions from somewhere”. Shah also denied that the PPP “changed its strategy” because of the PML-N reportedly being criticised for its attitude towards the KP CM during his Lahore visit . Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.",
      "title": "PPP’s Nasir Shah ‘apologises’ to KP CM Afridi for any unpleasant incident during Sindh visit",
      "summary": "Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah on Sunday tendered an apology to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi for any “unpleasant incident” that he may have faced during his ongoing visit to Sindh. His statements came after the PTI claimed its convoy was facing hurdles while on its way to Mazar-i-Quaid for a rally, and CM Afridi said he had to use risky routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad. “I personally apologise if something [unpleasant] happened somewhere, as this should not happen,” Shah said during Geo News ’ programme ‘Naya Pakistan’. ’’He is the chief minister of a province and whatever we did, the welcome and all, was in respect of the people of KP as he had their mandate,“ the PPP leader added. Asked about the apparent change in the Sindh government’s attitude , Shah highlighted that the guests were “welcomed and taken care of”. He noted that the PTI sought permission to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah from the Sindh government “even though it falls under the federal government’s jurisdiction”. He acknowledged that the PTI “adopted the proper procedure” to seek a no-objection certificate (NOC), which he said also caused delays. Then, the minister said, the issues arose when the NOC got delayed by about 1-1.5 hours, and the PTI announced that they would “hold the rally on a road”. Shah added that the Sindh government had even offered the PTI to connect them to their vendors if the preparations were lacking. The minister then pointed out CM Afridi’s “certain” statements, including one about President Asif Ali Zardari’s politics. “There are no differences. Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari sahib and President Asif Ali Zardari sahib are our PPP, the Sindh government. There is one stance,” he asserted. Shah added that if President Zardari did not wish so, the PTI guests would not have been welcomed at the airport or facilitated. He said the PTI started making harsh statements, which also upset party members who noted the criticism despite offering them support. Asked about the police action against PTI workers at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the early hours of Sunday, Shah said an inquiry was underway about what led to it. He said the PTI was being urged to arrange the setup in the ground, but they were insistent on holding a gathering on the road. On CM Afridi’s claims about his convoy being forced to take dangerous routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad, Shah said: “He had complete protocol, and as per the security threat issued, he was brought via the safest routes. “Those were the safest routes, and police protection was with him,“ the PPP leader asserted. “How could he have returned if there were pickets and if roads were blocked?” Shah asked rhetorically. “As per the reports the administration has given, this protocol was adopted for their security and safety,“ the minister replied to a question about the police pickets set up. On reports of shelling at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the day despite the NOC, Shah said, “Something unpleasant happened there.” Criticising Zardari is our democratic right: Qaiser Responding to Shah on the same show, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “We think that Sindh’s people and government respect democracy and […] they respect their opponents.” He acknowledged that the PTI had differences with the PPP and concerns about it. “In our opinion, the illegitimate government in power right now is so because of their support,” he said. “The legislation that they are doing. [Criticising it] is our stance. It is our democratic right to have whatever stance we want,” Qaiser stressed. To a question raised by the host, Qaiser responded: “You and he (Shah) both understand what is happening from where. Will a democratic political party take instructions in this manner? Will we not have a say?” Qaiser said the PTI respected the PPP, adding: “Even if you say that we criticised Zardari sahib , that is our democratic right.” “Will this attitude continue? Is this democracy? […] Tell me, what unlawful [incident] has occurred over the past two days?“ Qaiser asked. He stressed the vendors needed two to three days to make arrangements at the venue, adding that there was “no lighting” at Bagh-i-Jinnah and that the Sindh government would be responsible for any unfortunate incident. Responding to Qaiser, Shah pointed out the welcome accorded to CM Afridi on Friday, asking if it would have been given “if there were some instructions from somewhere”.

With the country’s government facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if force is used on protesters. Authorities intensify crackdown The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices. Authorities accuse the US and Israel of fomenting unrest. Iran’s police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront “rioters”. The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday. Footage posted on social media on Saturday from Tehran showed large crowds marching along a street at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd “has no end nor beginning,” a man is heard saying. In footage from the northeastern city of Mashhad, smoke can be seen billowing into the night sky from fires in the street, masked protesters, and a road strewn with debris, another video posted on Saturday showed. Explosions could be heard. Reuters verified the locations. State TV aired footage of dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroner’s office on Sunday, saying the dead were victims of events caused by “armed terrorists”. Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any US intervention. An Israeli military official said the protests were an internal Iranian matter, but Israel’s military was monitoring developments and was ready to respond “with power if need be”. An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment. Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, which the United States briefly joined by attacking key nuclear installations. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar. Iran denounces ‘rioters and terrorists’ Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a TV interview, said Israel and the US were masterminding destabilisation and that Iran’s enemies had brought in “terrorists … who set mosques on fire …. attack banks, and public properties”. “Families, I ask you: do not allow your young children to join rioters and terrorists who behead people and kill others,” he said, adding that the government was ready to listen to the people and to resolve economic problems. Alan Eyre, a former US diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple Iran’s ruling establishment. “I think it is more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker,” he told Reuters , noting that Iran’s ruling elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition. Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for security personnel killed in protests. State TV said 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan and that six more were killed by “rioters” in Kermanshah in the west.

      "title": "Iran’s parliament speaker Qalibaf warns US and Israel of retaliation if Iran is attacked",
      "summary": "Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, speaking in parliament on Sunday, warned the United States and Israel against “a miscalculation”, saying that Tehran will retaliate if it is attacked. “Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards. With the country’s government facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if force is used on protesters. Authorities intensify crackdown The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices. Authorities accuse the US and Israel of fomenting unrest. Iran’s police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront “rioters”. The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday. Footage posted on social media on Saturday from Tehran showed large crowds marching along a street at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd “has no end nor beginning,” a man is heard saying. In footage from the northeastern city of Mashhad, smoke can be seen billowing into the night sky from fires in the street, masked protesters, and a road strewn with debris, another video posted on Saturday showed. Explosions could be heard. Reuters verified the locations. State TV aired footage of dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroner’s office on Sunday, saying the dead were victims of events caused by “armed terrorists”. Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any US intervention. An Israeli military official said the protests were an internal Iranian matter, but Israel’s military was monitoring developments and was ready to respond “with power if need be”. An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment. Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, which the United States briefly joined by attacking key nuclear installations. Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar. Iran denounces ‘rioters and terrorists’ Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a TV interview, said Israel and the US were masterminding destabilisation and that Iran’s enemies had brought in “terrorists … who set mosques on fire …. attack banks, and public properties”. “Families, I ask you: do not allow your young children to join rioters and terrorists who behead people and kill others,” he said, adding that the government was ready to listen to the people and to resolve economic problems. Alan Eyre, a former US diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple Iran’s ruling establishment. “I think it is more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker,” he told Reuters , noting that Iran’s ruling elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition. Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for security personnel killed in protests. State TV said 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan and that six more were killed by “rioters” in Kermanshah in the west. Us ready to help, says Trump Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said : “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!” In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of US intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source present for the conversation. Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, said Trump had observed Iranians’ “indescribable bravery”. “Do not abandon the streets,” Pahlavi, who is based in the US, wrote on X. Netanyahu, speaking during a cabinet meeting, said Israel was closely monitoring developments. “We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from the yoke of tyranny,” he said.
