      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Sindh government on Monday decided to release nearly 300 Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) workers who had been detained under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance last week, government sources and party leaders said. PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui said that Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar called party MPAs Wajid Hussain and Sajjad Ali Soomro to inform them of the government’s decision. “So we hope that our workers will be released by tomorrow [Tuesday] after all government formalities are completed,” she told Dawn . She claimed around 300 party workers and leaders from different tiers were arrested in raids that began last Sunday and continued ahead of the Feb 8 protest call. “We have already challenged their detention in court.” Meanwhile, government sources confirmed the PTI’s claim and said that the government had, in principle, decided to release all PTI workers and that the “documentary process” in this regard had already begun. Opposition party hopes detained activists will be freed today; claims home minister has conveyed the decision to two PTI lawmakers “So it may take some time, and by Tuesday evening we may see the workers being released from prison,” said a source. Last week, the PTI accused provincial authorities of arresting dozens of activists during night-long raids in Karachi and other parts of Sindh and detaining them under the controversial MPO Ordinance. On Feb 1, the Sindh home department issued notifications under MPO to detain the PTI workers for 30 days on the ground that they “are instigating public to block roads, highways and organise sit-ins, which may disturb peace and tranquillity and can create serious law and order problems”. The party challenged the alleged detentions in the Sindh High Court (SHC) the very next day. On Friday, the Sindh High Court directed provincial authorities to produce the cabinet’s decision for issuing detention orders against PTI workers under the MPO Ordinance. A two-judge constitutional bench of the SHC, headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhary, also issued notices to the respondents and the Advocate General Sindh in around 35 identical petitions, fixing Feb 10 for hearing. Earlier on Monday, the PTI said that even after passing the Feb 8 protest call , its Karachi President Raja Azhar and Senior Vice President Faheem Khan were arrested by law enforcement authorities. Condemning the move as unconstitutional and politically motivated, the party spokesperson said that both leaders were shifted to the Central Prison and that even their families were unaware of the cases against them and their whereabouts. “We have been informed that both leaders were moved to the Central Prison on Monday evening. We were not allowed to meet them, nor were their families permitted to do so. This is open barbarity, which we strongly condemn,” she alleged. Published in Dawn, February 10th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ON Aug 1, 2025, a Facebook post showed Ajay Bisaria, former Indian envoy to Pakistan, alongside a video of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reading in parliament from the diplomat’s book about difficult relations with the neighbour. Last week, however, the defence minister was taking an opposite stance about quoting from books and published articles in parliament. He took umbrage at the opposition seeking to cite the memoirs of former army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi aimed to show with the help of the extracts how the Modi government’s macho image of itself was in fact pretentious and hollow when it came to confronting China. The defence minister insisted, wrongly, that it was against parliament’s rules to quote from the printed but as yet unpublished book. Rajnath Singh was livid because Gandhi cited some troubling passages showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a shirker when it came to confronting China. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla ad-libbed to tell an unsurprised Gandhi that he could neither quote from the book nor from an article about the book. And he wouldn’t be permitted to even describe its contents. The impugned book — Four Stars of Destiny — was written by the former army chief over a year ago, and has been ready for release for months. But its publication stands withheld without clearance from the defence minister’s office. The ministry has not responded to reminders from the publishers as to why it was not being cleared. The answer may lie elsewhere. On Jan 31, ace defence analyst Sushant Singh published excerpts from Naravane’s book in Caravan magazine. Some passages from the book do something unusually courageous. They unintentionally challenge Modi’s self-cultivated image as a tough nationalist who brooks no nonsense from India’s neighbours, chiefly Pakistan but also China, albeit in a muffled way. Naravane was alarmed, in Sushant’s version of a passage, when the chief of the Northern Command reported that Chinese tanks were moving speedily towards an Indian post on the disputed Himalayan border. The chief woke up everyone from the national security adviser to the foreign minister and the defence minister, but got no response. Hours later, the defence minister called to tell him pithily, according to the book, that Modi’s instructions were to deal with the situation as Naravane deemed fit. In other words, as Naravane writes, he was handed a hot potato. Rahul Gandhi cited some troubling passages from an as yet unpublished book showing Modi as a shirker when it came to China. According to Sushant’s reading of the book, Lt-Gen Yogesh Joshi, the chief of the Indian Army’s Northern Command, received a phone call at 8.15 pm on Aug 31, 2020. The information he received alarmed him. Four Chinese tanks, supported by infantry, had begun moving up a steep mountain track towards Rechin La in eastern Ladakh. Joshi reported the movement to Gen Naravane who immediately grasped the severity of the situation. The tanks were within a few hundred metres of Indian positions on the Kailash Range, the strategic high ground that Indian forces had seized, hours earlier, in a dangerous race with China’s People’s Liberation Army. “In this terrain on the disputed Line of Actual Control — the de facto border between the two countries — every metre of elevation translates to strategic dominance,” says Sushant Singh. The Indian soldiers fired an illuminating round, a kind of warning shot. It had no effect. The Chinese kept advancing. Naravane began making frantic calls to the leaders of India’s political and military establishment, including Rajnath Singh, the defence minister, Ajit Doval, the national security adviser, Gen Bipin Rawat, the chief of defence staff and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. “To each and every one my question was, ‘What are my orders?’” Naravane writes. The situation was deteriorating dramatically and demanded clarity. There was an existing protocol. Naravane had clear orders not to open fire “till cleared from the very top”. His superiors did not give any clear directive. Minutes ticked by. At 9.10 pm, Joshi called again. The Chinese tanks continued to advance and were now less than a kilometre from the pass. At 9.25 pm, Naravane called Rajnath again, asking “for clear directions”.

      "summary_en": "ON Aug 1, 2025, a Facebook post showed Ajay Bisaria, former Indian envoy to Pakistan, alongside a video of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reading in parliament from the diplomat’s book about difficult relations with the neighbour. Last week, however, the defence minister was taking an opposite stance about quoting from books and published articles in parliament. He took umbrage at the opposition seeking to cite the memoirs of former army chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi aimed to show with the help of the extracts how the Modi government’s macho image of itself was in fact pretentious and hollow when it came to confronting China. The defence minister insisted, wrongly, that it was against parliament’s rules to quote from the printed but as yet unpublished book. Rajnath Singh was livid because Gandhi cited some troubling passages showing Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a shirker when it came to confronting China. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla ad-libbed to tell an unsurprised Gandhi that he could neither quote from the book nor from an article about the book. And he wouldn’t be permitted to even describe its contents. The impugned book — Four Stars of Destiny — was written by the former army chief over a year ago, and has been ready for release for months. But its publication stands withheld without clearance from the defence minister’s office. The ministry has not responded to reminders from the publishers as to why it was not being cleared. The answer may lie elsewhere. On Jan 31, ace defence analyst Sushant Singh published excerpts from Naravane’s book in Caravan magazine. Some passages from the book do something unusually courageous. They unintentionally challenge Modi’s self-cultivated image as a tough nationalist who brooks no nonsense from India’s neighbours, chiefly Pakistan but also China, albeit in a muffled way. Naravane was alarmed, in Sushant’s version of a passage, when the chief of the Northern Command reported that Chinese tanks were moving speedily towards an Indian post on the disputed Himalayan border. The chief woke up everyone from the national security adviser to the foreign minister and the defence minister, but got no response. Hours later, the defence minister called to tell him pithily, according to the book, that Modi’s instructions were to deal with the situation as Naravane deemed fit. In other words, as Naravane writes, he was handed a hot potato. Rahul Gandhi cited some troubling passages from an as yet unpublished book showing Modi as a shirker when it came to China. According to Sushant’s reading of the book, Lt-Gen Yogesh Joshi, the chief of the Indian Army’s Northern Command, received a phone call at 8.15 pm on Aug 31, 2020. The information he received alarmed him. Four Chinese tanks, supported by infantry, had begun moving up a steep mountain track towards Rechin La in eastern Ladakh. Joshi reported the movement to Gen Naravane who immediately grasped the severity of the situation. The tanks were within a few hundred metres of Indian positions on the Kailash Range, the strategic high ground that Indian forces had seized, hours earlier, in a dangerous race with China’s People’s Liberation Army. “In this terrain on the disputed Line of Actual Control — the de facto border between the two countries — every metre of elevation translates to strategic dominance,” says Sushant Singh. The Indian soldiers fired an illuminating round, a kind of warning shot. It had no effect. The Chinese kept advancing. Naravane began making frantic calls to the leaders of India’s political and military establishment, including Rajnath Singh, the defence minister, Ajit Doval, the national security adviser, Gen Bipin Rawat, the chief of defence staff and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar. “To each and every one my question was, ‘What are my orders?’” Naravane writes. The situation was deteriorating dramatically and demanded clarity. There was an existing protocol. Naravane had clear orders not to open fire “till cleared from the very top”. His superiors did not give any clear directive. Minutes ticked by. At 9.10 pm, Joshi called again. The Chinese tanks continued to advance and were now less than a kilometre from the pass. At 9.25 pm, Naravane called Rajnath again, asking “for clear directions”. None came. “My position was critical.” Naravane was caught between “the Command who wanted to open fire with all possible means” and a government committee “which had yet to give me clear-cut executive orders”. To cut the story short, Rajnath Singh called back at 10.30 pm.

The region, strategically located between the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal on one of the world’s busiest trade routes, has increasingly attracted the interest of the Gulf states. The agreement comes a month and a half after Israel recognised Somaliland, a self-proclaimed republic that seceded from Somalia in 1991 but which Mogadishu still considers to be under its control. Somali Defence Minister Ahmed Moallim Fiqi and his Saudi counterpart, Prince Khalid Bin Salman, signed a “military cooperation agreement” on Monday, according to a message on X from the Somali defence ministry. “This agreement further strengthens defence and military cooperation between the two nations, while covering various areas of mutual interest for both countries,” it said. In a separate post on X, Prince Khalid Bin Salman said he had “signed and witnessed the signing” of “several” agreements on the sidelines of a military exhibition in Riyadh. He did not provide further details. Meanwhile, in Somaliland, the Emirati giant DP World has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in developing the deep-water port of Berbera, which it uses with little regard for the government in Mogadishu. This port includes an airport strictly controlled by Abu Dhabi, according to several witnesses and local sources.

      "summary_orig": "• Unanimous resolution demands intelligence, security upgrade in key areas • Opposition slams Basant celebrations amid nationwide grief; demands ex-military chiefs answer for Taliban return • Pandemonium erupts as parties trade blame over terrorism policies ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Monday strongly condemned the recent suicide attack in Tarlai, demanding a thorough, transparent and time-bound investigation to bring the perpetrators and sponsors of terrorism to justice. Through a unanimously adopted resolution moved by PPP Senator Syed Wa­­qar Mehdi, the House urged the strengthening of intelligence coordination and security arrangements, especially in the federal capital and at sensitive locations. The resolution condemned the suicide attack on civilians, stating it violates Islamic values, humanity, and Constitution. It expressed deep condolences to the victims’ families and prayed for the swift recovery of the injured. The House paid tribute to law-enforcement agencies, emergency responders, and medical personnel for their prompt professional response. It also suspended its routine to discuss the tragedy, affirming national unity amidst a blackout on TV and the Senate’s YouTube stream. However, the debate turned heated as opposition criticised Lahore’s Basant celebrations following major terror attacks in Balochistan and Islamabad. With incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan facing accusations re­­garding the resettlement of the Taliban in Pakistan, Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas called for a joint session of parliament. He demanded that the former military and spying age­ncy chiefs be summoned to explain who brought the Taliban back to the country. Senator Abbas regretted the dances performed as part of Basant celebrations in Lahore while dozens of families mou­rned. “This cold-heartedness would only benefit the terrorists,” Abbas remarked. He claimed timely hospital transfers could have saved lives. He argued that a collective funeral attended by the prime minister would have sent a necessary message of national unity. PTI’s parliamentary leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said the Tarlai tragedy had brought tears to the eyes of every citizen, reminding the House that the time for politics and excuses had already passed. “This is the time for a decisive action,” he asserted, adding that Pakistan comes first. Barrister Zafar emphasised that unity needs public trust, which the government undermines by opposing Imran Khan. He urged dismantling terrorist net­­works completely, not just isolated arrests. “If Daesh or any other terrorist organisation is operating within the country, it must be dealt with immediately and decisively,” he said. Senator Sherry Rehman criticised federal ministers’ absence during the debate and praised the armed forces’ sacrifices, while condemning the opposition for setting conditions during a national crisis. “What our army has done against terrorists, no other army in the world has done,” she said. Ms Rehman criticised Imran Khan for alleged sympathies with the Taliban, noting there was a reason many referred to him as “Taliban Khan”. Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar took strong exception to criticism directed at the armed forces. “All of us politicians and parties have made mistakes. Our security agencies are fighting a war against terrorism. We have to stand firmly with our institutions,” the law minister said. However, JUI-Fazl Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman argued the nation could not be satisfied by simply blaming a neighbouring country. “We trained the youth under an institution and today we are calling them wrong,” he regretted. He contended that a policy distinction persisted where those who commit terrorism on institutional orders are considered “good Taliban”, while those who do not are labelled “bad Taliban”. Framing of cultural event Rejecting criticism of the cultural festival, PML-N Senator Pervaiz Rashid framed the event as an act of defiance. “The terrorists want to make us mourn all the time but we will give a message to the terrorists, we will celebrate and destroy you,” he said. However, the session ended in pandemonium when PML-N’s Abid Sher Ali chided the PTI over the May 9 incidents, leading to intense verbal clashes.

The head of state’s tightly secured, four-day visit was aimed at consoling Australia’s Jewish community in the wake of the December shooting at Sydney’s Bondi Beach that killed 15 people at a Hanukkah festival. But he was met with protests in Australia’s two largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne on Monday evening, with the Sydney rally turning violent as police hit protesters and members of the media with pepper spray. The visit has attracted the ire of a large number of Australians, who accuse Herzog of being complicit in civilian deaths in Gaza . Israeli president’s visit to Sydney sparks massive protests in two major cities Pro-Palestine groups have organised protests in cities and towns across the country on Monday evening. In Sydney, thousands gathered in a square in the city’s central business district, listening to speeches and shouting pro-Palestine slogans. “The Bondi massacre was terrible but from our Australian leadership there’s been no acknowledgment of the Palestinian people and the Gazans,” said Jackson Elliott, a 30-year-old protester from Sydney. “Herzog has dodged all the questions about the occupation and says this visit is about Australia and Israeli relations but he is complicit.” There was a heavy police presence with a helicopter circling overhead and officers patrolling on horseback. Pepper spray, arrests Police repeatedly used tear gas and pepper spray to push back thousands of protesters who were trying to breach the line and march ahead. Several protesters were arrested as police claimed they clashed with the law enforcers. Palestine Action Group spokesman Josh Lees said on Instagram the police had repeatedly charged us with horses and pepper spray. Thousands of people also gathered in the centre of Melbourne demanding an end to Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories. New police powers The New South Wales state government invoked new powers giving police greater powers to control demonstrations prior to the rally. An attempt by protesters to overturn those powers in the state’s Supreme Court failed just before the rally began, local media reported. Not far from the protests, Herzog took part in an event on Monday evening titled “An Evening of Light and Solidarity” for the victims of the December 14 killings. Earlier, the Israeli president paid homage to the victims under rain and grey skies as he laid a wreath outside the beachside Bondi Pavilion. The UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry found last year that Herzog was liable for prosecution for inciting genocide after he said all Palestinians — an entire nation — were responsible for the Hamas attack on Israel.

      "summary_orig": "• Tens of thousands of supporters attend rival rallies across Dhaka • Voters will elect lawmakers to a 350-seat parliament • BNP, led by Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique, widely seen as a frontrunner • BNP’s main rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Shafiqur Rahman, allied with the student-led National Citizen Party DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election campaign entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina. Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election. The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat parliament, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — led by Tarique Rahman, who returned in December after 17 years in exile — widely tipped as a frontrunner. The BNP’s key rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party that is led by Shafiqur Rahman and has allied with the National Citizen Party (NCP) that was formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising. Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert. “The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation. “No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80. Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd. ‘Justice’ Hasina was overthrown on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups. The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was sentenced to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India. Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies. “If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall. “A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures. “Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.” ‘Long live the revolution’ Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades. “If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters. “If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach. “I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.” Published in Dawn, February 10th, 2026",

Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert. “The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation. “No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80. Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd. ‘Justice’ Hasina was overthrown on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups. The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was sentenced to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India. Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies. “If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall. “A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures. “Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.” ‘Long live the revolution’ Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades. “If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters. “If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach. “I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.” Published in Dawn, February 10th, 2026",

      "summary": "• Tens of thousands of supporters attend rival rallies across Dhaka • Voters will elect lawmakers to a 350-seat parliament • BNP, led by Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique, widely seen as a frontrunner • BNP’s main rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Shafiqur Rahman, allied with the student-led National Citizen Party DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election campaign entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina. Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday stressed the need for a national identity as the National Assembly passed a resolution condemning the attack at an imambargah in Islamabad. Speaking on the floor of the house, Asif said, “It is very important that we have a national identity on which no one disagrees.” Talking about terrorism, he said, “The spike in terrorism in the country; I am sad to say that we are not even united in the condemnation of terrorism.” He said that in order to protect political interests, some refrained from attending the funerals of martyrs. “At least on national issues — all of us sitting here, regardless of which party they belong to … this is one thing on which there needs to be consensus on and that is Pakistan and its integrity as well as respect for those sacrificing their lives,” he said. In his remarks, the minister said that two dictators in the past had joined the war in Afghanistan to please a superpower. He said terrorism was a blowback of mistakes committed by dictators in the past. The minister said religious hatred was being fanned in Pakistan under an international conspiracy. He said the last four presidents of the United States were responsible for the killings of millions of Muslims. “But we always try to get support from the world powers,” he added. He said India was sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan, adding that it was the need of the hour that all Pakistanis be united to foil India’s plan. He said that the Afghan government in the past had agreed with Pakistan’s stance but now were reluctant to give any guarantee for controlling terrorism. “Now, India is using Afghan terrorists against us. India is fighting a proxy war in Pakistan,” he added. He said there were differences among our religious sects which could be sorted out in Parliament instead of in mosques and imambargahs. “Let us make this parliament functional in a real manner,” he added. “History gives us an opportunity for course correction but we have to be loyal to the Constitution. All issues can be resolved here. All problems can be addressed if our politics becomes subservient to the state. Our loyalties to the motherland should not be conditional,” he said. Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Mehmood Khan Achakzai, in his speech, said that a three-day debate should be held on terrorism. He said all stakeholders should sit together to find solutions to the problems plaguing the country. He also offered unconditional support to the government for strengthening Parliament. “If today we decide that Parliament will be the hub of power and all decisions will be taken here, all our problems will be resolved,” he added. He also urged the government to ask the United Nations secretary general to hold an international conference on Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the NA also passed a resolution condemning the suicide bombing at the imambargah. The resolution — tabled by PML-N lawmaker Hameed Hussain — called the attack “a direct attack on the Constitution of Pakistan, religious freedom, national security and interfaith harmony”. “This house demands that the suicide bombers, facilitators, planners and patrons involved in this incident be exposed and brought to justice,” it said. It further demanded indiscriminate action be taken against banned organisations and their networks, social media propaganda and public activities. “Effective and permanent arrangements should be made for the security of places of worship, especially mosques and imambargahs,” the resolution added. “Immediate and adequate financial assistance should be provided to the families of martyrs, while the injured should be provided with the best medical facilities,” it further demanded. The resolution further called for an effective counterterrorism strategy at the national level, which should be practically implemented by authorities. “This house reiterates its resolve that terrorism, sectarianism and hate-based violence will not be tolerated in Pakistan, and will ensure the protection of lives and property of the citizens at all costs,” it said.",

      "title_orig": "Iran says it could dilute enriched uranium if all sanctions are lifted",
      "summary_orig": "Iran could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted, its atomic chief said on Monday, one of the most direct indications so far of its position at talks with Washington. US and Iranian diplomats held talks through Omani mediators in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy, after US President Donald Trump positioned a naval flotilla in the region, raising fears of new military action. The talks follow a crackdown on anti-government demonstrations in Iran last month. Trump joined an Israeli bombing campaign last year and hit Iranian nuclear sites. He also threatened last month to intervene militarily during the protests, but ultimately held off. Washington has demanded Iran relinquish its stockpile — estimated last year by the UN nuclear agency at more than 440 kilogrammes — of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent fissile purity, a small step away from the 90pc that is considered weapons grade. The head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation, Mohammad Eslami, said on Monday: “The possibility of diluting 60pc enriched uranium … depends on whether, in return, all sanctions are lifted or not”. Eslami, whose remarks were reported by Iran’s ISNA news agency, said, however, that another proposal, sending Iran’s highly enriched uranium abroad to another country, had not been discussed at the talks with US officials. Khamenei adviser to visit Oman Ali Larijani, a close adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and secretary of its national security council, will visit Oman on Tuesday following the US-Iranian talks there, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. “During this trip, (Larijani) will meet with high-ranking officials of the Sultanate of Oman and discuss the latest regional and international developments and bilateral cooperation at various levels,” Tasnim said. The date and venue of the next round of talks have yet to be announced. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Monday that a new round of talks would be “an appropriate opportunity for a fair and balanced resolution of this case,” and that a desired outcome could be reached if the US avoids maximalist positions and respects its commitments. Iran would continue to demand the lifting of sanctions and insist on its nuclear rights, including enrichment, he said. Iran and the US held five rounds of talks last year on curbing Tehran’s nuclear programme, with the process breaking down mainly due to disputes over uranium enrichment inside Iran. Since Trump struck Iran’s facilities, Tehran has said it has halted enrichment activity. It has always said its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes. The United States wants to include Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal in negotiations, but Tehran has ruled this out. In a televised statement aired on Monday, Khamenei called on Iranians to participate in the coming anniversary of the 1979 revolution. “The presence of the people in the march and their expression of loyalty to the Islamic Republic will cause the enemy to stop coveting Iran,” Khamenei said.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Data from hospitals showed that the death toll of the suicide attack on an imambargah in Islamabad reached 38 on Monday. Speaking in the National Assembly, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that 33 people were killed in the attack while more than 150 were injured. However, hospital records show that the toll has increased. On the day of the incident, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) spokesperson Dr Aneeza Jalil said that 28 dead bodies were brought to the hospital. On the other hand, Polyclinic said that four dead bodies were brought to the hospital, which added up to 32 deaths, as reported by the media. A day later, on Saturday, the Pims Spokesperson confirmed that a patient had died. The same day, it was also learnt that some of the injured were shifted to the HBS Institute of Healthcare and Allied Health Sciences, out of which three had died. The hospital’s representative, Dr Riaz Janjua, told Dawn that three deaths were reported at his hospital. He informed that as many as 67 injured were brought to the medical facility. Therefore, with the addition of three deaths at the private hospital, the death toll reached 36. On Monday, two more deaths were confirmed; one of the injured died at Polyclinic while another, who was shifted from Pims to a private hospital, also breathed his last, taking the toll to 38. Moreover, a document from Polyclinic shows that five deaths involving the incident have been recorded so far, with the first four being on Friday and the latest on Monday. The document also showed that seven patients were in critical condition and one was on the ventilator. According to the Pims spokesperson, 40 of those injured were still being treated at the hospital. Out of these, seven were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). She said that 29 deaths had been recorded at the hospital so far. Friday’s suicide blast at the Tarlai Imambargah was the second major terrorist attack in the federal capital in less than three months despite heightened security measures adopted by the police and the capital administration. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday said that four facilitators behind the incident, including the mastermind, had been arrested, saying the suspects were detained in overnight raids in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",
