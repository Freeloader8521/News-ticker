      "title_orig": "‘Who do you think you are?’: DG ISPR lashes out at Imran Khan’s ‘anti-army rhetoric’",
      "summary_orig": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Friday assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”. At the beginning of his press conference in Rawalpindi, he talked about a “creeping national security threat” that had become necessary for the military to address. “That threat emanates from a delusional mindset of a delusional person who has become captive to his own ego, thinking that his wishes are bigger than those of the state of Pakistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, in an apparent reference to incarcerated PTI founder, Imran Khan. “His ego, his wishes, and frustrations have grown to such an extent that he thinks that the world would cease to exist without him.” The DG ISPR added that it would be “a bit strange to see it coming from me, but the narrative that person is pushing is no more about politics now but has become a matter of national security.” According to Lt Gen Chaudhry, it was “very important” for the military’s media wing to clarify, remove all ambiguities and doubts, and say what needs to be said. “We need to understand how this narrative is working, and unfortunately, how it is working in deep collusion with external actors.” He continued: “To understand that, first, I will set the stage by repeating something that the armed forces have been saying again and again, that we are the armed forces of Pakistan, we don’t represent any ethnicity, don’t represent any language, religious inclination, political thought or school of thought. We have people from all areas of Pakistan, all religions, all sects, all languages, and all political views, but we put all that aside once we wear this uniform. “That is our pride, that is our honour; we strive, we die daily not for some language, area or political viewpoint. We strive and die on a daily basis for the people of Pakistan, for the integrity of Pakistan. And that we say very clearly, and we also don’t come from the elite class of Pakistan, we belong to the middle, lower-middle, and the poor socio-economic classes; we do not carry the flag of any political actor, class or elitism; This is your armed forces, and we are absolutely clear about the character of the armed forces of Pakistan, starting from a soldier all the way up to his field marshal,” he said. The DG ISPR added that if someone attacked the armed forces and its leadership for the sake of their ego, delusional mindset and narcissistic way of thinking, “then we will also come and fight bare-knuckle, there should be no doubt about that,” he said. “That is why we request again and again, you must be doing your politics. We respect all political parties and personalities, but please keep your politics away from the armed forces of Pakistan; don’t drag us into it. We don’t want to be part of your politics. That is why we need to communicate a few things clearly.” Lt Gen Chaudhry then pointed out ways in which Imran’s rhetoric was harming the armed forces. “First, no one can be allowed to create fissures between the people and the armed forces of Pakistan. Why? Because this is the only armed force that you have. You don’t have a choice; this country doesn’t have any other armed forces. You can have an opinion or observation about the forces, and if that could be a constructive observation or criticism, you are most welcome to do that. But that doesn’t allow you to instigate or provoke the people of Pakistan against the army and try to create a gap between the two.” He said that it was the armed forces that were standing between the Hindutva mindset in India and their hegemonic design, and the people of Pakistan. “It is these armed forces that are standing between the khawarij , terrorists, fitna al-khawarij , fitna al-Hindustan operating from Afghanistan and the people, and we also know for a fact that every country has an army. It is a famous saying that there will always be an army in a country, but if it is not yours, it will be your enemy’s. So, the one who attacks their own army and its leadership, is he trying to create space for someone else’s army? What is his design? Why is he trying to do that? “We are clear, and the people of Pakistan are clear that this cannot happen, because they understand, we understand, that you can fool some of the people all the time,” he said. Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said that whenever someone meets “this person”, he keeps aside the law, Constitution and rules and plays the narrative against the state of Pakistan, especially the armed forces of Pakistan and its leadership. “Tell me, under which law, rules and Constitution can this be allowed? Which politics in Pakistan allows you to go and meet a convict, and a narrative is continuously built from there against their own country’s armed forces? Which constitutional provision allows this?” Lt Gen Chaudhry questioned, referring to PTI’s demand to allow them to meet Imran at Adiala Jail, where he’s been imprisoned since 2023. “You talk about Article 17 of the Constitution and freedom of expression, it clearly says that freedom of expression and political activity are permitted, subject to reasonable restrictions. Under reasonable restrictions, nothing can be allowed that will be against the security and integrity of the state. “Article 19 says freedom of expression is allowed, it absolutely is, but such freedom of expression cannot be allowed that goes against the security, integrity and defence of Pakistan. Is it written [in the Constitution] or not? So, under which law, constitution, or rules, when you meet a convict, he spins a narrative against the army and its leadership? This is beyond our understanding.” Citing some examples, the DG ISPR recalled how Imran had been “spinning this narrative by trying to stop remittances to Pakistan so that the country defaults.” “He then writes a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), asking it not to enter into any agreement with the country so that the state could default. He then resorts to civil disobedience, doesn’t pay electricity bills, so that anarchy is spread in the country. Let me give you another example from a few days ago: He (Imran) tells his followers to target the leadership of the army — the army which stood against an economy and an armed forces eight times bigger than it during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and Marka-i-Haq. And doing so, they gained respect for the nation.” He then questioned who would actually benefit from such a narrative, adding that anyone living in Pakistan could not have such an agenda against the country. “That agenda can only come from someone in Delhi. Someone sitting there and guiding that — who wishes that this army, which is your armour against kharjis and terrorists, sacrificing their lives — stops doing it. This agenda and narrative cannot come from elsewhere,” he said. It is also worth mentioning that while he did not mention Imran’s name throughout the presser, he showed a video clip containing Imran’s anti-army tweets to prove his point. Pointing out to certain social media accounts, the DG ISPR asked, “From where are these accounts run? No one knows. And when the party [PTI] is asked about where the accounts are run from, they say they don’t know it either, but they completely own the narrative that is being spread through these accounts.” Calling Imran a “mental patient”, the DG ISPR recalled how a tweet was posted on Imran’s X account two days ago, which went viral within minutes. “A lot of unnamed, troll accounts are involved in making the post viral. These accounts are being operated from outside Pakistan. They carry forward this narrative, but they originate from this mental patient’s post”. He said that the Indian media and the accounts linked to the Indian-intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were making the posts viral. “The Indian media is reporting against your army chief with such happiness. Who is providing this narrative to them? They air this narrative for hours. Why are they spending so much money on spreading the narrative of this delusional mindset of this narcissist? There is one reason, because he is speaking against the army and its chief. He is talking about creating a rift between the Pakistani army and the public.” The head of the military’s media wing added that Afghan social media, being “facilitators of the khawarij”, was also involved in spreading Imran’s anti-army rhetoric. “Why wouldn’t they do it? Because someone here is saying things about the Pakistan army and its leadership, then why will they not do it? They all operate simultaneously, and then the international media picks up such news, too. It is a collusion because they have the same purpose and the same enemy, i.e. the Pakistan Army and its leadership.” Referring to Imran’s harsh comments against PTI members who attended a function at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad and terming them as traitors, the DG ISPR said: “By that logic, he is also saying that anyone in the ISPR and army is also a traitor, because they too went to NDU, he believes anyone who even is linked [to the army] is a traitor.” Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said: “I will again repeat that you can fool some of the people all the time, you can fool all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.” He said the time had come “for an end” to the PTI’s “political trickery”. The military spokesperson also slammed the persistent speculation over the issue of the notification for the chief of defence forces and questioned the “obsession” with the army. He questioned why the PTI continued to talk about the army instead of the governance of its government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and its performance against terrorism. “Please grow up. Talk about real issues.” The military spokesperson also criticised the PTI for its policy and stance on the issues of terrorism, Afghanistan and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. “Tell me, can the state’s security be sublet? Is appeasement a security policy?” The DG ISPR quipped that if Kabul or New Delhi would be the ones to ensure Pakistan’s security. “The world knows that security is only granted by standing tall against the evil, the aggressor, there is no other way … had appeasement granted security, Libya and Gaza wouldn’t be in the situation that they are in today. “We know that without this state, we neither have any identity, nor any worth, nor any politics, that is why we are ready to sacrifice our lives every day, because we are absolutely clear “Similarly, we are also clear that anyone’s person and politics cannot be above the state for us.” The DG ISPR also wondered why the PTI and its founder called for talks with terrorists. “Firstly, he is a mental patient. Apart from that, there are two more reasons. One, there is a terror crime nexus … there is political patronage and terrorists provide them with protection. The terrorists act against law enforcers, FC personnel, security forces and anyone who stands against them. There is a huge economic interest and there is a political reason also … the only story that comes out of KP is security … there is a narrative of the army being behind terrorism so that no one questions them about governance in the province where they have been in power for the past 12-13 years.” He said even more could be found if one looked for them. “It is clear to us that what is happening, why it is happening and why it is being carried out. We need to tell that this business of lies and deception will not continue anymore in Pakistan. This cannot be allowed.” DG Chaudhry said that if anyone thought their person and politics were bigger than the country’s security, they would be wrong to do so. “The Pakistan Army is standing and will keep on standing. We are not going anywhere. We have taken an oath for the protection of this state.” The military spokesperson also criticised the KP chief minister and said no one talked about the province’s governance from the PTI but kept focusing on the army. “If the barking dog barks, don’t pay attention to it.” Questioned about a ban on the PTI, the military spokesperson said: “The state is above the army. It is all wise. It is their decision. What they do and why they do. You need to ask them. … We are not politicians … the state has much more vision and clarity.” The DG ISPR was also asked about the imposition of governor’s rule in KP and said it had nothing to do with the army, adding that the government had to decide on the matter. He said it was for the government, Parliament and all stakeholders to decide the future course of the province. Headquarters of chief of defence forces The DG ISPR congratulated the nation on the chief of defence forces (CDF) headquarters beginning its work today, stating that it was one of the most important steps towards providing the requisite synergy and jointness for military operations in the country. “This was debated a lot in the media, and we understand that the character of warfare has changed — now there are multidomain operations taking place. It’s no more just land, sea and air; it’s in space, it’s in cyberspace, it is the informational domain, it’s intelligence-based, and war is fought in multiple domains,” he told reporters. “The wars have become violent, short and intense, so to get efficiency, efficacy and economy of effort in that, the CDF headquarters was a long-awaited essential requirement, and it’s not only in Pakistan, but there are more than a dozen countries, almost more than 70 countries, where synergetic headquarters of the chief of defence are available,” he said. The chief of the military’s media wing added that the CDF headquarters had been established on the directives and orders of the parliament; therefore, it was a “monumental and great day for the national security of Pakistan”.",

At the beginning of his press conference in Rawalpindi, he talked about a “creeping national security threat” that had become necessary for the military to address. “That threat emanates from a delusional mindset of a delusional person who has become captive to his own ego, thinking that his wishes are bigger than those of the state of Pakistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, in an apparent reference to incarcerated PTI founder, Imran Khan. “His ego, his wishes, and frustrations have grown to such an extent that he thinks that the world would cease to exist without him.” The DG ISPR added that it would be “a bit strange to see it coming from me, but the narrative that person is pushing is no more about politics now but has become a matter of national security.” According to Lt Gen Chaudhry, it was “very important” for the military’s media wing to clarify, remove all ambiguities and doubts, and say what needs to be said. “We need to understand how this narrative is working, and unfortunately, how it is working in deep collusion with external actors.” He continued: “To understand that, first, I will set the stage by repeating something that the armed forces have been saying again and again, that we are the armed forces of Pakistan, we don’t represent any ethnicity, don’t represent any language, religious inclination, political thought or school of thought. We have people from all areas of Pakistan, all religions, all sects, all languages, and all political views, but we put all that aside once we wear this uniform. “That is our pride, that is our honour; we strive, we die daily not for some language, area or political viewpoint. We strive and die on a daily basis for the people of Pakistan, for the integrity of Pakistan. And that we say very clearly, and we also don’t come from the elite class of Pakistan, we belong to the middle, lower-middle, and the poor socio-economic classes; we do not carry the flag of any political actor, class or elitism; This is your armed forces, and we are absolutely clear about the character of the armed forces of Pakistan, starting from a soldier all the way up to his field marshal,” he said. The DG ISPR added that if someone attacked the armed forces and its leadership for the sake of their ego, delusional mindset and narcissistic way of thinking, “then we will also come and fight bare-knuckle, there should be no doubt about that,” he said. “That is why we request again and again, you must be doing your politics. We respect all political parties and personalities, but please keep your politics away from the armed forces of Pakistan; don’t drag us into it. We don’t want to be part of your politics. That is why we need to communicate a few things clearly.” Lt Gen Chaudhry then pointed out ways in which Imran’s rhetoric was harming the armed forces. “First, no one can be allowed to create fissures between the people and the armed forces of Pakistan. Why? Because this is the only armed force that you have. You don’t have a choice; this country doesn’t have any other armed forces. You can have an opinion or observation about the forces, and if that could be a constructive observation or criticism, you are most welcome to do that. But that doesn’t allow you to instigate or provoke the people of Pakistan against the army and try to create a gap between the two.” He said that it was the armed forces that were standing between the Hindutva mindset in India and their hegemonic design, and the people of Pakistan. “It is these armed forces that are standing between the khawarij , terrorists, fitna al-khawarij , fitna al-Hindustan operating from Afghanistan and the people, and we also know for a fact that every country has an army. It is a famous saying that there will always be an army in a country, but if it is not yours, it will be your enemy’s. So, the one who attacks their own army and its leadership, is he trying to create space for someone else’s army? What is his design? Why is he trying to do that? “We are clear, and the people of Pakistan are clear that this cannot happen, because they understand, we understand, that you can fool some of the people all the time,” he said. Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said that whenever someone meets “this person”, he keeps aside the law, Constitution and rules and plays the narrative against the state of Pakistan, especially the armed forces of Pakistan and its leadership. “Tell me, under which law, rules and Constitution can this be allowed? Which politics in Pakistan allows you to go and meet a convict, and a narrative is continuously built from there against their own country’s armed forces? Which constitutional provision allows this?” Lt Gen Chaudhry questioned, referring to PTI’s demand to allow them to meet Imran at Adiala Jail, where he’s been imprisoned since 2023. “You talk about Article 17 of the Constitution and freedom of expression, it clearly says that freedom of expression and political activity are permitted, subject to reasonable restrictions. Under reasonable restrictions, nothing can be allowed that will be against the security and integrity of the state. “Article 19 says freedom of expression is allowed, it absolutely is, but such freedom of expression cannot be allowed that goes against the security, integrity and defence of Pakistan. Is it written [in the Constitution] or not? So, under which law, constitution, or rules, when you meet a convict, he spins a narrative against the army and its leadership? This is beyond our understanding.” Citing some examples, the DG ISPR recalled how Imran had been “spinning this narrative by trying to stop remittances to Pakistan so that the country defaults.” “He then writes a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), asking it not to enter into any agreement with the country so that the state could default. He then resorts to civil disobedience, doesn’t pay electricity bills, so that anarchy is spread in the country. Let me give you another example from a few days ago: He (Imran) tells his followers to target the leadership of the army — the army which stood against an economy and an armed forces eight times bigger than it during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and Marka-i-Haq. And doing so, they gained respect for the nation.” He then questioned who would actually benefit from such a narrative, adding that anyone living in Pakistan could not have such an agenda against the country. “That agenda can only come from someone in Delhi. Someone sitting there and guiding that — who wishes that this army, which is your armour against kharjis and terrorists, sacrificing their lives — stops doing it. This agenda and narrative cannot come from elsewhere,” he said. It is also worth mentioning that while he did not mention Imran’s name throughout the presser, he showed a video clip containing Imran’s anti-army tweets to prove his point. Pointing out to certain social media accounts, the DG ISPR asked, “From where are these accounts run? No one knows. And when the party [PTI] is asked about where the accounts are run from, they say they don’t know it either, but they completely own the narrative that is being spread through these accounts.” Calling Imran a “mental patient”, the DG ISPR recalled how a tweet was posted on Imran’s X account two days ago, which went viral within minutes. “A lot of unnamed, troll accounts are involved in making the post viral. These accounts are being operated from outside Pakistan. They carry forward this narrative, but they originate from this mental patient’s post”. He said that the Indian media and the accounts linked to the Indian-intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were making the posts viral. “The Indian media is reporting against your army chief with such happiness. Who is providing this narrative to them? They air this narrative for hours. Why are they spending so much money on spreading the narrative of this delusional mindset of this narcissist? There is one reason, because he is speaking against the army and its chief. He is talking about creating a rift between the Pakistani army and the public.” The head of the military’s media wing added that Afghan social media, being “facilitators of the khawarij”, was also involved in spreading Imran’s anti-army rhetoric. “Why wouldn’t they do it? Because someone here is saying things about the Pakistan army and its leadership, then why will they not do it? They all operate simultaneously, and then the international media picks up such news, too. It is a collusion because they have the same purpose and the same enemy, i.e. the Pakistan Army and its leadership.” Referring to Imran’s harsh comments against PTI members who attended a function at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad and terming them as traitors, the DG ISPR said: “By that logic, he is also saying that anyone in the ISPR and army is also a traitor, because they too went to NDU, he believes anyone who even is linked [to the army] is a traitor.” Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said: “I will again repeat that you can fool some of the people all the time, you can fool all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.” He said the time had come “for an end” to the PTI’s “political trickery”. The military spokesperson also slammed the persistent speculation over the issue of the notification for the chief of defence forces and questioned the “obsession” with the army. He questioned why the PTI continued to talk about the army instead of the governance of its government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and its performance against terrorism. “Please grow up. Talk about real issues.” The military spokesperson also criticised the PTI for its policy and stance on the issues of terrorism, Afghanistan and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. “Tell me, can the state’s security be sublet? Is appeasement a security policy?” The DG ISPR quipped that if Kabul or New Delhi would be the ones to ensure Pakistan’s security. “The world knows that security is only granted by standing tall against the evil, the aggressor, there is no other way … had appeasement granted security, Libya and Gaza wouldn’t be in the situation that they are in today. “We know that without this state, we neither have any identity, nor any worth, nor any politics, that is why we are ready to sacrifice our lives every day, because we are absolutely clear “Similarly, we are also clear that anyone’s person and politics cannot be above the state for us.” The DG ISPR also wondered why the PTI and its founder called for talks with terrorists. “Firstly, he is a mental patient. Apart from that, there are two more reasons. One, there is a terror crime nexus … there is political patronage and terrorists provide them with protection. The terrorists act against law enforcers, FC personnel, security forces and anyone who stands against them. There is a huge economic interest and there is a political reason also … the only story that comes out of KP is security … there is a narrative of the army being behind terrorism so that no one questions them about governance in the province where they have been in power for the past 12-13 years.” He said even more could be found if one looked for them. “It is clear to us that what is happening, why it is happening and why it is being carried out. We need to tell that this business of lies and deception will not continue anymore in Pakistan. This cannot be allowed.” DG Chaudhry said that if anyone thought their person and politics were bigger than the country’s security, they would be wrong to do so. “The Pakistan Army is standing and will keep on standing. We are not going anywhere. We have taken an oath for the protection of this state.” The military spokesperson also criticised the KP chief minister and said no one talked about the province’s governance from the PTI but kept focusing on the army. “If the barking dog barks, don’t pay attention to it.” Questioned about a ban on the PTI, the military spokesperson said: “The state is above the army. It is all wise. It is their decision. What they do and why they do. You need to ask them. … We are not politicians … the state has much more vision and clarity.” The DG ISPR was also asked about the imposition of governor’s rule in KP and said it had nothing to do with the army, adding that the government had to decide on the matter. He said it was for the government, Parliament and all stakeholders to decide the future course of the province. Headquarters of chief of defence forces The DG ISPR congratulated the nation on the chief of defence forces (CDF) headquarters beginning its work today, stating that it was one of the most important steps towards providing the requisite synergy and jointness for military operations in the country. “This was debated a lot in the media, and we understand that the character of warfare has changed — now there are multidomain operations taking place. It’s no more just land, sea and air; it’s in space, it’s in cyberspace, it is the informational domain, it’s intelligence-based, and war is fought in multiple domains,” he told reporters. “The wars have become violent, short and intense, so to get efficiency, efficacy and economy of effort in that, the CDF headquarters was a long-awaited essential requirement, and it’s not only in Pakistan, but there are more than a dozen countries, almost more than 70 countries, where synergetic headquarters of the chief of defence are available,” he said. The chief of the military’s media wing added that the CDF headquarters had been established on the directives and orders of the parliament; therefore, it was a “monumental and great day for the national security of Pakistan”.",

      "summary_orig": "Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi began summit talks in New Delhi on Friday, as New Delhi rolled out the red carpet for the Russian leader and Modi told him India supported peace efforts in Ukraine. Putin is on his first visit to India in four years, aiming to boost trade with the top buyer of Russia’s arms and seaborne oil as Western sanctions squeeze their decades-old ties. The visit comes at a time when New Delhi is engaged in talks with the US for a trade deal to cut punitive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on its goods over India’s Russian oil purchases. Moscow has been India’s top arms supplier for decades and has said that it wants to import more Indian goods in an effort to grow trade to $100 billion by 2030, which so far has been skewed in its favour due to New Delhi’s energy imports. Since European countries cut their reliance on Russian energy after Russia invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago, India ramped up its purchases of discounted Russian crude, only to reduce them under pressure from US tariffs and sanctions this year. Putin proposes ‘uninterrupted’ oil supply Putin said he was ready to continue “uninterrupted shipments” of fuel to India, as New Delhi faces heavy US pressure to stop buying oil from Moscow. Trump imposed punishing 50 per cent tariffs on most Indian products in August, citing New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil; revenue, Washington argues, helps fund the war in Ukraine. Modi thanked the Russian leader for his “unwavering commitment towards India”. “Russia is a reliable supplier of oil, gas, coal, and everything that is required for the development of India’s energy,” Putin told Modi after talks. “We are ready to continue uninterrupted shipments of fuel for the fast-growing Indian economy,” he added, according to an official translator. Modi said that “energy security has been a strong and important pillar of the India-Russia partnership”, and while he referenced nuclear power, he made no specific reference to oil. India emerged as a major buyer of Russian oil after the start of the Ukraine war, providing Moscow with a crucial export market as Europe sharply reduced purchases. In 2024, Russia supplied nearly 36pc of India’s total crude imports, around 1.8 million barrels of discounted oil per day. New Delhi recently reduced Russian crude imports under pressure. Efforts to end Ukraine conflict “India is not neutral. India has a position, and that position is for peace,” Modi told Putin as they opened their talks. “We support every effort for peace, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with every initiative taken for peace.” Putin, in response, thanked Modi for his attention and efforts aimed at resolving the conflict. “We had the opportunity — and you gave me that opportunity — to speak in detail about what is happening on the Ukrainian track and about the steps we are taking jointly with some other partners, including the United States, toward a possible peaceful settlement of this crisis,” Putin said. “As our countries and economies grow, the opportunities for cooperation expand,” Putin said. “New areas are emerging — high technologies, joint work in aviation, space, and artificial intelligence. We have a very trusting relationship in the field of military-technical cooperation, and we intend to move forward in all these areas.” 21-gun salute welcome Putin landed in Delhi on Thursday to a warm welcome from Modi, who greeted him with an embrace on the tarmac of the airport. The two men then travelled together in the same vehicle for a private dinner hosted by Modi. On Friday, Putin was given a ceremonial welcome on the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, the colonial-era presidential palace, with a 21-gun salute as his convoy drove in. The two sides are expected to announce a raft of deals at the end of formal talks. Indian firms are expected to sign an agreement with Uralchem group, Russia’s top potash and ammonium nitrate producer, to jointly set up a urea plant in Russia, Reuters reported on Thursday. Russian lenders Gazprombank (GZPRI.MM) and Alfa Bank have also sought approval to begin operating in India to help Moscow boost its trade with India, Reuters reported. Putin Challenges Washington Modi and Putin are also expected to discuss topics including labour and civil nuclear energy. A large business and government delegation has accompanied Putin for the visit, including Defence Minister Andrei Belousov who held talks with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh on Thursday. Belousov stated that “the Russian defence industry is ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in the field of defence production,” India’s defence ministry said after the talks. In an interview with broadcaster India Today that was aired late on Thursday, Putin challenged US pressure on India not to buy Russian fuel when the US could purchase Russian nuclear fuel. “If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn’t India have the same privilege? This question deserves thorough examination, and we stand ready to discuss it, including with President Trump,” Putin said. He also said that while there was a minor dip in India-Russia trade during the first nine months of this year, energy trade was “running smoothly”. India has said Trump’s tariffs are unjustified and unreasonable and pointed at ongoing US trade with Moscow. The US and European Union continue to import billions of dollars’ worth of Russian energy and commodities, ranging from liquefied natural gas to enriched uranium. ‘India’s Conundrum’ Putin arrived in India a day after holding talks with Trump’s top envoys on a possible peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, but they did not reach a compromise. India has resisted condemning Russia over the war and called for peace through dialogue and diplomacy, while saying that its ties with Moscow were being unfairly targeted by Western nations that it said continued to do business with Moscow when it was in their interest. “India faces a conundrum; by taking steps to strengthen ties with Moscow or Washington, New Delhi risks setting back ties with the other,” Michael Kugelman, senior fellow at Washington’s Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this week.",

When Awami National Party (ANP) chief Aimal Wali Khan asked as to who these “national heroes” were, Mr Nasar replied that they included former premiers Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto, and Nawaz Sharif; nuclear scientist Dr A. Q. Khan; and all those who signed the 1973 Constitution. “A handful of elements cannot hold the House hostage,” he said before abruptly adjourning the House to meet again on Friday (today). Minutes earlier, Mr Nasar said he needed a minute to say something crucial and had assured a senator, who wanted to speak on a point of public importance, that he would be given time. The Senate deputy chairman said maintaining dignity of the House was a shared responsibility and it was the chair’s job to run it in accordance with the rules. He added that the chair had the power to issue a strict order for the sake of decorum of the House. “This also includes the power under Rule 246 to suspend a member obstructing proceedings of the House,” he continued. Mr Nasar recalled that he had given a ruling to this effect on Feb 18 as well but regretted that certain members from the opposition benches were continuously disrupting proceedings of the House. He warned that he would not refrain from taking extreme steps to smoothly run the proceedings, if the unruly conduct continued. Without naming the PTI, the deputy chairman said he would write a letter to the parliamentary leader of the party, seeking instructions for their members to act as per law and the rules. He expressed alarm over the practice of members gathering around the chair’s podium. Mr Nasar stressed that the chair and its rulings must be respected. The Senate deputy chairman, who stressed the need for running the proceedings as per the law and the rules, surprised many during the Question Hour, by punishing an opposition lawmaker for pointing out the quorum. Prohibiting the opposition senator who had pointed out the quorum from participating in the session, Mr Nasar said: “This is my ruling”. However, the ruling was seen by many as something against the rules provide and an established parliamentary practice. Govt negligence Earlier, during the Question Hour, PPP Senator Shahadat Awan regretted the delay in disbursement of postal life insurance claims to around 34,000 individuals including widows and orphans, terming it a failure on the part of the government his party was allied with. Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan candidly conceded that it was indeed the government’s incompetence and “negligence” that disbursement under the Postal Life Insurance Company Limited (PLICL) could not be delivered to the people on time. The minister also agreed with Mr Awan that as per the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, the PLICL was liable to pay liquidated damages for delays beyond 90 days, calculated at monthly base with a 5 per cent additional rate over the prevailing base rate. “This escalating financial exposure underscores the immediate need for additional budgetary allocation,” the minister noted, holding the finance ministry responsible for it.

      "summary_orig": "Air travel across India was in turmoil for a fourth day on Friday after IndiGo cancelled around 500 flights, including all departures from New Delhi, prompting the government to announce special relief measures for the country’s largest airline. In a bid to improve air travel safety, Indian authorities have introduced new stricter regulations limiting pilot flying times and placing tighter restrictions on their operation of night-time flights. But IndiGo admitted it failed to plan properly ahead of a November 1 deadline for the measures’ introduction. And with air travel now approaching its December peak, that has forced widespread flight cancellations this week, which have stranded thousands of travellers. On Friday, the airline, which accounts for over 60 per cent of domestic air travel in the world’s most populous nation, apologised to its customers. “These last few days, we have [had] a serious operational crisis,” it said in a statement. “While this will not get resolved overnight, we assure you we will do everything in our capacity to help you in the meantime.” Following a request by IndiGo, India’s civil aviation authorities granted it a temporary exemption from some of the new rules on Friday to help it deal with the crisis. IndiGo had earlier flagged that it did not expect to fully restore operations until February 10, though on Friday it said there should be “progressive improvement” from Saturday. Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules. Hundreds of flights cancelled, passengers vent anger On Friday, Delhi airport announced all IndiGo departures were cancelled for the day, a number that a source put at 235 flights. Chennai airport also announced all departing IndiGo flights were cancelled. The airline cancelled 165 flights in Mumbai, 102 in Bengaluru, 92 in Hyderabad, airport sources, who declined to be named, said. Other major metro airports saw IndiGo flights up to 6pm (5:30pm PKT) cancelled on Friday. A boy cries as he waits with his family outside the Indigo airlines ticketing counter at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, after several IndiGo airlines flights were cancelled, in Mumbai, India on December 5. — Reuters At many airports across the country, crowds of stranded passengers voiced their frustrations, aggressively arguing with staff. Social media platforms and local media were flooded with videos of angry travellers. “Down with IndiGo! Down with IndiGo!” a group of passengers at Bengaluru airport shouted in protest, a video post on X showed. Another video showed a father shouting at IndiGo crew members, demanding a sanitary pad for his daughter. A post on X from earlier Friday morning showed dozens of young children sitting inside a Delhi airport terminal. “Kids waiting since 4am for their IndiGo (flight) … hungry, tired, sleepy,” read the post’s caption. IndiGo receives exemptions from new pilot duty rules Shares of IndiGo dropped nearly 3pc on Friday, taking their weekly slump to 10.3%. India’s main opposition party has demanded a discussion on the issue in parliament. The new pilot duty rules mandate that pilots can only make two night-time landings per week, down from six previously. That provision was put on hold for IndiGo until February 10 by India’s civil aviation regulator. The airline was also temporarily exempted from a rule specifying maximum flight duty periods for pilots doing some night flying. IndiGo said it will offer waivers on all cancellations and booking changes for travel between December 5 and December 15. The airline has also arranged ground transportation and thousands of hotel rooms for stranded customers, it said.",

      "summary_orig": "All government departments would be held responsible and held accountable if any citizen fell in a manhole, said Minister of Local Government and Housing Town Planning Nasir Hussain Shah while speaking to the media in Sukkur. The body of the boy, who drowned in an open manhole near Nipa in Gulshan-i-Iqbal on Sunday night, was found on Monday, around 15 hours after the incident occurred. The child’s tragic death, particularly the lack of cooperation from relevant civic agencies to launch an immediate search, had angered relatives and area residents, who staged a protest on University Road on Sunday night and again during the day on Monday. “All government departments, including KMC, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, as well as the administration, including police, deputy commissioner and assistant commissioners of relevant areas, would be responsible, if such kind of incidents happen again,” the minister said, adding that no excuses from officials would be entertained. Hussain maintained that the orders were applicable across Sindh. Referring to the unfortunate incident, the minister said, “Such an unfortunate incident can happen to anyone.” Addressing the issue, he said the government was making efforts to “over manholes”, but they were being “removed” as shown in multiple “videos circulating on social media”. On Tuesday, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials. A post by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation on X on Wednesday night said the mayor visited the boy’s family and extended his condolences. “An impartial inquiry will be conducted, and anyone found negligent will face action. We will take structured measures to prevent such incidents in the future,” the post quoted the mayor as saying. A district court issued notices to the Karachi mayor, managing director of the KWSC, the Gulshan Town chairman, and the Red Line contractor on an application seeking the registration of a case against them over their alleged negligence in the tragic death. The applicant submitted that the incident demonstrated blatant failure of local authorities and emergency services. He also argued that the tragic death of the child was not an isolated incident, as at least 23 people had lost their lives in Karachi in 2025 due to falling into open manholes.",

      "summary_orig": "Cloudflare, a content delivery network (CDN) and domain name server (DNS) service, said on Friday it had fixed an issue with its dashboard related Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The outage had sent shares down 4.5 per cent in premarket trading. In updates posted on its status page, the company said it was investigating issues with Cloudflare Dashboard and related APIs. Minutes later, it said a fix had been implemented and it was monitoring the results. On 9:20 UTC, it said the incident had been resolved. Detailing the incident, Cloudflare said: “A change made to how Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall parses requests caused Cloudflare’s network to be unavailable for several minutes this morning.” The company clarified that “this was not an attack; the change was deployed by our team to help mitigate the industry-wide vulnerability disclosed this week in React Server Components.” Canva, an online graphic design tool, in a post on X, initially informed its users that the issues were impacting its services. “Our CDN, Cloudflare, is experiencing an outage that’s impacting Canva,” it said, adding that it was working with the company to get things back up and running. The post was later deleted. Once the fix was implemented, Canva said its platform was functional again. Meanwhile, users of social media platform X also complained about their inability to access several websites. Cloudflare runs one of the world’s largest networks that helps websites and apps load faster and stay online by protecting them from traffic surges and cyberattacks. Last month, Cloudflare experienced a global outage that affected access to web services worldwide. In October, an outage of Amazon’s cloud service had caused global turmoil as thousands of popular websites and apps, including Snapchat and Reddit, were inaccessible due to the disruption.",

The outage had sent shares down 4.5 per cent in premarket trading. In updates posted on its status page, the company said it was investigating issues with Cloudflare Dashboard and related APIs. Minutes later, it said a fix had been implemented and it was monitoring the results. On 9:20 UTC, it said the incident had been resolved. Detailing the incident, Cloudflare said: “A change made to how Cloudflare’s Web Application Firewall parses requests caused Cloudflare’s network to be unavailable for several minutes this morning.” The company clarified that “this was not an attack; the change was deployed by our team to help mitigate the industry-wide vulnerability disclosed this week in React Server Components.” Canva, an online graphic design tool, in a post on X, initially informed its users that the issues were impacting its services. “Our CDN, Cloudflare, is experiencing an outage that’s impacting Canva,” it said, adding that it was working with the company to get things back up and running. The post was later deleted. Once the fix was implemented, Canva said its platform was functional again. Meanwhile, users of social media platform X also complained about their inability to access several websites. Cloudflare runs one of the world’s largest networks that helps websites and apps load faster and stay online by protecting them from traffic surges and cyberattacks. Last month, Cloudflare experienced a global outage that affected access to web services worldwide. In October, an outage of Amazon’s cloud service had caused global turmoil as thousands of popular websites and apps, including Snapchat and Reddit, were inaccessible due to the disruption.",

Journalist Zofeen Ebrahim was also barred from attending the press conference, which was eventually held at the KPC.

The HRCP urges the authorities to respect all people’s access to civic spaces and investigate the alleged police misconduct,” the commission said. While the authorities refused to give any official account of yesterday’s incident, a police officer who wished not to be named, said that “extreme vigilance and heightened security measures” had been put in place in the Red Zone, particularly around the KPC, because of security concerns. The officer said there was a “terrorist threat” and that security had therefore been tightened. The officer denied the arrest of any woman activist.",

This time, however, the alarm was amplified, since the campaign focused on girls aged 9 to 14, leading to concerns and questions about its impact on fertility and reproductive health. The HPV vaccine drive’s initial campaign was planned from September 15-27, 2025, but was later extended to October 1. It aimed to immunise 13 million girls aged 9-14 across Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the federal capital Islamabad. In the drive, the vaccine — which has a retail price of Rs7,500 — is being provided free of charge through a partnership between the government of Pakistan, the World Health Organisation and vaccine alliance GAVI. While vaccinators and public health experts expected resistance, the rate of refusal was shockingly high. On September 24, the state minister for national health revealed that only 34 percent — around 4.5 million girls — had been vaccinated. The misinformation around the HPV vaccine was so great that it threatened an entire campaign. It was yet another demonstration of how viral online lies can have deadly consequences A few days earlier, federal health minister Mustafa Kamal had his own daughter vaccinated in front of the press. “The refusal rate was extremely high in the first few days,” Kamal tells Eos. “I realised that the best way to allay parents’ concerns was to get my daughter inoculated,” he adds. Kamal says that it worked, with coverage improving drastically during the remainder of the campaign. By the end of the campaign, nine million girls had received the shot. But that number could have been higher, if not for the many disinformation campaigns that amplified suspicion and mistrust. THE DISINFORMATION ECHO CHAMBER A video on a YouTube channel, called Eon Podcast Reloaded with 176,000 followers, claimed that HPV only affects those with multiple sexual partners and its vaccine causes infertility. The host in the clip, Amanullah Tariq, tied HPV with promiscuity, calling for that to be stopped instead of vaccines to be administered. In the video, Tariq claims, “as a fact that can be Googled”, that the vaccine’s introduction in India led to the death of 125 girls. A 2010 HPV vaccine pilot in India targeting 30,000 girls was indeed suspended after seven girls died, but an Indian government investigation revealed that none of the deaths were caused by the vaccine. The podcast has since been removed from the YouTube channel, but snippets remain available online. Tariq claims he is unaware if the video was removed or deleted due to a YouTube strike. The podcaster, who continues to host high-profile guests, also doubled down on his opinions, asserting that he has the right to them, even if they are based on misinformation. Misinformation also spread through viral videos, including one which has 350,000 views on one post on X (formerly Twitter). It shows schoolgirls fainting, with the caption claiming it was the after-effect of the HPV vaccine. This is just one metric for a video that has been shared multiple times and across platforms, including WhatsApp groups. By the time fact checkers revealed that the claim was fake and the video was from a different event, the damage had already been done. These are only two examples from an ever-expanding digital universe powered by clicks and views — easiest to acquire through fearmongering — that adversely impacts individuals and families. One such example is Bushra, a schoolteacher in Islamabad, who convinced her sister not to get her niece vaccinated, as she was suspicious of the government. “It could be that Pakistan’s rapidly growing population might have pushed the government to accept an IMF condition to make girls infertile,” she tells Eos. UNDERSTANDING VACCINE MISINFORMATION “Whenever vaccines are free or mandatory, people start questioning intentions,” says Dr Naeem Majeed, a public health professional based in Karachi. “Anti-vaxxer movements exist worldwide and have grown stronger with increased online polarisation,” he tells Eos. Within Muslim-majority countries, Dr Majeed continues, there is a recurring fear that vaccines, especially those targeted at women and girls, will interfere with fertility or family planning. “This perception resurfaces every few years, even though it has no basis in science.” The HPV vaccine, however, had an added layer of controversy from the start because it targeted adolescent girls. Many young girls themselves began asking why boys were not receiving the vaccine, as misinformation online often framed HPV as exclusively linked to female sexual behaviour. “Parents dislike the implication that the HPV vaccine is only for people who are sexually active,” Dr Majeed says. “They don’t realise that ‘sexually active’ can mean being active with a single partner later on, even a husband. It has nothing to do with promiscuity.” While HPV is transmitted through sexual contact and most infections clear naturally, certain strains can cause cervical cancer years or decades later. The vaccine prevents these cancer-causing infections, which is why it’s administered before girls become sexually active — offering protection for their future health. GENDERED DISINFORMATION Surprisingly, HPV resistance was higher in urban centres as compared to rural areas, which is the opposite of what public health campaigns usually encounter. Dr Majeed explains that this is largely because urban populations, such as Karachi, consume far more social-media content, where gendered misinformation is spreading aggressively. Rural families, by contrast, are less aware of the vaccine and its controversies, and show lower levels of organised resistance, he adds. Government restrictions around messaging, imposed due to security concerns, also prevented health workers from addressing misconceptions with full transparency. “Technical experts were not allowed to answer certain questions and that vacuum was quickly filled by online disinformation,” says Dr Majeed. Beyond misinformation, awareness itself remains low. Cervical cancer has relatively low visibility in Pakistan because most cases are detected after age 45, while the HPV vaccine is administered years earlier. “People know breast cancer,” Dr Majeed continues, “but many have never even heard of cervical cancer, so they assume it’s a new disease or something created by the state.” However, according to the Aga Khan University Hospital, cervical cancer remains a significant public health threat in Pakistan, with over 5,000 new cases and approximately 3,000 deaths reported annually in the country. Despite these challenges, the campaign managed to achieve 77 percent coverage, lower than previous drives but still higher than what many other countries achieved in their first HPV rollout. Routine HPV immunisation will now be incorporated into Pakistan’s schedule for all girls aged nine, beginning January. The campaign phase will not be repeated in the covered regions unless major outbreaks or multi-year gaps occur. However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and Gilgit-Baltistan are still pending implementation and are scheduled for campaigns in 2026 and 2027. But before rolling out the next phase, the government and health experts need to ensure that online misinformation — which has real, offline consequences — is tackled and debunked. In the case of the HPV vaccine, denying an adolescent girl access to immunisation means potentially putting her future health at risk. Parents, teachers, opinion leaders and health experts share a responsibility to exercise due diligence, verify facts and approach public health guidance with care, rather than dismissing it as a state conspiracy without evidence. Unless that happens, Bushra and many others like her, will continue to resist the vaccine, leaving out girls facing another potential challenge that could have been avoided.

      "summary_orig": "Former special assistant to the prime minister Mirza Shahzad Akbar, who currently resides in the United Kingdom (UK), was declared a proclaimed offender on Friday in a case pertaining to alleged controversial statements made on social media platform X. The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered the case against Akbar in July this year over allegedly defamatory and controversial remarks shared on his social media account. According to the court order, issued by Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Abbas Shah, the decision was taken after Akbar failed to appear before the court despite multiple summons. The order also directed the authorities concerned to issue an arrest warrant for Akbar to ensure his production before the court. The order noted that the accused did not cooperate with the investigation and remained absent during the legal proceedings. A challan in the case has already been submitted to the court. With the proclamation order now in place, law enforcement authorities are expected to intensify efforts to apprehend the former aide on accountability as the trial moves forward. Interior minister hands extradition requests to UK envoy The development comes a day after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott and he handed over the extradition papers for Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja. “The extradition papers for Akbar and Raja from the government of Pakistan were handed over [to Marriott],” a statement issued by the interior ministry said. “Both individuals are wanted in Pakistan. They should be handed over to Pakistan immediately,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. He also provided evidence against Pakistani citizens who were spreading propaganda, the statement said. “I fully believe in freedom of expression, but fake news is a problem for every country,” he said, as per the statement. “No country can allow slander and defamation against state institutions from those sitting abroad,” the minister said. Naqvi also said that Pakistan would welcome British cooperation for the return of those who “spread anti-Pakistan propaganda”. While Pakistan does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, both countries do have an agreement in place whereby London can repatriate Pakistani nationals involved in crimes and violating immigration laws.",

      "title_orig": "US lawmakers seek action over ‘acts of intimidation’ in Pakistan",
      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Forty-four Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have written to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, demanding immediate sanctions on senior Pakistani officials over what they described as an “escalating campaign of transnational repression and worsening human rights crisis in Pakistan”. The effort is led by Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Congressman Greg Casar, and includes signatures from Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, two Muslim members of the House known for their advocacy on Palestinian and other Muslim issues. In the letter, made public on Wednesday, the lawmakers called for targeted measures, including visa bans and asset freezes on officials responsible for threatening US citizens and residents who criticise Pakistan’s military establishment, as well as their family members in Pakistan. There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, or the embassy in Washington. More than 40 lawmakers write to Marco Rubio, ask for sanctions against officials involved in ‘transnational repression’ The letter emphasises the need for Washington to act against those who “weaponise state power to jail political opponents, intimidate citizens abroad, and crush democratic freedoms”, said First Pakistan Global, a rights group sympathetic to the PTI, which distributed the letter. “In recent years, US citizens and residents who have spoken out against authoritarian abuses in Pakistan have faced threats, intimidation, and harassment — often extending to their families in Pakistan. These tactics include arbitrary detentions, coercion, and retaliatory violence, targeting diaspora individuals and their relatives,” the letter stated. The lawmakers warned that Pakistan was experiencing a deepening authoritarian crisis: opposition leaders have been detained without charge, journalists intimidated or forced into exile, and ordinary citizens arrested for social media activity. Women, religious minorities, and ethnic communities — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate repression, they claimed. “This authoritarian system in Pakistan is sustained through relentless repression. Opposition leaders are held without charge, denied fair trial, and kept in indefinite pretrial detention. Independent journalists are harassed, abducted, or forced into exile. Ordinary citizens are arrested for social media posts, while women, religious minorities, and marginalised ethnic groups — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate violence and surveillance,” the letter read. The lawmakers cited specific cases, including that of Virginia-based investigative journalist Ahmad Noorani, whose brothers were allegedly abducted and held for over a month after his reporting on military corruption. They also raised concerns about the 2024 elections , noting irregularities documented by independent observation reports. The US State Department had previously expressed concern over these irregularities and called for a full investigation. The letter urged the US administration to impose measures such as Global Magnitsky sanctions, visa bans, and asset freezes against officials credibly perpetrating systematic and transnational repression. It also called for the release of former prime minister Imran Khan and other political prisoners. “Such steps would reinforce US commitment to human rights, protect American citizens from transnational repression, and promote regional stability,” the lawmakers wrote. To strengthen congressional oversight, the lawmakers submitted five detailed questions to the State Department regarding sanctions, conditions for targeted measures, and steps to protect US residents from threats directed at their families abroad. The lawmakers have requested a response from Secretary Rubio by Dec 17, 2025. Earlier this year, more than 50 lawmakers submitted another resolution in the House, named the “ Pakistan Freedom and Accountability Act ”. It sought legal sanctions against those responsible for “undermining democracy in Pakistan”. That resolution, HR 5271, is in queue for voting at the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
