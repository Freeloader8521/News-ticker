The backlash at Dongduk underscores a widening generational debate in Korea over the role of single-sex education. As the government urges universities to respond to demographic changes and shrinking enrollment, many students argue that women’s institutions remain vital spaces for cultivating female leadership and that they should not abandon their historical and social missions for financial reasons. Although students argue that the transition could still be stopped without formal approval from education authorities, the ministry appears to have limited authority over whether the change ultimately proceeds. The announcement comes about a year after students occupied and spray painted buildings on campus as part of protests to oppose the move. The education ministry noted that a separate government approval is not required for women’s universities to shift",

      "summary_orig": "TOBA TEK SINGH: The Faisalabad FIA immigration officials have offloaded 13 passengers, including three women, who were illegally traveling to Europe on the pretext of Umrah. Those who were offloaded belong to Faisalabad. An FIA spokesperson said on Saturday that all of the passengers were going to Jeddah by flight number FZ 356 from Faisalabad airport; however, they were stopped during clearance on the basis of their suspicious movements and evidence. The passengers included Hamza Ali, Zeeshan Ali, Samiullah, Shiraz Hassan, Imran Waris, Bilal Hassan, Syed Yasin Hussain, Muhammad Rizwan, Ghulam Rasool, Haq Nawaz, Faizal Bibi, Zahida Bibi and Sardaran Bibi. He said there were reports that female passengers were being used as shields to travel to Europe through Saudi Arabia from various airports on Umrah visas. During the investigation, suspicious international phone calls were detected which were made from the passengers’ mobile phones. He also added that calls from the phones of offloaded passengers were also detected which were made to an agent identified as Sajid Ali and chats were made with him related to their next illegal journey to Egypt and Libya. According to the initial investigation, the passengers stated that they were planning to travel from Libya to Europe by boat. The FIA Anti-Human Trafficking Circle has been handed over the custody of offloaded 13 passengers for investigation and legal action. Meanwhile, FIA arrested two persons for violation of Copyright Act. An official said that FIA Corporate Crime Circle team raided Sargodha Road and arrested both suspects Mazhar Ali and Arqam Ali from whom a large quantity of fake products of known registered companies were also recovered. ACCIDENT: A youth died after he was hit by a speeding car near Tin Pullian Wala Adda on Shorkot Cantonment Road on Saturday. Rescue 1122 said deceased identified as Amanullah (19) of Mauza Bhangoo was crossing the road when a car ran over him as a result he was critically injured. He was shifted to Shorkot THQ hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.The car driver sped away after the accident. SUSPENDED: Faisalabad Commissioner Raja Jehangir Anwar suspended secretary of union council No 70 of Pirmahal tehsil, Syed Zeeshan Haider, due to his failure to eliminate stray dogs in UC villages which caused rising dog-bite cases. During his visit to Pirmahal tehsil on Saturday, people complained to the commissioner that a number of children and senior citizens had been bitten by the rabid dogs. He also warned the assistant director (local government) to boost municipal services in all 17 rural UCs in the tehsil, including focussing on dog culling and sanitation. The commissioner took notice of the poor condition of the cleanliness in Pirmahal THQ hospital and asked the MS to improve cleanliness within seven days otherwise action be taken against him. He set the Dec 31 deadline for the contractor to complete the construction of trauma centre in the hospital. During the briefing, he was informed that after the completion of 20-bed trauma centre the total number of beds will increase to 50. He also directed the assistant commissioner to deploy additional janitors for cleaning the hospital and submit him report. He said the general bus stand at Pirmahal is in bad shape and its essential repairs would be done by District Council funds. The commissioner also visited the Lyallpur Museum at Faisalabad along with its Chairman Board of Governors Dr Amir Sarfraz. On this occasion, it was decided to expand the Lyallpur Museum and the commissioner said that it is necessary to display more than 5,000 artifacts already kept in stock in the museum. He sought an expansion plan from the curator of the museum and said that the facilities for visitors will be upgraded. He said that the maintenance issues in the museum should be resolved within two weeks. He visited the galleries containing the history of the region.

      "summary_orig": "THE Balochistan government’s decision to abolish the Levies force was part of a broader state strategy to “harmonise” internal security institutions in response to critical national security challenges. On similar grounds, a federal constabulary was established. This restructuring process has been ongoing on federal and provincial levels, driven by the growing difficulty faced by premier security institutions in countering ‘foreign-influenced threats’, terrorism, and violent extremism. What this process actually means for the future of law-enforcement agencies (LEAs) in Pakistan remains an open and pressing question. Will the centralisation and standardisation of security structures lead to more capable, accountable, and coordinated institutions, or will they further complicate the landscape of security governance? This is a question that will matter significantly in the coming years. A few former police officers and security experts view this harmonisation process as occurring in parallel with global trends toward modernising security institutions, enhancing investigative capacity, strengthening responses to organised crime, and adopting new technologies. Yet, Pakistan’s context remains burdened by deep structural problems, the police culture of moral policing, extortionist practices, and low public trust. These dynamics complicate any attempt at reform, raising concerns about whether organisational restructuring alone can transform entrenched attitudes and practices. In this context, when state institutions burden LEAs with national security-related tasks, particularly those related to terrorism, violent extremism, and so-called foreign-influenced threats, the logic of security governance becomes more complex. The term ‘foreign-influenced threats’ is vague, yet many among the security institutions increasingly interpret it through the lens of rising political mobilisation by movements such as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee in Balochistan, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement in KP, and the Joint Action Committees (JACs) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB). These movements are often framed by security actors as being funded or influenced by foreign forces, including diaspora networks, and therefore as presenting risks to national security. Political analysts and movement leaders reject this framing, arguing that the state’s anxieties are instead rooted in fears of popular uprisings similar to those witnessed in Bangladesh and Nepal . Although Gen Z-led movements are gaining momentum globally, the uprisings in Bangladesh and Nepal were interpreted by segments of South Asian power elites as externally engineered, including by the US and Pakistan. Regardless of the accuracy of such interpretations, these narratives have contributed to shaping Pakistan’s internal security architecture. Will centralisation and standardisation of security structures lead to more capable institutions? For example, when the federal government an­­n­­ounced the transformation of the Frontier Con­stabulary into a ‘nationwide federal force’, its int­e­nded mandate included operating across all provinces, Islamabad, AJK, and GB. One explanation for this expansive jurisdiction is the state’s perception that local police forces in AJK and GB have been unable to contain the JAC protests , neces­­­sitating a more centralised coercive capacity. This harmonisation process was formalised with the establishment of the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre under the National Counter Terrorism Authority. The creation of Niftac was described as a step towards realising Nacta’s original objectives. In practice, however, Niftac has eclipsed Nacta, undermining its status and institutional relevance, despite expanding its footprint across all provinces. The irony is that a wing of Nacta has become so large that it has effectively subsumed the parent organisation. If state institutions had wished to establish Niftac as an independent body, they could have done so and subsequently merged it with Nacta. But Nacta was created through an act of parliament, meaning that any restructuring would have required legislative amendment and public debate. The more expedient strategy, therefore, was to create Niftac as a ‘wing’ of Nacta — while granting it a mandate that far exceeded that of the original authority. Another development is the government’s plan to establish a National Cybersecurity Authority under the Cybersecurity Act, 2025 , recognising that cybersecurity has become an integral component of the internal security domain. The merger of the Levies into the police in Balochistan has raised significant questions, as competing narratives continue to shape the debate. Critics argue that the Levies, despite limited resources and personnel, have historically performed better than the police across a vast and difficult terrain. They point to home department data showing that crime rates in Levies-administered areas are lower than in police-administered zones. This performance gap is particularly striking given the disparity in force size: the Levies operate with roughly 28,000 personnel, whereas the police have more than 42,000. Most political parties in Balochistan have therefore rejected the merger, insisting that effective local security structures should not be dismantled merely for administrative uniformity. They also fear that the decision is driven less by performance considerations and more by the state’s anxieties over a rising insurgency and its desire to centralise coercive authority. As mentioned, the purpose of harmonising the internal security infrastructure appears to be countering terrorism and violent extremism-related threats. Beyond that, it is increasingly aimed at addressing broader national security risks, including espionage, identifying actors linked to foreign influences, whether political, regional, or otherwise, and responding to activities deemed harmful to national security. However, significant grey areas exist within this domain. Under such an expansive framework, any political or social movement can easily be labelled as ‘foreign-influenced’ rather than a legitimate, locally supported mobilisation. This appro­ach extends across both kinetic and non-kinetic domains, yet what remains missing is recognition that many of these responsibilities traditionally fall within the core mandate of LEAs, particularly the police, whose primary functions are crime prevention and ensuring public safety and security. The irony is that LEAs, especially the police, have drifted far from their foundational roles. Their increasing focus on moral policing and coercive enforcement has become more regressive, extra-constitutional, and marred by institutional corruption that continues to deepen. The police have neither developed the capability to understand nor the capacity to implement their functions under evolving security paradigms. In the process, they have forgotten their core public-service mission. While the roots of moral policing lie in the colonial era, its contemporary manifestation is influenced not only by state practices but also by the growing pressure of religiously motivated violent groups within society.

      "summary_orig": "THE fragile ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan has been tested yet again, this time with an exchange of fire along the Afghan border in Balochistan. Hostilities began late on Friday, with officials saying the Afghan side had resorted to “unprovoked firing”. The Afghan Taliban, meanwhile, accuse Pakistan of instigating the hostilities at Spin Boldak. Though the exchange ended, it illustrates that without a permanent mechanism between both sides, flare-ups can occur at any time, with the potential of evolving into larger confrontations. Kabul had also accused Pakistan of conducting strikes in November — an accusation the government has denied . A ceasefire was signed in October following mediation by Qatar and Turkiye after heavy fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Perhaps one of the reasons that limited outbreaks of violence continue is that the negotiation process appears to be stalled. Turkish negotiators were due to arrive in Islamabad, but the visit has not materialised. As per the Foreign Office, “perhaps a lack of cooperation” from the Taliban is behind the delay. Pakistani and Afghan officials also met recently in Riyadh, but that process also seems to have stalled without producing any results. However, friendly states should continue their mediation efforts, and both Islamabad and Kabul should participate fully in these endeavours in order to arrive at a peaceful solution to the bilateral impasse. The alternative — continued hostilities — is in neither country’s interest. Yet the key sticking point remains the Taliban’s refusal to act against terrorists based on Afghan soil, and in particular not attempting to stop them from conducting cross-border attacks. Pakistan has long been a victim of terrorist groups such as the TTP and BLA based in Afghanistan. But as recent events have shown, the security of other regional states has also come under threat due to the lax policies of the Afghan Taliban towards terrorist groups active in their country. For example, a number of Chinese workers were killed in Tajikistan last month in attacks that originated from Afghanistan. Dushanbe has condemned the “illegal and provocative actions of Afghan citizens”. As this paper has previously argued, Pakistan, along with Afghanistan’s other neighbours, needs to communicate in unambiguous terms the need for the Afghan Taliban to clamp down on cross-border terrorism. If left unattended, the problem will grow, adding to insecurity across the entire region. For Pakistan, along with continuing the process of mediation facilitated by friendly states, there is also a need to remain vigilant at the border. Yet Islamabad’s decision to allow UN humanitarian supplies into Afghanistan needs to be welcomed. As the FO spokesperson noted, Pakistan intends no harm to the Afghan people. Therefore, while remaining firm on its demand for Kabul to end cross-border terrorism, Pakistan should continue to facilitate humanitarian and people-to-people exchanges with Afghanistan.

      "summary": "THE fragile ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan has been tested yet again, this time with an exchange of fire along the Afghan border in Balochistan. Hostilities began late on Friday, with officials saying the Afghan side had resorted to “unprovoked firing”. The Afghan Taliban, meanwhile, accuse Pakistan of instigating the hostilities at Spin Boldak. Though the exchange ended, it illustrates that without a permanent mechanism between both sides, flare-ups can occur at any time, with the potential of evolving into larger confrontations. Kabul had also accused Pakistan of conducting strikes in November — an accusation the government has denied . A ceasefire was signed in October following mediation by Qatar and Turkiye after heavy fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Perhaps one of the reasons that limited outbreaks of violence continue is that the negotiation process appears to be stalled. Turkish negotiators were due to arrive in Islamabad, but the visit has not materialised. As per the Foreign Office, “perhaps a lack of cooperation” from the Taliban is behind the delay. Pakistani and Afghan officials also met recently in Riyadh, but that process also seems to have stalled without producing any results. However, friendly states should continue their mediation efforts, and both Islamabad and Kabul should participate fully in these endeavours in order to arrive at a peaceful solution to the bilateral impasse. The alternative — continued hostilities — is in neither country’s interest. Yet the key sticking point remains the Taliban’s refusal to act against terrorists based on Afghan soil, and in particular not attempting to stop them from conducting cross-border attacks. Pakistan has long been a victim of terrorist groups such as the TTP and BLA based in Afghanistan. But as recent events have shown, the security of other regional states has also come under threat due to the lax policies of the Afghan Taliban towards terrorist groups active in their country. For example, a number of Chinese workers were killed in Tajikistan last month in attacks that originated from Afghanistan. Dushanbe has condemned the “illegal and provocative actions of Afghan citizens”. As this paper has previously argued, Pakistan, along with Afghanistan’s other neighbours, needs to communicate in unambiguous terms the need for the Afghan Taliban to clamp down on cross-border terrorism. If left unattended, the problem will grow, adding to insecurity across the entire region. For Pakistan, along with continuing the process of mediation facilitated by friendly states, there is also a need to remain vigilant at the border. Yet Islamabad’s decision to allow UN humanitarian supplies into Afghanistan needs to be welcomed. As the FO spokesperson noted, Pakistan intends no harm to the Afghan people. Therefore, while remaining firm on its demand for Kabul to end cross-border terrorism, Pakistan should continue to facilitate humanitarian and people-to-people exchanges with Afghanistan.

      "summary_orig": "Though the absence of opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate may not directly hinder parliamentary proceedings, the protracted delay in their appointment may erode the parliament’s credibility and undermine the democratic framework. Dawn talked to a number of veteran parliamentarians, constitutional experts and parliamentary reporters over the issue and found them almost unanimous in demanding that National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani should immediately recognise the democratic right of the opposition members by appointing their nominated persons as the opposition leaders in both houses of parliament. The two key parliamentary offices have been lying vacant since August after the disqualification of Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with their conviction in the May 9 cases. The PTI then nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas for the opposition leader slots in the National Assembly and Senate, respectively. Experts, lawmakers say this may erode parliament’s credibility, undermine democratic framework During a recent session of the National Assembly, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, while responding to the opposition’s protest over the delay, declared the issue “sub judice”. He was apparently referring to the petitions filed by Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz in the courts, challenging their disqualifications. “In my opinion, there is no legal justification for delaying the declaration of the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly and the Senate,” said Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob. He said the rules of business of the National Assembly did not provide for any timeframe for the declaration of the opposition leader, but the sense of Rule 39 was that the office should be filled on a priority basis. Similarly, Mudassir Rizvi of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) said the delay was eroding parliament’s credibility and would set a wrong precedent. He said future parliaments would struggle to restore their prestige due to this action. It may be noted a number of PTI lawmakers last year were abducted from parliament after they took shelter inside the building to evade arrest. A number of PPP leaders, a key coalition partner of the PML-N in the Centre, also found it difficult to defend the delay. According to PPP Secretary General Nayyar Bokhari, the rules do not provide any timeframe for the appointment of the opposition leaders as the appointments were at the discretion of the speaker and the Senate chairman. He, however, said that he personally believed that the speaker and the Senate chairman should nominate the opposition leaders as soon as possible. Mr Bokhari, who has also served as the Senate chairman, refused to talk about the ‘sub judice’ stance taken by the speaker, stating that the NA speaker must be aware of some legal difficulties in this regard, which only he could explain in a better way. Mr Bokhari recalled that the rules of both houses of parliament were changed after PPP’s Makhdoom Amin Fahim was not appointed as opposition leader in the 2002 National Assembly by then speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussain. Instead, he said, the speaker at that time nominated Maulana Fazlur Rehman as the opposition leader despite the fact that the Muttahida Majli-i-Amal (MMA) clearly had fewer members on the opposition benches than the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy (ARD), mainly comprising the PPP and the PML-N. Mr Bokhari said under the rules, now the speaker is required to seek the names of the opposition leader from the opposition members with their signatures and is bound to nominate the person having the support of the majority. While Mr Bokhari refused to speak on the issue in categorical terms, PPP stalwart Raza Rabbani appeared to be more critical of the speaker and the Senate chairman for “unnecessarily dragging” the matter. According to Mr Rabbani, the rules of procedure and conduct of the business in both houses are very clear and it is the duty of the custodians of both houses to fill the vacant positions of the opposition leaders without any delay. Mr Rabbani, who had also once served as Senate chairman, however, did not agree with the notion that the absence of the opposition leader had no impact on the functions of parliament. He explained that the opposition leader had an important role in setting the agenda and business of the house. He said the opposition leader had the privilege to get the floor whenever desired to speak on any issue. He said that according to his information, by-elections had already been held on the seats vacated by the two opposition leaders, so the two houses were complete and, therefore, he could not comprehend the “sub judice stance” taken by the speaker. He was of the view that the parliament was “incomplete” without an opposition leader. Senior parliamentary reporter Javaidur Rahman termed the delay in the nomination of the opposition leaders a violation of the Charter of Democracy (CoD) signed by the PPP and the PML-N in May 2006. He said in the CoD, the role of the opposition leader had been enhanced and the two parties had also agreed to appoint him as the head of the powerful Public Accounts Committee of parliament. Senior journalist M.B. Soomro, who is also president of the Parliamentary Reporters Association, regretted that it had been weeks since the opposition submitted an application to the National Assembly secretary with the signatures of 74 members to appoint Mr Achakzai as opposition leader, but the speaker had not yet initiated the process. Mr Soomro said it seemed that some powerful circles did not want Mr Achakzai as opposition leader. He also expressed his surprise over the continued silence of political parties present in the parliament over the issue. On the other hand, PTI leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser said even if, for the sake of argument, they agreed with the speaker’s stance that the matter was sub judice, then he should know that they had already withdrawn the petition filed by Omar Ayub. He said they had also handed over the documents in this regard to the speaker. Replying to a question, he said the speaker had not conveyed them verbally or in writing that he had some objection to Mr Achakzai’s nomination, adding that the speaker “cannot say it because it is against the Constitution”.

At least three civilians were injured in the clashes last night and were shifted to the district hospital in Chaman. On the Afg­han side, five people were inju­red, according to Afghan government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat. According to officials, Afghan forces fired mortar shells on the Badani area, prompting security forces to retaliate. However, Afg­han Taliban spokesperson Zabi­hullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding. Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, confirmed the clashes. “A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the Chaman border. An immediate, befitting [and] intense response has been given by our armed forces,” he wrote in a post on X early Saturday morning. “Pakistan remains fully alert [and] committed to ensuring its territorial integrity [and] the safety [of] our citizens,” he added. ‘Fighting has stopped’ Chaman Deputy Commissioner Habibullah Bangulzai confirmed that fighting between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban had stopped. He said that immediately after the Taliban attack, an emergency was declared at Chaman District Hospital. However, the deputy commissioner did not comment on the human or property losses. SSP Chaman Abdullah Cheema said all security measures had been taken and the situation was under control. Sources said a mortar shell lan­ded on a house and exploded, inj­uring a couple and their daughter. The residents of the area said that a large number of families living in border villages were shifted to Chaman city. “Heavy fighting started at 10pm and continued for over two hours,” an official of the local administration said. The clash comes amid stalled negotiations between Pakis­tan and Afghanistan after three rounds of talks in Istanbul could not yield any results. Border clashes first broke out between the two nations on Oct 11. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. Pak-Afghan talks Soon after the clashes on Oct 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha. Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators from Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on Nov 6. But on Nov 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.

But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators from Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on Nov 6. But on Nov 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and the United States agreed to intensify cooperation on immigration and security during a meeting here on Saturday between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker. The acting US ambassador, who called on the interior minister, offered her country’s full technical assistance for counter-narcotics operations and efforts to curb illegal immigration. The meeting also focused on strengthening collaboration in intelligence sharing. Speaking on the occasion, Mr Naqvi said that Pakistan had a clear and firm policy regarding illegal immigration. He added said the identification of drug trafficking cases at airports remained a top priority. “State-of-the-art scanning machines are being installed at all major airports across the country.” The minister reaffirmed that the country was strictly implementing a zero-tolerance policy against narcotics. “Even today, drugs originating from Afghanistan are reaching dozens of countries and destroying young generations,” he noted, adding that US technical support to bolster Pakistan’s counter-narcotics capabilities would be welcomed. On the prime minister’s directive, the National Narcotics Coordination Centre would be set up soon, the interior minister informed the envoy. ANF performance During the meeting, a detailed briefing was given on the Anti-Narcotics Force’s (ANF) performance and ongoing operations across the country. It was shared that under the annual counter-narcotics campaign, 134 tonnes of narcotics were seized, 2,001 suspects — including 75 foreign nationals — were arrested, and drugs worth $12.797 billion were confiscated. It was further informed that in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh, 110 Afghan nationals were arrested and 40,659 acres of land were cleared to maintain a “poppy-free status”. Ms Baker appreciated the performance of the ANF and said that the United States placed special importance on its relations with Pakistan and would continue cooperation in all areas. The interior minister said Pakistan-US relations were vital for promoting peace and stability in the region, and that Islamabad was committed to further strengthening their long-standing bilateral ties. The meeting was attended by the interior secretary, the ANF director general, its director enforcement, representatives of the US embassy, and other officials. Published in Dawn, December 7th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The United States wants Europe to take over the majority of Nato’s conventional defence capabilities, from intelligence to missiles, by 2027, Pentagon officials told diplomats in Washington this week, a tight deadline that struck some European officials as unrealistic. The message, recounted by five sources familiar with the discussion, including a US official, was conveyed at a meeting in Washington this week of Pentagon staff overseeing Nato policy and several European delegations. The shifting of this burden from the US to European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would dramatically change how the US, a founding member of the post-war alliance, works with its most important military partners. In the meeting, Pentagon officials indicated that Washington was not yet satisfied with the strides Europe has made to boost its defence capabilities since Russia’s expanded invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US officials told their counterparts that if Europe does not meet the 2027 deadline, the US may stop participating in some Nato defence coordination mechanisms, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Some officials on Capitol Hill are aware of and concerned about the Pentagon’s message to the Europeans, one US official said. No clarity on how US would measure Nato’s progress Conventional defence capabilities include non-nuclear assets from troops to weapons and the officials did not explain how the US would measure Europe’s progress toward shouldering most of the burden. It was also not clear if the 2027 deadline represented the Trump administration’s position or only the views of some Pentagon officials. There are significant disagreements in Washington over the military role the US should play in Europe. Several European officials said that a 2027 deadline was not realistic, no matter how Washington measures progress, since Europe needs more than money and political will to replace certain US capabilities in the short term. Among other challenges, Nato allies face production backlogs for military equipment they are trying to purchase. While US officials have encouraged Europe to buy more US-made materiel, some of the most prized US-made weapons and defence systems would take years to be delivered if ordered today. The US also contributes capabilities that cannot simply be purchased, including unique intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance that have proven key to the Ukrainian war effort. Asked for comment, a Nato official speaking for the alliance said European allies had begun taking more responsibility for the continent’s security, but did not comment on the 2027 deadline. “Allies have recognised the need to invest more in defence and shift the burden on conventional defence” from the US to Europe, the official said. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said: “We’ve been very clear in the need for Europeans to lead in the conventional defence of Europe. We are committed to working through Nato coordination mechanisms to strengthen the alliance and ensure its long-term viability as European allies increasingly take on responsibility for conventional deterrence and defence in Europe.” European nations have broadly accepted US President Donald Trump’s demand that they take more responsibility for their own security and have pledged big increases in defence spending. The European Union has set a target of making the continent ready to defend itself by 2030 and says it must fill gaps in its air defences, drones, cyber warfare capabilities, munitions and other areas. Officials and analysts said even that deadline is highly ambitious. Washington-Nato relationship runs hot and cold The Trump administration has consistently argued that European allies need to contribute more to the Nato alliance, but it’s not always clear where the president stands on Nato. On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump frequently bashed European allies, and he said he would encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Nato countries that did not spend their fair share on defence. But at the annual Nato leaders’ summit in June, Trump effusively praised European leaders for agreeing to a US plan to boost the annual defence spending target for member states to five per cent of gross domestic product. In the months since, Trump has vacillated between a harder line on Russia — the bloc’s main opponent — and, more recently, a willingness to negotiate with Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. European officials have complained that they were largely cut out of those negotiations. At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers this week, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said it was “obvious” Nato allies should take responsibility for Europe’s defence. “Successive US administrations have been saying this in one form or another pretty much my whole life … but our administration means what it says,” Landau wrote on X.",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI emphatically deplored “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson against ex-premier Imran Khan, saying he was “not a security threat”, and lamented the weakening of democracy in the country following the passage of recent constitutional amendments. In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”. Responding to the DG ISPR’s accusations in a press conference today at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “Do not drive away the people of Pakistan, they stand with Imran Khan and the PTI. Imran Khan is not a national security threat. He has kept the people united.” Raja said there were many narratives in the country, including along ethnic and sectarian lines, yet Imran had rejected all of them to stand with the narrative of Pakistan, along with PTI’s supporters and voters. “For God’s sake, don’t do this. You will not be able to minus Imran Khan, but God forbid if you do, it will be very difficult to keep this country’s interests united. If you attack KP and remove its elected government to install an unelected setup, then you yourselves will be responsible for the conditions that follow.” Raja termed the DG ISPR’s press conference “unfortunate” and added that the party will not answer the accusation and charges levelled against the PTI founder. “Today we are being told that the country’s most popular leader is a national security threat, which is ridiculous, but this has not been said for the first time.” Referring to the establishment’s manoeuvring against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s, Raja said: “The institutions decided again and again that any popular leader of the people is a national security threat and it is necessary to remove them from the scene, but this did not happen. You cannot remove them from the hearts of the people through your decisions. The nation has always been aware and there is a reason it is standing behind Imran Khan. We are not mad, we know who has always been in control in this country.” Raja elaborated that he wanted to set the context for everyone, noting that there have been countless times in the country’s history when it was pushed from democracy toward force and authoritarianism. Referring to previous military dictatorships in the country, he said prosperity was always promised, and yet, they all ultimately failed. The general secretary of the party said it was claimed multiple times during the past that democracy, law and the Constitution does not suit the country, and needs a stick, but the “ruler always left it weaker than before”. Raja lamented that the party was frequently criticised as a ragtag group without understanding of affairs and what heights the country was being taken towards. However, the PTI secretary general questioned whether the country needed to be forcibly developed through the use of power, noting that if this were the case, it would have already happened during previous periods of military rule. Raja said there was a need for a “grand dialogue”, given the country’s current situation, and that the nation needed to be involved lest the past repeat itself. “There will be no change, and we will go backwards.” Referring to the constitutional amendments and the subjugation of the judiciary, he said the development was not even comparable to anything under previous eras of military rule. Slamming censorship in the country, the senior PTI leader said that anyone speaking freely could be subject to the Peca law, inquiries, and more, referring to the trial proceedings of husband-and-wife lawyer duo Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha. Raja said the PTI was ready to talk, but the people of KP and their chief minister should never be mocked or denigrated. “Don’t put the future of the country or KP at stake in this battle of narratives. This is a very sensitive area, take the people along in the conditions that are there at the moment and the state of terrorism. The PTI is the biggest force in the country that can take it towards betterment.” The PTI secretary general also seemingly criticised the party’s social media wing and supporters, who he said called the party out to respond or answer why it was not taking action. “We are sitting because the country is dear to us and we don’t want discord in the country,” Raja added. He said the party and Imran would take every step required for the benefit of the country. “It is very easy to respond to the brick with a stone but we will not do it because the country’s benefit is not in this.” Former National Assembly speaker and PTI MNA Asad Qaiser also voiced a complaint with the DG ISPR’s remarks. “There is great anger and heightened emotions in our province. Your words should have been appropriate. We think such words should be desisted from and will also demand that they are retracted because a whole society and province think it has been disrespected.” Barrister Gohar calls for easing of ‘tone’ PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali criticised the DG ISPR’s remarks, calling them “inappropriate and wrong” and saying it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister. Gohar said that “there is an enemy of ours” who would be pleased by press conferences against each other, adding that this was why he had earlier said today’s would not be a confrontational press conference. PTI Chairman said the party wanted to clarify that “some people are trying to incite fighting between the workers of a major party and members of a major institution”. Gohar said such incidents should never occur, warning that “the beginning of any great destruction is always due to a few inappropriate words”. He added that ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction. The PTI leader said there was still time for “tone to be eased” and for steps to improve the current situation. He called for Tuesday’s meeting with Imran to be allowed without restriction and urged that no politics be made over the ex-premier’s meetings with his sisters. He maintained that the country deserved to prosper and grow, but if the current tense atmosphere and attitude continued, “then it won’t be minus-one, but minus-everyone, which should not happen”. At the start of the press conference, Gohar welcomed everyone to what he said would be an “unusual” press briefing in response to the military spokesperson’s remarks against the PTI founder, saying it would have a “different tone”. “We are not going to do a confrontational press conference or to respond to a brick with a stone, but it is very important to tell some facts to the people as charges have been levelled at us.” He claimed that the PTI was the country’s largest political party and its leader was Imran, with the support of 70 per cent of the nation. “It is necessary to tell the people what has happened to us in the recent past. From 180 seats, we were reduced to 91 seats, and now we are left with 76. Reserved seats were taken and there was violence against women and children. The injustices against us are a tale of their own.” Barrister Gohar said the party had continued to endure in order to uphold democracy, adding that the PTI’s stance was rooted in democracy, peace and the rule of law, and that Imran Khan had always maintained that both Pakistan and its army belong to the people. The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role. The PTI chairman added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but yesterday’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”. Referring to Imran’s pending cases and delayed proceedings, he said the party began with a position of calling for his release and was now reduced to asking for meetings to be permitted with the PTI founder. “All that we endured was for the sake of democracy and the country, but we say, if such conditions continue and such treatment with each other continues, then democracy will be the one to face the biggest loss.”",

      "summary_orig": "The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday that 14 terrorists were killed in three separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.. In a statement, the military’s media wing said nine khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij were killed on Friday. Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It said an IBO was conducted in Tank on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement read. In a separate IBO conducted in Lakki Marwat, “two more khawarij were effectively neutralised by security forces”. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area,” the statement said. Later in the day, the ISPR said security forces conducted an IBO in Balochistan’s Dera Bugti district and killed five terrorists belonging to the Fitna al Hindustan . The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists in all three instances. According to the military’s media wing, the eliminated terrorists “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians”. It added that a counter-terrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of “foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the operations. According to a statement posted by state broadcaster PTV on X, he said that security forces were making big gains against terrorism under Azm-i-Istehkam. “The nation stands with security forces against terrorism. We are determined to root out terrorism from the country,” he said. President Asif Ali Zardari commended the “courage and timely action” of the security forces in “thwarting the heinous intentions of the terrorists,” PTV reported. He stressed that “the nation’s resolve to eliminate terrorists will continue to stay intact until the menace is rooted out”. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the efforts of the security forces, stating that “security forces neutralised the militants with remarkable efficiency,” the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported. He also praised their professionalism, courage, and the swift action taken. He noted that the “timely operations thwarted major threats and demonstrated the exceptional skill and commitment of Pakistan’s security personnel”. “The nation takes pride in the bravery and professionalism of its soldiers,” he was quoted as saying. “Security forces remain fully determined to restore and maintain lasting peace in KP,” the minister added. Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Earlier this week, security forces killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district.",

      "summary_orig": "Calm returned to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border at Chaman on Saturday after heavy clashes occurred between the two sides a day earlier. At least three civilians were injured in the clashes last night and were shifted to the district hospital in Chaman. On the Afghan side, five people were injured, according to Afghan government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat. According to officials, Afghan forces fired mortar shells on the Badani area, prompting security forces to retaliate. However, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding. Prime Minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, Mosharraf Zaidi, however, confirmed the clashes. In a post on X early Saturday morning, he said, “A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the Chaman border. An immediate, befitting & intense response has been given by our armed forces.” “Pakistan remains fully alert & committed to ensuring its territorial integrity & the safety [of] our citizens,” he added. A senior official in Quetta also confirmed on the condition of anonymity that the exchange of fire started at around 10pm and continued till late at night. The clash comes amid stalled negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan after three rounds of talks in Istanbul could not yield any results. Border clashes first broke out between the two nations on October 11. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. A day earlier, the spokesperson Foreign Office (FO) had reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to engage in talks with Afghanistan. Pakistan-Afghanistan talks Soon after the clashes on Oct 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha. Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. But on November 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the clashes.",
