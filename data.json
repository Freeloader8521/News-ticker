      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Thursday that he was unable to meet the chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) earlier today and was denied permission to meet PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former premier, who is incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, since he was sworn in as the KP CM on October 15. He has been denied access to the PTI founder at least four times since then, despite the IHC’s directives to implement its March order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran. Addressing reporters outside the prison, CM Afridi lamented that he was unable to meet the party founder and the chief justice of the IHC, the latter of whom he had waited 90 minutes to meet before leaving empty-handed. “As you all know, there have been continuous efforts through constitutional and legal means; this is the fifth time,” he said, referring to how frequently he was denied a meeting with the PTI founder. “After waiting for an hour and a half, we couldn’t meet the IHC chief justice, so we came here. I was again denied permission for a meeting [with Imran]. You are seeing this system in place, which was exposed by my leader, Imran Khan.” He said that people with “clouded judgment” levelled allegations that the PTI was trying to incite and protest, but stated that he has “continuously tried to remove the fog clouding their judgment”. “Some people have become more powerful than institutions, because people are telling us they cannot do anything unless they receive orders from the top,” CM Afridi said, adding that he did not know who was issuing the orders. The PTI earlier staged a protest outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) over the multiple denials of CM Afridi’s jail meeting with Imran. The KP CM reached the IHC for “legal proceedings”, after which he would head to the Adiala jail to meet Imran, the PTI said on X. The move comes a day after the PTI parliamentary party unanimously passed a resolution calling for the arrangement of a meeting between Afridi and Imran. The PTI members urged both the federal and the Punjab governments to implement the IHC in letter and spirit. Speaking to reporters outside the court today, CM Afridi said he would “avail all legal and constitutional paths” to secure a meeting with Imran. The PTI leader has the option to file a petition against the Adiala jail administration for contempt of court proceedings — a move he has warned of previously. The chief minister said he came to the IHC to meet Chief Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and to discuss the fixation of some cases for hearing. “Our cases are not being fixed,” he claimed. “I have not been allowed to meet the PTI founder despite court orders,” the KP CM said, asserting that the Constitution guaranteed him the right to protest. “Only the courts can tell who is pressuring them,” he added. On the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment , the PTI leader wondered “whether the government itself has seen its draft or not”. Meanwhile, PTI parliamentarians and leaders also staged a protest outside the IHC. They chanted various slogans, including “One state, two constitutions unacceptable”, “Make the judiciary independent/free the judiciary”, and “Free Imran Khan”. Videos showed PTI leaders gathered at at least two spots, with one group also chanting slogans against the proposed 27th Amendment . Pictures shared by the PTI’s KP chapter showed huge crowds of party workers welcoming the chief minister upon his arrival at the IHC. Meeting denials A day after he took the oath as the chief minister on October 15, Afridi secured protective bail from the Peshawar High Court (PHC) till November 18 and went to Adiala to meet Imran, but failed to do so despite a two-hour wait. CM Afridi had also filed a separate plea in the IHC seeking permission to meet Imran, on which notices were issued to Adiala jail’s Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum and others. Then, on October 23, after the IHC ordered the jail superintendent to implement the twice-a-week meeting schedule, Afridi headed to Adiala jail but could not meet the imprisoned ex-premier again. The KP CM then visited Rawalpindi on October 28 but was denied access to Imran for the third time , compelling the PTI founder to issue directives that Afridi pick his KP cabinet. Afridi again was not able to meet Imran on October 30, marking the fourth such occurrence, following which he finally named his provincial cabinet .",

      "summary_orig": "The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday rejected “unfounded and misleading” allegations that members of the Hindu community were denied entry into the country on religious grounds, clarifying the action was “purely administrative” and consistent with Islamabad’s sovereign right to regulate entry into its territory. Earlier this week, Pakistan welcomed Sikh pilgrims from India, with over 2,000 pilgrims granted visas to attend a 10-day festival marking the 556th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh faith. However, Indian media claimed yesterday that an Indian national and six family members were reportedly denied entry into Pakistan, with officials allegedly citing their Hindu faith as the reason for refusal. In a statement today, FO said that these claims are “entirely baseless and represent yet another attempt to distort facts and politicise a matter that was purely administrative in nature”. “High Commission for Pakistan, New Delhi, had issued over 2,400 visas to Sikh pilgrims from India to participate in the celebrations marking the birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji from November 4 to 13,” FO’s statement noted. “On November 4, a total of 1,932 pilgrims successfully crossed into Pakistan through the Attari-Wagah border,” the statement highlighted. “It is pertinent to note that approximately 300 visa holders were prevented by the Indian authorities from crossing over. The entire immigration process on the Pakistani side was smooth, orderly, and free of any hindrance.” It added that a very small number of individuals were “found to possess incomplete documentation and were unable to provide satisfactory responses to immigration authorities”. Consequently, the statement noted, “they were requested to return to the Indian side in accordance with standard procedures”. “To suggest that these individuals were denied entry on religious grounds is completely incorrect and mischievous,” according to FO. “Pakistan has always welcomed pilgrims of all faiths to visit its sacred religious sites under a well-established and facilitative framework. The action taken was purely administrative, consistent with Pakistan’s sovereign right to regulate entry into its territory,” said FO, adding that any attempt to give this issue a communal or political colour is not only regrettable but “also reflective of the prejudiced mindset that increasingly dominates the Indian government and media narratives”.",

      "summary_orig": "Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Riffat Mukhtar said on Thursday that the agency is investigating reports of workers being offloaded at airports, during a meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, a statement from the ministry said. Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports on grounds of suspicion, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions follow Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s directive to crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. The development took place during a high-level meeting today presided over by the minister, in which he was briefed on such incidents. DG FIA Mukhtar, officials Ministry of the Overseas Pakistanis, and a delegation from the Pakistan Overseas Employment Promoters Association were also in attendance. DG FIA Mukhtar informed the meeting participants that incidents of workers being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway. “If any FIA officials are found involved, strict action will be taken against them,” the statement quoted him as saying. While addressing the participants, Minister Hussain pointed out that workers were offloaded at different airports despite having work visas and protection certificates. “Pakistanis going abroad for employment are highly respected by us, and no one will be allowed to unlawfully stop workers at airports,” the minister said, per the statement. Overseas Pakistanis, he said, send foreign remittances to Pakistan, which drives the national economy. The minister directed the DG FIA to immediately resolve the issue and instructed that no work visa holders be offloaded at airports in the future. Per the statement, no new conditions have been imposed by the FIA for those travelling abroad on work visas, nor has any new requirement been introduced for obtaining an affidavit from a government officer. A new digital system will soon be introduced, through which workers can complete their immigration online before departure. Federal Minister Hussain stated that to prevent such incidents in the future, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and FIA officials were preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs). In December of last year, four Pakis­tani citizens were among those killed in migrant shipwrecks off the coast of Greece, as confirmed by the Foreign Office. A high-level committee was formed to examine the tragedy, overseen by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. In January of this year, the former FIA DG, Ahmed Ishaque Jehangir, was removed from his position and Mukhtar appointed to replace him in early April.",

While addressing the participants, Minister Hussain pointed out that workers were offloaded at different airports despite having work visas and protection certificates. “Pakistanis going abroad for employment are highly respected by us, and no one will be allowed to unlawfully stop workers at airports,” the minister said, per the statement. Overseas Pakistanis, he said, send foreign remittances to Pakistan, which drives the national economy. The minister directed the DG FIA to immediately resolve the issue and instructed that no work visa holders be offloaded at airports in the future. Per the statement, no new conditions have been imposed by the FIA for those travelling abroad on work visas, nor has any new requirement been introduced for obtaining an affidavit from a government officer. A new digital system will soon be introduced, through which workers can complete their immigration online before departure. Federal Minister Hussain stated that to prevent such incidents in the future, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and FIA officials were preparing standard operating procedures (SOPs). In December of last year, four Pakis­tani citizens were among those killed in migrant shipwrecks off the coast of Greece, as confirmed by the Foreign Office. A high-level committee was formed to examine the tragedy, overseen by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. In January of this year, the former FIA DG, Ahmed Ishaque Jehangir, was removed from his position and Mukhtar appointed to replace him in early April.",

      "summary_orig": "Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP) President Abdullah Jadoon and Secretary General Awais Jadoon were dismissed from service on Thursday amid an ongoing tiff with the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafiz confirmed the development to Dawn . The national flag carrier also issued two dismissal notices to the engineers, copies of which are available with Dawn . Abdullah’s role was stated as an aircraft engineer (PG-VI), while Awais was an aircraft engineer (PG-VIII). The dismissal letters said that notices were issued to the SAEP president for conducting a press conference without prior authorisation and for disclosing official information to the media, and to the SAEP secretary general, for the unauthorised disclosure of confidential operational information and PIA images. “In order to enquire into the allegations/charges communicated to you via the aforesaid showcause notice, an enquiry was conducted wherein you failed to participate despite providing ample opportunities to appear and defend your case,” the notices said. “After examining the available evidence and statements of prosecution witnesses, the enquiry committee found you guilty of the charges levelled against you,” they added. They further said that both the SAEP officials were provided two opportunities to appear before the chief executive officer, but failed to do so. “Keeping in view your entire disciplinary case, the management has decided to dismiss you from the service of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited,” the notices said, adding that these dismissals would go into effect immediately. The dismissals come amid an ongoing tiff between the PIA management and the SAEP, with the protesting engineers refusing to issue clearance certificates to aircraft — a move that has disrupted flight operations in recent days. The engineers have been protesting for two-and-a-half mont­­hs, seeking pay hikes among other demands, according to SAEP officials. While the PIA has claimed that the engineers are on “strike”, the SAEP maintains that its engineers were on duty but were not giving clearance certificates to aircraft without all the mandatory checks. Earlier, the PIA spokesperson had highlighted that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he had warned. For his part, Awais Jadoon had earlier said that the two officers were on duty and working, but could not compromise on safety and airworthiness. “We are being forced to issue clearance certificates (to release the planes), but we cannot put passengers’ lives at risk in such tense circumstances.” He had also clarified that the engineers were not on strike and said that they were only issuing clearance certificates to aircraft completely fit for flying. In response to a question about a meeting with the PIA management, he had said that they were not called by the management for negotiations or to address the issues raised by engineers, but they were called for a ‘personal inquiry’ initiated against them. Meanwhile, the PIA has alleged that the engineer’s protest is aimed at sabotaging the national flag carrier’s privatisation. Flight disruptions The matter came into the spotlight when hund­reds of air travellers were reported to have been stranded at three major airports on Monday night due to the aircraft engineers’ protest, which delayed at least six flights of the national flag carrier. Similar delays have been reported at nearly all major airports in the country during the last two months. On Tuesday, the PIA claimed to have restored flight operations through alternative arrangements. A PIA spokesperson said that the management had used alternative means and worked overnight to restore operations, mitigating the impact of already delayed flights on subsequent operations. Yesterday, too, the PIA said it had managed to “partially restore its flight operations”.",

      "summary_orig": "Gunmen on motorbikes attacked a Bangladesh political rally, killing one person and wounding two others, including a candidate, officials said on Thursday, after parties began campaigning for landmark elections. Major parties opened their campaigns on Wednesday for the elections slated for February 2026, the first since a deadly uprising last year toppled the autocratic government of former ruler Sheikh Hasina. Campaigning turned violent almost immediately. The shooting took place at a rally on Wednesday for the powerful Bangladesh National Party (BNP) attended by hundreds in the port city of Chattogram, police said. Senior BNP leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said, “It was an attempt to destabilise politics and disrupt the election”. Major parties have unveiled their candidate lists, with the BNP saying this week that 80-year-old leader and three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia will run again, as well as her son, Tarique Rahman. The BNP are widely seen as the frontrunner in the polls. Police said the gunmen opened fire quickly on a crowd of hundreds at the rally but insisted that the BNP candidate was not the target. “The miscreants … shot their target, and fled in a flash,” senior police officer Hasib Aziz told reporters late on Wednesday. Candidate Ershad Ullah was shot and wounded, along with a supporter. A third man was killed. “We would urge candidates to inform the police station at least 24 hours prior to any election campaign, so that more police can be deployed,” Aziz said. ‘Show restraint’ The South Asian nation of about 170 million people has been in political turmoil since Hasina was overthrown by the student-led uprising in August 2024. Campaigning is technically unofficial because the election commission is not expected to announce the voting day until December. Interim leader Muhammad Yunus , the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner serving as chief adviser, has repeatedly promised the elections will be held in February. Yunus has ordered an investigation into the shooting, his media team said in a statement. The interim government “calls on all political actors and their supporters to uphold calm, show restraint, and ensure that the February general election takes place in an atmosphere of peace, dignity, and fairness”, it said on Thursday. Bangladesh police offered cash rewards yesterday for the surrender of more than 1,300 machine guns, rifles and pistols looted during last year’s uprising. Lieutenant General Md Mainur Rahman told an army news conference on Wednesday that the military would provide security to ensure peaceful polls and that they would return to barracks after the election. “We hope stability will be strengthened, law and order will remain normal, and we will return to the cantonment once the election is held,” Rahman said. Bangladesh’s largest Islamist political party, Jamaat-i-Islami, said it had finalised a preliminary candidate list and was “engaging with other parties on the prospect of seat-sharing”, senior leader Abdullah Mohammad Taher told AFP .",

      "summary_orig": "Shafiullah Jan, the special assistant to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information and public relations, said on Thursday that only the provincial chief executive could make decisions for ensuring lasting peace in the province. “We have the mandate. Any decision for lasting peace in the province will be made by the chief minister, and the provincial government will implement it,” Jan said while addressing a news conference in Peshawar. He said law and order was the biggest challenge for the provincial government, adding that the KP government was making efforts to address the issue. Jan further said that a multiparty conference was scheduled to be held next week and that the finalised terms of reference (ToRs) would be presented to the chief minister for further discussion with the stakeholders, to decide a future course of action for lasting peace in the province. Meanwhile, PTI Provincial Secretary General Ali Asghar requested all the political parties to share their suggestions, adding that PTI founder Imran Khan and his party were against any military operation in the province. “The consequences of military operations are faced by the locals who vacate their homes,” he said. The PTI has been opposing plans to conduct anti-terrorism operations across the province, with its incarcerated founder Imran Khan in August telling then-KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur not to allow the Centre to conduct any military operations. Imran had made a similar demand in September as well. However, Gandapur had deviated from the party line while he was the CM and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military. It was against this backdrop that Imran decided to remove Gandapur as the provincial chief executive and nominated Afridi for the post, who was elected as the chief minister on October 13. Imran’s this decision is also being linked to his opposition to military operations in the KP. Three days before Afridi’s election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership. In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations? ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ For his part, Afridi announced following his election that a jirga would be held in his hometown of Bara in the Khyber district on Oct 25 to establish enduring peace in the restive province and resist decisions made without the input of residents. He also asserted that the provincial government stood by the ideology of Imran and the interests of the KP residents. In his first official high-level meeting as the CM on Oct 20, he had maintained that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government. More recently on Oct 29, he used stronger words to criticise military operations in KP while speaking to the media in Peshawar, saying that civilian deaths during security operations constituted a “war crime” and not collateral damage.",

      "title_orig": "Move over, status quo — New York has a new story to tell",
      "summary_orig": "On November 5, the curtain fell on a remarkably well-executed political campaign as New York witnessed the historic election of its first-ever Muslim South Asian mayor. Watch parties surfaced across all five boroughs, pulsing with celebratory music, jubilation, and a sense of endless possibilities. The city itself seemed to hum with electric energy. The air, undeniably different, charged with the promise of something new. At a time when voter turnout and overall faith in politics have been at record lows, 34-year-old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, a Queens native and the son of Ugandan-Indian immigrants, has emerged as a ray of hope, not only for New Yorkers but progressives all over the world. His win signifies a new era for reformists, younger voters, and immigrant communities who poured their hearts out into his campaign, canvassing neighbourhoods, phone-banking, and donating generously. Nearly 70 per cent of his voter base was under the age of 30. “Seeing someone who shares similar values, background, and culture in a position of power feels very grounding and affirming. It shows that we belong here and that our voices matter,” said Dr Sayali Karke, 27, a medical professional and an immigrant from India. The mayoral election drew more than two million voters — a turnout last seen in 1969, according to the city’s Board of Elections, when 2.46 million people came out to vote for incumbent Mayor John Lindsay, who, after losing the Republican primary, was reelected on the Liberal line. Mamdani’s meteoric rise over the past year — from a lesser-known assemblyman to now the 111th mayor of New York, defeating well-established rivals such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa in both the Democratic primary and the general election — is nothing short of monumental. He’s coming for Trump and we’re here for it Running on a platform of progressive politics, Mamdani has pledged to prioritise five key policies: universal free childcare, a rent freeze on the city’s one million rent-stabilised apartments, rebuilding ties with his critics, reimagining the police department, and standing up to President Donald Trump’s attacks on the city. In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani addressed the president directly . “This is not how we stop Trump; this is how we stop the next one. So, Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: turn the volume up,” declared Mamdani, eliciting thunderous applause. A historic day indeed, to see a Muslim politician challenge the president of the United States on the world’s stage. And Trump was, in fact, watching. “AND SO IT BEGINS!”, he responded on his Truth Social platform. Mamdani now faces significant challenges as mayor in reconciling his ambitious agenda with the realities of governance amid deep political hostility and division. Trump has already launched a slew of scornful attacks on social media and threatened to halt federal funds to New York City. “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Aside from the fact that Mamdani has clarified on multiple occasions that he is not a communist but a democratic socialist, the president does not have the authority to withhold federal funds from states. Under the US Constitution, that power lies with Congress. When Islamophobia met its match The scourge of Islamophobia presents yet another battle Mamdani and his Muslim supporters will continue to encounter. His campaign team, which included many Muslim staffers, endured harassment and discrimination but continued to press forward with unwavering resolve. “I was canvassing outside a mosque in Brooklyn, handing out fliers, when a group of young white men walked past, hurling Islamophobic insults because I was wearing a keffiyeh,” recalled a resident of Brooklyn, Zarah Shujjah, who is also an immigrant. “That incident gave me more conviction that we need a Muslim mayor. So, I showed up again the next day, and the next, and the next.” Throughout the campaign, Mamdani’s candidacy endured waves of racially charged attacks, from criticisms about his lack of experience to outright anti-Muslim slurs. Ellie Cohanim, a former deputy envoy in the first Trump Administration, posted a picture of the burning Twin Towers from September 11, 2001, captioned: “Never forget …. Vote Andrew Cuomo & save our city”. The New York Post ran headlines that conflated Mamdani with terrorism, and Cuomo himself engaged in Islamophobic remarks in an interview with the conservative radio host Sid Rosenberg. As Islamophobia persists across the United States, Muslim Americans finally feel a sense of solace and pride knowing that when Mamdani is sworn in on January 1, he will be the most powerful Muslim elected official in the country. “It’s shocking that I have seen a Muslim mayor in my 20s. It feels like a response to the polarising state of the country. We’re going to see more Trumps and Kirks pop up, but we’ll also see more Mamdanis. That’s both exciting and concerning. It’s a reality that represents the current state of US politics,” said Maria Mir, who moved to Brooklyn from Pakistan. The line between hope and hype While it’s tempting, and often politically useful, to glorify a newly elected leader in an age of virality, such adulation should be seen with caution. The internet has a way of turning people into symbols, often faster than they can grow into the roles those symbols demand. Elevating a figure as esteemed as Mamdani creates expectations: promises made on the campaign trail become moral contracts with voters, and supporters rightly expect those contracts to be honoured. It will be important to hold him accountable to his commitments and to the faith of those who propelled him to victory. That said, accountability and optimism for change are not mutually exclusive. Transitioning from campaigner to the daily grind of city leadership is a radical shift — from setting agendas to balancing budgets and operating within institutional constraints. In a city long dominated by wealth and entrenched interests, the odds are stacked against him. He must be afforded the leeway to falter as he transitions to his new role. Yet, for now, New Yorkers, and many others around the world can revel in this renewed sense of faith and watch as new beginnings start to unfold.

      "summary_en": "On November 5, the curtain fell on a remarkably well-executed political campaign as New York witnessed the historic election of its first-ever Muslim South Asian mayor. Watch parties surfaced across all five boroughs, pulsing with celebratory music, jubilation, and a sense of endless possibilities. The city itself seemed to hum with electric energy. The air, undeniably different, charged with the promise of something new. At a time when voter turnout and overall faith in politics have been at record lows, 34-year-old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, a Queens native and the son of Ugandan-Indian immigrants, has emerged as a ray of hope, not only for New Yorkers but progressives all over the world. His win signifies a new era for reformists, younger voters, and immigrant communities who poured their hearts out into his campaign, canvassing neighbourhoods, phone-banking, and donating generously. Nearly 70 per cent of his voter base was under the age of 30. “Seeing someone who shares similar values, background, and culture in a position of power feels very grounding and affirming. It shows that we belong here and that our voices matter,” said Dr Sayali Karke, 27, a medical professional and an immigrant from India. The mayoral election drew more than two million voters — a turnout last seen in 1969, according to the city’s Board of Elections, when 2.46 million people came out to vote for incumbent Mayor John Lindsay, who, after losing the Republican primary, was reelected on the Liberal line. Mamdani’s meteoric rise over the past year — from a lesser-known assemblyman to now the 111th mayor of New York, defeating well-established rivals such as former governor Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa in both the Democratic primary and the general election — is nothing short of monumental. He’s coming for Trump and we’re here for it Running on a platform of progressive politics, Mamdani has pledged to prioritise five key policies: universal free childcare, a rent freeze on the city’s one million rent-stabilised apartments, rebuilding ties with his critics, reimagining the police department, and standing up to President Donald Trump’s attacks on the city. In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani addressed the president directly . “This is not how we stop Trump; this is how we stop the next one.

      "summary_orig": "Continuing to comment on the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year, US President Donald Trump has now stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down. “In eight months I ended eight wars, including Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda … Pakistan and India,” he said during a speech at the American Business Forum in Miami late on Wednesday. “I was in the midst of a trade deal with both of them. And then I read on the front page of a certain newspaper — I won’t mention the newspaper because it’s usually fake news — but I heard they are going to war. Eight planes, seven planes were shot down — an eighth was really badly wounded [sic]. But eight planes were shot down essentially,” he said. He reiterated his previous claims that he threatened not to make trade deals unless the two countries agreed to peace. “I’m not trading with you; we are not making any deals with you if you are at war with each other,” he said. “A day later, I get a call, ‘We made peace’. They stopped. I said, ‘Thank you, let’s trade’. Isn’t that great? Tariffs did that. Without tariffs that would have never happened.” The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to seven planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September. Just last month, he had said that seven “brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down” during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India. India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks. The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”.",
