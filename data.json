      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: After accusing the police of subjecting its workers to violence and detaining them near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, the PTI wrapped up its sit-in in the early hours of Wednesday. The IHC has allowed Imran twice-a-week meetings — on Tuesday and Thursdays — with his family, lawyers and other associates. Despite the order, the ex-premier has not been allowed any visitors for weeks, including his sisters and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. Therefore, protests and sit-ins near the Adiala jail, where Imran has been incarcerated since September 2023, have become a usual occurrence on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On several occasions, police have also used force to disperse the protesters, who often camp at Factory Naka — a police picket near the prison. Imran’s sisters and supporters again staged a sit-in near the prison on Tuesday, while a PTI post on social media platform X alleged that police had inflicted violence on party workers and arrested them. A livestream on the PTI’s YouTube channel showed one of Imran’s sisters, Aleema Khanum, surrounded by party workers and supporters, including children, sitting on the ground and shouting slogans. However, videos posted by PTI leader Aliya Hamza Malik from earlier in the evening showed men, appearing to be policemen, detaining people. Malik claimed in her post on X that lawmaker Mehar Abdul Sattar, along with party workers, had been arrested. A video posted by Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Moeen Riaz Qureshi showed a large contingent of police in riot gear. The caption said “a large contingent of police is approaching”. The sit-in continued despite the alleged police action, with Imran’s all three sisters present. While the protest was still under way until a short while after midnight, the number of participants had reduced by then. Naeem Haider Panjutha, who is a spokesperson to Imran on legal affairs and was present at the sit-in, posted on X at 12:44am that their protest was continuing. However, at around 1:30am, he wrote, “The sit-in has ended for the release of arrested [party] workers.” A video shared by him showed Aleema sitting in a car and speaking to Panjotha. Speaking to reporters at the spot earlier, Aleema demanded a meeting with Imran and immediate medical treatment for his eye condition Al-Shifa Hospital. “They have made a joke out of this, they have to provide him medical treatment,” she emphasised. The PTI has been raising concerns about Imran’s health after reports emerged, and later the government confirmed, that he was treated at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). Aleema, flanked by Noreen Niazi and Uzma Khanum, also requested CM Afridi to “do something to get Imran free”. “You may shut down KP. What is happening with Imran in Punjab … you should come here.” Speaking to Geo News , Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had said last week that the former premier was taken to Pims in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on Imran’s eye on the night of January 24. He said the ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”. The PTI has also condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians. Aleema said about the development today that information about the Pims visit had been “leaked” and neither she, nor anyone else in Imran’s family was informed. “They quietly took him late at night. They might be worried that something might happen to him (Imran), but why leak it?” she questioned. “Why weren’t we told that he was taken to the hospital?” Aleema added. She said they had to meet Imran and said that Imran medical check-up be conducted in the presence of his physician, Dr Aasim Yusuf. She also called for the examination of Imran’s eye by a specialist doctor. While Aleema was staging a sit-in, the Rawalpindi sub-divisional police officer approached her with warrants issued for her by an anti-terrorism court in the garrison city on Monday, and Aleema signed the warrants. PTI to file another contempt plea Earlier, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja was at the Islamabad High Court to initiate the process of filing yet another contempt of court petition against Adiala jail authorities for repeatedly denying party leaders permission to meet Imran. Announcing that his party’s plans to again move the court against jail authorities, Raja said while speaking to reporters on the court premises that this would be the “sixth contempt petition” filed on the matter. The PTI and Imran’s sisters both have previously filed contempt petitions against Adiala jail authorities over non-compliance with the IHC order. Today, Raja said while speaking to reporters at the IHC that he was at the court to file “another contempt of court petition” over what he deemed was “continued and deliberate non-compliance with court orders”. “This is not the first time; this is the sixth contempt petition,” Raja said, adding that despite clear judicial directions, prison officials had consistently obstructed access to the PTI founder. “No constitution prevents a prisoner from speaking, and the jail rule being cited to restrict meetings is itself unconstitutional,” he asserted, without specifying which rule he was referring to. Raja maintained that while incarceration lawfully curtailed a person’s physical freedom, it did not “extinguish fundamental rights altogether”. The PTI leader said while a prisoner’s freedom was taken away, they could not be deprived of their capability to think and speak. “When someone goes to meet a prisoner, he can say whatever comes to his mind. There is no law that allows the state to censor thought or speech in this manner,” the PTI leader added. Raja alleged that restrictions on meetings with Imran were “not administrative but political in nature”, aimed at “silencing the former premier and controlling the political narrative”. “An attempt is being made to hide the hollowness of the system,” he said, further alleging that authorities were trying to bury what he described as the “lie of February 8” — seemingly a reference to the 2024 general elections, which the PTI has repeatedly alleged were rigged. He alleged that efforts were being made to hide that “people’s vote was robbed”, further accusing the state of “sending a message of submission” to the public. “They are telling the people that your destiny is only subjugation, that your vote and your voice have no value,” he said, without naming anyone. Raja further alleged that the continued denial of meetings with Imran was intended to create an atmosphere of fear and helplessness. “They are giving the people the impression that the freedom of your leaders is at our mercy,” he said, adding that such actions struck at the heart of democratic norms and constitutional guarantees. Raja described Imran Khan as the country’s most popular political leader and claimed that those in power were unnerved by his influence even from behind bars. “The founder of PTI is the biggest leader in the country, and today they are scared and terrified,” he said. “Their aim is to silence the voice of the founder of PTI.” Additional input from Ikram Junaidi and Mohammad Asghar",

      "summary_orig": "TRIPOLI: Saif al Islam, the most prominent son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi, was shot dead at his home on Tuesday. Abdullah Othman Abdul Rahim, a relative, told a TV channel that Saif al Islam was killed in his house by a group of four unidentified men. “Four armed men stormed the residence of Saif al Islam Qadhafi after disabling surveillance cameras, then executed him,” Abdul Rahim said. While Saif al Islam was well known in the north African country, especially for his role in shaping policy during his father’s rule, his public profile receded in recent years. In 2015, a Libyan court passed a death sentence in absentia on Saif al Islam for suppressing peaceful protests during the country’s 2011 revolution that ended his father’s rule. He was also provisionally charged by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity. In 2021, Saif al Islam registered as a presidential candidate for a December vote that eventually collapsed amid a political deadlock. Saif went from being his father’s heir apparent to a decade of captivity and obscurity in a remote hill town before launching a presidential bid that helped derail the attempted election in 2021. Despite holding no official position, he was once seen as the most powerful figure after his father, who ruled for more than four decades. He led talks on Libya abandoning its weapons of mass destruction and negotiated compensation for the families of those killed in the bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland in 1988.

      "summary_orig": "THE separatist militancy, which has gripped Balochistan for the past two decades, now seems to have escalated into a full-blown insurgency. Last week, hundreds of armed terrorists launched simultaneous attacks reportedly in 12 locations, including the provincial capital Quetta. They stormed security installations, set government buildings on fire and looted banks. Highly trained terrorists engaged the security forces in gun battles for hours, revealing their capacity to challenge the state. While the government claims to have killed 145 terrorists and restored order, such large-scale attacks, which breach even high security zones such as the provincial capital and cause many casualties among security officials and civilians, are highly disturbing. The violence brought the province to a standstill. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has claimed responsibility for this massive terrorist attack, has also asked for people’s backing. The spectacle of a large number of terrorists launching such audacious and coordinated attacks across the province indicates the organisation is not without backing. There has been a sharp escalation in Baloch separatist violence over the past five years, with 2025, the deadliest year on record. According to the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, the province saw at least 254 attacks in 2025 (a 26 per cent increase from the previous year) resulting in more than 400 deaths. In recent times, the terrorists appear to have shifted from a hit-and-run strategy to one aimed at taking control of territory, though briefly. There have been incidents when dozens of heavily armed terrorists have stormed district headquarters and taken control of it before dispersing. Not only were the attacks targeted, according to reports, the terrorists also clashed with the security forces and blocked highways that connect Balochistan to other parts of Pakistan. The latest terrorist attacks in Balochistan undermine claims that the situation is under control. Last year, BLA terrorists carried out one of their most audacious attacks, hijacking the Jaffer Express, which was travelling from Quetta to KP. Over 300 passengers were rescued after an operation that lasted more than a day, during which 33 militants were killed. But despite the killing of so many terrorists by the security forces, there seems to be no cessation in the number of militant attacks. In fact, they have also increased in intensity. The latest terrorist attacks undermine the government’s claim that the situation is under control. It’s one of the most serious security challenges this country has faced in decades. The latest wave of terrorist violence in the strategically located region is a grim reminder of the resurgence of the menace with greater ferocity. What has made the situation worse is the state’s failure to win public support in its battle against the separatists. Considering that this region has long been the epicentre of political unrest, it is hardly surprising that it witnesses frequent attacks. Arguably, public discontent has increased over the years as Balochistan has still not been able to get its due political and economic rights. The civilian administration is non-existent in large parts of the province. Besides, the uptick in violence has also been evident following the controversial 2024 national elections. Thanks to electoral manipulation, there is a widespread perception that the government is unrepresentative and has thus failed to establish its authority. Those elections were criticised as marginalising even Baloch nationalists seeking democratic rights within the federal structure. Moreover, the increasing use of force to curb peaceful protests has inflamed the situation further, providing the terrorists an opportunity to recruit new members. A combination of factors, including the denial of democratic rights, poverty and excesses by the state have pushed many, particularly among the educated youth, towards terrorist groups, which have also recruited women in their ranks. Some of the major terrorist attacks have been carried out by Baloch women. The terrorist attack in Gwadar last week was reportedly led by a woman. The growing participation of women, mostly from educated middle class backgrounds, shows the widening influence of the terrorist groups. These groups, with the support of external forces, are now better trained and equipped with sophisticated weaponry, as was seen in the recent attacks. India has openly been supporting the Baloch separatist movement as a part of its ongoing hostilities against Pakistan. There is strong evidence of separatist leaders having close links with the Indian intelligence agencies. Regional geopolitics is another factor behind the escalation of such attacks. Afghanistan has long been a safe haven for Baloch terrorists. The return of Taliban rule and the escalating tension between Kabul and Islamabad have given even greater space to the terrorists to operate from. The terrorists have now acquired sophisticated weapons left behind by Nato forces as they exited Afghanistan in 2021. Some of the Baloch separatist factions are said to have made a tactical alliance with the banned TTP, which is being patronised by the Afghan Taliban regime. Moreover, a long porous border with Iran also provides a cross-border sanctuary for the insurgents in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province. A long coastal belt provides the militants a safe supply line. The areas along the sea and those bordering Iran have been the worst affected by terrorism. It is also the region where China is helping develop Gwadar, a key seaport on the Arabian Sea. The increased targeting of Chinese nationals working on various CPEC projects carries strong geopolitical implications. The BLA, which claimed the attacks, threatened intensified attacks on key Chinese interests unless China withdraw from the region. A mix of internal and external factors has complicated the Balochistan problem. But it is the growing political alienation of the Baloch people from the state that has made it harder to deal with the separatist insurgency. The country cannot confront the challenge without addressing the people’s grievances. A population that is deprived of its basic democratic and economic rights is estranged from the state.

      "title": "Rising threat in Balochistan",
      "summary": "THE separatist militancy, which has gripped Balochistan for the past two decades, now seems to have escalated into a full-blown insurgency. Last week, hundreds of armed terrorists launched simultaneous attacks reportedly in 12 locations, including the provincial capital Quetta. They stormed security installations, set government buildings on fire and looted banks. Highly trained terrorists engaged the security forces in gun battles for hours, revealing their capacity to challenge the state. While the government claims to have killed 145 terrorists and restored order, such large-scale attacks, which breach even high security zones such as the provincial capital and cause many casualties among security officials and civilians, are highly disturbing. The violence brought the province to a standstill. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), which has claimed responsibility for this massive terrorist attack, has also asked for people’s backing. The spectacle of a large number of terrorists launching such audacious and coordinated attacks across the province indicates the organisation is not without backing. There has been a sharp escalation in Baloch separatist violence over the past five years, with 2025, the deadliest year on record. According to the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, the province saw at least 254 attacks in 2025 (a 26 per cent increase from the previous year) resulting in more than 400 deaths. In recent times, the terrorists appear to have shifted from a hit-and-run strategy to one aimed at taking control of territory, though briefly. There have been incidents when dozens of heavily armed terrorists have stormed district headquarters and taken control of it before dispersing. Not only were the attacks targeted, according to reports, the terrorists also clashed with the security forces and blocked highways that connect Balochistan to other parts of Pakistan. The latest terrorist attacks in Balochistan undermine claims that the situation is under control. Last year, BLA terrorists carried out one of their most audacious attacks, hijacking the Jaffer Express, which was travelling from Quetta to KP. Over 300 passengers were rescued after an operation that lasted more than a day, during which 33 militants were killed. But despite the killing of so many terrorists by the security forces, there seems to be no cessation in the number of militant attacks. In fact, they have also increased in intensity. The latest terrorist attacks undermine the government’s claim that the situation is under control. It’s one of the most serious security challenges this country has faced in decades. The latest wave of terrorist violence in the strategically located region is a grim reminder of the resurgence of the menace with greater ferocity. What has made the situation worse is the state’s failure to win public support in its battle against the separatists. Considering that this region has long been the epicentre of political unrest, it is hardly surprising that it witnesses frequent attacks. Arguably, public discontent has increased over the years as Balochistan has still not been able to get its due political and economic rights. The civilian administration is non-existent in large parts of the province. Besides, the uptick in violence has also been evident following the controversial 2024 national elections. Thanks to electoral manipulation, there is a widespread perception that the government is unrepresentative and has thus failed to establish its authority. Those elections were criticised as marginalising even Baloch nationalists seeking democratic rights within the federal structure. Moreover, the increasing use of force to curb peaceful protests has inflamed the situation further, providing the terrorists an opportunity to recruit new members. A combination of factors, including the denial of democratic rights, poverty and excesses by the state have pushed many, particularly among the educated youth, towards terrorist groups, which have also recruited women in their ranks. Some of the major terrorist attacks have been carried out by Baloch women. The terrorist attack in Gwadar last week was reportedly led by a woman. The growing participation of women, mostly from educated middle class backgrounds, shows the widening influence of the terrorist groups. These groups, with the support of external forces, are now better trained and equipped with sophisticated weaponry, as was seen in the recent attacks. India has openly been supporting the Baloch separatist movement as a part of its ongoing hostilities against Pakistan. There is strong evidence of separatist leaders having close links with the Indian intelligence agencies. Regional geopolitics is another factor behind the escalation of such attacks. Afghanistan has long been a safe haven for Baloch terrorists. The return of Taliban rule and the escalating tension between Kabul and Islamabad have given even greater space to the terrorists to operate from. The terrorists have now acquired sophisticated weapons left behind by Nato forces as they exited Afghanistan in 2021.

Ties between Turkiye and Saudi Arabia have steadily recovered in recent years, with the countries cooperating on a range of diplomatic issues. This includes support for Gaza and backing Syria’s new government in the wake of the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in 2024. Erdogan met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman in Riyadh, Turkiye’s Comm­unications Director Burha­nettin Duran told Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu.

      "title_orig": "That’s not cricket: How ‘creeping Hindutva’ stumped sportsmanship ahead of the T20 World Cup",
      "summary_orig": "In 1993, a rising star kicked off a legendary Bollywood career with back-to-back megahits in Darr and Baazigar , where he introduced audiences to the concept of the ‘anti-hero’. Thirty-three years later, it led to Bangladesh being expelled from a World Cup. If this paragraph makes no sense to you, there are some crucial details that need to be unpacked to make this connection clear. But at the heart of this story is one disturbing new reality — international cricket today has become a tool of India’s ruling Hindutva regime. From Mustafizur’s ouster to Bangladesh’s expulsion Let’s begin with the basic details. On January 2, a member of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Sangeet Som, attacked India’s most popular Muslim figure , Shahrukh Khan, calling him a traitor. Shahrukh owns the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), a cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League that had selected Bangladesh cricketer Mustafizur Rahman. Threatening Mustafizur with “dire consequences” and claiming Shahrukh had “no right to live” in India, Som’s calls led to a chorus of hatred against Shahrukh and Mustafizur. Within days, the Indian cricket board, the BCCI “requested” KKR to release the player, vaguely citing “recent developments going on all across”. Almost immediately, Bangladesh’s Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul reacted , ordering the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to ask the game’s governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), to change the venue of their matches in the upcoming T20 World Cup from India to co-host Sri Lanka. Nazrul noted that “if a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India … then the entire Bangladesh team cannot feel safe travelling to India for the World Cup.” After several rounds of negotiations between the BCB and the ICC, the latter responded firmly, rejecting Bangladesh’s request and stating that doing so “could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body”. The apex body kicked Bangladesh out of the tournament and replaced them with Scotland. In response to that, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi vocally opposed the decision, decrying the ICC’s “double standards.” A few days later, the Government of Pakistan instructed its team to boycott its World Cup game against India. ‘Ocean of vagueness’ So how is all of this related to India’s ruling Hindutva regime? For starters, Sangeet Som’s allegations and threats against Shahrukh and Mustafizur were part of the BJP’s standard dog-whistle, anti-Muslim tactics. These particular ones came as part of campaigning for the West Bengal state elections, where KKR play and where the BJP has called for the expulsion of local Muslims by claiming they are Bangladeshi refugees, amongst other bigoted claims. This has not been the first time that Shahrukh Khan in particular has come under the religiofascist BJP’s crosshairs . His decades-long megastardom has meant that the BJP has repeatedly sought to target him as the most iconic Muslim figure in Indian society. What was unprecedented however was when the BCCI stepped in and ‘requested’ KKR to remove the player. Journalists in both India and Bangladesh noted that there were no indications of any internal discussion or debate within the BCCI before the decision was taken. According to a report in The Indian Express , the decision was taken at the highest level in the board, with neither board members nor the league’s governing council involved. An unnamed BCCI official told the paper that “we ourselves got to know about this through the media. There was no discussion. No suggestion was taken from our side.” The BCCI’s request to KKR was also deliberately vague, avoiding any specifics of the toxic demands that led to the situation, which later allowed the ICC to reject BCB’s claims of security concerns. According to veteran Indian cricket journalist Sharda Ugra, this “ocean of vagueness” is a deliberate feature of the Indian board’s recent actions. She noted that despite her best efforts, she never managed to get any formal response on which officials ordered the Indian team to refuse shaking hands with their Pakistani counterparts in the Asia Cup 2025. Similarly, when the Indian team refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy last year, Ugra said that “there [was] no specific instruction from anyone, no clear cut statement saying … that we have been instructed by the external affairs ministry or the home ministry or the foreign ministry or the prime minister’s office — nothing.” The same process seems to have been followed in Mustafizur’s case. As Ugra noted, “There is no evidence of any paperwork, [or] procedure … there’s no document that says … this guy cannot have a contract [or] he’s in danger. No official government warnings. It is just whisperings. That’s all that it seems to have come from.” The question of revenue But if the BCCI is compromised by India’s ruling party, then the ICC is no different. It is currently run by Jay Shah, the son of Amit Shah, India’s Home Minister and the second-most important figure in the ruling regime after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As such, its announcement expelling Bangladesh came to be seen as particularly hypocritical, given it had happily conceded to demands to move venues from India for the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. As journalist Taha Hashim wrote in The Guardian , the ICC’s claim about protecting the “sanctity of future … events is a particularly tragicomic line [given that their] Champions Trophy decision did ‘set a precedent’, forming a hybrid model that has already turned ICC tournaments into a joke.” PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi was the only dissenting voice from other cricket boards, terming the ICC’s actions regarding Bangladesh “double standards” and an “injustice” to the South Asian team, as well as promising action in solidarity. But while it does appear that the fallout with Bangladesh might give Naqvi and the PCB another ally, senior Bangladeshi cricket journalist Mohammad Isam is cautious about such a possibility. Noting the political reality of Bangladesh being surrounded by India on three sides as well as the longstanding cultural links with Bangla-speakers across the border, he said that the options for Bangladeshi cricket were more limited. He pointed out that the current standoff was driven directly by the sports ministry and a government that is about to go into elections in February. According to Isam, the expectation amongst observers after Mustafizur’s removal was a diplomatic approach from the board. “[We heard] that the BCB was planning to give a statement that was going to be middle of the ground … because while for this Bangladesh government [opposing] India can be something, but for the cricket board, Indian cricket is the end all. The BCB can’t really afford to fight the BCCI, as one tour from India pays the bills for several years.” Similarly, he mentioned that several voices within Bangladeshi cricket felt that the government’s response had put the ball in India’s court and restricted the BCB’s ability to negotiate a way out. This fear of lost revenue is the stick that allows India its undue sway over world cricket. While the PCB and Pakistan cricket have spent almost two decades adjusting to and living with a de facto ban from Indian cricket and its riches, none of the smaller boards have the resources or the clout for such a fight. Crucially, the most economically and politically powerful boards have also shown a complete sense of apathy on this matter. Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University, wrote in a blog post that “the Mustafizur moment will not be the last time a player is sacrificed at the altar of majoritarian politics … The machinery is now in place, tested and proven effective. And no one — not the ICC, not the boards of other cricket nations, not the global media — has demonstrated the will to stop it.” When asked over an email what would need to happen to resist this tide, he speculated that it “would happen when countries like England and Australia are targeted. That could lead to some kind of a pushback but even then, those boards may decide to lump the humiliation and keep placating the BCCI for the moolah.” India’s grip on international cricket finances, governance Sharda Ugra was similarly unmoved by the potential of any opposition from within the ICC or the two most powerful boards after India. “I’ve been following cricket for 30 years,” she said, adding that “I’ve never seen [the ICC] look this bad — they are an unserious organisation. [And] the Australian and English cricket boards are no more than the sidekicks of the big don in our game. There is no capable, mature leadership in the ICC anymore.” That much maligned ICC leadership appeared to be scrambling in the wake of Pakistan’s decision to solely boycott the game against India — the biggest revenue generator in every tournament. In a statement released before they had even formally been notified of the decision by the PCB itself, the ICC made clear that “it expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution”, a much more conciliatory tone than the outright rejection of the BCB’s demands. Clearly, with a huge financial bite to face, the ICC’s priorities have been put to test. The decisions by Bangladesh and Pakistan have been the first time in a long time that the sport has had to address someone else’s concerns other than India’s. India’s vice-like grip over both international cricket’s finances as well as its governance has meant that the entire sport has become increasingly beholden to it. And in turn, the Hindutva movement and the BJP’s control over Indian institutions has meant that as Ugra puts it, the BCCI’s actions are now “addressing voting constituencies rather than cricket fans.” It has meant that the fallout from campaigning in a local state election in India can lead to massive implications for foreign countries and players, potentially crippling the future of the sport. As one Indian observer posted on social media platform X , “this is what happens if you decide to torch your … one genuine soft power currency to please a few. You can draw a straight line from the Mustafizur decision to [the Pakistan government’s] decision.” Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any quick solution. Writing after the news of Pakistan’s boycott, Sushant Singh said, “[The sport’s] final wicket will fall not to a rival bowler, but to a lawsuit from a broadcaster or the collapse of a commercial deal, leaving the game bankrupt in every sense — financially, morally, and culturally… The only way back is … through accountability.” Till then, the reality of the sport is that the flap of a butterfly’s wings in local Indian politics can cause a typhoon in another country’s cricketing fortunes.",

      "summary_en": "In 1993, a rising star kicked off a legendary Bollywood career with back-to-back megahits in Darr and Baazigar , where he introduced audiences to the concept of the ‘anti-hero’. Thirty-three years later, it led to Bangladesh being expelled from a World Cup. If this paragraph makes no sense to you, there are some crucial details that need to be unpacked to make this connection clear. But at the heart of this story is one disturbing new reality — international cricket today has become a tool of India’s ruling Hindutva regime. From Mustafizur’s ouster to Bangladesh’s expulsion Let’s begin with the basic details. On January 2, a member of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Sangeet Som, attacked India’s most popular Muslim figure , Shahrukh Khan, calling him a traitor. Shahrukh owns the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), a cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League that had selected Bangladesh cricketer Mustafizur Rahman. Threatening Mustafizur with “dire consequences” and claiming Shahrukh had “no right to live” in India, Som’s calls led to a chorus of hatred against Shahrukh and Mustafizur. Within days, the Indian cricket board, the BCCI “requested” KKR to release the player, vaguely citing “recent developments going on all across”. Almost immediately, Bangladesh’s Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul reacted , ordering the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to ask the game’s governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), to change the venue of their matches in the upcoming T20 World Cup from India to co-host Sri Lanka. Nazrul noted that “if a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India … then the entire Bangladesh team cannot feel safe travelling to India for the World Cup.” After several rounds of negotiations between the BCB and the ICC, the latter responded firmly, rejecting Bangladesh’s request and stating that doing so “could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body”. The apex body kicked Bangladesh out of the tournament and replaced them with Scotland. In response to that, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi vocally opposed the decision, decrying the ICC’s “double standards.” A few days later, the Government of Pakistan instructed its team to boycott its World Cup game against India. ‘Ocean of vagueness’ So how is all of this related to India’s ruling Hindutva regime? For starters, Sangeet Som’s allegations and threats against Shahrukh and Mustafizur were part of the BJP’s standard dog-whistle, anti-Muslim tactics. These particular ones came as part of campaigning for the West Bengal state elections, where KKR play and where the BJP has called for the expulsion of local Muslims by claiming they are Bangladeshi refugees, amongst other bigoted claims. This has not been the first time that Shahrukh Khan in particular has come under the religiofascist BJP’s crosshairs . His decades-long megastardom has meant that the BJP has repeatedly sought to target him as the most iconic Muslim figure in Indian society. What was unprecedented however was when the BCCI stepped in and ‘requested’ KKR to remove the player. Journalists in both India and Bangladesh noted that there were no indications of any internal discussion or debate within the BCCI before the decision was taken. According to a report in The Indian Express , the decision was taken at the highest level in the board, with neither board members nor the league’s governing council involved. An unnamed BCCI official told the paper that “we ourselves got to know about this through the media. There was no discussion. No suggestion was taken from our side.” The BCCI’s request to KKR was also deliberately vague, avoiding any specifics of the toxic demands that led to the situation, which later allowed the ICC to reject BCB’s claims of security concerns. According to veteran Indian cricket journalist Sharda Ugra, this “ocean of vagueness” is a deliberate feature of the Indian board’s recent actions. She noted that despite her best efforts, she never managed to get any formal response on which officials ordered the Indian team to refuse shaking hands with their Pakistani counterparts in the Asia Cup 2025. Similarly, when the Indian team refused to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy last year, Ugra said that “there [was] no specific instruction from anyone, no clear cut statement saying … that we have been instructed by the external affairs ministry or the home ministry or the foreign ministry or the prime minister’s office — nothing.” The same process seems to have been followed in Mustafizur’s case. As Ugra noted, “There is no evidence of any paperwork, [or] procedure … there’s no document that says … this guy cannot have a contract [or] he’s in danger. No official government warnings. It is just whisperings. That’s all that it seems to have come from.” The question of revenue But if the BCCI is compromised by India’s ruling party, then the ICC is no different. It is currently run by Jay Shah, the son of Amit Shah, India’s Home Minister and the second-most important figure in the ruling regime after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As such, its announcement expelling Bangladesh came to be seen as particularly hypocritical, given it had happily conceded to demands to move venues from India for the Champions Trophy in Pakistan. As journalist Taha Hashim wrote in The Guardian , the ICC’s claim about protecting the “sanctity of future … events is a particularly tragicomic line [given that their] Champions Trophy decision did ‘set a precedent’, forming a hybrid model that has already turned ICC tournaments into a joke.” PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi was the only dissenting voice from other cricket boards, terming the ICC’s actions regarding Bangladesh “double standards” and an “injustice” to the South Asian team, as well as promising action in solidarity. But while it does appear that the fallout with Bangladesh might give Naqvi and the PCB another ally, senior Bangladeshi cricket journalist Mohammad Isam is cautious about such a possibility. Noting the political reality of Bangladesh being surrounded by India on three sides as well as the longstanding cultural links with Bangla-speakers across the border, he said that the options for Bangladeshi cricket were more limited. He pointed out that the current standoff was driven directly by the sports ministry and a government that is about to go into elections in February. According to Isam, the expectation amongst observers after Mustafizur’s removal was a diplomatic approach from the board. “[We heard] that the BCB was planning to give a statement that was going to be middle of the ground … because while for this Bangladesh government [opposing] India can be something, but for the cricket board, Indian cricket is the end all. The BCB can’t really afford to fight the BCCI, as one tour from India pays the bills for several years.” Similarly, he mentioned that several voices within Bangladeshi cricket felt that the government’s response had put the ball in India’s court and restricted the BCB’s ability to negotiate a way out. This fear of lost revenue is the stick that allows India its undue sway over world cricket. While the PCB and Pakistan cricket have spent almost two decades adjusting to and living with a de facto ban from Indian cricket and its riches, none of the smaller boards have the resources or the clout for such a fight. Crucially, the most economically and politically powerful boards have also shown a complete sense of apathy on this matter. Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University, wrote in a blog post that “the Mustafizur moment will not be the last time a player is sacrificed at the altar of majoritarian politics … The machinery is now in place, tested and proven effective. And no one — not the ICC, not the boards of other cricket nations, not the global media — has demonstrated the will to stop it.” When asked over an email what would need to happen to resist this tide, he speculated that it “would happen when countries like England and Australia are targeted. That could lead to some kind of a pushback but even then, those boards may decide to lump the humiliation and keep placating the BCCI for the moolah.” India’s grip on international cricket finances, governance Sharda Ugra was similarly unmoved by the potential of any opposition from within the ICC or the two most powerful boards after India. “I’ve been following cricket for 30 years,” she said, adding that “I’ve never seen [the ICC] look this bad — they are an unserious organisation.

      "summary_orig": "• Drone ‘approaching’ aircraft carrier shot down; gunboats approach US-flagged vessel • White House says talks still on despite skirmishes • Tehran officials ‘seek change of venue’ after Pezeshkian’s go-ahead for negotiations • FO says Pakistan also invited to attend dialogue ISLAMABAD / DUBAI: Tehran has asked for a change of venue ahead of planned talks between US and Iranian officials this week, after President Masoud Pezeshkian confirmed ordering the initiation of dialogue with Washington. On Tuesday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also confirmed that it had been invited to participate in the Iran-US talks aimed at de-escalation of tensions between Tehran and Washington. According to earlier reports, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi were supposed to meet in Istanbul on Friday in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran’s nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war. The Reuters news agency, however, reported on Tuesday night that instead of Istanbul, Iranian officials are asking that the talks be held in Oman instead, and that the scope be narrowed to two-way talks on nuclear issues only. This latest uncertainty followed reports of escalatory moves in the Persian Gulf, where a US warplane shot down an alleged Iranian drone that was said to be approaching the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. Earlier, a US-flagged tanker was approached and challenged by Iranian gunboats in the Strait of Hormuz, before continuing on its way, the British maritime security firm Vanguard Tech said. However, the White House reiterated that the proposed talks were still on, despite these hiccups. “I just spoke with special envoy (Steve) Witkoff, and these talks as of right now are still scheduled,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, adding that they were due to happen “later this week.” Hectic diplomacy Iran’s president confirmed on Tuesday that he had ordered the start of talks with the US, provided they were free of threats, after his counterpart Donald Trump suggested “bad things” would happen without a deal. “I have instructed my Minister of Foreign Affairs, provided that a suitable environment exists — one free from threats and unreasonable expectations — to pursue fair and equitable negotiations,” President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X. He added that the talks followed requests “from friendly governments”. On Tuesday, Qatar’s foreign ministry said diplomacy with Iran was “continuing very intensively”, in “tandem with all our neighbours”. Earlier, a senior official from the UAE said Iran needed to reach a deal and “rebuild their relationship with the United States”. “I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don’t have these issues every other day,” said presidential adviser Anwar Gargash. Iran has repeatedly stressed that any talks should remain focused solely on the nuclear issue, rejecting the possibility of negotiations over its missile programme or defence capabilities. When asked about the upcoming talks, an Iranian diplomatic source told Reuters they were “neither optimistic nor pessimistic”, adding that Tehran would not negotiate over its defensive capabilities. Pakistan’s role “Pakistan has received the invitation for the upcoming talks between Iran and the United States,” FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said while responding to a query on Tuesday. “Pakistan’s participation is seen as crucial to defusing tensions, as Islamabad has been quietly working to facilitate the talks,” a diplomatic source told Dawn. The diplomatic source added that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is expected to participate in the meeting. The priority of the talks is to avoid any conflict and de-escalate tensions between the two sides, a regional official told Reuters , adding that some regional powers were also invited. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some of the countries invited to the talks at the foreign ministers’ level included Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. The person said the format of the meetings remained unclear, but that the “main meeting” would be on Friday. Last-minute change? According to Reuters , a regional diplomat said that Tehran wants to change the format of the talks. “They only want to discuss the nuclear file with the Americans while the U.S. wants to include the ballistic missiles and the activities of Iran’s proxies in the region.” A source said that Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was due to take part in the talks, along with US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.

      "summary_orig": "The US military on Tuesday shot down an Iranian drone that “aggressively” approached the Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea, it said. The Iranian Shahed-139 drone was flying toward the carrier “with unclear intent” and was shot down by an American F-35 fighter jet, it said. “An F-35C fighter jet from Abraham Lincoln shot down the Iranian drone in self-defence and to protect the aircraft carrier and personnel on board,” said Navy Captain Tim Hawkins, a spokesperson at the US military’s Central Command. No American service members were harmed during the incident and no US equipment was damaged, he added. The incident came as diplomats sought to arrange nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, and US President Donald Trump warned that with US warships heading toward Iran, “ bad things ” would probably happen if a deal could not be reached. The Lincoln carrier strike group is the most visible part of a US military buildup in the Middle East following a crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month. Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene during the crackdown, has since demanded that Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was “seriously talking,” while Tehran’s top security official, Ali Larijani, said arrangements for negotiations were under way. Central Command said that in another incident today, hours later in the Strait of Hormuz, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces harassed a US-flagged and crewed merchant vessel. “Two IRGC boats and an Iranian Mohajer drone approached M/V Stena Imperative at high speeds and threatened to board and seize the tanker,” Hawkins said. Meanwhile, the White House said talks between US and Iranian officials were “still scheduled” this week after the drone was shot down. US envoy Steve Witkoff “is set to have conversations with the Iranians later this week; those are still scheduled as of right now”, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Fox News .",

      "summary_orig": "Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said on Tuesday that Beijing strongly condemned the recent attacks in Balochistan and would always firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism. Jian made these remarks during a regular press briefing when he was asked to comment on a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan last week. Jian said that China strongly condemned the attacks. “We mourn for the lives lost, and our hearts go out to the injured and those who lost their loved ones,” he said. “China firmly opposes any form of terrorism and will, as always, firmly support Pakistan in combatting terrorism, maintaining solidarity and social stability, and protecting the safety of the people,” he added. On Monday, the Chinese embassy in Pakistan had also condemned the “recent multiple terrorist activities in Balochistan”. In a post on X, the embassy said “we […] deeply mourn for the lives lost, and extend sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the injured”. Apart from China, the US , European Union, Iran and several other countries have also condemned the attacks. As many as 92 terrorists were killed on Saturday as security forces repulsed coordinated attacks by members of banned organisations in parts of the provincial capital and around a dozen other cities and towns across Balochistan, the military’s media wing said. In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 15 security personnel were martyred while repulsing the attacks, while 18 civilians also lost their lives. It said that terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni. The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. According to reports, the assailants targeted police stations in Quetta’s Sariab area, torched records and killed officers who resisted the attacks. They also raided banks in the Hazarganji area and opened indiscriminate fire before dispersing into different localities of Sariab. In Kharan, armed men attacked the residence of the Mullazai Qaumi Etihad chairman, killing him and his six security guards. Senior police officer Abdul Baqi said the attackers fled the area after the assault. In the Tump area of Kech district, armed men shot dead former tehsildar Abid after he resisted an attempted kidnapping. Sources said armed men also attacked Mastung, burning the police station and breaking into the district jail, freeing 30 prisoners. They also targeted banks and government institutions. Similar attacks occurred in Kalat, where terrorists attacked banks and police stations, injuring three police personnel and setting banks ablaze. Government offices were also attacked. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had held India responsible for the attacks. Speaking on Saturday night, he said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and strategising.",

      "title_orig": "Basant set to make its grand return in Lahore under mostly clear skies",
      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday said dry weather with clear skies was expected for the majority of the Basant festival, which is set to be celebrated in Lahore this week. “Mainly dry weather with clear skies is expected on 6th and 7th February, while dry weather with few cloudy conditions on 8th February, 2026 in Lahore during the Basant 2026,” the PMD said in a forecast posted on the social media platform X. It added that light westerly/north-westerly winds were likely to blow at the speed of 10 to 15 kilometres per hour, which was “suitable for safe kite-flying”. The PMD advised the festival participants to “exercise caution while flying kites, especially near electric lines and open roads”. The three-day Basant festival is set to kick off in Lahore from February 6, following the Punjab government’s decision to lift a ban on the historic event after 18 years, with strict regulations. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has announced a “ long weekend ” in the province, declaring a “provincial Basant holiday on the 6th, followed by Saturday and Sunday”. Owing to the increasing demand and soaring prices of kite-related commodities, the Punjab government on Monday approved the manufacture of only “permissible kite-flying material” in four more districts of the province. According to the Punjab government’s instructions, only cotton string is allowed to be sold for kite-flying during Basant, whereas the manufacturing of metallic string material and kites exceeding fixed sizes is strictly prohibited. The provincial government has also imposed a ban on the manufacturing of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party. The festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire. ‘No better occasion to portray Pakistan’s positive image’ CM Maryam visited a Safe City office in Lahore on Tuesday, which she said was being used as Basant control room. “All the street activities are being monitored from here through drone surveillance,” she said in a televised address. The chief minister said that Basant was a festivity that was “exclusive to Punjab and we have witnessed how passionately people used to celebrate it”. “But, due to some unfortunate incidents, the people of Punjab were deprived of it,” she expressed regret. She further stated that it was unfortunate that “we adopt other cultures”. “Punjab has a very rich culture and Punjabi, Saraiki, and Potohari are beautiful languages.” But, the CM continued, “our children have been taught that if they speak English, they will be considered uncultured”. “We want people to own Punjab, its language and culture,” she added. “Residents of Punjab should protect their culture and language as their historical heritage and take pride in it.” The Punjab CM said that “our Sikh brothers from Indian Punjab and their children speak Punjabi with pride in all over the world ,whether it is US, Canada, UK or any other country”. “I urge our Punjabi brothers and sisters to teach Punjabi to their children along with Urdu and English,” she said, adding that “it (Punjabi) is their pride, not a source of embarrassment.” The chief minister said when her government announced the lifting of ban on Basant, she had little idea about the enthusiasm and Basant “fever” being witnessed among people presently. People from cities other than Lahore were also making appeals to organise Basant in their cities, she said, adding, “We are organising Basant as a pilot project in Lahore, so that we can see how effective our security protocols and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are.” The Punjab CM further stated, “We cannot get a better occasion than this to portray Pakistan’s progressive image to the world.” Maryam said Basant had “generated economic activity worth billions [of rupees]”. “People from around the world are coming to Punjab. All the hotels and guest houses are booked,” she stated. The Punjab CM said the tradition of Basant went back to 1250, and the festival marked arrival of spring. “It’s colour is yellow , as yellow symbolises life returning to land. This is life returning to Punjab,” she remarked. Outlining the rules and regulations notified by the Punjab government for Basant, she warned that strict SOPs and security protocols were being enforced and violators could face punishment. “We are going to celebrate Basant from Feb 6 to 8, not a day before Feb 6 nor the day after Feb 8. “No kites or threads exceeding the permissible size will be allowed, and the violations may lead punishment for up to 10 years and 2 million in fines,” she said. Maryam said that all kite-flying material that imported from outside Lahore was being strictly monitored. The CM said information regarding registered manufacturers and sellers of kite-flying material was available at online portal www.basant.punjab.gov.pk . Moreover, 46 monitoring and implementation camps were established in the high-risk areas, 32 in medium-risk areas and 20 in low-risk zones, she added. “Over 2500 traffic and 100,00 police personnel have been deployed for the safety of people”, the CM said. She added that all the entrances of Lahore city were being monitored to prevent the transportation of any non-permissible kite-flying material.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution calling for an “aggressive” national response against the external sponsors and internal facilitators of terrorism. The lower house of Parliament continued its discussion on the prevailing security situation in Balochistan in the wake of a series of deadly attacks across the province on Saturday. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the resolution, which stated: “This House condemns in the strongest terms the recent terrorist incidents in Balochistan, in which not only innocent civilians were targeted but also heinous and inhumane tactics such as using women as weapons were adopted.” The NA further demanded that an “immediate, aggressive, coordinated, and effective national response be ensured against these external sponsors and internal facilitators, funding, smuggling, and propaganda hubs, in which political, diplomatic, military, intelligence, legal, and rhetorical fronts are united”. The resolution highlighted that “in several cases, evidence available points to external sponsorship, [and] particularly there are serious concerns over the role of India”. It further said terrorism was “being supported in some neighbouring countries through logistical and operational facilitation, financial support, training, treatment, movement and propaganda networks”. The resolution also expressed “deep sorrow and concern over the fact that terrorist networks are trying to use women against the state and society through exploitation, coercion and blackmail”, adding that it was completely contrary to Islamic, Pakistani and Baloch values. It appreciated the “timely and effective measures taken by the security forces, law enforcement agencies, the provincial government of Balochistan and the civil administration”. Expressing solidarity with the martyrs and the injured, the resolution asserted that attacks on “civilian populations, women, and children are unforgivable crimes, and the state must take decisive action against such elements on the principle of zero tolerance”. The military’s media affairs wing said terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a large-scale coordinated attack across Balochistan on Saturday. The security forces killed 92 terrorists as they responded to the incidents, with more militants being eliminated later to take the 48-hour tally to 177 on Monday. Lawmakers sound alarm Lawmakers from across the political spectrum, including those from the PTI, the PPP and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), sounded an alarm on the surge in terrorism in the province. During some opposition speeches, the proceedings were not livestreamed on the NA’s YouTube channel. Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai suggested an addition in a resolution that would “recommend that the first right of the children of a province be acknowledged on their respective province’s resources”. NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq remarked that this was a “constitutionally protected” matter. In his speech, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said terrorist incidents were taking place in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa frequently. “If we do not see its root causes and the basic issues leading to this, and do not assess it correctly […], the situation would not move forward,” he said. Stating that Pakistanis are aggrieved when someone is killed in a terrorist incident, Qaiser said: “We need to see what the fundamental reason is for this insurgency in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the moment, and that insurgency is not being controlled in any way.” He further said, “A state is like a mother, and when a state does not do justice to its children, does not give them basic rights, differentiates between them and does not treat them fairly, then it has to face such situations.” The former NA speaker stressed the need to figure out the root causes behind the rising unrest in Balochistan. “The fundamental thing is democracy,” he added. “When you do not give importance to the public and do not accept their opinions and suggestions, and when the people think they are beings of a lower level and their thoughts have no value,” he said, before the NA YouTube livestream was disrupted for over a minute. The PTI leader then lamented that ex-premier Imran Khan was being denied the right to meet his family in jail. He contended that his imprisonment was “unlawful”, and his remarks were not aired for half a minute. According to a clip uploaded by the NA, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq objected to certain remarks by Qaiser about the judiciary and expunged them. Echoing the KP government’s stance , Qaiser lamented that the province was not being provided with the funds allocated for it. He also highlighted the purported difference in the services provided to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz. “The chief minister of a province sits outside the Adiala jail to beg for a meeting, but he is denied . On the other hand, the chief minister of a province uses a government airplane when going to China and Brazil. Is this not one country but two constitutions?” he said. Noting the planned talks between the United States and Iran over their concerns, Qaiser said, “If Iran and America can sit for talks in Istanbul… then why not with Afghanistan, however much serious your concerns are?” The PTI MNA affirmed that Pakistan’s cross-border terrorism concerns with Kabul should be addressed, but stressed the importance of using diplomatic channels for it. “All our trade, our business, our livelihood is linked with Afghanistan, our survival is not [possible] without it,” he said. He asserted that his party wanted full implementation of the National Action Plan and the complete eradication of terrorism. “Since we are the victims, make a policy after speaking to us. We want the end of terrorism,” Qaiser said, calling for civilian supremacy and strong economic and foreign policies. Noting that even India and the US, which were seen as having strained relations , have now signed a trade deal , Qaiser contended that Pakistan was “moving towards isolation”. “We should revisit our policies. The state should act like a mother and remain within its jurisdiction, […] and this parliament should be rightfully elected,” the PTI leader said. JUI-F MNA Aliya Kamran questioned the “delayed” response of security forces during the attacks, and claimed the situation in some areas had yet to normalise, including in the Nushki district. She said reliable information had not been received from some areas of the province so far, adding that questions raised regarding Balochistan must be answered. “Where have the terrorists who escaped gone, and why is action not being taken against them?” she asked, stressing that the situation should be taken seriously. She also urged the House to reflect on why even women were becoming suicide bombers, wondering what reasons were behind this trend. According to the defence minister , women were involved in at least “two attacks in the 12 cities targeted”. “For God’s sake, save these children,” Kamran said, while suggesting the initiation of dialogue with the people of Balochistan. Usman Badini, another JUI-F lawmaker, said Balochistan had been “on fire” for the past 48 hours. “We are sitting here, crying and pleading. For God’s sake, take care of Balochistan,” he said. “Where was the writ of the state at the time of the attack?” he asked. “Balochistan gets electricity for only one hour […] the reason Balochistan is falling behind is the denial of rights,” the JUI-F leader noted. Stating that the people of Balochistan were not beggars, as they had resources, Badini said, “There is no need for anyone to do politics in the name of Balochistan”. He pointed out that those who spoke about their rights were labelled a traitor. “Dialogue must be held with all those who accept the flag of Pakistan; otherwise, the problem will not be resolved,” he emphasised. Speaking after Chaudhry tabled the resolution, PTI’s Noor Alam Khan highlighted the rise in terrorist incidents in KP, pointing out that even school and college buildings were targeted . “Whoever is doing terrorism in Pakistan cannot be a patriot,” he said. The PTI lawmaker requested that the terrorism concerns of KP also be incorporated in the resolution as “terrorism is the highest there”. “Our women, sisters and daughters are unable to study there. Please [add] this in the resolution,” he said. PPP MNA Sehar Kamran emphasised that the Balochistan attacks could not be seen in isolation, noting there was a “nexus” between the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and India. “The aim was not just to target Balochistan, but to target Pakistan,” she said, adding that those responsible for “external interference” wanted to create instability in the province and weaken the country. Sehar backed Alam’s opinion that KP was also adversely impacted by terrorism. “To attack nine to 12 places in a coordinated manner requires tactical and logistic support. I think it is clear that there is external involvement,” the PPP MNA said, stressing the need for national unity to combat it. During his speech, Ejazul Haq of the PML-Zia pointed out that the benches of federal ministers were empty despite an “important matter” being discussed. He noted that Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai had made “correct” statements about the deprivation of Sui-supplied gas faced by the people of Balochistan. A day ago, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had briefed the lower house of Parliament on the security situation in Balochistan. In his remarks on the NA floor on Monday, Asif had rejected any attempt to justify violence in the name of political or nationalist movements, saying the state’s “bottom line” was that no such rationalisation would be allowed. Referring to the recent wave of coordinated terrorist attacks in Balochistan, he said these acts were being falsely portrayed as a freedom struggle to legitimise what he described as organised criminal activity. ‘Province being provided significant financial support’ State Minister for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said Balochistan receives more than 40 per cent higher share than Punjab under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, stressing that the province is being provided significant financial and development support by the federation. Addressing the house, Chaudhry stated that under the NFC formula, Balochistan receives more than double the per capita funds compared to Punjab and Sindh. The state minister said 91pc of the “financial resources spent in Balochistan are provided by the federal government”. Chuadhry further noted that the province has seen major infrastructural and institutional development. “Balochistan currently has 13 cadet colleges, 321 technical education institutions, and airports even in cities with populations of around 200,000. “Balochistan has 13 major hospitals, 757 basic health centres, and more than 25,000 kilometres of roads,” he added. Chaudhry questioned the targeting of public institutions, asking why attacks are carried out on schools and hospitals if the struggle is truly for rights. He emphasised that such acts “harm” ordinary citizens rather than addressing grievances. “Blocking highways, exploding bridges, and hijacking trains? What is the motive behind it, as common people use them?” he questioned. The interior official asserted that terrorists have no linguistic or religious affiliation. “TTP is using the beard (religion), and BLA is running their narrative upon Baloch identity; however, they have nothing to do with either of them.” Responding to the question of why sporting events were being held in the country despite terrorist attacks, he said, “That’s what terrorists want.” “Terrorists want to tell the world that by halting the business, trade, markets, and sporting events, they have paralysed us. We will not let this happen.” Chaudhry also criticised New Delhi, saying that despite condemnations from all over the world of the Balochistan attacks, “only India” refrained from it. He added that security forces were playing their part in the fight against terrorism, and the political leadership had to back them with a joint narrative. Balochistan attacks The attacks took place on Saturday in Quetta and several other parts of Balochistan, where militants carried out coordinated assaults on security forces and civilian targets across the province. According to the military’s media wing, the January 31 attacks were reported from the provincial capital as well as Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni, prompting an immediate and widespread security response. A police officer walks past damage at the site, after militant attacks, in Quetta on Feb 1, 2026. — Reuters The Inter-Services Public Relations said security forces and law enforcement agencies launched clearance operations in the affected areas, killing 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers, while 15 security personnel were martyred. The attacks also claimed the lives of at least 18 civilians, including women, children, elderly people and labourers, particularly in Gwadar and Kharan. The military said intelligence reports confirmed that the assaults were orchestrated by terrorist leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who remained in contact with the attackers throughout the incidents.",

I think it is clear that there is external involvement,” the PPP MNA said, stressing the need for national unity to combat it. During his speech, Ejazul Haq of the PML-Zia pointed out that the benches of federal ministers were empty despite an “important matter” being discussed. He noted that Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai had made “correct” statements about the deprivation of Sui-supplied gas faced by the people of Balochistan. A day ago, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had briefed the lower house of Parliament on the security situation in Balochistan. In his remarks on the NA floor on Monday, Asif had rejected any attempt to justify violence in the name of political or nationalist movements, saying the state’s “bottom line” was that no such rationalisation would be allowed. Referring to the recent wave of coordinated terrorist attacks in Balochistan, he said these acts were being falsely portrayed as a freedom struggle to legitimise what he described as organised criminal activity. ‘Province being provided significant financial support’ State Minister for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said Balochistan receives more than 40 per cent higher share than Punjab under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, stressing that the province is being provided significant financial and development support by the federation. Addressing the house, Chaudhry stated that under the NFC formula, Balochistan receives more than double the per capita funds compared to Punjab and Sindh. The state minister said 91pc of the “financial resources spent in Balochistan are provided by the federal government”. Chuadhry further noted that the province has seen major infrastructural and institutional development. “Balochistan currently has 13 cadet colleges, 321 technical education institutions, and airports even in cities with populations of around 200,000. “Balochistan has 13 major hospitals, 757 basic health centres, and more than 25,000 kilometres of roads,” he added. Chaudhry questioned the targeting of public institutions, asking why attacks are carried out on schools and hospitals if the struggle is truly for rights. He emphasised that such acts “harm” ordinary citizens rather than addressing grievances. “Blocking highways, exploding bridges, and hijacking trains? What is the motive behind it, as common people use them?” he questioned. The interior official asserted that terrorists have no linguistic or religious affiliation. “TTP is using the beard (religion), and BLA is running their narrative upon Baloch identity; however, they have nothing to do with either of them.” Responding to the question of why sporting events were being held in the country despite terrorist attacks, he said, “That’s what terrorists want.” “Terrorists want to tell the world that by halting the business, trade, markets, and sporting events, they have paralysed us. We will not let this happen.” Chaudhry also criticised New Delhi, saying that despite condemnations from all over the world of the Balochistan attacks, “only India” refrained from it. He added that security forces were playing their part in the fight against terrorism, and the political leadership had to back them with a joint narrative. Balochistan attacks The attacks took place on Saturday in Quetta and several other parts of Balochistan, where militants carried out coordinated assaults on security forces and civilian targets across the province. According to the military’s media wing, the January 31 attacks were reported from the provincial capital as well as Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni, prompting an immediate and widespread security response. A police officer walks past damage at the site, after militant attacks, in Quetta on Feb 1, 2026. — Reuters The Inter-Services Public Relations said security forces and law enforcement agencies launched clearance operations in the affected areas, killing 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers, while 15 security personnel were martyred. The attacks also claimed the lives of at least 18 civilians, including women, children, elderly people and labourers, particularly in Gwadar and Kharan. The military said intelligence reports confirmed that the assaults were orchestrated by terrorist leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who remained in contact with the attackers throughout the incidents.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) told the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday that its recent tree-cutting drive in the capital was conducted on the direct instructions of the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO). The statement was part of a written report submitted to the court in response to a petition challenging the CDA’s tree-cutting drive, which had drawn significant public criticism. Recently, large-scale tree removal took place in at least three locations in Islamabad, including acres of tree cover around Shakarparian, drawing criticism alleging large-scale environmental damage. However, authorities have maintained that only Paper Mulberry trees were cut down as they were a major cause of allergies. In its submission, the CDA defended the campaign as a “well-planned operation” aimed at removing Paper Mulberry trees, which it described as a major source of pollen allergies and asthma in Islamabad. The authority cited scientific research, including a study published in the Journal of Global Health , linking Paper Mulberry pollen to increased asthma attacks and hospital visits. The authority further claimed that the tree species deteriorated air quality and soil health. The CDA stated that the decision to remove the trees followed a multi-step process: a 2022 order from the IHC led to the formation of an Environment Committee, which recommended the trees’ removal in May 2023. A public hearing was later held in July 2023, it said. According to the CDA report, the issue gained attention after a journalist’s column in November 2024, prompting the PMO to direct the Ministry of Health and CDA to take action. Subsequent meetings resulted in the PMO issuing formal directions to implement a pollen allergy management plan, the authority said. The CDA denied allegations that it cut down trees other than Paper Mulberry, or that the drive was a cover for development projects. It stated that trees for projects like the ‘Marka-i-Haq Monument’ were transplanted to other locations. The authority also argued that no separate environmental approval was needed because the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (PAK-EPA) was part of the committee that recommended the action. The CDA has asked the court to dismiss the petition, calling it “without merit”. It is worth mentioning that environmental conservation organisation WWF-Pakistan, in a statement, had disputed Islamabad authorities’ stance that paper mulberry trees were removed due to a rise in pollen allergies, stating that the action was also linked to infrastructure development. “WWF-Pakistan’s field assessments indicate that vegetation loss in the capital is not limited to Paper Mulberry management alone, but is also linked to infrastructure development in multiple locations,” the environmental body had said.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Former federal minister Shireen Mazari on Tuesday approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC), seeking urgent judicial intervention to allow her to meet her imprisoned daughter, human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, and son-in-law Hadi Ali Chatha, both held in Adiala jail. A sessions court had sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case pertaining to controversial social media posts. In a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, Mazari, through prominent lawyers including Kamran Murtaza, members of the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) Raja Aleem Abbasi, Chaudhry Hafeezullah Yaqub, Zafar Khokhar, Asif Irfan, Abdul Rehman Hur Bajwa, President Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) Syed Wajid Ali Gillani, President District Bar Association Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar, Riasat Ali Azad, and others, alleged that jail authorities had completely cut off the detainees from family contact and legal counsel, without any written order, recorded reasons, or lawful justification. The petition states that Imaan and Hadi were convicted on January 24, 2026, in a case registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, and have since been held in “continuous judicial custody”. Despite repeated requests, the petitioner — mother of Imaan and mother-in-law of Hadi — has been denied visitation rights and kept in the dark about their physical and mental health, medical care, and jail conditions. The plea contends that the detainees have also been deprived of confidential access to their lawyers, obstructing their ability to file an appeal against their conviction — a time-sensitive legal remedy. It argues that such “complete and indefinite denial” amounts to “incommunicado detention,” violating constitutional guarantees under Articles 4, 9, 10-A, and 14, which protect the rights to due process, dignity, fair trial, and humane treatment. The petition further invokes the Punjab Prison Rules, 1978, and international standards such as the UN Nelson Mandela Rules, asserting that the state has a heightened duty of care toward individuals in custody. In her interim relief request, Mazari has urged the IHC to issue immediate directions allowing temporary family visits and legal consultations pending the final decision of the writ. The respondents in the petition include the Federation of Pakistan through the secretary of Interior, the inspector general of police Islamabad, and the superintendent of Adiala Jail. The IHC is yet to fix a hearing date on the petition. The case The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCI) in Islamabad. The NCCIA complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts. The First Information Report (FIR) of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Judge Majoka issued arrest warrants for the couple on Nov 5, 2025. Later that month, a court-appointed lawyer for the couple refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying he could not “ask questions dictated” to him. Subsequently, they were appointed a new lawyer by the court. After multiple hearings and repeated non-appearances, the court cancelled their interim bail on January 14 and days later, reissued arrest warrants for them. Later, the two challenged their arrest orders before the IHC. Separately, a case related to a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo. The IHC had granted them pre-arrest bail in the case. Separataely, on January 23, Imaan and Hadi were arrested by the police in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025. They were then sent to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.",
