      "title_orig": "PCB seeks Pakistan-India match referee’s removal from Asia Cup over alleged violations of ICC rules",
      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against the match referee for yesterday’s Asia Cup game between Pakistan and India over his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket”, PCB Chairperson Mohsin Naqvi said. “The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket,” Naqvi posted on X, referring to referee Andy Pycroft. “The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the match referee from the Asia Cup,” he added. According to an earlier press release by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Pycroft was scheduled to be the match referee for the Pakistan-UAE match on Wednesday. The Asia Cup match between the two sides took place on Sunday in Dubai, where spinners led by Kuldeep Yadav helped India beat Pakistan by seven wickets as the neighbours met on the cricket pitch for the first time since a military conflict between them in May. After hitting the winning shot, Suryakumar and his teammates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts. The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government”. In the post-match presentation, Suryakumar said India took the match against Pakistan as “just another game” and dedicated the win to the Indian armed forces. “We stand with the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack, and we express our solidarity,” Suryakumar said. “We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.” The April 22 attack on civilians in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam triggered Pakistan-India hostilities in May. New Delhi, without evidence, accused Pakistan of backing the attack — a charge Islamabad strongly denies . After the match, the PCB confirmed to Dawn.com that Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema had “registered a protest against the match referees’ behaviour.” “It was against the sportsman spirit that the Indian team did not shake hands,” the PCB statement quoted the manager as saying. It alleged that the “match referee had asked the captains not to shake hands at the time of the toss”. Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony as a reaction to the Indian team’s move. Pakistan’s coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason Salman was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match. “It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said. Following the developments, PCB chief Naqvi earlier today said on X: “Utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today. Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports. “Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace.” The match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘ boycott ’ the fixture. The Indian cricket board had said it could not boycott an international event and that such a move would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”. New Delhi only cleared the match in a recently announced sports policy , saying the Indian national team can play Pakistan in multi-national events but not in bilateral competitions. Pakistan last played a bilateral series against India in 2012, when the Green Shirts toured India for an ODI and T20I series.",

      "summary_orig": "The Manchester mayor has never been shy about his ambitions. But is he planning to capitalise on a weakening Starmer? Good morning. It’s been a torrid summer of getting screamed at, dumped on and generally run ragged by those who wouldn’t even be there without you. But enough about my paternity leave: today’s newsletter is about Keir Starmer’s wobbling Labour leadership, and the man some of his own MPs want to replace him in No 10. In some ways, Andy Burnham is not an obvious candidate to replace Starmer: he is a throwback to a past Labour era, a figure once viewed as an uber-Blairite, and he’s not even an MP. But in the last couple of weeks, without any explicit challenge, the Greater Manchester mayor has been strikingly prominent. The resignation of senior aide Paul Ovenden yesterday, over offensive messages he sent about Diane Abbott in 2017, will have done little to soothe those sceptical of Starmer’s intent to use the visit of Donald Trump to reset his premiership – and story after story has suggested that Burnham is working quietly, but doggedly, to capitalise. Far right | Downing Street has fiercely condemned Elon Musk for using “dangerous and inflammatory” language, after he told a crowd of protesters in London that “violence is coming” and “you either fight back or you die”. Police are looking for 11 people suspected of committing violent disorder at the march and have charged eight others. UK politics | The MP Danny Kruger has defected from the Conservatives to Reform UK, declaring the Tory party “is over” and Nigel Farage is the “new custodian” of conservatism and the political right’s “last hope” of governing Britain. UK news | Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who caused the death of their newborn baby after taking her to live in a tent in wintry conditions to evade social services, have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison. Technology | Jamieson Greer, a US trade representative, said on Monday that Washington and Beijing have struck a framework agreement on transferring TikTok to US-controlled ownership. Espionage | The UK government says it is “extremely disappointed” by a decision to drop charges of spying for China against two men , one of whom was a parliamentary aide.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Apart from the affluent sheikhs of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, who lavished Pakistan’s dignitaries — including visiting bureaucrats — with expensive gifts, mainly wristwatches, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif received a traditional golden dagger during the first six months of 2025. The Toshakhana record, made public by the cabinet division for the period between January and June 2025, lists high-value items such as watches, luxury vehicles, carpets, handicrafts, and traditional artefacts presented to top state functionaries, including the president, prime minister, ministers, and senior officials during foreign visits and local engagements. The data, comprising 137 entries, records gifts received from heads of state, royal families, diplomats, and business delegations. However, the value of these gifts is still being assessed by the cabinet division. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received a total of 61 gifts, mostly decorative and traditional items. These included several high-end wristwatches. Notably, on the first day of 2025, he was presented with two luxury wristwatches — an IWC Schaffhausen and a Panerai, both with warranty cards — by Sheikh Abdul Hadi Mana Al-Hajri of Qatar. Record shows PM received 61 out of total 137 gifts presented to state officials The Shah of the State of Selangor, Malaysia, gifted PM Shehbaz a ‘Golden Kris’ — a traditional Malaysian dagger. Additionally, the president of Turkiye presented him with an electric car. During his visit to Azerbaijan, the prime minister received a handmade silk carpet and other items. The President of Tajikistan gifted him a box containing a golden teacup with a spoon. While in Saudi Arabia , PM Shehbaz received a model of Mimbar-e-Rasool from Prince Mansour Bin Muhammad Bin Saad bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, and a wooden box containing two documents — the Charter of Makkah in English and Arabic — from Dr Mohammad Abdulkareem Al-Issa, Secretary General of the Muslim World League. From Iran , the PM was presented with a wall hanging and a shield by the Chief of General Staff. Other gifts included handmade carpets, onyx decorations, paintings, tea sets, books, and shields. Interestingly, while the Saudi hosts did not overwhelm the prime minister with lavish gifts, several Pakistani officials visiting the Kingdom — led by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — received high-end wristwatches. On Jan 28, Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia gifted six Rolex watches, five Tudor watches, three Black Armin watches, and nine Frank Rosha watches to Pakistani officials, primarily government officers. The record shows that President Asif Ali Zardari received 11 gifts, including a ladies’ suit and a bedsheet from the High Commissioner of Bangladesh. The most valuable among his gifts was an electric vehicle from the president of Turkiye. He also received a carpet from the Iranian foreign minister, as well as vases, candle stands, shields, a coffee set, and onyx items. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received several Afghan carpets and traditional bowls, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was presented with prayer mats and Turkish handicrafts. Other ministers, advisers, and security officials were gifted watches, rugs, wall hangings, and porcelain items. Published in Dawn, September 16th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "THE world is in ferment but is South Asia feeling the rumble? Europe is on edge. It’s losing the Ukraine war , and the leaders of France, Germany and the UK, to name a few, are facing the economic and political heat. The US is becoming ever more unpopular abroad and fractured at home, the slide underscored by the killing of a white supremacist by a white youth belonging to a family of Donald Trump’s supporters. The Republican governor of Utah, where the killing happened, bemoaned the fact that the killer was white and not someone from a minority community or immigrant, robbing the right-wing of a handy ruse to target what the Americans call the left. Trump seems also to be reheating the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine that imperiously forbade foreign intrusion in the American hemisphere. Venezuela, for one, has been targeted for its ties with Iran and China. In Brazil, President Lula jailed right-wing opponent Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup against his elected government. Argentina’s pro-US president is reportedly losing the plot and possibly confidence too in the advice he would get from his pet dog whose bark or woof decided political and economic matters. In Eura­sia, by contrast, the Shanghai club has got a new spring in its march since China hosted a landmark summit followed by an earthshaking display of preparedness for war should one ever be imposed. In West Asia, the Arab and Muslim world is grappling with Israel’s genocidal impunity in Gaza and its murderous assault on Doha, not without the knowledge of the US defence forces stationed in the country. Trump, though denies knowing the attack was coming. In South Asia, Nepal saw violent protests agai­nst the ruling elite, evicting the government of a three-term prime minister. Indian media was hoping the violence would restore the evicted monarchy with its Hindu motifs, which is not happening. Since the monarch was regarded as an avatar of Lord Vishnu, it would require tearing up the secular constitution, unlikely to ever happen. Indians seem unaware that whoever rules Kathmandu, king or parliament, China has kept excellent ties with them. There’s the story, for example, of the king asking China to repatriate Maoist guerrillas hiding there. And China handed them over post-haste. As ferment goes, the short-lived street violence in Nepal doesn’t quite seem to fit the description of any upheaval. The interim rulers in Bangladesh have set elections in March. If the victory of the Jamaat-i-Islami-backed students in the Dhaka University polls is any indication the country’s and possibly the region’s future looks set for interesting times but little more. Meanwhile, the leftist president of Sri Lanka has jailed pro-US former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for alleged graft. The president of the Maldives, for his part, was heading to Doha to participate in the Arab Muslim nations’ response to Israel’s widening aggression against whoever it chooses to target with the blessings of the Trump administration. Meanwhile, though it could have been more cheerful, India and Pakistan played a cricket match in Dubai. The good news was marred by a curious censure of the fixture by India’s opposition parties. Relief from the pervasive stuffiness came with the Pakistani envoy at the UN delivering a heartwarming speech slamming Israel’s occupation of Palestine even as he lambasted the genocide in Gaza. While India, true to form, sig­ned a slew of defence deals with visiting far-right Israeli finance minister, scandalising much of the Global South and possibly even Europe, which has blacklisted the hateful Bezalel Smotrich. An apocryphal story ascribed to Pakistan’s fabled poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz describes the South Asian tremors nicely. His comrades were reportedly discussing threats to Pakistan in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. India was eyeing Sindh. Iran was drooling over Balochistan, and the USSR was pondering the warm water ports of Pakistan. Did Faiz agree? The poet, the story goes, took a long puff of his cigarette, flicked the ash, pon­­d­­ered thoughtfully and concluded: “The biggest threat to Pakistan is that nothing will change.” As ferment goes, the short-lived street violence in Nepal doesn’t quite seem to fit the description of any upheaval. Nepal is a country after all that not long ago overthrew its centuries-old religiously ordained monarchy, declared itself a secular republic and turned armed Maoist guerrillas into parliamentary democrats. The issues of corruption and nepotism are being highlighted as the main elements in Kathmandu’s recent protests. Both issues are genuine, of course, and played a key role in fomenting anger against the elected but allegedly corrupt government. Such issues, however, have the propensity to surrender their political capital to the most unworthy alternative. Pakistan and India have seen surges of anti-corruption movements without the core shifting from its rut. The India Against Corruption camp­a­i­­gn, for example, promised to rid the country of in­­­vidious crony capitalism and deep-set corruption. It targeted Manmohan Singh’s second term and delivered Narendra Modi instead. Likewise, practically every ruler in Pakistan, civilian or in unif­orm, has come with the promise of cleaning up the system but ended up tilting at windmills at best. While a leftist government was in bad odour in Nepal, it was the opposite in Sri Lanka where the economy improved under an erstwhile leftist guerrilla president. The Maldives too is doing fine with its own leftist president. And so, life continues along its undulating pattern of ups and downs. Yet, across South Asia, much has changed in the last four decades, mostly for the better. Remember Dhaka’s first Saarc summit in 1985. Rajiv Gandhi represented the only functioning democracy there. Nepal’s absolute monarch was feted with Gen Ziaul Haq, autocratic Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and Junius Jayewardene. Bhutan was an absolute monarchy too, and the host was military dictator Gen. Husain Muhammad Ershad. Much has changed albeit not as much as Faiz would have wanted. South Asian democracies should count their blessings — and hope for the best for India. That’s how the roles have changed. The writer is Dawn’s correspondent in Delhi. jawednaqvi@gmail.com Published in Dawn, September 16th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "IT is apparently a very simple proposition. The Afghan Taliban can either cooperate with Pakistan and eliminate safe havens for the banned TTP and other terrorist outfits on their soil. Or they can continue to nurture an array of violent outfits and sour Afghanistan’s chances of regional integration and greater diplomatic recognition, along with torpedoing any chances of better ties with Pakistan. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made the offer to Kabul’s rulers while visiting Bannu on Saturday, asking the Afghan Taliban to “choose between Pakistan and TTP”. The PM’s comments reflect the frustration of the administration towards the Taliban. The current dispensation has tried both carrots and sticks with Kabul to help stop terrorist attacks from Afghanistan-based militants, but neither approach has delivered results. The frustration is understandable because terrorist attacks have resulted in high troop losses for Pakistan. Just last week, at least 19 troops were martyred during operations against terrorists in KP. The military also says that Afghan nationals have been involved in attacks on Pakistan. To its credit, Pakistan has tried to mend fences diplomatically with the Afghan Taliban, and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has undertaken several visits to Kabul. Additionally, a trilateral mechanism involving Pakistan, China and Afghanistan has been launched to try and ‘mainstream’ the Taliban, offering them incentives for cutting ties with terrorist groups. On the other hand, Pakistan has also undertaken kinetic action inside Afghanistan to target militant sanctuaries. However, so far, neither method has been successful in convincing the Taliban to change their ways. It is true that the TTP and the Afghan Taliban are linked by ideology. But if the Taliban seek greater engagement with the outside world, they must decide whether to stay wedded to their ideology, or assure their neighbours that they will not allow terrorist groups to threaten regional security. The Taliban may be reluctant to act against militant groups; however, they must guarantee that these violent actors will not pose a threat to neighbouring states. The Taliban’s denial that they are hosting militants does not fly, as a special UN monitoring body has confirmed on several occasions that various militant groups, including the TTP, are active in Afghanistan. For Pakistan, the dilemma is acute. The status quo is obviously not an option, as anti-Pakistan terrorist groups find sanctuary and support in Afghanistan. However, cutting ties with the Taliban is not a viable option either, as it may drive the Afghan rulers into a more extreme direction. The least bad option at present seems to be limited engagement with Kabul, with pressure from regional states, especially China, on the Taliban to do more against the militants. Moreover, Pakistan must also improve its counterterrorism methods to stop the infiltration of terrorists, and prevent troop and civilian losses. Published in Dawn, September 16th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "India’s Supreme Court has suspended key provisions of a controversial new law that changes how properties donated by Muslims are owned and managed in the country. The Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025 was criticised by opposition parties and challenged for violating the rights of the Muslim community to manage their own religious endowments, which are typically used as schools or mosques, while the Modi government asserts that it will make managing the properties more transparent, according to a BBC News report . In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties — sometimes worth billions of dollars — are important to India’s 200 million Muslims as they are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages — and cannot be sold for any other purpose. Allows nomination of non-Muslims to waqf board Historically, these properties have been governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level waqf boards to manage them. But in April this year, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led government amended the act, including changes to how a waqf property is determined and managed, sparking criticism from the community. On Monday, the SC bench comprising Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai and Justice A.G. Masih refused to strike down the entire law, saying that “the grant of stay is only in the rarest of rare category”. Controversial clauses It did, however, halt a controversial provision that allowed the government to decide whether a disputed property is waqf or not. Over the years, many properties that were donated through oral declarations or community customs have been legitimised as waqf properties because of their continuous use by the Muslim community. But under the new law, waqf boards were required to provide valid documents to claim a property as waqf. In case of disputes, the final decision rested with the government. The court struck down the rule, saying that allowing the government to determine the rights of a citizen would go against the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary, mandated under the constitution. Another contentious provision that was scrapped was a clause that required a waqf donor to be a practising Muslim for at least five years. The waqf properties are currently managed by state-level boards and a central council, with nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of state bar council, Islamic scholars and the managers of these properties. While the judges refused to stay a provision that allows the nomination of non-Muslims to the waqf board, they limited the number of non-Muslim members to four in the 22-member federal board and to three in the 11-member state boards. The court also said, “Efforts should be made to appoint the chief executive officer of the board from amongst the Muslim community.” The case reached the top court in early April, soon after the law was passed by parliament amid widespread criticism.

The home bowlers then combined to dismiss Oman for 130 in 18.4 overs for their first win in this edition of the regional tournament played in the T20 format. Medium-pace bowler Junaid Siddique stood out with figures of 4-23. Haider Ali and Muhammad Jawadullah took two wickets each.

Sharafu fell for his 51, but Waseem kept up the charge and reached fifty with a six. The captain was run out in the final over. UAE play Pakistan, who went down to tournament favourites India in a key match, next on Wednesday, with the winner likely to move into the Super Four stage of the eight-nation event. Oman were never in the chase and lost five wickets for 50 runs with captain and opener Jatinder Singh scoring 20 as they slumped to a second straight defeat. Defending champions India, who won the previous edition played in a 50-overs format, lead the table in Group A with two wins in two matches are nearly through to the next stage.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan captain Fatima Sana said on Monday that her team’s focus was on the Women’s World Cup ahead of the one-day international (ODI) series against South Africa in Lahore. The World Cup , to be hosted later this month under a hybrid model across India and Sri Lanka, will see all of Pakistan’s fixtures staged in Colombo, with political tensions ruling out travel between the two neighbours. Pakistan open their immediate run-in with a three-match ODI series against South Africa in Lahore from Tuesday, following the conclusion of a training camp at the National Cricket Academy and the Gaddafi Stadium. Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Lahore, Fatima said: “The specific aim is to prepare for the World Cup and execute our plans in this series.” “A series like this is very beneficial for the team ahead of the World Cup. It gives the players a good opportunity to put into practice all the preparation they have done in recent times,“ she was quoted as having said by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). She added that it is widely known that Pakistan rely on their bowling attack, so this time the Green Team’s focus will be on getting more support from the batting unit as well. “We worked a lot on batting during the camp,” the Pakistani skipper said. The ODIs will be staged at the Gaddafi Stadium on September 16, 19 and 22, with the first ball of all matches to be bowled at 3:30pm, according to the PCB. Pakistan’s 15-member squad will be captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt will lead the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches. The squad features one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August. In Pakistan, the fans will be able to watch the matches on A Sports , while live-streaming for viewers across the Pakistan region will be available on Tamasha. Cricbuzz and Sportainment (Middle-East and North Africa), Super Sports (Africa), Sports Central (Global outside Pakistan), and Willow TV (North America) will broadcast matches internationally, the PCB added. The forthcoming series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka. In head-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on September 14, 2023.",
