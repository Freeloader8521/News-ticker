Proscription makes it a criminal offence to belong to or support Palestine Action, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Well, I followed the clear advice and recommendations, going through a serious process that the Home Office goes through, involving different agencies and police advice as well, which was very clear about the recommendation for proscription of this group.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The sit-in by the main opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) at Parliament House over concerns regarding PTI founder Imran Khan’s health entered its third day on Sunday. After the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on February 12 that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, the TTAP announced it would stage a sit-in until the ex-premier was shifted to a hospital of his personal doctors’ choice. Although government figures on Saturday had hinted that Imran — currently incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail — will soon be shifted to a hospital, no such development had occurred till Sunday morning. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan shared visuals of him, TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, MNA Asad Qaiser and Senator Faisal Javed, among others, sitting at Parliament House. A TTAP leader, wishing not to be named, told Dawn that things have become more confusing rather than being streamlined. “Last night we were informed that Imran Khan will be shifted to Shifa International Hospital [in Islamabad], but a demand was made that doctors in the medical board be changed as including doctors of our choice will give a message that the government has gone on the back foot. “[Therefore,] we decided to show flexibility and gave names of a few more doctors, and there was an understanding that we will not reveal their names in the media,” the TTAP leader said. He added: “However, today we have been getting messages that first we should call off the sit-in and then Imran Khan will be shifted to the hospital and a medical board will be announced. How can we call off the sit-in without implementation of our demands?” he asked. Replying to a question, the leader said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi — who is staging a sit-in at KP House in the capital — also contacted government representatives to make it clear that the situation could go out of his control if the issue was not resolved soon. He added that the government representatives told them that the interior minister was in Sri Lanka, while the National Assembly and Senate chairs were also abroad, making it “difficult to decide” for the authorities. TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai told Dawn that it has been decided to continue the sit-in till the fulfilment of the demands. He termed it unfortunate that the police were allegedly not allowing breakfast to be delivered inside Parliament House for the opposition leaders. “There are a number of leaders who have diabetes, and it becomes difficult for them to maintain their sugar levels. I fear that some may faint,” he said. He wondered why the government was not showing flexibility and taking confidence-building measures if it was serious. Aleema demands Imran’s treatment as per personal doctors’ advice Earlier in the day, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said the party would not accept any medical board formed without the approval of the PTI founder’s personal doctors. Aleema referred to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry’s post from Saturday, which announced that a medical board would be set up. She added, “Secondly, we are hearing in news that Imran Khan is to be shifted to Al Shifa eye hospital in Rawalpindi. “Our demand has been clear from the beginning. Imran Khan shall not be given any treatment WITHOUT the presence and approval of his personal doctors and family members.” The former prime minister’s sister affirmed: “We do NOT accept any medical board they set up and control! We do NOT accept any reports or results they manufacture.” She added that the family was “extremely worried as to why they are resisting the selection of specialists advised” by Imran’s personal doctors. “Why are they rejecting the supervision by Imran Khan’s personal doctors? Why are they rejecting the presence of Imran Khan’s family members? Why such fierce resistance? Are they hiding something?” Aleema wondered. Earlier on Sunday, Imran’s longtime personal physicians Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan issued a joint video statement , reiterating that the ex-premier needed a comprehensive medical check-up that could be provided at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. “In addition to urgent retina specialist care for his central retinal vein occlusion and severe vision loss, Imran Khan needs a full multidisciplinary evaluation of his underlying conditions at a tertiary hospital like Shifa International Islamabad,” read the post accompanying their statement. HRCP calls for ‘uninterrupted access’ to treatment The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed “grave concern over reports regarding the deteriorating health of prisoners affiliated with the PTI, particularly” Imran and former Punjab health minister Yasmin Rashid. In a statement, the HRCP urged the interior ministry, the Punjab Home Department and the relevant prison authorities to ensure that “all such inmates are allowed immediate, independent medical examinations and uninterrupted access to prescribed treatment”. “Their condition must be verified with transparency,” the rights body stressed. It pointed out: “Denial or delay of adequate healthcare to any detainee violates legal and constitutional guarantees, including under the Prison Rules, as well as Pakistan’s human rights obligations.” Awaam Pakistan leader Dr Zafar Mirza, noting the government’s assurances and the development of Imran speaking to his sons on phone, said: “Last two days have proven the power of non-violent peaceful protest, as it has before many times in human history. “Decision to let Imran Khan speak with his sons, move him to hospital, establishment of a medical board, all this has not happened in a vacuum and for nothing.” However, Dr Mirza stressed that the former premier “still needs access to personal physician, family and his cases also need to be heard without politically motivated delays”. “Awaam Pakistan is fully supporting the dharna (sit-in) as we are standing with the moral principle of human right to health care and we are standing on the right side of the history,” he affirmed.",

      "summary_orig": "Iran is ready to consider compromises to reach a nuclear deal with the United States if Washington is willing to discuss lifting sanctions, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC in an interview published on Sunday. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions, but has repeatedly ruled out linking the issue to other questions, including missiles. Takht-Ravanchi confirmed that a second round of nuclear talks would take place on Tuesday in Geneva, after Tehran and Washington resumed discussions in Oman earlier this month. “[Initial talks went] more or less in a positive direction, but it is too early to judge,” Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC. A US delegation, including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, a source had told Reuters on Friday, with Omani representatives mediating the US-Iran contacts. Iran’s atomic chief said on Monday the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted. Takht-Ravanchi used this example in the BBC interview to highlight Iran’s flexibility. The senior diplomat reiterated Tehran’s stance that it would not accept zero uranium enrichment, which had been a key impediment to reaching a deal last year, with the US viewing enrichment inside Iran as a pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking such nuclear weapons. During his first term in office, Trump pulled the US out of a 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the signature foreign policy achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama. The deal eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear programme to prevent it from being able to make an atomic bomb.",

      "summary_orig": "Former US president Barack Obama criticised a lack of shame and decorum in the country’s political discourse, responding on Saturday for the first time to a post on Donald Trump’s social media account that depicted him and first lady Michelle as monkeys. In a wide-ranging podcast interview with left-wing political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released on Saturday, Obama also compared the actions of agents enforcing the president’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to dictatorships. The video, shared on Trump’s Truth Social account on February 5, sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting “fake outrage” only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and taking it down. Near the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump’s 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, the Obamas — the first Black president and first lady in US history — were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second. “The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven’t seen before…Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape’s body,” Cohen said in the interview. “And so again, we’ve seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?” Without naming Trump, Obama responded by saying the majority of Americans “find this behaviour deeply troubling”. “There’s this sort of clown show that’s happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That’s been lost.” ‘Rogue behaviour’ Obama predicted that such messaging would hurt Trump’s Republicans in midterm elections, saying, “ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people”. Trump has told reporters he stood by the thrust of the video’s claims about election fraud, but that he had not seen the offensive clip at the end. Turning to Trump’s policies, Obama criticised his immigration crackdown in Minnesota and blasted the conduct of agents during the controversial weeks-long operation that was brought to an end this week. Obama called the behaviour of federal officers, which included two fatal shootings that sparked mounting pressure on Trump’s mass crackdown, as the sort that “in the past we’ve seen in authoritarian countries and we’ve seen in dictatorships”. Thousands of federal agents — including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — carried out weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in what the Trump administration claims were targeted missions against criminals. “The rogue behaviour of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous,” Obama said. But he added he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations. “Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organised way, citizens saying, ‘this is not the America we believe in,’ and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests,” he said. “That kind of heroic, sustained behaviour in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope. “As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this.” The aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota had triggered large protests and nationwide outrage. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was subject to a partial government shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Democrats are opposing any new DHS funding until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.",

But he added he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations. “Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organised way, citizens saying, ‘this is not the America we believe in,’ and we’re going to fight back, and we’re going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests,” he said. “That kind of heroic, sustained behaviour in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope. “As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this.” The aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota had triggered large protests and nationwide outrage. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was subject to a partial government shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of Trump’s immigration crackdown. Democrats are opposing any new DHS funding until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.",

      "summary_orig": "• DHA, Clifton residential plots up 25-50pc; commercial plots surge 25-75pc • Industrial investment in Karachi remains weak; investors shifting to Nooriabad, Jhampir KARACHI: Property prices in Karachi have increased over the past two years, but the gains have lagged behind the unexpected returns in equities and gold. Investors have been drawn to bullion amid global uncertainty, including market swings linked to US President Donald Trump’s shifting stance on tariffs and threats of military action against various countries. Pakistan’s stock market has also posted strong gains over the past two years, repeatedly setting new highs amid political and economic developments, lower interest rates and investor reluctance to hold US dollars. One tola gold on Jan 1, 2024, was available at Rs219,700 as compared to the current price of Rs526,962 on Saturday, reversing from a record peak of Rs572,862 on Jan 29, 2026. On Feb 13, the KSE-100 Index closed at 179,603.73 points, almost three times higher than its level of 64,661.78 points on Jan 1, 2024. Muhammad Shafi Jhakvani, vice president of the Defence and Clifton Association of Real Estate Agents (DEFCLAREA), said the prices of DHA and Clifton residential plots have increased by 25-50 per cent in different blocks and phases in the last two years followed by 25-75pc in commercial plots. Apartment prices have risen by 10-40pc. For example, the price of a three-bedroom apartment in a good vicinity of Clifton like Bath Island and Civil Lines, which was available at Rs 55-60 million in 2023-24, have now touched Rs75-80m and even higher in some projects. Similarly in DHA, the 1,500 square feet apartment’s price was Rs20,000 per sq ft (Rs30-32m), and is now around Rs28,000-30,000 per sq ft (Rs40-45m). The prices of 500- and 1000-square-yard bungalows have also gone up by 10-25pc. Normally in Pakistan and in Karachi, rental returns are 0.25pc per month and 3-4pc per annum. In residential properties, it also increases according to price hike and in some smaller units, it rises more than that because of shortage of rental inventories, he said. “Bungalow rent also soars according to rising prices but portions are in high demand because of again shortage of inventory,” Mr Shafi said. He said investors are active in Clifton commercial plots as big plots and prices have become costlier drastically in the last two years. In DHA Phase 8, the price has surged as investors have been very active since 2024. He expected new benchmarks in 2026, particularly in Phase 8 for both residential and commercial properties. Abdul Wahab Parekh, owner of Parekh Estate, said new 500-yard and 1,000-yard bungalows were increasingly being built as ground-plus-one units, often with swimming pools in the basement. A 500-yard ground-plus-one bungalow now costs Rs100-250m, depending on location, compared with Rs80-160m two years ago. A 1,000-yard ground-plus-one bungalow in DHA cost Rs130-450m, depending on the phase, compared with Rs110-350m two years ago, he said. Flat prices in various DHA phases were now around Rs20,000-35,000 per square foot compared to Rs15,000-20,000 two years ago. In Clifton, he said, a three-bedroom apartment (old or new) cost Rs25-50m, compared with Rs20-40m previously. Mr Parekh said commercial plot prices had also increased. In PECHS and on Sharea Faisal (left side towards the airport), commercial plots were priced at Rs1.5-2m per square yard, compared with Rs1-1.2m earlier. On the right side, they ranged from Rs1m to Rs1.5m compared to Rs700,000 to Rs1.2m. On Shaheed-i-Millat Road, he said, commercial plots were around Rs1.5m per square yard, up from Rs800,000 to Rs1m two years ago. He described I.I. Chundrigar Road as a slow market, with rates pegged at Rs400,000 per square foot. On the industrial side, Mr Parekh said no major new investment had arrived in Karachi in the last 50 years, with many owners dividing premises and land for non-industrial uses. Investors were shifting towards Nooriabad and Jhampir due to lower rates, he said, adding that 60-70pc of land along the Super Highway was “risky and controversial”. Mohammad Najeeb, a member of the Supreme Council of the North Nazimabad Association of Real Estate Agents (NNAREA), said the price of a 240-yard ground-plus-one house had remained more or less unchanged at Rs55-65m over the past two years, while a 400-yard ground-plus-one bungalow had risen to Rs60-70m from Rs45-50m. He said 600-yard ground-plus-one bungalows remained in the Rs70-100m range, while 1,000-yard ground-plus-one bungalows cost Rs180-200m, up from Rs140-150m two years ago. In North Nazimabad, he said, an old two-bedroom flat without a lift, generator or parking cost Rs5-7m. New flats with facilities were priced at Rs15-17.5m, up from just over Rs10m. Old three-bedroom flats were priced at Rs10-12.5m, up from Rs8-9m, while new three-bedroom units with facilities were priced at Rs17.5-35m, compared with Rs15-20m two years ago.

He said investors are active in Clifton commercial plots as big plots and prices have become costlier drastically in the last two years. In DHA Phase 8, the price has surged as investors have been very active since 2024. He expected new benchmarks in 2026, particularly in Phase 8 for both residential and commercial properties. Abdul Wahab Parekh, owner of Parekh Estate, said new 500-yard and 1,000-yard bungalows were increasingly being built as ground-plus-one units, often with swimming pools in the basement. A 500-yard ground-plus-one bungalow now costs Rs100-250m, depending on location, compared with Rs80-160m two years ago. A 1,000-yard ground-plus-one bungalow in DHA cost Rs130-450m, depending on the phase, compared with Rs110-350m two years ago, he said. Flat prices in various DHA phases were now around Rs20,000-35,000 per square foot compared to Rs15,000-20,000 two years ago. In Clifton, he said, a three-bedroom apartment (old or new) cost Rs25-50m, compared with Rs20-40m previously. Mr Parekh said commercial plot prices had also increased. In PECHS and on Sharea Faisal (left side towards the airport), commercial plots were priced at Rs1.5-2m per square yard, compared with Rs1-1.2m earlier. On the right side, they ranged from Rs1m to Rs1.5m compared to Rs700,000 to Rs1.2m. On Shaheed-i-Millat Road, he said, commercial plots were around Rs1.5m per square yard, up from Rs800,000 to Rs1m two years ago. He described I.I. Chundrigar Road as a slow market, with rates pegged at Rs400,000 per square foot. On the industrial side, Mr Parekh said no major new investment had arrived in Karachi in the last 50 years, with many owners dividing premises and land for non-industrial uses. Investors were shifting towards Nooriabad and Jhampir due to lower rates, he said, adding that 60-70pc of land along the Super Highway was “risky and controversial”. Mohammad Najeeb, a member of the Supreme Council of the North Nazimabad Association of Real Estate Agents (NNAREA), said the price of a 240-yard ground-plus-one house had remained more or less unchanged at Rs55-65m over the past two years, while a 400-yard ground-plus-one bungalow had risen to Rs60-70m from Rs45-50m. He said 600-yard ground-plus-one bungalows remained in the Rs70-100m range, while 1,000-yard ground-plus-one bungalows cost Rs180-200m, up from Rs140-150m two years ago. In North Nazimabad, he said, an old two-bedroom flat without a lift, generator or parking cost Rs5-7m. New flats with facilities were priced at Rs15-17.5m, up from just over Rs10m. Old three-bedroom flats were priced at Rs10-12.5m, up from Rs8-9m, while new three-bedroom units with facilities were priced at Rs17.5-35m, compared with Rs15-20m two years ago.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: In New York, the Jackson Heights neighbourhood is alive with smells and sounds that evoke home: hilsa frying in mustard oil, khajur gurr stacked beside jars of achar , sari shops glittering with Tangail cottons and Jamdani silks. The chatter of Bangla in every accent — from the clipped tones of Shudhu Bangla to the soft drawl of Noakhali and the rolling lilt of Chittagong — further authenticated the atmosphere. Restaurants serving Bengali biryani and pakoras sit side by side with Pakistani eateries. Mosques are filled with worshippers preparing for Ramazan, with banners welcoming the holy month and offers of free iftar visible on doors and gates. This vibrant diaspora community, the largest Bangladeshi settlement in North America, marked the elections and welcomed the results with a festive yet reflective mood. Residents had long participated in protests outside the United Nations headquarters against Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s government. The neighbourhood has Awami League supporters too, but most are silent for now. “We are hoping that it will bring stability and prosperity to Bangladesh,” said Abul Hassan, a longtime shopkeeper. “We Bangladeshis have proven time and again that we do not tolerate tyranny. Hasina Wajed failed because she became a tyrant.” Hassan said most in Jackson Heights support the BNP, though some also admire Jamaat-e-Islami. Rasheed Ahmed, who runs a clothing store, called Jamaat’s success “a historic achievement for them anywhere in South Asia,” expressing hope it could play a constructive role in parliament. The rise of political Islam The BNP’s victory was widely expected in Jackson Heights too, even before the Awami League was barred from the contest, leaving Bangladesh’s largest opposition party with a clear path. Jamaat-e-Islami’s gain of around 70 seats, however, has stunned analysts and raised concerns about the rise of political Islam. Taj Hashmi, a Toronto-based historian and Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, stressed the structural factors behind these results. “The BNP’s win was predictable,” he said. “Eighteen years of political exclusion cannot erase deep-rooted grassroots networks. Anti-incumbency sentiment was enough to secure their return.” “While a formidable party like the Awami League was absent from the poll (for the right or wrong reasons), it was obvious that it would benefit the largest political party, the BNP,” he added. “What’s surprising is that the Jamaat-e-Islami, who never ever polled more than 4 to 7 per cent of the vote in Bangladesh since 1979, has captured around 70 seats in the parliament.” On Jamaat’s gains, he added: “The Jamaat’s rise reflects not only protest votes but the growing influence of political Islam among marginalised communities. Socioeconomic deprivation, unemployment, and decades of perceived injustice created fertile ground for their ideology.” Hashmi highlighted the party’s historical persecution: “Under Hasina, Jamaat leaders were executed or imprisoned on charges dating back to 1971. That repression, while intended to weaken them, instead fortified their narrative as a party of martyrs.” He was candid about the party’s ideology: “Jamaat’s intellectual roots lie in a vision of an Islamic state that is anti-individualist, and opposed to gender equality.” Adding nuance, he noted: “Political Islam has been rising gradually, but it was exacerbated by Hasina’s heavy-handed rule. People seek alternatives, and even if Jamaat’s agenda is concerning, their parliamentary presence now is a reflection of deeper societal currents.” Dr Mohammad Imran Hossain, a visiting professor from Dhaka in New York, framed the elections in terms of regional diplomacy. “In recent years, Bangladesh–Pakistan relations have been formal but cautious,” the executive director of Bangladesh Institute of Development and Security Studies said. “A BNP-led government could normalise ties incrementally, focusing on trade, flights, and pragmatic engagement — while still balancing the vital relationship with India.” Prof. Imran cautioned that changes would be measured: “Dramatic breakthroughs are unlikely. Progress depends on mutual respect and the ability to manage the legacy of 1971. If both sides see strategic value, relations could improve steadily within broader regional frameworks.” Imran also highlighted the domestic dimension: “The rise of Jamaat, while politically significant, could challenge governance. BNP will need to ensure democratic norms while integrating these actors responsibly.” He added: “The BNP’s foreign policy orientation will likely be pro-China and cautious toward India. That may unsettle New Delhi but could provide space for Bangladesh to diversify partnerships.” Observations from Washington US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s congratulatory message sounded cautious and formal. “Congratulations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its leader Tarique Rahman as well as the people of Bangladesh. The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected government to advance prosperity and the security of the region,” he wrote. The UN emphasised inclusive participation while noting intimidation and harassment of women candidates, including in cyberspace. Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, described the process as peaceful, with strong turnout and no parties threatening to reject the results — a “significant step for democratisation,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "THE trajectory of Pakistan-US relations has once again been defined by strategic pragmatism rather than a durable partnership. Recent statements from Washington reaffirm that bilateral engagement continues to revolve around two principal pillars: access to critical mineral resources and counterterrorism cooperation. While the evolving US strategic posture in South Asia is largely shaped by its competition with China and alignment with India, Pakistan remains embedded within this framework due to its geostrategic relevance, serving as a check on India. Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Subcommittee on South and Central Asia recently, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored these priorities. He noted that Washington is working with Pakistan to harness the potential of its critical mineral reserves, combining US government seed financing with private sector expertise to generate mutual economic benefits. At the same time, he emphasised that continued counterterrorism cooperation serves a dual purpose, strengthening Pakistan’s capacity to manage internal security challenges while addressing transnational threats that could affect the US and its partners. Perhaps the Middle East does not fall within Kapur’s portfolio, and that is why he did not comment on Pakistan’s relevance in this context, especially in light of the growing crisis with Iran and the Gaza peace plan, ie, the Board of Peace, whose meeting is scheduled this month, and which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to attend. At the meeting, he would announce Pakistan’s commitment to the Gaza peace plan, particularly its contribution to a Gaza stabilisation force. Pakistan is currently relevant across multiple domains of US geo-economic and strategic objectives, particularly in three regions: South, Central, and West Asia. In these different regions, Pakistan serves different US interests. If we set aside the Middle East for a while in Pakistan-US relations, America’s priority list would include counterterrorism cooperation, containing China, and economic cooperation in the mineral sector in South and Central Asia. Even Kapur hinted at the same in his briefing. However, in South Asia, three additional elements emerge. First, encouraging India to develop independently, stand on its own, and preserve its freedom of action serves broader US strategic objectives, particularly preventing China or any single hegemonic power from dominating the region. At the same time, supporting Pakistan helps maintain a balance that checks Indian intentions. Perhaps we need a new approach towards Afghanistan, one that is not aligned with any camp. Second, through financial assistance via international monetary institutions and by enhancing economic cooperation in critical sectors, the US seeks to engage Pakistan. This approach encourages segments of Pakistan’s power elite to limit their inclination towards deeper strategic alignment with China, which could otherwise affect US influence and reduce India’s political appeal in the region. Third, Pakistan serves as a primary partner for counterterrorism in Central Asia, but also in the broader SCO and regional context, where Pakistan can be viewed as a partner maintaining deep relations with the US. While this may continue to irritate Russia, Pakistan’s growing relations with Central Asian states also carry geo-economic advantages. However, Afghanistan remains a constraint in this design, and Baloch­istan, where mineral and counterterrorism interests converge, poses another critical challenge. Interestingly, while the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs was briefing Congress, the deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs, John Mark Pomeroy, was visiting Islamabad to explore and enhance partnership in the mineral sector. During a meeting with the interior minister, while condoling the tragic terror incidents in Islamabad and Balochistan, he emphasised that Pakistan believes in global partnerships to eliminate terrorism and promote investment, echoing the same position articulated by the assistant secretary himself during the congressional hearing. The question is whether the US would partner with Pakistan to soften Afghanistan, the main hurdle in connectivity between Pakistan and Central Asia, and enhance cooperation to build Pakistan’s counterterrorism and counterinsurgency capabilities to reduce risks in Balochistan, which is essential for the utilisation of the province’s mineral resources. Interestingly, Afghanistan and Balochistan both connect to the US and China’s strategic designs, particularly in counterterrorism efforts and competition in the race for rare earth minerals. China remains reluctant to intervene or deepen security cooperation beyond a certain point, as Beijing sees long-term political, strategic and economic consequences. In contrast, the US is a notoriously ambitious actor willing to take risks. If it is willing to take risks to denuclearise Iran to serve Israel and its Arab allies, would it be prepared to do something similarly provocative in Afghanistan, perhaps to create pressure or controversy over Bagram, as Trump had earlier instigated and tested reactions? The US does not seem interested in intervening directly in Afghanistan, as it would be too early for another military involvement. The UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution recently extending by one year the mandate of the Monitoring Team that supports the 1988 Afghanistan Sanctions Committee, which oversees sanctions imposed on the Afghan Taliban, indicating continued US attention and an indication that Washington still wants to give some more time to the Taliban regime. However, one possibility cannot be ruled out that the US may increase its diplomatic as well as equipment support to Pakistan, targeting terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan, which will keep pressure on the Taliban regime. But, this level of intervention will likely remain minimal and may not help Pakistan influence the Taliban to cooperate on counterterrorism issues, and may not even be able to force the Taliban to change their attitude towards their own people. Perhaps Pakistan needs a new approach tow­a­rds Afghanistan, one that is independent and not aligned with any camp, whether the US or China. Such an approach may help gauge the real potential for cooperation, as well as the adversity and costs involved. Pakistan also needs a different ap­­proach to dealing with Balochistan, a vision that begins a journey towards peace through peaceful means, which would enhance stability and long-term regional cooperation. But is this a wish list that the power elites would not like to read? The writer is a security analyst. Published in Dawn, February 15th, 2026",

      "title_orig": "Minister says Imran to be shifted to hospital amid opposition sit-in at Parliament House",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said on Saturday that the government had decided to shift PTI founder Imran Khan to a hospital, while the opposition continued its sit-in at Parliament House over concerns regarding the ex-premier’s health. In a post on X, the minister said, “Imran Khan has been given the facility to talk to his sons on the phone and considering his health, it has also been decided to shift him to the hospital and form a medical board.” “The government prioritises humanitarianism and legal requirements. It is the government’s responsibility to provide facilities to every prisoner according to the law,” he said. “There should be no politics on a sensitive issue like health. PTI should avoid baseless propaganda or political point scoring. The government is fulfilling its responsibilities. Instead of politicising this issue, show national seriousness and tolerance,” he said. Shortly before Chaudhry, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that further medical treatment of Imran would be carried out by eye specialists at a specialised medical institution. “Pursuant to ongoing eye treatment of Imran Khan, further checkup and treatment will be done in a specialised medical facility by the best eye specialists. “A detailed report thereof will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” he said. The development came as parliamentarians from opposition parties, under the banners of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), continued their sit-in at Parliament House and KP House in Islamabad on Saturday for a second day, demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment. The sit-in was announced after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on Thursday that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others. PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that although he appreciated the announcement by the government, the sit-in would not be called off until Imran was moved to Shifa International Hospital and a family physician was included in the medical board. “It is unfortunate that for the first time in the history of Pakistan, Parliament was locked down,” Qaiser told Dawn . TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Yousufzai told Dawn that taking the PTI founder to the hospital was a principled stance. “We will not accept it if efforts are made to shift Imran to [the] Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. Moreover, we want a family physician in medical board,” he stated. However, another opposition leader said that it did not believe the statements by government ministers. “They have contacted us, but they have nothing in their hands and cannot take a decision. We will wait for the final outcome,” he said. In a post on X, Achakzai said that the sit-in would continue until Imran was “provided with medical facilities from eye specialists in the presence of his family and personal physician”. Separately, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, in a video posted by TTAP on X, said they had been informed that a phone call between Imran and his sons was arranged and that there was “willingness” to shift the ex-premier to Shifa International Hospital. “If it is so, then there should be no delay … why the delay?” he asked. Raja said that the delay was directly related to the “anger” of the party and its workers. ‘Parliament turned into a prison’ Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said on Saturday that Parliament House had been turned into a “prison”. “We have been inside Parliament since yesterday. We wanted to go outside but all the gates were closed,” he said in a video posted by TTAP on X. “Parliament and its premises have been turned into a prison; it is condemnable.” “We are not armed. We are standing here with nothing but our ethics and the strength of the truth,” he added. The Senate opposition leader noted that Imran, like other prisoners, had rights and that “90 per cent” of Pakistanis — both here and abroad — were expressing concerns over the PTI founder’s health. In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”. Demanding that they “be set free”, the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House. “We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”. “The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed. TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises. “On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said. According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night. Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in. PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors. She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour. We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.” She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye. Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament. “Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”. “Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”. The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released. He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked. Govt told to not escalate situation Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, flanked by former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza, warned the government to take steps before things got out of hand. They said that the government should not escalate the situation and eliminate political space for the opposition. They warned the government that it would not remain in power forever and urged it to go for dialogue and give respect to democratic principles. They also demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a hospital for medical treatment and that his family be granted access to him. They stated that the protest would continue until these demands were fulfilled. Khokhar also stated that he was prevented from taking food inside Parliament on Saturday morning and called the situation unjust. He also said that opposition leaders inside Parliament House were confined and roads leading to Parliament Lodges and KP House were blocked. Ahmad, meanwhile, demanded that Imran be provided medical treatment immediately. He claimed that direct responsibility for the situation was on the shoulders of the federal government. Reporters decry mistreatment The Parliamentary Reporters Association Pakistan (PRAP) strongly condemned the “obstacles, mistreatment, and rude behaviour faced by journalists” while covering the ongoing sit-in at the Parliament House, and demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed full access” to the premises. A joint statement issued by PRAP President M.B. Soomro, PRAP Secretary Naveed Akbar, and other office-bearers said the opposition had been staging a sit-in at Parliament House since yesterday, in which the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly (NA) and Senate, senators, and members of the NA are participating. “Covering such an important political process is the professional responsibility of journalists, and preventing them from doing so is a blatant violation of the principles of press freedom,” it said. According to the statement, “After covering the sit-in late last night, when Soomro, senior journalist Akram Abid, and other reporters reached the entrance of the Parliament House this morning, security personnel stopped them and pushed them away. “An attempt was also made to forcibly put Abid into a police van,” it said. The association expressed serious concern over the incident and said, “Preventing journalists from entering a national institution such as the Parliament House amounts to depriving them of their constitutional and professional rights. Turning the Parliament into a fortress and preventing the media from coverage reflects an undemocratic and authoritarian attitude.” It further said: “If the media is prevented from performing its duties, the timely and accurate dissemination of information to the public will be affected, which is harmful to any democratic society.” The association demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed unhindered access to the Parliament House and that effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents in the future”. The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”. KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful. “Imran Khan sahib ’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X. He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well. “Those opposing Imran Khan sahib , who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.” The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib ’s family and party,” Afridi added. “A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised. SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government. In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC. “The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted. Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”. “The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said. She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists. Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!” “Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”. “PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded. “Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.",

Shortly before Chaudhry, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that further medical treatment of Imran would be carried out by eye specialists at a specialised medical institution. “Pursuant to ongoing eye treatment of Imran Khan, further checkup and treatment will be done in a specialised medical facility by the best eye specialists. “A detailed report thereof will also be submitted to the Supreme Court. Conjecture, speculations and efforts to turn this into political rhetoric and mileage for vested interests may please be avoided,” he said. The development came as parliamentarians from opposition parties, under the banners of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP), continued their sit-in at Parliament House and KP House in Islamabad on Saturday for a second day, demanding that PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately moved to a hospital for treatment. The sit-in was announced after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed on Thursday that Imran’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. The protest is being led by TTAP Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and other prominent leaders, including PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Senator Ali Zafar, Asad Qaiser, Junaid Akbar, and others. PTI stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said that although he appreciated the announcement by the government, the sit-in would not be called off until Imran was moved to Shifa International Hospital and a family physician was included in the medical board. “It is unfortunate that for the first time in the history of Pakistan, Parliament was locked down,” Qaiser told Dawn . TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Yousufzai told Dawn that taking the PTI founder to the hospital was a principled stance. “We will not accept it if efforts are made to shift Imran to [the] Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. Moreover, we want a family physician in medical board,” he stated. However, another opposition leader said that it did not believe the statements by government ministers. “They have contacted us, but they have nothing in their hands and cannot take a decision. We will wait for the final outcome,” he said. In a post on X, Achakzai said that the sit-in would continue until Imran was “provided with medical facilities from eye specialists in the presence of his family and personal physician”. Separately, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, in a video posted by TTAP on X, said they had been informed that a phone call between Imran and his sons was arranged and that there was “willingness” to shift the ex-premier to Shifa International Hospital. “If it is so, then there should be no delay … why the delay?” he asked. Raja said that the delay was directly related to the “anger” of the party and its workers. ‘Parliament turned into a prison’ Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said on Saturday that Parliament House had been turned into a “prison”. “We have been inside Parliament since yesterday. We wanted to go outside but all the gates were closed,” he said in a video posted by TTAP on X. “Parliament and its premises have been turned into a prison; it is condemnable.” “We are not armed. We are standing here with nothing but our ethics and the strength of the truth,” he added. The Senate opposition leader noted that Imran, like other prisoners, had rights and that “90 per cent” of Pakistanis — both here and abroad — were expressing concerns over the PTI founder’s health. In a post on X, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said the Parliament House, Parliament Lodges, and the KP House “had been turned into a jail”. Demanding that they “be set free”, the senior PTI leader alleged that the state was “terrified” of them taking to the streets. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said in an earlier post on X that the sit-in had entered its second day, adding that the opposition leaders were “trapped” inside Parliament House. “We also remained inside Parliament House the entire night,” he said, adding that the PTI and TTAP leadership was “exhausted from hunger”. “The police did not allow dinner at night and now breakfast in the morning to be taken inside,” Akram claimed. TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai told Dawn that the sit-in was continuing at both locations. He said it was unfortunate that even breakfast was not being allowed inside Parliament and added that no one was being allowed to enter the premises. “On the other hand, those who are in Parliament are not being allowed to come out. The sit-in will continue until TTAP’s demand is accepted,” he said. According to Yousafzai, PTI Senator Falak Naz Chitrali was feeling unwell since last night. Yousafzai, criticising the government for not contacting the protesters, said TTAP Vice Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was also attending the sit-in. PTI leader Shandana Gulzar, speaking to the media, said it was unfortunate that Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi gave four days to have Imran examined by a team of doctors. She questioned whether the same time frame would have been given if it were the chief justice’s daughter or Nawaz Sharif. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister is staging a sit-in at KP House and protesting against the government’s unjust behaviour. We are demanding that Imran Khan be shifted to Shifa International Hospital.” She alleged that the government was waiting for further damage to Imran’s eye. Gulzar further said that the police had manhandled the parliamentarians and other leaders of the opposition. Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) spokesperson Aslam Ghauri, in a statement, condemned the “violence” against the TTAP protest outside Parliament. “Respected members of Parliament and provincial assemblies were dragged,” he said, adding that those who had “trapped the protesters inside Parliament call themselves democratic”. “Making a mockery of democracy, playing around with the Constitution and going against Islam are the actions of this government,” he alleged, quipping that the “fake forced government had gone mad in the fire of revenge”. The JUI-F leader demanded that all detained leaders be immediately released. He blamed the government’s attitude for the anarchy in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Do the rulers want to spread this anarchy across the country?” he asked. Govt told to not escalate situation Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, flanked by former Senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza, warned the government to take steps before things got out of hand. They said that the government should not escalate the situation and eliminate political space for the opposition. They warned the government that it would not remain in power forever and urged it to go for dialogue and give respect to democratic principles. They also demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a hospital for medical treatment and that his family be granted access to him. They stated that the protest would continue until these demands were fulfilled. Khokhar also stated that he was prevented from taking food inside Parliament on Saturday morning and called the situation unjust. He also said that opposition leaders inside Parliament House were confined and roads leading to Parliament Lodges and KP House were blocked. Ahmad, meanwhile, demanded that Imran be provided medical treatment immediately. He claimed that direct responsibility for the situation was on the shoulders of the federal government. Reporters decry mistreatment The Parliamentary Reporters Association Pakistan (PRAP) strongly condemned the “obstacles, mistreatment, and rude behaviour faced by journalists” while covering the ongoing sit-in at the Parliament House, and demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed full access” to the premises. A joint statement issued by PRAP President M.B. Soomro, PRAP Secretary Naveed Akbar, and other office-bearers said the opposition had been staging a sit-in at Parliament House since yesterday, in which the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly (NA) and Senate, senators, and members of the NA are participating. “Covering such an important political process is the professional responsibility of journalists, and preventing them from doing so is a blatant violation of the principles of press freedom,” it said. According to the statement, “After covering the sit-in late last night, when Soomro, senior journalist Akram Abid, and other reporters reached the entrance of the Parliament House this morning, security personnel stopped them and pushed them away. “An attempt was also made to forcibly put Abid into a police van,” it said. The association expressed serious concern over the incident and said, “Preventing journalists from entering a national institution such as the Parliament House amounts to depriving them of their constitutional and professional rights. Turning the Parliament into a fortress and preventing the media from coverage reflects an undemocratic and authoritarian attitude.” It further said: “If the media is prevented from performing its duties, the timely and accurate dissemination of information to the public will be affected, which is harmful to any democratic society.” The association demanded that “all journalists be immediately allowed unhindered access to the Parliament House and that effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents in the future”. The PRAP strongly condemned the “inappropriate and undemocratic conduct” and reaffirmed its commitment that “no restrictions on journalists’ professional rights, press freedom, and responsible reporting will be accepted”. KP CM urges voluntary protesters to remain peaceful Separately, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi urged protesters in other locations across the country to remain peaceful. “Imran Khan sahib ’s health is more important to me than politics. I will neither engage in politics myself over his health nor allow anyone else to do so,” he affirmed on X. He stressed: “At this time, those workers who have stepped up on their own without any official call — wherever you are, stay peaceful, and nearby workers, support them. All of you must remain peaceful going forward as well. “Those opposing Imran Khan sahib , who have subjected him to medical terrorism, are capable of going to any extremes. They will include their own provocative elements amongst us to divert our peaceful protest in another direction and target us.” The KP CM urged protesters to keep an eye on “all provocative individuals and continue the peaceful protest”. “Do not believe any negative or false propaganda unless it is verified by Imran Khan sahib ’s family and party,” Afridi added. “A mockery has been made out of his health, which is unforgivable. Right now, his best possible treatment is our top priority,” the chief minister emphasised. SC still has not provided written orders: Aleema Earlier on Saturday, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum criticised the Supreme Court for its alleged inaction to ensure its directives are implemented by the government. In a post on X, she recalled that lawyers waited “all day on Thursday the 12th and all day Friday the 13th for written court orders” from the SC. “The order should have been for Imran Khan to be shifted to Shifa International Hospital. Emergency orders for his immediate examination and treatment by specialist doctors under supervision of his personal doctors,” she asserted. Citing information given to their lawyers, she claimed that CJP Afridi had left on an urgent tour to Punjab to “watch the jeep rally in Cholistan”. “The urgent and pressing matter for our CJP (taking precedence over the extreme urgency to save Imran Khan’s eyesight in his right eye), we are told, is to watch the jeep rally in Cholistan. Ofcourse this could be totally fabricated information!” Aleema said. She added that the CJP would be back in office on February 16, noting it was the same date he had set as the deadline for Imran to be seen by specialists. Aleema stated: “Without a court order for the Govt, Imran Khan is certainly not going to receive any emergency medical care. The court order has to wait until the CJP returns to office on Monday from the Cholistan jeep rally!” “Since CJP didn’t give a court order for Imran Khan’s treatment, people will have to support us to ensure there is enough pressure on the [government], so they will allow him to be treated at Shifa International Hospital,” she added. PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan also said CJP Afridi and the “courts should have acted well in time”. “PM Imran Khan must be given immediate access to qualified doctors and medical facilities in Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to save the vision in his eye,” he demanded. “Every moment being delayed is criminal,” the former MNA contended.",

      "title_orig": "Karachi police clash with Jamaat-i-Islami workers outside Sindh Assembly",
      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Police clashed with Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) workers outside the Sindh Assembly on Saturday. Footage aired on television showed police using tear gas, with workers running while covering their faces. The JI had announced that it would stage a sit-in outside the Sindh Assembly on Feb 14 to protest what it described as the Sindh government’s “failure to address Karachi’s issues” and alleged interference in the city’s institutions. Speaking on Geo News , Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that police and the provincial government were in contact with the party’s administration since 4pm, telling them that they may protest but not enter the Red Zone. “They were strictly forbidden from entering the Red Zone, but despite that, JI party workers entered the Red Zone, pelted stones at the police, and also tried to enter the assembly,” Memon stated. He added that police were forced to use tear gas and arrest workers. “You cannot enter the Red Zone under [Section] 144; the JI entering like this is a violation of the law,” the minister asserted. “No one will be allowed take the law into their own hands.” Asked about comments by JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, maintaining that the protesters were peaceful, Memon questioned why they had to come to the assembly when it was closed. The minister claimed that the only reason they wanted to enter the assembly was to vandalise it. “We’ve been in contact with them since 4pm, but they violated the agreement by entering the Red Zone and then pelted stones at the police. This kind of behaviour will not be tolerated from anyone,” Memon said. In a statement, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said that it had already been stated that permission would not be given to march toward Sindh Assembly. “Police were pelted with stones; we were forced to take this step,” he said. “Nobody is allowed to violate the law … taking the law into your own hands is absolutely not permitted,” he said. The Sindh home minister appealed to the public to remain peaceful and not become an instrument of those who wanted to spread chaos. Sindh Government Spokesperson Aqraba Fatima issued a statement encouraging the JI and all political parties to protest peacefully and within the ambit of the law. “Security concerns arise due to crowds in sensitive areas,” she was quoted as saying, adding that the JI need to act responsibly. The spokesperson added that the authorities have been in contact with the party so that the situation does not drag on. “Civil life being affected under the guise of protest is not acceptable in any way,” Fatima added. “The government believes in dialogue and the Jamaat-i-Islami is expected to cooperate positively.” She added that political activities should not affect Karachi’s routine and that peace in the metropolis is a shared responsibility. ‘Police attacked peaceful protesters with batons’ Meanwhile, the JI chief took to X and said that the “entire country is witnessing the fascism” of the PPP, attaching videos and photos of police action against the protesters. “Using tear gas on peaceful citizens and attempting to stop the sit-in at the Sindh Assembly is proof of the Sindh government’s failure and desperation,” he stated. JI provincial lawmaker Muhammad Farooq told reporters that police shelled and attacked peaceful protesters with batons, accusing the governing PPP of “fascism”. “We were coming to demand Karachi’s right to live,” he asserted. “The PPP arrested several Jamaat-i-Islami workers, which is an undemocratic act. Release the missing and arrested workers immediately.” The MPA said that the demonstrators were not heading towards a “palace” and that the people of Karachi “are not courtiers”. “When we pay taxes, the rulers enjoy their luxuries. The PPP provincial government is stripping the people of Karachi of their right to live,” Faroq asserted. “The PPP provincial government is not even allowing us to protest in accordance with the Constitution.” Calling the PPP a “product of authoritarianism which promotes fake democracy”, Farooq alleged that the United Nations had placed a ban on tear gas shells, which the police were using.",

      "summary_en": "KARACHI: Police clashed with Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) workers outside the Sindh Assembly on Saturday. Footage aired on television showed police using tear gas, with workers running while covering their faces. The JI had announced that it would stage a sit-in outside the Sindh Assembly on Feb 14 to protest what it described as the Sindh government’s “failure to address Karachi’s issues” and alleged interference in the city’s institutions. Speaking on Geo News , Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that police and the provincial government were in contact with the party’s administration since 4pm, telling them that they may protest but not enter the Red Zone. “They were strictly forbidden from entering the Red Zone, but despite that, JI party workers entered the Red Zone, pelted stones at the police, and also tried to enter the assembly,” Memon stated. He added that police were forced to use tear gas and arrest workers. “You cannot enter the Red Zone under [Section] 144; the JI entering like this is a violation of the law,” the minister asserted. “No one will be allowed take the law into their own hands.” Asked about comments by JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, maintaining that the protesters were peaceful, Memon questioned why they had to come to the assembly when it was closed. The minister claimed that the only reason they wanted to enter the assembly was to vandalise it. “We’ve been in contact with them since 4pm, but they violated the agreement by entering the Red Zone and then pelted stones at the police. This kind of behaviour will not be tolerated from anyone,” Memon said. In a statement, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said that it had already been stated that permission would not be given to march toward Sindh Assembly. “Police were pelted with stones; we were forced to take this step,” he said. “Nobody is allowed to violate the law … taking the law into your own hands is absolutely not permitted,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "Five European countries — including Britain, France and Germany — accused Russia of “poisoning” opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison in 2024 using a “rare toxin”, on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. “The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin,” the countries said in a joint statement, following “analyses of samples” from his body. The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence. The epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America was found in samples and “highly likely resulted in his death”, the European states said. “Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death,” the UK foreign office added in a statement. Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now “science-proven” that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered. “Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband,” Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference. “I was of course certain that it was a murder … but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts,” Navalnaya added. Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning. “Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice,” UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement. The countries said they had reported Russia to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog — the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons — over the finding. “We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons,” the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention. Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering. The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin’s inner circle.",
