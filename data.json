      "summary_orig": "LONDON: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that the federal cabinet had approved Pakistan joining the Board of Peace, which is led by US President Donald Trump. A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — had gathered on stage on Thursday with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland, to put their names to the founding charter of the body. Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year bombardment of the Palestinian enclave, the Board of Peace’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts. Speaking to the media outside the Pakistan High Commission in London on Saturday, the premier said that he had a “very good trip” to Davos. He said that Pakistan had received an invitation from Trump to join the Board of Peace, adding that he accepted with the approval of the cabinet. “We signed with the hope that there will be peace in Gaza, that Palestinians will receive the respect they deserve, and that Gaza will be reconstructed,” the premier said. PM Shehbaz said the humanitarian situation in Gaza required urgent international attention and reiterated Pakistan’s long-standing position in support of Palestinian rights. The premier also highlighted his meeting with International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Kristalina Georgieva, describing it as positive. He did not share details of the discussion but said Pakistan would continue to engage constructively with international financial institutions as it works to stabilise its economy. Commenting on regional security, PM Shehbaz said he had thanked Mr Trump for what he described as his role in “saving millions of lives in South Asia by ending the India-Pakistan war”, without elaborating further. Meanwhile, the prime minister’s aide, Rana Sanaullah, also said on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan ’ that the federal cabinet had endorsed the decision to join the Board of Peace. “There was much discussion on this and the cabinet endorsed it. After the cabinet’s endorsement, the prime minister accepted this [invitation],” he said. “The development happened in the past week to 10 days. Based on this, the government signed after consultations with the cabinet. I know this, I was in that consultation,” he said. The decision to join the board was criticised, with politicians and analysts saying that the decision was “unwise” and Pakistan had “jumped the gun”. In response, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry had defended the move in the National Assembly, saying the country joined the body meant to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding in the interest of the Palestinian people. The issue was also raised during a joint sitting of Parliament on Friday, with Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman claiming the decision was taken because of the “fear of Trump”. The government had again defended the move, with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal saying that Pakistan being at the “centre stage” along with its brother Muslim countries to contribute towards peace in Gaza and Palestine was a “diplomatic win”.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Navy on Saturday successfully conducted the medical evacuation of a Sri Lankan national on the high seas, approximately 1,500 kilometres off Pakistan’s coast. A statement by the navy said that PNS ships Tabuk and Moawin successfully conducted the medical evacuation of a Sri Lankan national requiring “urgent medical attention” on an Indonesian-flagged merchant vessel (MV) Grey Palm. ​”The operation was initiated following a formal request from [the] Sri Lankan Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) for [the] provision of medical assistance to a Sri Lankan national crew member in critical condition onboard MV Grey Palm, positioned 800 nautical miles (approximately 1,500 kilometres) from Pakistan’s coast,” the statement said. The Pakistan Navy dispatched its ships as first responders and evacuated the Sri Lankan crew member along with an attendant, it said. Subsequently, the patient was immediately provided with the necessary treatment aboard the navy vessel, it added. “The Sri Lankan authorities and family of the individual thanked Pakistan for [the] prompt response and support,” the statement said. “​The successful medical evacuation is yet another testament to operational readiness and [the] longstanding commitment of Pakistan for the safety of life at sea, irrespective of nationality.” President Asif Ali Zardari praised the rescue operation, which took place 1,500 km off the coast of Gwadar, according to a statement from the Presidency. Paying tribute to the two vessels and their crews for their professionalism and prompt response, President Zardari was quoted as saying, “Pakistan Navy has fulfilled its international responsibilities by transcending nationality to protect human life at sea.”",

      "summary_orig": "At least three people were killed in a fire at a hotel in Lahore’s Gulberg, according to rescue officials. Punjab Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said at least three people had been killed in the fire at the Indigo Hotel. He said the victims were identified as Shehreyar, approximately 25-years-old, Imran, approximately 30-years-old, and Riaz, approximately 30-years-old. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif also shared several updates about the incident on the social media platform X. She also shared a video of Rescue 1122 Director General Rizwan Naseer, in which he termed the operation “difficult”, saying the building had 21 floors, three of which were located below the ground. He said that there was a boiler in the basement, which was being heated using LPG cylinders, where the fire ignited. He said initially, the hotel staff were trying to put out the fire on their own. He said Rescue 1122 received the call around 12:25pm. He said that rescuers entered the basement, a difficult task due to the heat and smoke. Earlier, she said she was monitoring the evacuation and rescue operation through the Safe City drone system. She had also said the incident was caused by the “explosion of the air-conditioning system boiler”, terming it “severe”. “Strict directives have been issued: All commercial boiler and cylinder installations across Punjab must fully comply with safety standards. Any premises found compromising public safety will be sealed immediately, without exception,” she said. The development comes as Karachi is reeling from a deadly fire at a popular shopping mall, which has claimed 71 lives so far. On Thursday, the Punjab government gave two weeks to stakeholders to implement standard operating procedures (SOPs) in plazas, schools and hospitals in the wake of Gul Plaza inferno. “A building grading system has now been introduced across the province, under which safe buildings will be categorised as A-grade, while others will be graded according to their condition. The firefighting sector is being upgraded with modern technology, drones and state-of-the-art equipment,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said at a press conference in Lahore.",

      "summary_orig": "Police on Saturday registered a first information report (FIR) over the devastating Gul Plaza inferno, citing the incident as an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”. The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished , has left the ground-plus-three-storey building in ruins, with some sections collapsed. It has so far claimed 71 lives. South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the FIR had been registered on behalf of the state, through a police official, under relevant laws. According to the FIR, Nabi Bux Station House Officer (SHO) Inspector Nawaz Ali Zardari said the police received information about the fire in the plaza at around 10:30pm on January 17. The FIR added that the fire was “rapidly spreading and engulfed the entire plaza” while firefighters and other rescue personnel were engaged in efforts to extinguish the blaze. It further stated that the fire erupted in shop number 193, a flower and gift shop, located on the ground floor, and quickly spread in the shopping plaza. “Rescue work is ongoing and there are apprehensions of more deaths,” said the FIR. The police also blamed the lack of firefighting equipment and “no reasonable arrangements” in the case of an emergency for the tragedy. The report added that there were “no emergency exits” and that electricity had been switched off, complicating the evacuation of those inside the shopping plaza. “Due to these reasons, precious human lives were lost and substantive financial losses also occurred.” The FIR has been registered under Sections 322 (murder without intention), 337-H(i) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). Police have not nominated anyone in the case; therefore, the FIR has been registered against unknown persons. Sindh home minister says tragedies should not be politicised Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar said that tragedies such as the Gul Plaza fire should not be turned into political controversies, according to a statement from his office. Speaking to the media at the Police Training College in Shahdadpur, Lanjar expressed deep sorrow over the Gul Plaza tragedy, stating that precious human lives had been lost and the entire provincial government was in mourning. According to the statement, he added that an FIR had been registered in connection with the incident, including sections related to negligence and carelessness, and assured that action would be taken against those responsible in accordance with the law. “Tragedies such as the Gul Plaza incident should not be turned into political controversies,” he was quoted as saying, regretting that the matter was being linked to the 18th Constitutional Amendment and the NFC Award, which he described as “beyond understanding”. Criticising leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), he added, “Politics over dead bodies are unacceptable under any circumstances. Such incidents could occur in Lahore, Peshawar, or any other city.” The home department stated that Lanjar clarified that Gul Plaza’s lease had been granted in the past and that the Sindh chief minister had already placed all facts of the tragedy before the nation. He was further quoted as saying that the chief minister had announced financial assistance for the families of the deceased, and affected traders would also be provided with rebuilt shops. Need to learn lessons: Khaqan Abbasi Awaam Pakistan Convenor Shahid Khaqan Abbasi paid a visit to Gul Plaza, where he stressed the need to “learn lessons” from the incident and take corrective measures. “This has been a complete failure […] There are thousands of such buildings in Karachi. What will the government do about those?” he said while speaking to the media. The ex-premier remarked that possibly replacing a “few officials” after an investigation was “no compensation” for the loss of lives and property caused by the fire. During the media talk, a citizen decried that the relatives of the deceased who had come for shopping were “not getting any information” or propoer responses. “We had given our DNA report from the first day [of the incident], but we have got nothing so far.” Responding to him and another query, Abbasi said, “Whenever such incidents take place, the government institutions come and analyse how many people have been martyred and how their relatives can be helped. “[…] It takes some time but it appears that such a procedure has not been employed […] how they can be consoled, helped in the identification.” Addressing a press conference at Karachi Press Club later, the Awaam Pakistan chief stressed that it was the responsibility of the government to “at least listen” to the affected people. CM Murad announces major relief, accountability measures On Friday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah briefed the provincial assembly on the incident, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab in attendance. Recalling that Rs10 million had been announced for the family of each deceased individual, CM Murad said the required funds have been released and handed over to the Karachi commissioner for distribution. About the committee formed to estimate the losses faced by the businesses at Gul Plaza, he said the Sindh Assembly would compensate the affected people. The Sindh CM announced Rs500,000 in “immediate” financial assistance for the 1,102 shops approved by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) at Gul Plaza, and if any others had any proper documentation. “This is for their sustenance so that they can stand back on their feet, as the rest of the programme can take two to three months,” he noted. The chief minister further revealed that after some ministers’ efforts, 500 shops were made available in one building and 350 in another, whose owners have said they will not take any rent for one year. “My effort is to make arrangements for them (shop occupants/renters) to get makeshift shops for two years,” Murad said. He went on to announce that the Sindh government, through the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund, would arrange the “security/collateral” for the affected people and pay the interest if someone wanted Rs10m in loans. The Sindh CM said Gul Plaza would likely be demolished and then rebuilt, with each shop getting the same area size it previously had. He added that the Sindh government would aim to reconstruct them within two years. The chief minister also stated that an audit will be conducted and non-compliant buildings would be given a “brief period” to comply, failing which they would be sealed. He further said that he has directed the provincial law minister to draft legislation for making insurance mandatory.",

Need to learn lessons: Khaqan Abbasi Awaam Pakistan Convenor Shahid Khaqan Abbasi paid a visit to Gul Plaza, where he stressed the need to “learn lessons” from the incident and take corrective measures. “This has been a complete failure […] There are thousands of such buildings in Karachi. What will the government do about those?” he said while speaking to the media. The ex-premier remarked that possibly replacing a “few officials” after an investigation was “no compensation” for the loss of lives and property caused by the fire. During the media talk, a citizen decried that the relatives of the deceased who had come for shopping were “not getting any information” or propoer responses. “We had given our DNA report from the first day [of the incident], but we have got nothing so far.” Responding to him and another query, Abbasi said, “Whenever such incidents take place, the government institutions come and analyse how many people have been martyred and how their relatives can be helped. “[…] It takes some time but it appears that such a procedure has not been employed […] how they can be consoled, helped in the identification.” Addressing a press conference at Karachi Press Club later, the Awaam Pakistan chief stressed that it was the responsibility of the government to “at least listen” to the affected people. CM Murad announces major relief, accountability measures On Friday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah briefed the provincial assembly on the incident, with Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab in attendance. Recalling that Rs10 million had been announced for the family of each deceased individual, CM Murad said the required funds have been released and handed over to the Karachi commissioner for distribution. About the committee formed to estimate the losses faced by the businesses at Gul Plaza, he said the Sindh Assembly would compensate the affected people. The Sindh CM announced Rs500,000 in “immediate” financial assistance for the 1,102 shops approved by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) at Gul Plaza, and if any others had any proper documentation. “This is for their sustenance so that they can stand back on their feet, as the rest of the programme can take two to three months,” he noted. The chief minister further revealed that after some ministers’ efforts, 500 shops were made available in one building and 350 in another, whose owners have said they will not take any rent for one year. “My effort is to make arrangements for them (shop occupants/renters) to get makeshift shops for two years,” Murad said. He went on to announce that the Sindh government, through the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund, would arrange the “security/collateral” for the affected people and pay the interest if someone wanted Rs10m in loans. The Sindh CM said Gul Plaza would likely be demolished and then rebuilt, with each shop getting the same area size it previously had. He added that the Sindh government would aim to reconstruct them within two years. The chief minister also stated that an audit will be conducted and non-compliant buildings would be given a “brief period” to comply, failing which they would be sealed. He further said that he has directed the provincial law minister to draft legislation for making insurance mandatory.",

      "summary_orig": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday thanked his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar for his “ strong support ” and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) amid the prevailing tense situation between Washington and Tehran. On Friday, the UNHRC adopted a resolution — with 25 votes in favour, seven against and 14 abstentions — to extend the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran for two years. The resolution also extended the mandate of the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran by one year and called for an urgent investigation by the mission, in the context of the deadly nationwide protests in Iran that started in December. Pakistan, along with China and India, voted against the resolution. In a post on X on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said Dar, who is on a visit to Dubai, received a telephone call from Araghchi. The Iranian minister thanked the deputy prime minister for “his strong support and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, including its call for a vote as well as voting against the resolution concerning Iran”, the FO added. The ministry said the two dignitaries exchanged views on regional and international developments, while Araghchi conveyed “deep appreciation” for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Pakistani government and the people. Separately, Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam also thanked the country’s leadership for its “historic and unwavering support” at the UNHRC by “calling for a vote and casting a negative vote against the unjustified resolution targeting Iran”. In his post on X, Moghadam also conveyed special appreciation to the representatives of the Permanent Mission of Pakistan in Geneva for “their tireless efforts and dedication” in the pursuit of justice. “This principled stance marks the third consecutive defeat of unprovoked and politically motivated actions against Iran over the past year, including the unprovoked twelve-day aggression, recent foreign-backed riots aimed at destabilising the country, and the misuse of international organisations to pursue capricious and hostile agendas by certain members.” The envoy went on saying that such “steadfast support” was a clear reflection of the country’s “enduring commitment to justice, multilateralism, respect for human rights, and national sovereignty”, adding that it would be “remembered with deep appreciation”. On Friday, a senior Iranian official said the country would treat any attack “as an all-out war against us”, after US President Donald Trump’s comment that a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely.",

      "summary": "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Saturday thanked his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar for his “ strong support ” and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) amid the prevailing tense situation between Washington and Tehran. On Friday, the UNHRC adopted a resolution — with 25 votes in favour, seven against and 14 abstentions — to extend the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran for two years. The resolution also extended the mandate of the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran by one year and called for an urgent investigation by the mission, in the context of the deadly nationwide protests in Iran that started in December. Pakistan, along with China and India, voted against the resolution. In a post on X on Saturday, the Foreign Office (FO) said Dar, who is on a visit to Dubai, received a telephone call from Araghchi. The Iranian minister thanked the deputy prime minister for “his strong support and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, including its call for a vote as well as voting against the resolution concerning Iran”, the FO added. The ministry said the two dignitaries exchanged views on regional and international developments, while Araghchi conveyed “deep appreciation” for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Pakistani government and the people. Separately, Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam also thanked the country’s leadership for its “historic and unwavering support” at the UNHRC by “calling for a vote and casting a negative vote against the unjustified resolution targeting Iran”. In his post on X, Moghadam also conveyed special appreciation to the representatives of the Permanent Mission of Pakistan in Geneva for “their tireless efforts and dedication” in the pursuit of justice. “This principled stance marks the third consecutive defeat of unprovoked and politically motivated actions against Iran over the past year, including the unprovoked twelve-day aggression, recent foreign-backed riots aimed at destabilising the country, and the misuse of international organisations to pursue capricious and hostile agendas by certain members.” The envoy went on saying that such “steadfast support” was a clear reflection of the country’s “enduring commitment to justice, multilateralism, respect for human rights, and national sovereignty”, adding that it would be “remembered with deep appreciation”.

      "title_orig": "Imaan-Hadi arrest and a state at war with dissent",
      "summary_orig": "“As dissenters challenge existing ideas, social consciousness grows, the condition of human existence and rights improve and society progresses …Thus, it is in society’s collective interest that the right to dissent be upheld, even though critical ideas might seem unpalatable. It is in the state’s own interest to tolerate ideas critical of it. Criticism of the state and its policies is a natural outcome of the democratic system of governance … the security of the state must not be projected by the state itself to be so fragile that critical speech would shake its foundation.” — Justice Babar Sattar in the case of Shoukat Ali vs. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2024 Islamabad 135) On Friday, lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were arrested while they were reportedly on the way to the Islamabad district courts. The multiple cases registered against them invoke provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), anti-terrorism legislation, and laws regulating public assembly. Their arrest demonstrates how the law is being employed to silence opposition, revealing a state increasingly at war with dissent. The allegations against Imaan include ‘offensive tweets’ against ‘important state institutions’. While Imaan is being prosecuted for posting content, Hadi is being prosecuted for reposting and resharing her content. Even clicking ‘repost’ on content that the state finds objectionable can subject an individual to criminal prosecution. A state that treats criticism as a crime undermines both democracy and the rule of law. When lawyers are punished for challenging state excesses, it is not just an attack on individuals, but on the legal system itself. Peca: an instrument of control When Peca was amended last year to include a punishment for “false and fake information” through Section 26-A, the government claimed the aim was to counter misinformation. The intent was clear then, and it is clear now: the amendment has nothing to do with fake news. It is an instrument of control. The Peca case against Imaan and Hadi includes provisions of cyberterrorism and the offence of fake/false information. The fundamental problem with Peca is that it has been structured in a manner to shield state institutions from criticism. By defining “unlawful content” as “aspersions against any person, including members of the judiciary, the armed forces, parliament or a provincial assembly”, the amendment seeks to elevate members of these institutions above public scrutiny or accountability. Constitutional democracies do not insulate individuals from criticism; they protect a citizen’s right to free speech. Freedom Network, a media watchdog that works on freedom of speech, reported that as per the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, 150 journalists faced charges under Peca in December 2024 alone, “often for allegedly spreading false narratives against state institutions”. When a law is enforced primarily against lawyers, journalists, and human rights defenders, its purpose is clear. Case after case, the reliance on a vague charge of propagating a “false narrative against the state” reveals the true function of Peca: it is not about countering misinformation, but transforming lawful dissent into a punishable offence. No society can claim to be governed by the rule of law when those defending it are themselves under attack. A mockery of the justice system When the Islamabad High Court granted Imaan and Hadi time to appear before the trial court in the Peca case and expressly ordered that they shall not be arrested in the case, another first information report (FIR) suddenly emerged against them, levelling absurd allegations. The state’s conduct exposes a dangerous and unlawful pattern. When courts provide protection, coercive machinery is redeployed through new FIRs to nullify that relief. This creates a situation where court orders are rendered meaningless. If such conduct is permitted, the courts cease to operate as a check on executive power and judicial orders are immediately undone by executive action. According to reports, an FIR against Imaan was registered for a protest in February 2025, the day the Judicial Commission of Pakistan convened to appoint judges to the Supreme Court pursuant to the 26th Amendment . It also names several other lawyers who were at the protest. The FIR alleges, among other things, that slogans were raised against the constitutional amendment, the higher judiciary, and other state institutions. No action was taken at the time (nearly a year ago). Instead, criminal cases purportedly lodged months earlier are allowed to remain dormant, without investigation, only to be suddenly revived when judicial protection is granted in an unrelated case. The latest FIR also includes provisions of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act 2024 , an oppressive law that effectively does away with the right to protest in Islamabad. The law defines ‘assembly’ as any gathering of more than 15 people, and makes assemblies subject to prior permission from the district magistrate. Authorities have the power to “recall” or “amend” permission. A police officer, on the instructions of the district magistrate, can order dispersal of a protest “likely to disturb the public peace”. The law imposes criminal penalties of imprisonment of up to three years or fines for being a member of an assembly classified as unlawful. The message that is being sent through these cases is that no form of dissent — whether online or on the streets — is acceptable. Legal resistance will be met with retaliation. Speaking out against enforced disappearances on social media is being treated as a criminal offence. Protesting against the destructive constitutional amendments can lead to criminal cases being registered. The anti-terrorism law was introduced as a special law to address terrorism offences, and special courts were created to hear terrorism cases. Using this law against human rights defenders, journalists, and lawyers subverts its very purpose. There are reports of a spike in terrorism incidents, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Yet, the state is focusing its resources on categorising human rights defenders and lawyers as terrorists. The misuse of power is a betrayal of the state’s responsibility. And this conduct reflects a deliberate strategy of intimidation designed to silence voices that hold state power accountable. The visuals and manner of the arrest were equally shameful. “Eyewitnesses report that law enforcement officials used undue force against both the lawyers, and no reasons were provided at the time of arrest, raising serious concerns about their safety,” per Amnesty International. Imaan’s mother, former federal minister for human rights Dr Shireen Mazari said: “I have no idea where my daughter and her husband have been taken”. The state’s actions signal a breakdown of the law and the increasing capacity of the state to act with complete impunity. Arresting individuals without informing them of the charge and withholding information from their legal counsel and families is a clear violation of due process. Such actions are the hallmarks of authoritarianism, not lawful governance. Post-amendment judiciary While two officers of the court are subjected to legal harassment, the post-amendment judiciary serves its intended purpose by allowing it to continue. A society in which the judiciary does not defend rights and prevent blatant abuse of power is a frightening place, leaving citizens entirely unprotected and vulnerable to arbitrary executive action. As per the 26th and 27th amendments, the Judicial Commission, including members of the executive, shall conduct an “annual performance evaluation” of the judges of high courts. If judges are to be “evaluated” by a commission that has government representatives on it, independent decision-making is compromised. If a judge renders a decision against the government, the government representatives in the commission may render a negative evaluation against the judge. The provision effectively places a sword of Damocles over the judiciary and allows the executive to intimidate judges. Imaan and Hadi are among the few lawyers in Pakistan who consistently represent the most vulnerable victims of state abuse, from families of victims of enforced disappearances to those caught up in blasphemy cases. Pakistan’s fear of its human rights defenders is a confession: the truth is more threatening than anything else. This is not just about two individuals facing legal harassment. It is about the reality that tomorrow it could be any lawyer, journalist, or citizen who speaks out and challenges state excesses.",

Imaan and Hadi are among the few lawyers in Pakistan who consistently represent the most vulnerable victims of state abuse, from families of victims of enforced disappearances to those caught up in blasphemy cases. Pakistan’s fear of its human rights defenders is a confession: the truth is more threatening than anything else. This is not just about two individuals facing legal harassment. It is about the reality that tomorrow it could be any lawyer, journalist, or citizen who speaks out and challenges state excesses.",
      "title": "Imaan-Hadi arrest and a state at war with dissent",
      "summary": "“As dissenters challenge existing ideas, social consciousness grows, the condition of human existence and rights improve and society progresses …Thus, it is in society’s collective interest that the right to dissent be upheld, even though critical ideas might seem unpalatable. It is in the state’s own interest to tolerate ideas critical of it. Criticism of the state and its policies is a natural outcome of the democratic system of governance … the security of the state must not be projected by the state itself to be so fragile that critical speech would shake its foundation.” — Justice Babar Sattar in the case of Shoukat Ali vs. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2024 Islamabad 135) On Friday, lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha were arrested while they were reportedly on the way to the Islamabad district courts. The multiple cases registered against them invoke provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), anti-terrorism legislation, and laws regulating public assembly. Their arrest demonstrates how the law is being employed to silence opposition, revealing a state increasingly at war with dissent. The allegations against Imaan include ‘offensive tweets’ against ‘important state institutions’. While Imaan is being prosecuted for posting content, Hadi is being prosecuted for reposting and resharing her content. Even clicking ‘repost’ on content that the state finds objectionable can subject an individual to criminal prosecution. A state that treats criticism as a crime undermines both democracy and the rule of law. When lawyers are punished for challenging state excesses, it is not just an attack on individuals, but on the legal system itself. Peca: an instrument of control When Peca was amended last year to include a punishment for “false and fake information” through Section 26-A, the government claimed the aim was to counter misinformation. The intent was clear then, and it is clear now: the amendment has nothing to do with fake news. It is an instrument of control. The Peca case against Imaan and Hadi includes provisions of cyberterrorism and the offence of fake/false information. The fundamental problem with Peca is that it has been structured in a manner to shield state institutions from criticism. By defining “unlawful content” as “aspersions against any person, including members of the judiciary, the armed forces, parliament or a provincial assembly”, the amendment seeks to elevate members of these institutions above public scrutiny or accountability. Constitutional democracies do not insulate individuals from criticism; they protect a citizen’s right to free speech. Freedom Network, a media watchdog that works on freedom of speech, reported that as per the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, 150 journalists faced charges under Peca in December 2024 alone, “often for allegedly spreading false narratives against state institutions”. When a law is enforced primarily against lawyers, journalists, and human rights defenders, its purpose is clear. Case after case, the reliance on a vague charge of propagating a “false narrative against the state” reveals the true function of Peca: it is not about countering misinformation, but transforming lawful dissent into a punishable offence. No society can claim to be governed by the rule of law when those defending it are themselves under attack. A mockery of the justice system When the Islamabad High Court granted Imaan and Hadi time to appear before the trial court in the Peca case and expressly ordered that they shall not be arrested in the case, another first information report (FIR) suddenly emerged against them, levelling absurd allegations. The state’s conduct exposes a dangerous and unlawful pattern. When courts provide protection, coercive machinery is redeployed through new FIRs to nullify that relief. This creates a situation where court orders are rendered meaningless. If such conduct is permitted, the courts cease to operate as a check on executive power and judicial orders are immediately undone by executive action. According to reports, an FIR against Imaan was registered for a protest in February 2025, the day the Judicial Commission of Pakistan convened to appoint judges to the Supreme Court pursuant to the 26th Amendment . It also names several other lawyers who were at the protest. The FIR alleges, among other things, that slogans were raised against the constitutional amendment, the higher judiciary, and other state institutions. No action was taken at the time (nearly a year ago). Instead, criminal cases purportedly lodged months earlier are allowed to remain dormant, without investigation, only to be suddenly revived when judicial protection is granted in an unrelated case. The latest FIR also includes provisions of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act 2024 , an oppressive law that effectively does away with the right to protest in Islamabad. The law defines ‘assembly’ as any gathering of more than 15 people, and makes assemblies subject to prior permission from the district magistrate. Authorities have the power to “recall” or “amend” permission. A police officer, on the instructions of the district magistrate, can order dispersal of a protest “likely to disturb the public peace”. The law imposes criminal penalties of imprisonment of up to three years or fines for being a member of an assembly classified as unlawful. The message that is being sent through these cases is that no form of dissent — whether online or on the streets — is acceptable. Legal resistance will be met with retaliation. Speaking out against enforced disappearances on social media is being treated as a criminal offence. Protesting against the destructive constitutional amendments can lead to criminal cases being registered. The anti-terrorism law was introduced as a special law to address terrorism offences, and special courts were created to hear terrorism cases. Using this law against human rights defenders, journalists, and lawyers subverts its very purpose. There are reports of a spike in terrorism incidents, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Yet, the state is focusing its resources on categorising human rights defenders and lawyers as terrorists. The misuse of power is a betrayal of the state’s responsibility. And this conduct reflects a deliberate strategy of intimidation designed to silence voices that hold state power accountable. The visuals and manner of the arrest were equally shameful. “Eyewitnesses report that law enforcement officials used undue force against both the lawyers, and no reasons were provided at the time of arrest, raising serious concerns about their safety,” per Amnesty International. Imaan’s mother, former federal minister for human rights Dr Shireen Mazari said: “I have no idea where my daughter and her husband have been taken”. The state’s actions signal a breakdown of the law and the increasing capacity of the state to act with complete impunity. Arresting individuals without informing them of the charge and withholding information from their legal counsel and families is a clear violation of due process. Such actions are the hallmarks of authoritarianism, not lawful governance. Post-amendment judiciary While two officers of the court are subjected to legal harassment, the post-amendment judiciary serves its intended purpose by allowing it to continue. A society in which the judiciary does not defend rights and prevent blatant abuse of power is a frightening place, leaving citizens entirely unprotected and vulnerable to arbitrary executive action. As per the 26th and 27th amendments, the Judicial Commission, including members of the executive, shall conduct an “annual performance evaluation” of the judges of high courts. If judges are to be “evaluated” by a commission that has government representatives on it, independent decision-making is compromised. If a judge renders a decision against the government, the government representatives in the commission may render a negative evaluation against the judge. The provision effectively places a sword of Damocles over the judiciary and allows the executive to intimidate judges. Imaan and Hadi are among the few lawyers in Pakistan who consistently represent the most vulnerable victims of state abuse, from families of victims of enforced disappearances to those caught up in blasphemy cases. Pakistan’s fear of its human rights defenders is a confession: the truth is more threatening than anything else. This is not just about two individuals facing legal harassment.

      "title_orig": "Iran will treat any attack as ‘all-out war against us,’ says senior Iran official",
      "summary_orig": "Iran will treat any attack “as an all-out war against us,” a senior Iranian official said on Friday, ahead of the arrival of a US military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days. “This military buildup — we hope it is not intended for real confrontation — but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran,” said the senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “This time we will treat any attack — limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it — as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this,” the official said. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an “armada” heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program. “If the Americans violate Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond,” said the Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like. “A country under constant military threat from the United States has no option but to ensure that everything at its disposal can be used to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran,” the official said. The US military has, in the past, periodically sent increased forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive. However, the US military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran’s nuclear program. Air France suspends service to Dubai as KLM halts Middle East flights At least two European airlines suspended flights to cities in the Middle East on Friday, with Air France saying it will temporarily stop service to Dubai due to the geopolitical situation. Dutch airline KLM also halted flights until further notice to cities in the Middle East and would not fly through the airspace of several countries in the region, including Iraq and Iran, according to the Netherlands’ state broadcaster. “Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the company has decided to temporarily suspend its service to Dubai,” France’s national carrier said in a statement to AFP. The airline added it was “constantly monitoring the evolution of the geopolitical situation in the territories served and overflown by its aircraft” to ensure “the highest level of safety and security” for its flights. “Air France is monitoring the situation in real time and will provide further updates on its flight schedule,” the French airline said. KLM told Dutch public broadcaster NOS on Friday that it had suspended flights until further notice to Tel Aviv, Dubai, Dammam and Riyadh and would not fly through the airspace of Iraq, Iran, Israel and several countries in the Gulf.

Trump has repeatedly threatened US strikes on Iran over the crackdown on the protest movement that recently erupted across the Islamic republic. The prospect of military action appeared to recede last week after the White House said Tehran had halted planned executions of demonstrators, but Trump on Thursday confirmed continuing military preparations. “You know we have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case… We have a big force going toward Iran,” he said.",

      "summary_en": "Iran will treat any attack “as an all-out war against us,” a senior Iranian official said on Friday, ahead of the arrival of a US military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days. “This military buildup — we hope it is not intended for real confrontation — but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran,” said the senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “This time we will treat any attack — limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it — as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this,” the official said. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an “armada” heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program. “If the Americans violate Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond,” said the Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like. “A country under constant military threat from the United States has no option but to ensure that everything at its disposal can be used to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran,” the official said. The US military has, in the past, periodically sent increased forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive. However, the US military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran’s nuclear program. Air France suspends service to Dubai as KLM halts Middle East flights At least two European airlines suspended flights to cities in the Middle East on Friday, with Air France saying it will temporarily stop service to Dubai due to the geopolitical situation. Dutch airline KLM also halted flights until further notice to cities in the Middle East and would not fly through the airspace of several countries in the region, including Iraq and Iran, according to the Netherlands’ state broadcaster. “Due to the current situation in the Middle East, the company has decided to temporarily suspend its service to Dubai,” France’s national carrier said in a statement to AFP. The airline added it was “constantly monitoring the evolution of the geopolitical situation in the territories served and overflown by its aircraft” to ensure “the highest level of safety and security” for its flights. “Air France is monitoring the situation in real time and will provide further updates on its flight schedule,” the French airline said. KLM told Dutch public broadcaster NOS on Friday that it had suspended flights until further notice to Tel Aviv, Dubai, Dammam and Riyadh and would not fly through the airspace of Iraq, Iran, Israel and several countries in the Gulf.

      "summary_orig": "Negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the United States will meet in Abu Dhabi on Saturday for the second day of negotiations on a plan being pushed by US President Donald Trump to end the almost four-year-long war. The first known direct contact between Ukrainian and Russian officials on the proposal began Friday. Ukraine’s chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said the discussions focused “on the parameters for ending Russia’s war and the further logic of the negotiation process”. An initial US draft drew heavy criticism in Kyiv and western Europe for hewing too closely to Moscow’s line, while later iterations prompted pushback from Russia for floating the idea of European peacekeepers. Both sides say the fate of territory in the eastern Donbas region is one of the main outstanding issues in the search for a settlement to a war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and decimated parts of Ukraine. The UAE foreign ministry said in a statement that the talks were scheduled to last two days and were “part of ongoing efforts to promote dialogue and identify political solutions to the crisis”. Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday and US envoy Steve Witkoff later held talks with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin. Donbas dispute The Emirates meeting began as thousands of people in Kyiv were without heating in sub-zero temperatures due to Russian strikes. The European Union, which has sent hundreds of generators, accused Moscow of “deliberately depriving civilians of heat”. Further Russian strikes killed one person and injured 22 others in Ukraine’s capital and the northeastern city of Kharkiv overnight, authorities said early Saturday. “Kyiv is under a massive enemy attack,” Mayor Vitali Klitschko posted on Telegram, adding that several non-residential buildings had been hit and telling residents to remain in shelters. While diplomacy to end Europe’s worst conflict since World War II has gained pace, Moscow and Kyiv appear deadlocked over the issue of territory. Hours after Putin met Witkoff — and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner — in Moscow, the Kremlin said its maximalist demand that Kyiv withdraw from the eastern Donbas region still stood. “Russia’s position is well known on the fact that Ukraine, Ukrainian armed forces, have to leave the territory of the Donbas,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “This is a very important condition,” he added. Kyiv, which still controls around 20 per cent of the eastern region, has rejected such terms. ‘Desire to end the war’ Ahead of the talks Zelensky told reporters territory remained a “key issue” — with Moscow having said it is not dropping its demand that Kyiv pull out of its eastern Donbas region. In a post online, he later added: “It is necessary that not only Ukraine has the desire to end the war and achieve full security, but that a similar desire somehow emerges in Russia as well.” Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are last known to have met face-to-face in Istanbul last summer, in talks that ended only in deals to exchange captured soldiers. The Abu Dhabi meeting is the first time they have faced each other to talk about the Trump administration’s plan. Putin has repeatedly said Moscow intends to get full control of eastern Ukraine by force if talks fail. After the Russia-US talks in the Kremlin, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov insisted Moscow was “genuinely interested in resolving” the war diplomatically. But he added: “Until that happens, Russia will continue to achieve its objectives… on the battlefield.” Trump has in the past pressured Ukraine to agree to terms that Kyiv sees as capitulation. Trump repeated on Wednesday his belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal. “I believe they’re at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don’t, they’re stupid — that goes for both of them,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "India and Europe hope to strike the “mother of all deals” when European Union (EU) chiefs meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi next week, as the two economic behemoths seek to forge closer ties. Facing challenges from China and the United States, India and the European Union have been negotiating a massive free trade pact — and talks, first launched about two decades ago, are nearing the finishing line. “We are on the cusp of a historic trade agreement,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week. Von der Leyen and European Council president Antonio Costa will attend Republic Day celebrations on Monday before an EU-India summit on Tuesday, where they hope to shake hands on the accord. Securing a pact, described by India’s Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal as “the mother of all deals”, would be a major win for Brussels and New Delhi as both seek to open up new markets in the face of US tariffs and Chinese export controls . But officials have been eager to stress there is more to it than commerce. “The EU and India are moving closer together at the time when the rules-based international order is under unprecedented pressure through wars, coercion and economic fragmentation,” the EU’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on Wednesday. ‘Untapped potential’ Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and US President Donald Trump’s punitive tariffs have brought momentum to the relationship between India and the EU, said Praveen Donthi, of the International Crisis Group think tank. “The EU eyes the Indian market and aims to steer a rising power like India away from Russia, while India seeks to diversify its partnerships, doubling down on its strategy of multi-alignment at a time when its relations with the US have taken a downward turn,” he said. Spain’s Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares shakes hand with India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar during a visit to New Delhi, India on Jan 21, 2026. — Spain’s Foreign Ministry via Reuters The summit will offer Brussels the chance to turn the page after a bruising transatlantic crisis over Greenland — now seemingly defused. Together, the EU and India account for about a quarter of the world’s population and GDP. Bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion ($139bn) in 2024, an increase of nearly 90 per cent over the past decade, according to EU figures, with a further €60bn ($69bn ) in trade in services. But both parties are eager to do more. “India still accounts for around only around 2.5 per cent of total EU trade in goods, compared with close to 15 per cent for China,” an EU official said, adding the figure gave a sense of the “untapped potential” an agreement could unlock. EU makers of cars, machinery and chemicals have much to gain from India lowering entry barriers, said Ignacio Garcia Bercero, an analyst at Brussels think tank Bruegel, who led EU trade talks with New Delhi over a decade ago. “India is one of the most heavily protected economies in the world, with very, very high tariffs, including on many products where the European Union has a competitive advantage,” he told AFP . With its economy in the doldrums, the 27-member EU is also pushing to ease exports of spirits and wines and strengthen intellectual property rules. India — the fastest-growing major economy in the world — wants easier market access for products such as textiles and pharmaceuticals. Defence pact EU officials were tight-lipped about the deal’s contents as negotiations are ongoing. But agriculture, a sensitive topic in both India and Europe, is likely to play a limited role, with New Delhi eager to protect its dairy and grain sectors. Talks are focusing on a few sticking points, including the impact of the EU’s carbon border tax on steel exports and safety and quality standards in the pharmaceutical and automotive sectors, according to people familiar with the discussions. Still, EU officials said they were confident negotiations could be concluded in time for the summit. An accord on mobility to facilitate movement for seasonal workers, students, researchers and highly skilled professionals, is also on the menu, alongside a security and defence pact. The latter envisages closer cooperation in areas including maritime security, cybersecurity and counter-terrorism, an EU official said. It is also a “precondition” for the possible joint production of military equipment, said a second EU official. New Delhi, which has relied on Moscow for decades for key military hardware, has tried to cut its dependence on Russia in recent years by diversifying imports and pushing its own domestic manufacturing base .

      "title_orig": "War in Gaza weakened Arab states, emboldened Israel, says Vali Nasr",
      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: Iranian-American academic and political scientist Vali Nasr suggested on Friday that the war on Palestine had politically weakened Arab states and emboldened Israeli leaders, to the point that the latter had abandoned the two-state framework entirely. Speaking at a session titled ‘The Gaza War and the Remaking of the Middle East’, moderated by journalist Najam Sethi, Mr Nasr implied that the situation has proven detrimental to the Palestinian cause. He said Israel now believes it can pursue its objectives primarily through force. “With Arab states politically neutralised, Israeli leaders see little incentive to return to negotiations,” he added. According to him, Israeli leadership now views political compromise with the Palestinians as a security liability rather than a pathway to stability, effectively abandoning the two-state framework. Following the Gaza war, Israel moved against Hezbollah in Lebanon, significantly weakening the group’s operational capacity. The collapse of the Assad regime in Syria in December 2024 further altered the regional balance. Scholar notes Pakistan currently enjoying ‘diplomatic honeymoon’ with Washington, which won’t last for long Hamas, Hezbollah and the Syrian government, long aligned with Iran and regarded as part of the so-called “axis of resistance”, were effectively dismantled. “With this strategic buffer around Israel gone, Israeli policymakers believed they could confront Iran more directly,” the political scientist said, referring to Israeli-US military strikes on Iran in October 2024. He said Arab states have also seen their influence in regional affairs diminish, leaving them increasingly sidelined. Israel, Mr Nasr argued, has concluded that military strength is now its primary guarantee of security. As Iran’s regional influence declined, Arab and Muslim countries reassessed Tehran’s strategic importance as a symbol, pillar, and financier of resistance. “Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey moved to restore and strengthen ties with Iran, recognising its symbolic and geopolitical counterweight to Israel,” he said. Mr Nasr also said the events of Oct 7, 2023 marked a turning point that reshaped regional politics and power dynamics. “In many ways, everything in the Middle East changed on that day,” he said. Until then, he explained, US strategy in the region centred on normalising Saudi-Israeli relations, expanding the Abraham Accords, building regional trade corridors, and linking Middle Eastern economies with Europe and India while bypassing China. “The events of October 7 pushed the Palestinian issue, which the US and many regional allies had put on the back burner, back to the centre of global attention,” Mr Nasr said, adding that Israel’s security doctrine has since undergone a fundamental shift. He also criticised the “ Board of Peace ” initiative announced by US President Donald Trump, calling it ineffective because it excludes Palestinians. According to Mr Nasr, several participating countries joined mainly to maintain favourable relations with Trump rather than to advance a genuine peace process. Despite the shifting landscape, the political scientist said key questions remain unresolved. “The future of Gaza is still unclear. There are also uncertainties surrounding the role of a potential Pakistan-Saudi defence partnership and how Iran and Turkey will manage their competing interests in Syria,” he said. However, he concluded that the regional balance of power has already undergone a historic shift. “The Middle East has entered a new phase, and this transformation may well be permanent,” he said. ‘Diplomatic honeymoon’ In a separate discussion, titled ‘Pakistan: Between the USA and China’, Mr Nasr argued against the view that China’s rise is irreversible and America’s decline is inevitable, advising middle powers such as Pakistan to focus on strengthening their own technological and economic foundations. Sharing the stage with former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and journalist Raza Rumi, Mr Nasr described Pakistan’s current relationship with Washington as a diplomatic “honeymoon”, which had so far helped shield Islamabad from difficult questions regarding its strategic ties with China and its defence cooperation with Saudi Arabia. “This relationship has also helped Pakistan avoid scrutiny over its conflict with India, largely because it played its diplomatic cards well,” he said. Noting that Pakistan had also benefited from the recent strain in US-India ties, Mr Nasr cautioned that this favourable phase may not last long. “The United States effectively has two centres of power — one represented by the White House and the other by permanent institutions such as the State Department and the Pentagon,” he said. “Pakistan is currently engaging mainly with the White House and benefiting from it, but the institutional system is likely to reassert itself and reopen uncomfortable discussions.” Ms Khar largely agreed with Nasr’s assessment, and called for Pakistan to deepen its alignment with China — which she described as more predictable and consistent in its diplomacy — while maintaining constructive relations with the United States. “The US remains a global superpower and Pakistan must remain on the right side of Washington,” she said, but warned policymakers not to assume that this situation would last.
