      "summary_orig": "Israel and Hamas agreed on Thursday to the first phase of a Gaza ceasefire aimed at ending a conflict that has killed tens of thousands, razed the Palestinian territory and unleashed a major humanitarian crisis. The deal, to be signed Thursday, includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel. Key developments US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”; says he thinks captives will probably be released on Monday Palestinian group Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, US President Donald Trump said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal. Qatar said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”. Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP Thursday. The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said. The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added. The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement “I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network. “This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.” Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!” He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”. “The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview. “This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”. In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.” “Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”. Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”. In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt. “I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza. Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier. An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday. Announcement opportunity to secure lasting peace in Middle East: PM Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the announcement was a “historic opportunity to secure lasting peace in the Middle East”. “President Trump’s leadership throughout the process of dialogue and negotiations reflects his unwavering commitment to world peace,” he said in a post on X. “The resolute and wise leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye are also to be applauded for their untiring efforts to negotiate a deal,” he said. “Most of all, we must all pay tribute to the Palestinian people—who have suffered in an unprecedented manner, one that should never, ever be repeated,” he said. He also noted with concern and strongly condemned “recent provocations at Masjid Al Aqsa”. “The world must hold the occupiers and illegal settlers to account and prevent any further actions that undermine the enormous efforts made by President Trump to reduce tensions and pave the way for lasting peace,” he said. “We will continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people are established in accordance with their wishes and UN resolutions,” he said. ‘Optimism prevails’ As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air. “We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza. Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce. In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday. Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible. The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning. Protests, prisoners Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return. One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for. High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media. Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”. Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration. Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen. There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007. Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries. It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza. Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack.",

For five days last week, I was part of a small group of Pakistani journalists invited by the European Union (EU) to visit Brussels and interact with their officials who deal with all manner of issues, from Pakistan to Russia to the Middle East and the US and the big tech platforms. Over the years, I have been a part of many such delegations hosted by many different countries but there was something different this time. This was the first time in any such visit that nobody had any major complaint against Pakistan. People asked about Pakistan’s relations with China , and though there was a competitive aspect to the questioning, it wasn’t hostile. This is a sharp break from all my previous such engagements. Over the years, it had been quite normal on such trips for one major complaint against Pakistan to dominate the agenda. For example, over a decade ago, on a similar trip to Australia, everybody we met asked about the Supreme Court’s verdict on the Reko Diq deal. In other trips, it was perceived support for terrorist groups based out of Pakistan that were the bone of contention. In at least two such trips, there was active shouting, mostly by officials from the other side. It is easy to see that something important has changed and Pakistan’s stock in the eyes of the European capitals has risen. Given the renewed bonhomie between Pakistan’s leadership and the Trump administration, as well as the good relations Pakistan is enjoying with China and the important partnerships shaping up with Saudi Arabia and Turkiye , the sharp turnaround in Pakistan’s fortunes on the global stage is palpable. The engagements in the EU only served to underscore this reality. Everybody laid the emphasis on GSP-Plus as the central plank of the EU’s relationship with Pakistan. The grant of this preferential trade status, through which Pakistan ran a trade surplus of almost $6 billion from the EU last year, is up for renewal and a team will be visiting in November to take stock of the progress the government has made in meeting the rights-related benchmarks set out for it. These include, but are not limited to, treatment of religious minorities, continuation of the moratorium on the death penalty along with reform of the procedure for clemency, enforced disappearances, labour rights and more. Something important has changed and Pakistan’s stock in the eyes of the European capitals has risen. There are a lot of specifics to discuss, but the overall sense was positive. The message from the EU side was to not take the GSP-Plus status for granted, but the sense was also there that Pakistan has been making visible progress in meeting the benchmarks for renewal so far. Room for complacency is limited, but so is room for alarm. Pakistan’s relations with China are being seen with some concern in Brussels, but nothing that would imply a zero-sum view of the situation. What was obvious from the engagements is that the EU’s interests in Pakistan are limited by comparison to China’s. For Brussels, the agenda is dominated by Russia and the war in Ukraine , which, they underscored repeatedly, they view as a ‘war of imperialist aggression’ and they would brook no talk of it as anything other than an act of naked aggression. Next up, their agenda is full: trying to deal with a capricious Trump administration. The challenge from America is twofold. First is the melting away of the security-related commitments under which Europe has grown up after World War II. Increasingly, they are being told to arrange for their own security, either by footing the bill for Nato, by raising their own defence expenditures, or by raising their own forces altogether. Second, and not any less important, is the end of the era of free trade that America had long championed, along with Europe. In one frank exchange, an official agreed that the tariff wars are not some temporary aberration. Rather, they herald the rise of a new protectionism that will define the world economy from here onwards. For Europe, this is a serious problem. They are adjusting, we were told, by diversifying their exports and engaging with regional trade blocs like Mercosur in South America or the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in the Asia-Pacific (among others). According to their calculations, these arrangements can help compensate for almost 75 per cent of the loss they will suffer from being cut out of the American market, and the remaining 25pc they intend to make up from increased trade initiatives within the EU itself. Both of these are a long shot. Fiscally, the states that make up the EU are burdened with expenditures they cannot sustain, so carrying greater defence expenditures will be a tough choice. And in trade they are getting beaten by China and dumped by the US. At the same time, they are acutely aware of the growing danger from right-wing neo-populist parties from within, which poses a threat to the multilateral cosmopolitanism that the EU embodies. This makes the populism engulfing America, which is driving that country to retreat from its trade and security commitments, more familiar to Europeans than to their peers in Asia, because their own societies are wracked by the same phenomenon. Our own prodding on the genocide in Gaza was usually met with a stock answer that for the EU to agree on a course of action, a large number of countries have to come to an agreement around it. They were aware that this places a question mark over the EU’s professed commitment to values as the cornerstone of its foreign policy, and in one case, they tried to point to the resolution passed by the European Parliament in September calling for a ceasefire and a resumption of humanitarian aid to Gaza.

      "summary_orig": "PAKISTAN presented its first Nationally Determined Contributions in 2016, updating it in 2021 and most recently submitting NDC 3.0 last month. The latest asks for $565.7 billion in climate finance. Implementation of the first two? Marginal. Catastrophic floods in 2021 and 2025 affecting all provinces proved the point. As climate change accelerates, our resilience erodes further. The reason is simple: Pakistan’s NDCs were top-down federal documents for bottom-up provincial subjects. Constitutional reality: The 18th Amendment devolved climate-relevant sectors to the provinces. Agriculture, water management, urban planning, disaster response, irrigation, land use, forestry, infrastructure development and construction standards are all provincial subjects. These are where climate impacts hit and where adaptation must happen. The first two NDCs were federal exercises. The climate change ministry reached out to the federal and provincial departments, set national targets and submitted documents to the UNFCCC. The provinces were not asked to develop their own NDCs, prepare implementation strategies, estimate financial needs or align budgets with climate commitments. Federal pledges were disconnected from provincial capacity. Provincial development budgets total Rs2,869bn in 2025-26 — nearly three times the federal PSDP. These resources proceed without systematic alignment with NDC commitments. The machinery implementing development has never been oriented towards systematic climate action. Case study in federal-provincial disconnect: The 2021 and 2025 floods exposed how federal NDC commitments fail without provincial implementation. Both the 2016 and 2021 NDCs pledged climate-resilient agriculture, improved drainage infrastructure and enhanced disaster preparedness. Yet when calamity hit, provincial responses revealed complete disarray. Sindh’s agriculture department had no plans for salt-tolerant crop varieties despite federal commitments. Its irrigation department hadn’t climate-proofed canal systems. Provincial disaster management lacked pre-positioned resources, early warning integration, and evacuation protocols at scale. When the floods hit, Sindh requested emergency federal intervention rather than implementing existing NDC adaptation measures. The floods exposed how federal NDC obligations fail without provincial implementation. Punjab’s drainage systems remained unchanged despite years of federal flood resilience pledges. Its irrigation department continued operating colonial-era infrastructure. Provincial planning had approved countless urban development PC-1s in flood-prone areas without EIAs or climate screening. Punjab’s own climate vulnerability assessment mandated by federal policy had never been completed. Balochistan’s water infrastructure couldn’t handle extreme rainfall because its planning had never developed the watershed management systems promised in federal NDC documents. KP’s disaster preparedness was compromised because the provincial DMA had received neither the budget nor the institutional mandate to implement federal adaptation commitments. The floods revealed that federal ministries can pledge climate action to the UNFCCC, but only provincial departments can deliver it. Provincial subjects, federal commitments: Agriculture is provincial. Sindh controls 5.4 million acres of irrigated land supporting cotton, rice, sugarcane. Punjab manages 14m acres producing wheat, rice and cotton. Each requires distinct climate strategies. Sindh needs salinity management and heat-resistant varieties. Punjab needs water-efficient irrigation and crop diversification. Federal NDC commitments to ‘climate-resilient agriculture’ mean nothing without the provinces developing costed plans, their irrigation departments modernising infrastructure and their budgets funding implementation. Urban resilience is provincial and municipal. Sindh faces coastal flooding, extreme heat and inadequate drainage. Punjab confronts air quality crises, urban heat islands and monsoon flooding. Cities experience industrial water pollution and heat stress. Each area needs its own nuanced resilient-development priorities. Political economy: Different political parties entrenched in different provinces create implementation barriers rarely acknowledged in federal NDC documents. Divergent political priorities make provincial implementation negotiable rather than automatic. The federal government has prioritised emergency cash disbursements over provincial NDC implementation capacity. This treats disaster response and disaster prevention as separate rather than integrated interventions. Planning departments in Sindh and Punjab approve countless PC-1s annually without reference to federal NDC targets, while provincial finance departments don’t track climate-relevant spending or organise budgets around NDC priorities. The World Bank and ADB have committed over $60bn since 2016, much of the amount flowing through provincial projects, yet systematic alignment with NDCs priorities is absent without the provinces owning the commitments. Provincial ownership: Provincial NDCs would need each province to assess specific vulnerabilities and develop locally led responses. For example, Sindh would quantify coastal inundation risk, estimate costs for mangrove restoration and coastal defences, and budget for heat action plans in Karachi, Hyderabad and Thatta. Punjab would assess water scarcity in Bahawalpur and Multan districts and budget for urban heat mitigation in Lahore and Faisalabad. Balochistan would map drought vulnerability, estimate small-scale water harvesting needs and budget for rangeland management. KP and GB would assess GLOF risk and budget for disaster preparedness in the northern districts. Provincial finance departments would tag climate expenditures in annual budgets. NDC alignment for PC-1 approvals would be mandatory. Citizens’ groups have already begun to hold provincial governments accountable for climate failures, including Sindh for Karachi’s heat deaths and Punjab for Lahore’s poor air quality. Path forward: The Pakistan Climate Change Council must require each province to develop its own NDCs aligned with the national framework and based on provincial stakeholder consultation. Adaptation and mitigation strategies must have clear budgets, timelines, baselines and indicators. The Planning Commission will need to take the lead in climate-proofing the PSDP. The Economic Affairs Department must engage with the World Bank and ADB to align their $1.5-2bn annual portfolios with provincial NDC implementation. Without provincial NDCs backed by provincial implementation strategies and provincial budgets, federal climate commitments to the UNFCCC will continue to be contradicted by the provincial planning departments and undermined by provincial budget allocations. The third federal NDC will fail like the first two did unless it catalyses provincial ownership. That is the lesson Pakistan must finally learn.

Constitutional reality: The 18th Amendment devolved climate-relevant sectors to the provinces. Agriculture, water management, urban planning, disaster response, irrigation, land use, forestry, infrastructure development and construction standards are all provincial subjects. These are where climate impacts hit and where adaptation must happen. The first two NDCs were federal exercises. The climate change ministry reached out to the federal and provincial departments, set national targets and submitted documents to the UNFCCC. The provinces were not asked to develop their own NDCs, prepare implementation strategies, estimate financial needs or align budgets with climate commitments. Federal pledges were disconnected from provincial capacity. Provincial development budgets total Rs2,869bn in 2025-26 — nearly three times the federal PSDP. These resources proceed without systematic alignment with NDC commitments. The machinery implementing development has never been oriented towards systematic climate action. Case study in federal-provincial disconnect: The 2021 and 2025 floods exposed how federal NDC commitments fail without provincial implementation. Both the 2016 and 2021 NDCs pledged climate-resilient agriculture, improved drainage infrastructure and enhanced disaster preparedness. Yet when calamity hit, provincial responses revealed complete disarray. Sindh’s agriculture department had no plans for salt-tolerant crop varieties despite federal commitments. Its irrigation department hadn’t climate-proofed canal systems. Provincial disaster management lacked pre-positioned resources, early warning integration, and evacuation protocols at scale. When the floods hit, Sindh requested emergency federal intervention rather than implementing existing NDC adaptation measures. The floods exposed how federal NDC obligations fail without provincial implementation. Punjab’s drainage systems remained unchanged despite years of federal flood resilience pledges. Its irrigation department continued operating colonial-era infrastructure. Provincial planning had approved countless urban development PC-1s in flood-prone areas without EIAs or climate screening. Punjab’s own climate vulnerability assessment mandated by federal policy had never been completed. Balochistan’s water infrastructure couldn’t handle extreme rainfall because its planning had never developed the watershed management systems promised in federal NDC documents. KP’s disaster preparedness was compromised because the provincial DMA had received neither the budget nor the institutional mandate to implement federal adaptation commitments. The floods revealed that federal ministries can pledge climate action to the UNFCCC, but only provincial departments can deliver it. Provincial subjects, federal commitments: Agriculture is provincial. Sindh controls 5.4 million acres of irrigated land supporting cotton, rice, sugarcane. Punjab manages 14m acres producing wheat, rice and cotton. Each requires distinct climate strategies. Sindh needs salinity management and heat-resistant varieties. Punjab needs water-efficient irrigation and crop diversification. Federal NDC commitments to ‘climate-resilient agriculture’ mean nothing without the provinces developing costed plans, their irrigation departments modernising infrastructure and their budgets funding implementation. Urban resilience is provincial and municipal. Sindh faces coastal flooding, extreme heat and inadequate drainage. Punjab confronts air quality crises, urban heat islands and monsoon flooding. Cities experience industrial water pollution and heat stress. Each area needs its own nuanced resilient-development priorities. Political economy: Different political parties entrenched in different provinces create implementation barriers rarely acknowledged in federal NDC documents. Divergent political priorities make provincial implementation negotiable rather than automatic. The federal government has prioritised emergency cash disbursements over provincial NDC implementation capacity. This treats disaster response and disaster prevention as separate rather than integrated interventions. Planning departments in Sindh and Punjab approve countless PC-1s annually without reference to federal NDC targets, while provincial finance departments don’t track climate-relevant spending or organise budgets around NDC priorities. The World Bank and ADB have committed over $60bn since 2016, much of the amount flowing through provincial projects, yet systematic alignment with NDCs priorities is absent without the provinces owning the commitments. Provincial ownership: Provincial NDCs would need each province to assess specific vulnerabilities and develop locally led responses. For example, Sindh would quantify coastal inundation risk, estimate costs for mangrove restoration and coastal defences, and budget for heat action plans in Karachi, Hyderabad and Thatta. Punjab would assess water scarcity in Bahawalpur and Multan districts and budget for urban heat mitigation in Lahore and Faisalabad. Balochistan would map drought vulnerability, estimate small-scale water harvesting needs and budget for rangeland management. KP and GB would assess GLOF risk and budget for disaster preparedness in the northern districts. Provincial finance departments would tag climate expenditures in annual budgets. NDC alignment for PC-1 approvals would be mandatory. Citizens’ groups have already begun to hold provincial governments accountable for climate failures, including Sindh for Karachi’s heat deaths and Punjab for Lahore’s poor air quality. Path forward: The Pakistan Climate Change Council must require each province to develop its own NDCs aligned with the national framework and based on provincial stakeholder consultation. Adaptation and mitigation strategies must have clear budgets, timelines, baselines and indicators. The Planning Commission will need to take the lead in climate-proofing the PSDP. The Economic Affairs Department must engage with the World Bank and ADB to align their $1.5-2bn annual portfolios with provincial NDC implementation. Without provincial NDCs backed by provincial implementation strategies and provincial budgets, federal climate commitments to the UNFCCC will continue to be contradicted by the provincial planning departments and undermined by provincial budget allocations. The third federal NDC will fail like the first two did unless it catalyses provincial ownership. That is the lesson Pakistan must finally learn.

About a week after KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur complained to incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan about the latter’s sister — reportedly going so far as to accuse her of attempting to ‘hijack’ the party with the help of an intelligence agency — he has been told to step down as provincial chief executive. Mr Gandapur had laid bare his grievances concerning Aleema Khan in his first meeting with the jailed former prime minister in many months, primarily accusing her of ‘dividing’ the party and not doing enough to rein in his critics. It may be recalled that this meeting took place shortly after the PTI’s Sept 27 political rally in Peshawar, during which party workers had protested rather boorishly as Mr Gandapur addressed the crowd. The outgoing chief minister appears to have taken the insult to heart. It had been becoming clear that Mr Khan might soon have to choose between the two, and even though he did briefly prohibit them from bickering, ultimately, he seems to have felt that blood runs thicker than water. One wonders how Mr Gandapur feels about this rather unceremonious dismissal. He appears to have been constantly under pressure from the PTI’s support base for not taking a more aggressive stance against the federal government and the state. This pressure had grown as Mr Khan’s incarceration continued to drag on. The party’s new nominee for the position, Sohail Afridi, is said to be a more combative person, but how much can he do in the same position? It seems Mr Gandapur’s critics never came to terms with the fact that official titles and roles often come with their own very heavy restrictions. One must wait to see what the change of command will portend for the party. One thing that does not seem to have changed is the constant conflict that surrounds the PTI chief. And, because of this, chaos still defines everything the party does. A major decision has been taken rather abruptly, and few really seem to know why. The party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, has framed it as a desire for a ‘fresh start’ after the failure of Mr Gandapur’s government to implement Mr Khan’s vision. Some are taking Mr Afridi’s nomination as a signal of the overall direction that the PTI may be orienting itself towards. The party recently announced Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Raja Nasir Abbas as its nominees for opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate. It was seen as a provocation. With Mr Afridi’s addition to the PTI’s list of most important representatives, the party will be perceived to be taking a hard line. It would be interesting to see what developments unfold in the days to come. Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2025",

      "title_orig": "Ex-senator Mushtaq departs for Pakistan",
      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan embassy in Jordan said late on Wednesday that former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan. Ahmad led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan. “In accordance with the instructions of the honorable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said. The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post. Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi. According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home. “He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Mushtaq was scheduled to reach Pakistan today. On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said. “Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said. Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said.

      "summary_en": "The Pakistan embassy in Jordan said late on Wednesday that former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan. Ahmad led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan. “In accordance with the instructions of the honorable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said. The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post. Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi. According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home. “He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Mushtaq was scheduled to reach Pakistan today. On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia. “Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said. “Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said. Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over. “I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention. “During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said. He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down. “We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted.

      "summary_orig": "CHICAGO: President Donald Trump on Wednesday called for jailing Chicago’s mayor and the governor of Illinois, both Democrats, as his administration prepared to deploy troops to the streets of the third-largest US city. Neither Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson nor Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker have been accused of criminal wrongdoing, though both have emerged as prominent opponents of Trump’s immigration crackdown and deployment of National Guard troops in Democratic-leaning cities. Trump’s call to imprison the two elected officials comes as another high-profile political rival, former FBI director James Comey, appeared in court to face criminal charges that have been widely criticised as flimsy. Donald Trump has frequently called for jailing his opponents since he first entered politics in 2015, but Comey is the first to face prosecution. On his social media platform, the president accused Johnson and Pritzker of failing to protect immigration officers who have been operating in Chicago. “The Chicago mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice officers! Governor Pritzker also!” Trump wrote, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel. ‘ICE free zone’ Johnson signed an executive order on Monday creating an “ICE Free Zone” that prohibits federal immigration agents from using city property in their operations. Hundreds of Texas National Guard soldiers have gathered at an army facility outside Chicago, over the objections of Pritzker, Johnson and other Democratic leaders in the state. Trump has threatened to deploy troops to more cities, which he said last week could serve as “training grounds” for the armed forces. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found most Americans oppose the deployment of troops without an external threat. Trump has ordered National Guard troops to Chicago and Portland , Oregon, following his earlier deployments to Los Angeles and Washington. In each case, he has defied staunch opposition from Democratic mayors and governors, who say Trump’s claims of lawlessness and violence do not reflect reality. “My goal is very simple. STOP CRIME IN AMERICA!” he wrote on his social media platform. Violent crime has been falling in many US cities since a Covid-era spike, and National Guard troops have so far been largely used to protect federal facilities, not fight street crime. Protests over Trump’s immigration policies in Chicago and Portland had been largely peaceful and limited in size, far from the conditions described by Trump administration officials. “What we have going on right now is literally domestic terrorism in Chicago,” Todd Blanche, the No. 2 Justice Department official, said on Fox News. Pritzker has accused Trump of trying to foment violence to justify further militarisation, and his state has sued to stop the deployment. A federal judge on Monday permitted the deployment to proceed for the time being. Another federal judge has blocked the deployment to Portland. Trump has threatened to invoke an anti-insurrection law to sidestep any court orders blocking him, which was last invoked during the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi left for New Delhi on Wednesday, the ministry said, in what would be the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since they seized power in 2021. Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will hold talks with Indian Foreign Minister Subra­hmanyam Jaisha­nkar and other officials on political, economic and trade issues, the Afghan foreign ministry added. The visit comes just a day after Muttaqi attended a regional meeting in Moscow where Afgha­nistan’s neighbours including Pakistan, Iran, China and several Central Asian countries issued a joint statement opposing the deployment of foreign military infrastructure in the region. The statement was regarded as a signal of opposition to US President Donald Trump’s stated objective to retake control of the Bagram military base near Kabul. So far, Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration. Historically, India and Afghanistan had friendly relations but New Delhi shut its embassy in Kabul after the 2021 US withdrawal from the war-shattered country and the return to power of the Taliban. India opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support and humanitarian aid. New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries. Muttaqi’s trip was made possible after the UN Security Council Com­mittee temporarily lifted a travel ban on him to allow diplomatic engagements abroad, India’s foreign ministry said last week. Discussions during Muttaqi’s trip will centre on bilateral cooperation, trade exchanges, exports of dry fruit, facilities in the health sector, consular services and various ports, the Afghan Taliban foreign ministry said last week. Bar on social media On the other hand, access to several social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, have been “intentionally restricted” in Afghanistan, internet watchdog NetBlocks said on Wednesday. Social media sites have been intermittently accessible on smartphones since Tuesday, AFP journalists reported, a week after a 48-hour nationwide internet and phone blackout was imposed by Taliban authorities. “The restrictions are now confirmed on multiple providers, the pattern shows an intentional restri­ction,” said NetBlocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance.

      "summary_orig": "Eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Wednesday. A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that last night, security forces conducted an IBO in Orakzai district on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khawarij . Fitna Al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). “During the conduct of operation, 19 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the ISPR said. It added that during the exchange of fire, 39-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq, who was leading his troops from the front, and his second-in-command, 33-year-old Major Tayyab Rahat, embraced martyrdom along with nine of their men. The soldiers were identified as 38-year-old Naib Subedar Azam Gul, 35-year-old Naik Adil Hussain, 34-year-old Naik Gul Ameer, 31-year-old Lance Naik Sher Khan, 32-year-old Lance Naik Talish Faraz, 32-year-old Lance Naik Irshad Hussain, 28-year-old Sepoy Tufail Khan, 23-year-old Sepoy Aqib Ali and 24-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Zahid. The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area. It further stated that security forces were “determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve”. Funeral prayers were offered for the two officers in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala district, which were attended by Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, federal ministers and military and civic officials, the ISPR said in a later statement. “The prime minister, while paying tribute to the 11 shuhadas (martyrs) of [the] Orakzai incident, resolved that [the] Pakistani nation stands resolute and firm against this menace of terrorism and the shuhadas’ ultimate sacrifice is a reminder of the unwavering resolve of the nation to defend the motherland at all costs,” the statement read, adding that the remaining nine martyrs would be laid to rest in their native towns with full military honours. Military and civilian officials offer funeral prayers for two officers martyred during an operation in KP’s Orakzai area in Rawalpindi on October 10. — Photo courtesy ISPR PM Shehbaz paid tributes to the country’s security forces for killing 19 terrorists and also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the soldiers, including Lieutenant Colonel Arif and Major Rahat, according to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office. “The sacrifices of the fearless sons of security forces will never go in vain,” he said. “We will crush the nefarious intentions of Indian-backed terrorists. We will not allow elements that harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he added. PM Shehbaz said the government was determined to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country. A statement issued by the presidency said President Asif Ali Zardari had paid tributes to the “courageous action of security forces in the Orakzai district”. It added, “[The] president expressed satisfaction over the elimination of 19 terrorists of the Indian-backed khwarij . The President declared Lt. Col. Junaid Tariq shaheed, Major Tayyab Rahat and other martyrs as heroes of the nation,” the statement read. It added that Zardari expressed heartfelt sympathy with the families of the martyrs, praying that they bear their loss with patience and courage. The president said that the brave sons set an eternal example by sacrificing their lives while defending their country. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a symbol of the nation’s resolve and unity.” He reiterated the “resolve to completely eliminate Indian-backed terrorism from the soil of Pakistan”. “The entire nation stands as a lead wall with its armed forces,” the statement quoted him as saying. A statement issued by the PPP said party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the 11 security personnel and paid them tributes. The statement posted on the PPP’s X account said Bilawal extended condolences to the families of the martyred and expressed solidarity with them. “Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs,” the statement said, adding that he reaffirmed his “unwavering support for the security forces during the ongoing operation for the elimination of terrorists”. National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, expressing grief over the martyrdom of the security personnel and paying tributes to them, reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate the threat of terrorism, state-run APP reported. “The sacrifices of our armed forces and security personnel in the war against terrorism will never go in vain. Terrorist […] will never succeed in fulfilling their nefarious designs,” the APP quoted him as saying. Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam said in a statement that he was “extremely dejected” to learn of the martyrdom of the personnel. “In this moment of profound grief, I extend my heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the government, armed forces and the people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families who have lost their loved ones,” the statement read. “May Allah Almighty grant eternal peace to the souls of the departed and bestow strength and patience upon their families.” Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Two reports , issued last week by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.",

      "title_orig": "Cristiano Ronaldo becomes football’s first billionaire, says report",
      "summary_orig": "Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first footballer to reach billionaire status, according to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index , which has valued the Portugal great’s net worth at an estimated $1.4 billion. The 40-year-old striker’s financial ascent comes after he signed a new contract with Saudi side Al-Nassr in June reportedly worth more than $400 million. Bloomberg said that Ronaldo earned more than $550m in salary between 2002 and 2023, supplemented by a decade-long Nike deal worth nearly $18m annually, and lucrative endorsements with Armani, Castrol and others that added more than $175m to his fortune. Ronaldo’s move to Al-Nassr from Manchester United in 2023 had already made him the highest-paid player in football history, with an annual salary of 177m pounds ($237.52m), plus bonuses and a reported 15 per cent share in his Saudi Arabia club. Argentina and Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi has earned more than $600m in pre-tax salary during his career. Ronaldo’s billionaire status places him among a rare group of athletes that includes basketball greats Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, golfer Tiger Woods and tennis player Roger Federer. Ronaldo suggested he is not considering retirement any time soon. “I still have a passion for this,” he said at the Portugal Football Globes gala on Tuesday. “My family says it’s time to quit and they ask me why I want to score 1000 goals if I’ve already scored 900-something. But I don’t think that way inside. “I’m still producing good things, I’m helping my club and the national team. Why not continue? I am sure that when I finish I will leave full because I gave everything of myself. I know I don’t have many years left to play, but the few I have left, I have to enjoy them to the fullest.”",

      "summary_en": "Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first footballer to reach billionaire status, according to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index , which has valued the Portugal great’s net worth at an estimated $1.4 billion. The 40-year-old striker’s financial ascent comes after he signed a new contract with Saudi side Al-Nassr in June reportedly worth more than $400 million. Bloomberg said that Ronaldo earned more than $550m in salary between 2002 and 2023, supplemented by a decade-long Nike deal worth nearly $18m annually, and lucrative endorsements with Armani, Castrol and others that added more than $175m to his fortune. Ronaldo’s move to Al-Nassr from Manchester United in 2023 had already made him the highest-paid player in football history, with an annual salary of 177m pounds ($237.52m), plus bonuses and a reported 15 per cent share in his Saudi Arabia club.

      "title_orig": "Unpacking 5 major controversies of Gandapur’s tenure as KP CM",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Wednesday announced that he would step down from his office and the PTI confirmed that party founder Imran Khan had given the direction to do so along with nominating Sohail Afridi for the provincial top slot. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar said Gandapur would send his resignation to the governor on Thursday. Gandapur assumed the office of chief minister after he was administered his oath by then-KP governor Haji Ghulam Ali on March 3, 2024. His tenure as chief minister was not without controversy, either involving the federal government or criticism from within his own party. In fact, it has been a tight-rope walk for the chief minister, from his first day in office, to balancing politics with realpolitik. He had to do business with the federal government, as KP is heavily dependent on its resources and the real power brokers. Government officials said that in the initial few months, Gandapur struggled to balance between focusing on governance and the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the province, and demands from the hawkish group within the party to launch protest caravans against Islamabad, at times giving marching orders without even bothering to check with him. Dawn.com unpacks five major controversies from his 19-month tenure: Corruption allegations Allegations of corruption and financial irregularity have plagued the Gandapur administration since its first year. Imran had sent a stern message from his prison cell to members of the KP government in August 2024 that they would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments. Shakeel Ahmad Khan, the former minister for communication and works, was subsequently removed from his position. In September 2024, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi alleged that Gandapur was involved in massive corruption in the province. In May 2025, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) said a preliminary probe revealed that officials of the communication and works department, Upper Kohistan, in connivance with officials of district accounts office of Upper Kohistan and a branch of National Bank of Pakistan, had misappropriated more than Rs30 billion from different projects through bogus withdrawal of funds from the national treasury in the name of several contractors, who didn’t carry out any civil work. The bureau claimed that the district accounts office of Upper Kohistan, without carrying out any verification of the alleged work done by the said contractors, passed the cheques amounting to billions of rupees, which were deposited by those contractors in their bank accounts. Direct communication with Afghanistan Another area of Gandapur’s policy that often landed him in direct confrontation with the federal government was his pursuit of a direct line of communication with the interim Afghan Taliban government as per Imran’s instructions. In September 2024, Gandapur said he had requested the ‘authorities’ for permission to hold talks with the Afghan government for peace in the province on Imran’s instructions , warning that he would proceed on his own if the request was not considered. The response was swift as the federal government and its allies lambasted Gandapur for his comments about unilaterally leading peace talks with Afghanistan, accusing him of exceeding his authority. The Foreign Office also jumped into the fray and unequivocally stated that conducting diplomatic negotiations with foreign governments was the sole domain of the federal government. The issue resurfaced in January when Gandapur announced plans to send a delegation to Afghanistan for dialogue on bilateral issues. The provincial government also said it would engage cross-border tribesmen to curb militancy and ensure regional peace . That led to Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Kashmir Affairs, and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam stating that negotiations with Afghanistan fell outside the provincial government’s jurisdiction. Backing down from his earlier assertiveness, Gandapur said in March that he was waiting for the federal government’s approval regarding the terms of reference for a jirga to negotiate with the Afghan government and last month, he disclosed that his passport had been blocked since May 9, 2023, so he couldn’t travel to Afghanistan for holding peace talks. The disclosure came after Imran directed Gandapur to visit Afghanistan and hold discussions with authorities regarding “mutual issues and peace and security to prevent the situation from deteriorating further”. Role in PTI protests Gandapur has also been the frequent victim of criticism by PTI supporters, particularly on social media, regarding his contribution and role in advocating for Imran’s release. The most challenges Gandapur faced emanated from within his own party. The PTI staged a protest in Islamabad in October last year that saw clashes between its supporters and the police. Gandapur also reached the federal capital and went to KP House. Confusion subsequently emerged as the party initially claimed but then retracted the claim that he was arrested from KP House. His decision to leave party workers in Islamabad and move to KP House had surprised many and also elicited criticism from the PTI’s political committee. In a surprising turn of events, he resurfaced and entered the KP Assembly chamber on Oct 6 after the PTI demanded he be produced within 24 hours. Reacting to Gandapur’s sudden reappearance, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had said that he had “staged a drama” through his disappearance. In a repeat occurrence during the party’s November 2024 protest, government ministers had alleged that Gandapur had again fled the party’s protest and abandoned its supporters. There was something amiss , according to those in attendance. Ganda­pur, who was originally to lead the caravan to D-Chowk — was trailing far behind. The events that unfolded on November 26 not only deeply polarised the party that still rallies around its incarcerated chief, but also triggered and intensified a tug of war and jockeying for power bet­ween different groups within the PTI. Former first lady Bushra Bibi had heaped scorn on Gandapur for abandoning her at D-Chowk — enough of a cue for the party’s social media warriors to start trolling the chief minister. Those who are closely associated with Gandapur had blamed some party figures from Punjab for poisoning the party founder against him. The acrimony was witnessed at a core committee meeting, where, according to some who sat through the proceedings, the two sides exchanged barbs after KP objected to being left alone to do the heavy-lifting while the Punjab chapter was nowhere to be seen when push came to shove. But that acrimony, some party insiders had said, was just part of a larger issue — Gandapur’s inability to make any significant headway in their quest for some kind of relief for his jailed leader and his spouse. The chief minister’s suggestions to convince power brokers to relocate the former prime minister and his wife and place them either under house arrest at their home in Banigala, or at a host of locations in KP, such as the Governor’s House, Nathiagali or the CM House in Peshawar, did not really cut any ice with those who actually wield power in the country. His own party’s social media warriors, who once adored and called him ‘Khan sahib’s tiger’, then began trolling him. The difficult balancing act that he was trying to perform seemed to be becoming too heavy a burden for his shoulders to bear. For perhaps the first time in his political career, ever since his entry into power corridors, Gandapur seemed to be under pressure. In a similar turn of events in July 2025, Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by Imran, which was expected to climax on August 5, marking two years of the former PM’s imprisonment. At a press conference where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’. Flanked by PTI leaders who had arrived in Lahore to launch their movement for the release of Imran and his spouse, Gandapur had said that the 90-day countdown had already begun. However, the mixed messages had left party workers questioning whether this meant a postponement of the Aug 5 protest plan, or something else altogether. The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters. He himself had decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the party’s planned Aug 5 protest and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences. The result was a muted turnout on Aug 5 that saw the party alleging that its plans were thwarted by the state’s crackdown. Feud with Aleema Khanum The latest controversy to embroil Gandapur came when a split between him and Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum came to the fore. He met Imran on September 29 for over two hours, discussing differences in the party, with Imran ordering strict action against “those creating issues within the party”. The very next day, Gandapur accused Aleema of creating a divide within the party and alleged that she was being facilitated by the Military Intelligence (MI) and “establishment”. He confirmed there was a rift in the party and Aleema, with the help of some vloggers, was trying to provoke the party workers against him and to discredit the party leaders. He said he told the party founder that the factions were working for their vested interests and that had hurt the campaign for his release. For six months, Gandapur weathered a storm. Not from a weak opposition but from his own party, backed by an unbridled overseas social media brigade, clamouring for his head. He was called a ‘traitor’, ‘compromised’ and ‘establishment tout’. The noise reached such a fever pitch that some within his own cabinet began to wonder loudly about the prospects of replacing him. Many in officialdom were left puzzled and wondering whether the mustachioed, long-locked strongman was indeed on his way out. “I never felt so weak,” Gandapur narrated to his jailed party leader. For months, he said, he was trolled for refusing the chairman’s orders not to present and pass the provincial budget, hold direct negotiations with the Afghan Taliban to put an end to militancy in the volatile province and, more crucially, refuse support for military operations and drone attacks in the tribal districts. Political action against PTI wishes The sardar from Kulachi, Dera Ismail Khan, hardly had smooth sailing as KP’s eighteenth chief minister. For the first eight months, he was required to launch one protest march after another as the party attempted to pressure the powerful military establishment to eke out concessions for his leaders. Governance, at the time, was placed firmly on the back burner. Furthermore, the times he took political action that seemingly went against Imran and the PTI’s wishes, such as supporting military operations to legislative actvity, further incensed the party’s supporters. His political challenges became compounded after the D-Chowk fiasco last November, and were further exacerbated by subsequent events, beginning with the abortive attempt to pass the mines and minerals bill, which the party’s social media activists claimed was being sponsored by the military establishment. The chief minister had to relent, however, when his incarcerated leader conveyed his own opposition to the bill. Then came the budget. Orders from Adiala said the incarcerated leader should be consulted before it is presented to the house. Efforts were made to share the draft proposals and seek his nod, but things didn’t work out. Then came another order, ‘Don’t pass the budget’. Barrister Saif, self-acclaimed ‘Pindi boy’ and adviser to the chief minister, was dispatched to brief the leader that passing the budget was a constitutional requirement, and failure to do so would technically knock out the government. This time, Imran relented. The unforgiving internet activists, however, trolled Gandapur again when the worsening security situation warranted a military response. The problem was further compounded by incidents involving drone attacks that resulted in civilian casualties. The political storm was gathering, and the chief minister’s fate seemed to have been sealed when Imran’s frustration with him seemed to boil over, triggered by his “failure to stop” military operations in the province.",

      "summary_en": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Wednesday announced that he would step down from his office and the PTI confirmed that party founder Imran Khan had given the direction to do so along with nominating Sohail Afridi for the provincial top slot. PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar said Gandapur would send his resignation to the governor on Thursday. Gandapur assumed the office of chief minister after he was administered his oath by then-KP governor Haji Ghulam Ali on March 3, 2024. His tenure as chief minister was not without controversy, either involving the federal government or criticism from within his own party. In fact, it has been a tight-rope walk for the chief minister, from his first day in office, to balancing politics with realpolitik. He had to do business with the federal government, as KP is heavily dependent on its resources and the real power brokers. Government officials said that in the initial few months, Gandapur struggled to balance between focusing on governance and the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the province, and demands from the hawkish group within the party to launch protest caravans against Islamabad, at times giving marching orders without even bothering to check with him. Dawn.com unpacks five major controversies from his 19-month tenure: Corruption allegations Allegations of corruption and financial irregularity have plagued the Gandapur administration since its first year. Imran had sent a stern message from his prison cell to members of the KP government in August 2024 that they would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments. Shakeel Ahmad Khan, the former minister for communication and works, was subsequently removed from his position. In September 2024, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi alleged that Gandapur was involved in massive corruption in the province. In May 2025, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) said a preliminary probe revealed that officials of the communication and works department, Upper Kohistan, in connivance with officials of district accounts office of Upper Kohistan and a branch of National Bank of Pakistan, had misappropriated more than Rs30 billion from different projects through bogus withdrawal of funds from the national treasury in the name of several contractors, who didn’t carry out any civil work. The bureau claimed that the district accounts office of Upper Kohistan, without carrying out any verification of the alleged work done by the said contractors, passed the cheques amounting to billions of rupees, which were deposited by those contractors in their bank accounts. Direct communication with Afghanistan Another area of Gandapur’s policy that often landed him in direct confrontation with the federal government was his pursuit of a direct line of communication with the interim Afghan Taliban government as per Imran’s instructions. In September 2024, Gandapur said he had requested the ‘authorities’ for permission to hold talks with the Afghan government for peace in the province on Imran’s instructions , warning that he would proceed on his own if the request was not considered. The response was swift as the federal government and its allies lambasted Gandapur for his comments about unilaterally leading peace talks with Afghanistan, accusing him of exceeding his authority. The Foreign Office also jumped into the fray and unequivocally stated that conducting diplomatic negotiations with foreign governments was the sole domain of the federal government. The issue resurfaced in January when Gandapur announced plans to send a delegation to Afghanistan for dialogue on bilateral issues. The provincial government also said it would engage cross-border tribesmen to curb militancy and ensure regional peace . That led to Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Kashmir Affairs, and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam stating that negotiations with Afghanistan fell outside the provincial government’s jurisdiction. Backing down from his earlier assertiveness, Gandapur said in March that he was waiting for the federal government’s approval regarding the terms of reference for a jirga to negotiate with the Afghan government and last month, he disclosed that his passport had been blocked since May 9, 2023, so he couldn’t travel to Afghanistan for holding peace talks. The disclosure came after Imran directed Gandapur to visit Afghanistan and hold discussions with authorities regarding “mutual issues and peace and security to prevent the situation from deteriorating further”. Role in PTI protests Gandapur has also been the frequent victim of criticism by PTI supporters, particularly on social media, regarding his contribution and role in advocating for Imran’s release. The most challenges Gandapur faced emanated from within his own party. The PTI staged a protest in Islamabad in October last year that saw clashes between its supporters and the police. Gandapur also reached the federal capital and went to KP House. Confusion subsequently emerged as the party initially claimed but then retracted the claim that he was arrested from KP House. His decision to leave party workers in Islamabad and move to KP House had surprised many and also elicited criticism from the PTI’s political committee. In a surprising turn of events, he resurfaced and entered the KP Assembly chamber on Oct 6 after the PTI demanded he be produced within 24 hours. Reacting to Gandapur’s sudden reappearance, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had said that he had “staged a drama” through his disappearance. In a repeat occurrence during the party’s November 2024 protest, government ministers had alleged that Gandapur had again fled the party’s protest and abandoned its supporters. There was something amiss , according to those in attendance. Ganda­pur, who was originally to lead the caravan to D-Chowk — was trailing far behind. The events that unfolded on November 26 not only deeply polarised the party that still rallies around its incarcerated chief, but also triggered and intensified a tug of war and jockeying for power bet­ween different groups within the PTI. Former first lady Bushra Bibi had heaped scorn on Gandapur for abandoning her at D-Chowk — enough of a cue for the party’s social media warriors to start trolling the chief minister. Those who are closely associated with Gandapur had blamed some party figures from Punjab for poisoning the party founder against him. The acrimony was witnessed at a core committee meeting, where, according to some who sat through the proceedings, the two sides exchanged barbs after KP objected to being left alone to do the heavy-lifting while the Punjab chapter was nowhere to be seen when push came to shove. But that acrimony, some party insiders had said, was just part of a larger issue — Gandapur’s inability to make any significant headway in their quest for some kind of relief for his jailed leader and his spouse. The chief minister’s suggestions to convince power brokers to relocate the former prime minister and his wife and place them either under house arrest at their home in Banigala, or at a host of locations in KP, such as the Governor’s House, Nathiagali or the CM House in Peshawar, did not really cut any ice with those who actually wield power in the country. His own party’s social media warriors, who once adored and called him ‘Khan sahib’s tiger’, then began trolling him. The difficult balancing act that he was trying to perform seemed to be becoming too heavy a burden for his shoulders to bear. For perhaps the first time in his political career, ever since his entry into power corridors, Gandapur seemed to be under pressure. In a similar turn of events in July 2025, Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by Imran, which was expected to climax on August 5, marking two years of the former PM’s imprisonment. At a press conference where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’. Flanked by PTI leaders who had arrived in Lahore to launch their movement for the release of Imran and his spouse, Gandapur had said that the 90-day countdown had already begun. However, the mixed messages had left party workers questioning whether this meant a postponement of the Aug 5 protest plan, or something else altogether. The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters. He himself had decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the party’s planned Aug 5 protest and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences. The result was a muted turnout on Aug 5 that saw the party alleging that its plans were thwarted by the state’s crackdown. Feud with Aleema Khanum The latest controversy to embroil Gandapur came when a split between him and Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum came to the fore. He met Imran on September 29 for over two hours, discussing differences in the party, with Imran ordering strict action against “those creating issues within the party”. The very next day, Gandapur accused Aleema of creating a divide within the party and alleged that she was being facilitated by the Military Intelligence (MI) and “establishment”. He confirmed there was a rift in the party and Aleema, with the help of some vloggers, was trying to provoke the party workers against him and to discredit the party leaders. He said he told the party founder that the factions were working for their vested interests and that had hurt the campaign for his release. For six months, Gandapur weathered a storm.

      "summary_orig": "A superb century from Beth Mooney dragged defending champions Australia back from the brink of disaster before they completed a crushing 107-run win over Pakistan in the ICC Women’s World Cup clash in Colombo on Wednesday. The Aussies were staring down the barrel at 76-7 and then 115-8 after being asked to bat first with the Pakistan bowlers causing mayhem, left-arm spinner Nashra Sandhu finishing with 3-37 from her 10 overs. But a record ninth-wicket stand between Mooney, who was dismissed off the final ball of the innings for 109, and Alana King, who made 51 not out, turned the tide. The pair dragged their side from the doldrums to a competitive 221-9 and that proved plenty as Pakistan’s brittle batting folded meekly for 114 all out in 36.3 overs. A superb century from Beth Mooney dragged defending champions Australia back from the brink of disaster before they completed a crushing 107-run win over Pakistan in a Women’s World Cup clash in Colombo on Wednesday.

But a record ninth-wicket stand between Mooney, who was dismissed off the final ball of the innings for 109, and Alana King, who made 51 not out, turned the tide. The pair dragged their side from the doldrums to a competitive 221-9 and that proved plenty as Pakistan’s brittle batting folded meekly for 114 all out in 36.3 overs. Sidra Amin was the only Pakistan batter to put up a fight with 35 while opening bowler Kim Garth, who used to compete for Ireland, was the pick of the Australian attack with 3-14. In the end it was a comfortable win for the Australians but it hadn’t looked like that a little earlier. After a top order collapse that left the dugout stunned, Australia needed a saviour and up stepped the ever reliable Mooney. The left-hander produced her fifth ODI hundred while King played the perfect foil, matching grit with gumption in a 106-run partnership off 97 balls that breathed new life into the innings. It was not just a rescue act, it was record breaking. The partnership eclipsed Australia’s previous best for the ninth wicket — 77 between Garth and Ashleigh Gardner — and also set a new Women’s World Cup benchmark, surpassing South Africa’s 66-run effort by Yulandi van der Merwe and Kim Price back in 2000. Mooney’s innings was a masterclass in temperament, a classic backs-to-the-wall knock. She farmed the strike smartly, ran fast between the wickets and only unfurled the big shots towards the end. “It was a pretty tricky situation. We wanted to get a partnership going and really had to grind to reach 221,” said Mooney. “Alana King was incredible tonight. We’ve seen her do it before and it was nice to share that stand with her.” Having rebuilt brick by brick, Mooney brought up her century with a nudge to mid-on off Fatima Sana, while King capped her maiden fifty in style, hoisting the Pakistan captain for six as Australia plundered 21 runs off the final over. Mooney’s 109 off 114 deliveries, laced with 11 boundaries, ended when she holed out to cover off the final ball of the innings. King remained unbeaten on 51 off 49, peppered with three fours and as many sixes, the highest score ever made by a number 10 or lower in women’s ODIs. Pakistan never found their footing in reply, undone by Australia’s relentless discipline with the ball. The seven-time world champions climbed back to the top of the points table, while Pakistan’s third straight defeat leaves their knockout hopes hanging by a thread.",

      "summary_orig": "PTI’s Ali Amin Gandapur said on Wednesday that he will resign from his role as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister shortly after the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the role of provincial chief executive. At just 35, Afridi has emerged as one of the most prominent young faces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s political paradigm. Representing PK-70 Bara for the first time as an MPA, Afridi’s political struggle reflects a steady rise from student activism to a cabinet position. Born in 1989 in Khyber district’s Bara tehsil, Afridi’s roots lie deep in the tribal heartland, an area that has seen immense transformation in recent years. A graduate in economics, his early years were marked by his involvement in student politics — a platform that paved the way for his future in provincial governance. Afridi served as the provincial president of the Insaf Students Federation (ISF), the student wing of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), where he gained recognition for mobilising youth and advocating for educational reforms. His tenure in the ISF helped him establish a grassroots political base, particularly among first-time voters and students. Elected to the KP Assembly from PK-70 Bara in 2024, Afridi made his legislative debut with a strong mandate from his native constituency. Later that year, he was inducted into the provincial cabinet as special assistant to the chief minister on communications, a role in which he contributed to the province’s connectivity and infrastructure agenda. Last week, in a reshuffle within the provincial cabinet, Afridi was elevated to the post of minister for higher education, a portfolio that aligns closely with his academic background and early political activism. Irfan Saleem, PTI’s additional general secretary and the party president in Peshawar, told Dawn.com that Afridi has been a party loyalist since student life, adding that whenever Imran Khan made a call for protest, he stood in the front row. “He saw hardship and jails for the party,“ Saleem said. “We expect that he will take Imran Khan’s cause ahead.“ “When there were drone attacks, the Bara Khyber incident or other issues , he raised his voice,” he added. “He knows the party well and will handle it to end polarisation.” Another PTI leader in KP, Deputy Information Secretary and social media head Ikram Katahna, told Dawn.com , “We welcome this decision as we stand with Khan and his decisions.” Katahna added that Afridi is a grassroots worker and “a common man like us and he came to this stage”. “The PTI is a party of common people and Sohail Afridi’s nomination proves it,” he added.",

      "summary_orig": "An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday began its deliberations on the petitioners’ request to form a full court to hear a set of pleas challenging the 26th Amendment . The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy. It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment. The legislation had been challenged by various bar associations , bar councils , lawyers , the PTI , and some politicians . The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB. The CB is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. It resumed proceedings yesterday after over eight months , and unanimously allowed live-streaming of the case upon some petitioners’ request. The pleas taken up also seek the formation of a full court to hear the matter. Hence, before proceeding further, the court will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB. During today’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment. Several judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Malik noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that. The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow. Requests to form a full court bench and to live stream the case dominated yesterday’s hearing, with the state lawyer expressing no objection to live stream the proceedings. Commenting on today’s hearing, Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, who is one of the petitioners , said: “Justice Ayesha stood out with her observations, while her colleagues appeared to take refuge in Article 5 ’s ‘loyalty to the state’ clause”. The hearing At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Hamid came to the rostrum and said the 26th Amendment was introduced in an “unusual” manner and passed by the parliament at night . Hamid recalled that there were 17 judges present in the SC at the time the legislation was passed, including then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa, who later retired. Therefore, he contended, a 16-judge “full court” bench as of then should hear the pleas and pointed out that all eight judges in the current CB would be part of that bench as they were already serving as SC judges in October last year. As per the SC’s website, there are currently a total of 24 judges in the SC, including CJP Yahya Afridi, after six new judges were appointed in February. “This Amendment is against the very basic features of the Constitution,” he asserted, at which Justice Mandokhail said that the matter will be deliberated upon later and asked him whether the Amendment was currently a part of the Constitution. In response to Hamid’s arguments, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “We depend on the Constitution. Lawyers also depend on the Constitution. Unless the Constitution is [further] amended, we will have to depend on the current Constitution.” Justice Hilali also observed that whether the 26th Amendment was “right or wrong”, the court had not suspended it yet. “You consider the 26th Amendment a part of the Constitution, which is why you have challenged it.” Here, Justice Mazhar noted that the CB was at the moment not considering the main question of the legislation’s legality, but the request for a full court and sought arguments on that. Hamid responded that he was not detailing how the 26th Amendment was unconstitutional, but on the “effects of its powers”. He said it was for the first time after the legislation that the “authority to form benches was taken away from the chief justice”. Noting that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) existed prior to last year’s constitutional tweaks, the LHCBA counsel said the 26th Amendment impacted the JCP’s formation as “judges became a minority” after the number of its members was increased . “After the Amendment, the majority in the Judicial Commission went to the administrative side, which affected judicial independence,” Hamid said. Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Hamid whether he was acknowledging the 26th Amendment or not, the lawyer replied in the negative. At this point during the hearing, Justice Mazhar wondered whether a bench constituted after the 26th Amendment could decide a plea seeking the formation of a full court. Justice Mandokhail, however, remarked that the Amendment was part of the Constitution for now. At Justice Afghan pointing out that Hamid had not specified in his petition that “to whom should the bench send the case”, the lawyer said the matter should be referred to the CJP. Justice Hilali also asked whether the LHCBA counsel had made any request to the authority responsible for constituting the benches. To this, Hamid replied, “We are challenging the bench formation, which was constituted under the influence of the 26th Amendment.” Here, Justice Aminuddin observed, “Right now, [we are] not at such a stage to consider who will hear the case. Possibly, there might be hearings for a month on the matter of who will hear the case,” he added. “On what basis are you saying that we cannot hear the case?” the CB head questioned Hamid, remarking that it was not in the judges’ control to “go back to before the 26th Amendment”. At this point during the hearing, Justice Malik said, “Whether a full court hears or a bench, no one is stopping any judicial order. The process continues after a judicial order. “Where under the 26th Amendment is a full court being barred?” she asked, to which Hamid replied that the legislation did not do so. Justice Malik observed, “When there is a request for forming a bench, we do not question the procedure. We give directions, after which the process is initiated.” Here, Justice Aminuddin wondered under what authority the CB would constitute a full court, following which Justice Malik said there was “no restriction on forming a full court under a judicial order”. “Where in the 26th Amendment is it written that a judicial order cannot be issued? Such is being done in ordinary cases, then why not in this case?” she countered. Justice Afghan again raised the issue of Hamid not mentioning the said request in his petition. Upon Justice Mazhar asking whether the CB could use Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution to issue the order for a full court, Hamid replied in the affirmative. At one point during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the CB was not conceptualised by the SC but by the parliament. When Hamid said the bench should “forget” Article 191A, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court, Justice Aminuddin said if that was forgotten, the SC would not exist anymore. “A full court was always formed whenever questions were raised about the Constitution,” Hamid emphasised. At this, Justice Mandokhail wondered if a “point decided by 17 judges in the past” can be reversed, to which the lawyer replied in the negative. “Will you not be glad if the previous decision is upheld and now a smaller bench hears the case?” the judge asked. However, Justice Afghan noted that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 did not exist in the past. He remarked that CJPs in the past “kept using their powers to constitute full courts ”, but now that authority lied with the SC Practice and Procedure Committee “as per the Constitution and the law”. The petitions The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution. In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution. These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts . As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued. The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239. They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",

      "summary_orig": "A local journalist, Tufail Rind, was shot dead by unidentified armed men in the Mirpur Mathelo area of Sindh’s Ghotki district on Wednesday morning, according to the police. The attack took place when he was on his way to drop his children off at school. According to a police press release, the shooting occurred on the Jerwar Road near Maso Wah, where the assailants riding a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire at his car. “Rind died on the spot, while his children miraculously escaped unharmed,” the police said. Witnesses added that the attackers fled the scene after the assault, spreading panic across the area. The police later transported the body to the District Headquarters Hospital of Mirpur Mathelo for medico-legal formalities. The police statement said that upon receiving the information, Ghotki’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran immediately reached the crime scene, inspected the site, and met with the victim’s family, issuing “strict orders to the concerned officers for prompt action”. “The SSP Ghotki assured the victim’s family that all individuals involved in the murder would be arrested soon and brought to justice,” the statement added. The police said that multiple angles are being investigated and evidence is being collected to determine the motive behind the attack. According to a relative of the victim, Rind was associated with Mehran Newspaper and Royal News , and also served as an office-bearer of the Mirpur Mathelo Press Club. He had survived an earlier assassination attempt in which he had requested security from the local administration, but no effective measures were taken. SSP Khetran confirmed in a statement that Rind had complained a few months ago about an incident of gunfire at his home, saying that police had made arrests at that time. “We also arrested one person in connection with that on Oct. 4 (Saturday),” he added. “Rind was in contact with us and appreciated that the arrests were made.” A few hours after the murder, another tragedy struck when Rind’s eight-year-old niece fainted upon hearing the news of the killing. She was rushed to Mirpur Mathelo Hospital and later referred to Sukkur due to her critical condition, but died on the way. Her body was handed over to the family after medico-legal procedures. Suspects arrested Ghotki’s SSP Khetran has said that two suspects have already been arrested in connection with Rind’s murder. “The slain journalist had a dispute with members of his own community for the past four years, during which two people had previously been killed,” said SSP Khetran. He said that individuals from both sides of the rival groups were already in jail, and that this was the third murder linked to the same dispute. “All those involved in the murder of journalist Tufail Rind will be arrested,” the SSP added. Sindh’s Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought an urgent report from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon. In his statement, the chief minister said, “Attacks on journalists are attacks on press freedom, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.” Murad directed the police to conduct an impartial investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest. He also expressed condolences to the victim’s family and assured them that justice would be ensured. Locals in Ghotki and Mirpur Mathelo described Rind as a courageous journalist who always stood for the downtrodden. His funeral was attended by a large number of citizens, journalists, and political leaders. Condemnations pour in Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and deplorable incident”. He said the Sindh government stood with the bereaved family, adding, “Such attacks are equivalent to assaults on freedom of expression.“ Deputy Parliamentary Leader of Sindh Assembly and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Pakistan’s representative, Taha Ahmed Khan, strongly condemned the “brutal murder”. In a statement, Khan said that MQM Pakistan stood in solidarity with Rind’s family as well as with the journalist community during this difficult time. Sindh Government Spokesperson and Mayor of Sukkur, Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh, expressed sorrow and regret over the incident, calling it highly condemnable. “Attacks on journalists are actually tantamount to attacks on freedom of expression, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Mayor Sukkur said in a statement. Journalist, press associations demand justice Rind’s murder sparked widespread grief and anger across the journalist community in Pakistan. Journalists across Sindh staged protests, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits and the introduction of effective laws to protect journalists. The protests included a sit-in observed in front of the SSP’s office. The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Karachi Press Club, Hyderabad Union of Journalists, Umerkot Press Club, Ghotki Press Club, and Mirpur Mathelo Press Club jointly condemned the killing, saying, “Another voice has been silenced — punished for speaking the truth.” They urged the Sindh government to provide financial and legal assistance to Rind’s family and to formulate a clear security policy for journalists to prevent further bloodshed. PFUJ’s Vice President Akbar Jafri said in a statement that the incidents of attacks, threats, kidnappings and brutal killings of journalists across the country were “clear evidence of the complete failure and indifference of the government and administration”. He said that Rind’s murder was “proof that there is no effective policy for the protection of journalists across the country, including Sindh.” Jafri pointed out that Rind had appealed on social media a few days ago regarding the threat to his life, but the government and administration ignored this appeal, which “resulted in the loss of another precious life”. “The journalistic community is united and will continue to struggle for its rights and protection, because remaining silent now will be tantamount to waiting for more sacrifices,” he said. Journalist Mazhar Abbas also posted on X, saying that the killing of journalists was “on rise again in Sindh”. “Following Imtiaz Mir’s murder , another journalist Tufail Rind, has been killed within two weeks,” Abbas said. “Rind’s alleged killer has also shared his confessional statement’s video. This is quite alarming.” Last month, anchorperson Imtiaz Mir was shot and wounded in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbing to his injuries few days later, according to his family and police. Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation . Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists. According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”. In August last year, unknown armed men shot dead another Ghotki journalist, Muhammad Bachal Ghuniyo, who was associated with a private Sindhi TV channel. Another Ghotki journalist, Nasrullah Gadani, who worked for a Sindhi newspaper, was shot at and seriously wounded in an attack in May 2024. He succumbed to fatal injuries at a Karachi hospital three days later.",
