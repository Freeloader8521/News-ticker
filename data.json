      "title_orig": "From fake profiles to deepfake porn: The war Pakistani women cannot win alone",
      "summary_orig": "Shukria Ismail, a young woman from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s conservative Kurram district, faced an uphill battle convincing her family to let her pursue journalism as a career. After her parents half-heartedly allowed her, she made sure to follow all the cultural norms expected of a Pathan woman: keeping her dupatta on and being careful about what she said or did. She threw herself into her work, attending training sessions, reporting from the field, appearing on-screen, and building professional networks. Things were going well for her. She was happy. In March 2024, however, her world came to a sudden halt when her sister discovered a fake Facebook profile in Shukria’s name. The profile picture was a screenshot of her reading news on TV, while the cover photo carried a sexually explicit image. “At first, I brushed it off as something common in our field,” she says. “But then my sister told me that obscene messages were being sent to our relatives and even to people who had old property disputes with my father and uncle.” The targeting was precise, suggesting someone close to her was behind it. Eventually, she found out a relative was involved, acting out of a personal grudge. “They attached indecent images to my photos and spread them online,” Shukria recalls. The harassers didn’t stop there. Her family began receiving calls insinuating she was having affairs or questioning her character simply because she was a journalist. Even her younger brother’s college was dragged into the mess, with texts sent to his classmates saying she was involved in “questionable activities.” “It was clear they wanted to push me towards suicide or provoke an ‘ honour killing ,’” she adds. Through it all, her family stood by her, never blaming or abusing her. Yet the biggest blow came when they forced her to quit journalism entirely. “Being on air, reporting, writing — journalism became a crime in my own home. My parents forbade me from going to work. That was the day I died mentally,” she says. Rising cost of being a woman online Shukria is one of thousands of women whose lives have been upended by technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV). The term refers to acts of violence committed, assisted, aggravated, or amplified by the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) or digital media against a person because of their gender. This year, the 16 Days of Activism against GBV runs from November 25 to December 10, under the UN theme “ UNiTE to End Digital Violence against All Women and Girls ,” spotlighting cyber harassment, deepfakes, and attacks that spill into real-world harm. In Pakistan, the damage rarely stays online: it hits mental health, careers, and, for women like Shukria, can end professional lives altogether. The Digital Rights Foundation’s Digital Security Helpline Annual Report 2024 shows a sharp rise in online harassment and TFGBV in the country, with 3,171 new cases recorded. Per the report, the year began with a surge in gendered disinformation and AI-generated images targeting women politicians and journalists during the February elections, aimed at humiliating and discrediting them both personally and professionally. This infographic is created using Imagine Art Women journalists also faced false blasphemy allegations, a tactic carrying severe offline risks, including mob violence. One journalist told DRF she feared for her life for the first time, while another faced a hacked X account and coordinated attacks on her identity and credibility. Pakistan remains one of the world’s most dangerous countries for women, and rising internet access has extended violence into digital spaces. Despite broadband reaching 58.6 per cent of the population, a gender gap persists: only 33pc of women regularly use the internet, and 23pc access it via someone else’s phone, leaving many without the knowledge or tools to protect themselves from TFGBV, the report said. The increasing accessibility of technology, combined with deep-seated misogyny, has enabled more sophisticated attacks, from deepfakes to doxing. Gender minorities face even greater risks due to online anonymity and weak accountability. Journalists encounter heightened hostility as well. Pakistan dropped two places to 152 on the 2024 World Press Freedom Index . Women journalists face sexualised threats, gendered disinformation, and image-based abuse, including AI-generated content. DRF research shows 55pc of women in media have experienced online abuse, yet only 14.2pc sought help; 70pc fear misuse of their images online, and 40pc report stalking or harassment. This infographic is created using Imagine Art Meanwhile, data from the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW)’s 2023 report shows that almost 40pc of Pakistani women surveyed had faced digital cyber-bullying or harassment. Conviction rates remain low: only 92 cybercrime convictions were secured out of 1,375 cases in 2023. As the nature of online abuse grows more complex, those on the frontlines are seeing the impact most clearly. Digital rights expert and DRF founder Nighat Dad told Dawn that the organisation was witnessing “a disturbing new frontier of gender-based violence,” noting that the Digital Security Helpline had seen a steady rise in cases involving deepfake pornography, doctored images, voice manipulation, and AI-powered impersonation, especially targeting women and mostly women public figures. “These aren’t just new tools; they are intensifying old patriarchal patterns of control, blackmail, and public shaming,” she said. She added that “AI has lowered the barrier for abuse. With just a photo and a free app, anyone can manufacture a scandal. That level of scale and invisibility makes it harder than ever for survivors to find redress. We urgently need stronger platform-level safeguards, quicker takedown mechanisms for synthetic media, and gender-sensitive digital safety policies. But just as importantly, we need a survivor-centric ecosystem where helplines like ours are resourced, trusted, and recognised as vital for frontline support in fighting this evolving form of violence.” Smear campaign without borders Like Shukria, journalist Mona Alam from Islamabad faced a different but equally vicious online smear campaign that took a heavy toll on her mental health. “The campaign against me, involving the circulation of pornographic videos, began in December last year. It wasn’t a morphed image or a superimposed video; it was a real video of a sex worker filmed years ago. That same video had previously circulated on the dark web under the title ‘Nimra Mehra’s leak video,’ to malign a British-Pakistani singer, and that wasn’t Nimra either — just a woman who slightly resembled her. In December 2024, it was made viral again, this time labelled as ‘Mona Alam’s leaked video.’ “I became aware of it because the campaigners were Pakistani. It was deliberately pushed in WhatsApp and Facebook groups, especially media groups with journalists, politicians, and professional contacts. Among the initial campaigners were individuals affiliated with political parties and some media professionals. Soon, others began making vlogs and videos, amplifying it further.” The journalist immediately approached the police and the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cybercrime wing in Islamabad, saying she was grateful to the then–DG FIA, Ahmed Ishaq Jahangir, who pursued the case diligently. “He had the initial campaigners arrested, kept in FIA custody for a few days, questioned, and their mobile phones confiscated for forensic examination. Courts eventually granted bail. Thanks to the ex-DG, the case was progressing well.” However, in February 2025, at a critical stage when all the phones had been seized and forensic work was pending, the DG was removed, and the FIA “abandoned the case”, she claimed. Despite repeated follow-ups, the case did not move. She did not give up and repeatedly contacted FIP Additional Director Ayaz Khan. Later, at a ceremony in the Presidency, she explicitly asked Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for help. “He listened at first, but as soon as I mentioned the FIA’s negligence, he walked past me without answering. I had hoped he would intervene, but he offered no help.” A generic image showing a person using their cellphone. — Iqbal Nuril Anwar/ Pixabay The campaign quickly shifted abroad. “When the initial campaigners were arrested, they moved it to Dubai and India, where they had accounts with millions of followers. Indian tabloids, social media accounts, and Bollywood-style gossip pages — all amplified it aggressively. Despite Pakistani officials’ usual reactions to Indian attacks, this malicious campaign received no attention here.” Mona was also disappointed by the silence of Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. “Although I didn’t explicitly ask him for help, he didn’t offer any either.” Dawn reached out to both Naqvi and Tarar for comment, but neither responded. Women politicians equal targets While Mona received no support from the political elite, even senior women lawmakers face similar treatment. Case in point is Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari, whose sexualised deepfake video circulated in 2024, leaving her deeply distressed. Deepfakes, digitally manipulated videos or images that superimpose a person’s likeness onto another or fabricate content, are increasingly weaponised against women in the public sphere, particularly in conservative societies like Pakistan. Despite her position as a senior minister, Bokhari endured the same online harassment and character assassination as countless other women, illustrating how digital violence affects women across all levels and exposing the systemic nature of gendered abuse online. Speaking to Dawn , Bokhari said her deepfake did attract attention, but she does not believe it produced the “desired results.” “Unless such cases are treated as test cases, where at least one perpetrator is actually punished, nothing will change,” she said, pointing out that Punjab now has dedicated defamation courts, which are civil in nature. This image is created using Imagine Art “Cases like mine should go to such defamation courts. And once pursued, courts must show zero tolerance. No matter what the investigation does, the ball eventually lands in the court’s court,” she said. Bokhari stressed that without strict judicial action, digital violence cannot be curbed. She also warned that “if we turn such incidents into political issues, granting favours, or portraying someone as a victim to secure their release, this problem will never end.” Unseen scars of digital abuse For a non-public figure like Maria, a pseudonym, a deepfake cost her a potential marriage. Maria, a marketing professional from Karachi, had been in a relationship with a former boyfriend during university, but they parted ways and didn’t stay in touch. “I didn’t have any contact with him for two years. I was about to get married in three months and shared an engagement photo on Instagram. That’s when he suddenly messaged me, angry and jealous, and began threatening me that I had ‘betrayed him.’ He said he had kept my intimate pictures on his phone, claiming, ‘I had saved them for such an occasion only, and I will teach you a lesson.’” Though her images did not contain nudity, just photos of her hugging him, he sent them to her fiancé after doctoring them, sparking a huge fight that ended her engagement. “At that time, I was devastated and depressed for months. I was scared. I told my family, and though they were disappointed, they supported me. I told them that if this ever happens again, I would face it without fear. My biggest fear is over. The marriage is called off, but my izzat is intact. I did nothing wrong. If anyone is to blame, it’s him,” she said. Illustration created via ChatGPT The psychological impact of such harassment is severe and long-lasting. Huma Pervaiz, clinical psychologist and lecturer at Karachi’s DHA Suffa University, explained that manipulations like deepfakes “tend to demean, silence, or discredit women, particularly those in social or professional positions. Cyberbullying, trolling, and doxing create a constant sense of insecurity, which can harm mental well-being, erode self-confidence, and blur the line between online and offline abuse.” Samiha Sajid, clinical psychologist, added that even a single threatening message or manipulated image can trigger anxiety, hypervigilance, shame, and withdrawal from social spaces. “What makes this crisis even more concerning is the low conviction rate for cybercrimes. When only a fraction of perpetrators are held accountable, women internalise a dangerous message: that their safety, dignity, and voice are negotiable in digital spaces.” She continued: “We must recognise online harassment as a serious mental-health threat. Pakistan needs stronger, gender-sensitive reporting systems, public awareness campaigns, and digital-literacy initiatives. Protecting women online is not just a legal responsibility, but it is essential for their psychological well-being and their full participation in society.” Journalist Gharida Farooqi, herself a victim of AI-fuelled harassment campaigns, told Dawn , “Artificial intelligence or automated insolence? Yet another unsafe space for women across the globe. Having been a victim of fake campaigns and real threats myself since 2014, even when AI was distant, it feels nothing has changed in 2025, rather intensified manifold for women.” She said that before stricter laws and implementation, the sensitisation and sanitisation of minds—both human and AI—towards women is urgently required, “so that the benefits of modern-day technology are harnessed and shared not just by mankind, but by all of humankind.” Threat of AI-driven misogyny The rise of AI has not only accelerated online abuse but reshaped how misogyny is produced, amplified, and weaponised in Pakistan’s digital spaces. Experts warn that without urgent systemic safeguards, women will face an increasingly hostile environment online. Digital rights activist Usama Khilji has been warning for years that technology would eventually supercharge the violence women face online. That moment has now arrived. He describes deepfakes and AI-generated intimate images as “a huge, huge risk,” especially in intimate relationships where former partners weaponise fabricated content to keep women silent or under control. “Such tactics are becoming so normalised that one abuser even boasted he no longer needed to throw acid on a woman as an AI video can destroy her without leaving a trace”. Political networks, he added, have also begun deploying deepfakes to discredit women journalists and public figures, using misogyny as a strategic tool. Yet the cybercrime system remains ill-equipped. “Threats to create a deepfake don’t fall neatly into any section,” he told Dawn , noting that most women receive no meaningful legal protection despite the severity of the harm. Tech journalist Sindhu Abbasi sees the same pattern unfolding across the digital ecosystem, where AI has lowered the barrier for large-scale manipulation. Her research has taken her from AI “nudifier” apps — “Meta has already taken legal action against some of these developers,” she pointed out — to professional settings where photos are altered without consent. Screenshot of a news article published on Indicator She cited a LinkedIn case where a woman’s standard headshot was modified to add cleavage before being posted publicly. “If companies are using AI, they should let you know,” she emphasised. “It affects your reputation and your professional image.” Abbasi also highlighted a rising trend of doctored YouTube thumbnails featuring Pakistani actresses, the unchecked spread of sexualised images, and the dangerous access gaps within state surveillance systems. In one case she investigated, a government officer used data from a woman’s official application to locate her home and assault her daughter. “What could go wrong? Possibly everything,” she said. For journalist and researcher Anaam Lodhi, these incidents are not anomalies. Rather, they are the logical outcome of a gendered digital culture that predates AI but is now amplified by it. Her research on tech-facilitated gender-based violence shows just how vulnerable women remain. “All women in Pakistan’s digital space are highly vulnerable because they are the rare ones who voice their opinions,” she explained. Journalists, activists and political workers face the harshest climate, operating in spaces where harassment is already “widespread and normalised.” Lodhi noted that even before AI, morphed images caused serious harm. Now, she said, “AI makes harassment faster, more personalised, and harder to trace.” One interviewee told her that abusers were able to find her residence through “minor details shared over the years,” illustrating how AI-driven data scraping collapses the line between digital and physical danger. Deepfakes, Lodhi argued, weaponise cultural stigma around honour: “A woman’s face can be lifted from a profile photo and placed onto sexualised content within minutes.” View this post on Instagram Her survey of 439 users found that 73pc of women on X had faced harassment, and many now self-censor or withdraw altogether. For her, AI isn’t creating misogyny but “it magnifies it,” making harmful gender norms appear socially acceptable and widely endorsed. System struggling to protect women online For Ambreen, another pseudonym, the terror began quietly after a stranger began using her photos to create fake profiles, messaging her at random, disappearing instantly, and reappearing with new accounts. “He’d message me at 3am and then immediately deactivate his account so we couldn’t trace him,” she recalled. The man repeatedly pushed her to get on a Skype call, something she didn’t fully understand at the time but instinctively felt was unsafe. Isolated and afraid, she first approached the DRF, followed by the FIA’s cybercrime office in Islamabad. “I was in university at the time, studying, so I was very scared but also brave enough to take that step,” she said. She kept the ordeal hidden from her family, relying instead on friends and the few responsive officers she encountered. Eventually, with DRF’s support and multiple complaints filed, the harassment stopped. “Since I took multiple steps at once, I don’t know which one worked, but the messages stopped, and all the fake pages were taken down,” she said. This, however, was not the case with Ayesha, who chose to be identified by her first name only. She told Dawn that her harasser kept reappearing with “obscene profiles and lewd messages for five years before I mustered the courage to tell my husband.” “My husband was very upset with all this and did not agree to go to the FIA to complain,” she said. “He thought we would make matters worse by involving the police.” Ayesha’s experience reflects a broader failure of systems meant to protect women, a reality high court advocate Syed Miqdad Mehdi sees regularly. He said that while Pakistan’s cybercrime law, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016 , has evolved, its implementation still lags behind the scale of abuse. “Law is evolving with the change of modern challenges… but public awareness raising is very important, and capacity building is essential, especially with regards to GBV and TFGBV,” he said. Illustration by Geralt Altmann/ Pixabay He stressed the critical need to sensitise officers, build trust, and create victim-friendly mechanisms so women can report cases without fear of humiliation. “There is no doubt that the FIA… has been getting a lot of successful stories,” he acknowledged, “but despite this, there is a lot of pendency and a lot of load on their work.” With limited staff, long distances to reporting centres, and a lack of specialised GBV-focused infrastructure, many victims lose confidence before their cases even begin. “The specialised courts need to be sensitised,” he added, stressing that TFGBV cases often fall through the cracks of existing legal structures. For Fauzia Yazdani, a gender and governance expert with over three decades of experience, the core issue lies deeper, in social norms and the pace at which digital harms evolve. “When you come into the digital space, your socials and social apps were curated to be gender-blind,” she said. As new forms of online violence emerged, laws were drafted, “but as the digital space is evolving at such a speed, oversight and rules and regulations are not evolving.” Despite the presence of strong laws, from the Pakistan Penal Code to the women protection acts, “are they being implemented? That’s where the issue is,” she said. Yazdani described deepfakes, harassment bots, and algorithm-driven amplification as “crude corners of digital space that need to be monitored and regulated,” warning that the gap between law, oversight, and reality is widening. She argues that the surge in TFGBV is inseparable from Pakistan’s social and political climate. “Our societal narrative is tilted towards gender inequality… it stereotypes women, it categorises or typecasts them into certain roles,” she explained. The result is a landscape where political polarisation and misogyny intertwine and where women’s visibility, whether as journalists, politicians, or ordinary citizens, can become a liability. “It’s very convenient… you’re anonymous, you can harass someone, you can generate bots behind them… and still remain anonymous.” Turning tide against online GBV Technology-facilitated gender-based violence is not just a digital threat. It can change lives, careers, and families. As Yazdani explains, “For transformational change, we have to change the society’s narrative, we have to change the society’s thought process.” Without shifting norms, strengthening oversight, and bringing more women into tech, she warns, the country will continue to see TFGBV grow faster than the systems meant to contain it. Yet even with awareness, enforcement, and advocacy, the human cost is clear. Shukria’s story brings this painfully to life: nearly two years after being targeted online and forced out of journalism, she remains unable to write, speak publicly, or practise her profession. “I am engaged to be married soon, but I feel like I am sitting in a cage, only dreaming of the life I once had,” she says. “I hope that once I am with my husband, I can revive the career that was forcibly taken from me.” Imran Gabol from Lahore and Nadir Guramani from Islamabad contributed to this report.

This infographic is created using Imagine Art Women journalists also faced false blasphemy allegations, a tactic carrying severe offline risks, including mob violence. One journalist told DRF she feared for her life for the first time, while another faced a hacked X account and coordinated attacks on her identity and credibility. Pakistan remains one of the world’s most dangerous countries for women, and rising internet access has extended violence into digital spaces. Despite broadband reaching 58.6 per cent of the population, a gender gap persists: only 33pc of women regularly use the internet, and 23pc access it via someone else’s phone, leaving many without the knowledge or tools to protect themselves from TFGBV, the report said. The increasing accessibility of technology, combined with deep-seated misogyny, has enabled more sophisticated attacks, from deepfakes to doxing. Gender minorities face even greater risks due to online anonymity and weak accountability. Journalists encounter heightened hostility as well. Pakistan dropped two places to 152 on the 2024 World Press Freedom Index . Women journalists face sexualised threats, gendered disinformation, and image-based abuse, including AI-generated content. DRF research shows 55pc of women in media have experienced online abuse, yet only 14.2pc sought help; 70pc fear misuse of their images online, and 40pc report stalking or harassment. This infographic is created using Imagine Art Meanwhile, data from the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW)’s 2023 report shows that almost 40pc of Pakistani women surveyed had faced digital cyber-bullying or harassment. Conviction rates remain low: only 92 cybercrime convictions were secured out of 1,375 cases in 2023. As the nature of online abuse grows more complex, those on the frontlines are seeing the impact most clearly. Digital rights expert and DRF founder Nighat Dad told Dawn that the organisation was witnessing “a disturbing new frontier of gender-based violence,” noting that the Digital Security Helpline had seen a steady rise in cases involving deepfake pornography, doctored images, voice manipulation, and AI-powered impersonation, especially targeting women and mostly women public figures. “These aren’t just new tools; they are intensifying old patriarchal patterns of control, blackmail, and public shaming,” she said. She added that “AI has lowered the barrier for abuse. With just a photo and a free app, anyone can manufacture a scandal. That level of scale and invisibility makes it harder than ever for survivors to find redress. We urgently need stronger platform-level safeguards, quicker takedown mechanisms for synthetic media, and gender-sensitive digital safety policies. But just as importantly, we need a survivor-centric ecosystem where helplines like ours are resourced, trusted, and recognised as vital for frontline support in fighting this evolving form of violence.” Smear campaign without borders Like Shukria, journalist Mona Alam from Islamabad faced a different but equally vicious online smear campaign that took a heavy toll on her mental health. “The campaign against me, involving the circulation of pornographic videos, began in December last year. It wasn’t a morphed image or a superimposed video; it was a real video of a sex worker filmed years ago. That same video had previously circulated on the dark web under the title ‘Nimra Mehra’s leak video,’ to malign a British-Pakistani singer, and that wasn’t Nimra either — just a woman who slightly resembled her. In December 2024, it was made viral again, this time labelled as ‘Mona Alam’s leaked video.’ “I became aware of it because the campaigners were Pakistani. It was deliberately pushed in WhatsApp and Facebook groups, especially media groups with journalists, politicians, and professional contacts. Among the initial campaigners were individuals affiliated with political parties and some media professionals. Soon, others began making vlogs and videos, amplifying it further.” The journalist immediately approached the police and the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) cybercrime wing in Islamabad, saying she was grateful to the then–DG FIA, Ahmed Ishaq Jahangir, who pursued the case diligently. “He had the initial campaigners arrested, kept in FIA custody for a few days, questioned, and their mobile phones confiscated for forensic examination. Courts eventually granted bail. Thanks to the ex-DG, the case was progressing well.” However, in February 2025, at a critical stage when all the phones had been seized and forensic work was pending, the DG was removed, and the FIA “abandoned the case”, she claimed. Despite repeated follow-ups, the case did not move. She did not give up and repeatedly contacted FIP Additional Director Ayaz Khan. Later, at a ceremony in the Presidency, she explicitly asked Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi for help. “He listened at first, but as soon as I mentioned the FIA’s negligence, he walked past me without answering. I had hoped he would intervene, but he offered no help.” A generic image showing a person using their cellphone. — Iqbal Nuril Anwar/ Pixabay The campaign quickly shifted abroad. “When the initial campaigners were arrested, they moved it to Dubai and India, where they had accounts with millions of followers. Indian tabloids, social media accounts, and Bollywood-style gossip pages — all amplified it aggressively. Despite Pakistani officials’ usual reactions to Indian attacks, this malicious campaign received no attention here.” Mona was also disappointed by the silence of Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. “Although I didn’t explicitly ask him for help, he didn’t offer any either.” Dawn reached out to both Naqvi and Tarar for comment, but neither responded. Women politicians equal targets While Mona received no support from the political elite, even senior women lawmakers face similar treatment. Case in point is Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari, whose sexualised deepfake video circulated in 2024, leaving her deeply distressed. Deepfakes, digitally manipulated videos or images that superimpose a person’s likeness onto another or fabricate content, are increasingly weaponised against women in the public sphere, particularly in conservative societies like Pakistan. Despite her position as a senior minister, Bokhari endured the same online harassment and character assassination as countless other women, illustrating how digital violence affects women across all levels and exposing the systemic nature of gendered abuse online. Speaking to Dawn , Bokhari said her deepfake did attract attention, but she does not believe it produced the “desired results.” “Unless such cases are treated as test cases, where at least one perpetrator is actually punished, nothing will change,” she said, pointing out that Punjab now has dedicated defamation courts, which are civil in nature. This image is created using Imagine Art “Cases like mine should go to such defamation courts. And once pursued, courts must show zero tolerance. No matter what the investigation does, the ball eventually lands in the court’s court,” she said. Bokhari stressed that without strict judicial action, digital violence cannot be curbed. She also warned that “if we turn such incidents into political issues, granting favours, or portraying someone as a victim to secure their release, this problem will never end.” Unseen scars of digital abuse For a non-public figure like Maria, a pseudonym, a deepfake cost her a potential marriage. Maria, a marketing professional from Karachi, had been in a relationship with a former boyfriend during university, but they parted ways and didn’t stay in touch. “I didn’t have any contact with him for two years. I was about to get married in three months and shared an engagement photo on Instagram. That’s when he suddenly messaged me, angry and jealous, and began threatening me that I had ‘betrayed him.’ He said he had kept my intimate pictures on his phone, claiming, ‘I had saved them for such an occasion only, and I will teach you a lesson.’” Though her images did not contain nudity, just photos of her hugging him, he sent them to her fiancé after doctoring them, sparking a huge fight that ended her engagement. “At that time, I was devastated and depressed for months. I was scared. I told my family, and though they were disappointed, they supported me. I told them that if this ever happens again, I would face it without fear. My biggest fear is over. The marriage is called off, but my izzat is intact. I did nothing wrong. If anyone is to blame, it’s him,” she said. Illustration created via ChatGPT The psychological impact of such harassment is severe and long-lasting. Huma Pervaiz, clinical psychologist and lecturer at Karachi’s DHA Suffa University, explained that manipulations like deepfakes “tend to demean, silence, or discredit women, particularly those in social or professional positions. Cyberbullying, trolling, and doxing create a constant sense of insecurity, which can harm mental well-being, erode self-confidence, and blur the line between online and offline abuse.” Samiha Sajid, clinical psychologist, added that even a single threatening message or manipulated image can trigger anxiety, hypervigilance, shame, and withdrawal from social spaces. “What makes this crisis even more concerning is the low conviction rate for cybercrimes. When only a fraction of perpetrators are held accountable, women internalise a dangerous message: that their safety, dignity, and voice are negotiable in digital spaces.” She continued: “We must recognise online harassment as a serious mental-health threat. Pakistan needs stronger, gender-sensitive reporting systems, public awareness campaigns, and digital-literacy initiatives. Protecting women online is not just a legal responsibility, but it is essential for their psychological well-being and their full participation in society.” Journalist Gharida Farooqi, herself a victim of AI-fuelled harassment campaigns, told Dawn , “Artificial intelligence or automated insolence? Yet another unsafe space for women across the globe. Having been a victim of fake campaigns and real threats myself since 2014, even when AI was distant, it feels nothing has changed in 2025, rather intensified manifold for women.” She said that before stricter laws and implementation, the sensitisation and sanitisation of minds—both human and AI—towards women is urgently required, “so that the benefits of modern-day technology are harnessed and shared not just by mankind, but by all of humankind.” Threat of AI-driven misogyny The rise of AI has not only accelerated online abuse but reshaped how misogyny is produced, amplified, and weaponised in Pakistan’s digital spaces. Experts warn that without urgent systemic safeguards, women will face an increasingly hostile environment online. Digital rights activist Usama Khilji has been warning for years that technology would eventually supercharge the violence women face online. That moment has now arrived. He describes deepfakes and AI-generated intimate images as “a huge, huge risk,” especially in intimate relationships where former partners weaponise fabricated content to keep women silent or under control. “Such tactics are becoming so normalised that one abuser even boasted he no longer needed to throw acid on a woman as an AI video can destroy her without leaving a trace”. Political networks, he added, have also begun deploying deepfakes to discredit women journalists and public figures, using misogyny as a strategic tool. Yet the cybercrime system remains ill-equipped. “Threats to create a deepfake don’t fall neatly into any section,” he told Dawn , noting that most women receive no meaningful legal protection despite the severity of the harm. Tech journalist Sindhu Abbasi sees the same pattern unfolding across the digital ecosystem, where AI has lowered the barrier for large-scale manipulation. Her research has taken her from AI “nudifier” apps — “Meta has already taken legal action against some of these developers,” she pointed out — to professional settings where photos are altered without consent. Screenshot of a news article published on Indicator She cited a LinkedIn case where a woman’s standard headshot was modified to add cleavage before being posted publicly. “If companies are using AI, they should let you know,” she emphasised. “It affects your reputation and your professional image.” Abbasi also highlighted a rising trend of doctored YouTube thumbnails featuring Pakistani actresses, the unchecked spread of sexualised images, and the dangerous access gaps within state surveillance systems. In one case she investigated, a government officer used data from a woman’s official application to locate her home and assault her daughter. “What could go wrong? Possibly everything,” she said. For journalist and researcher Anaam Lodhi, these incidents are not anomalies. Rather, they are the logical outcome of a gendered digital culture that predates AI but is now amplified by it. Her research on tech-facilitated gender-based violence shows just how vulnerable women remain. “All women in Pakistan’s digital space are highly vulnerable because they are the rare ones who voice their opinions,” she explained. Journalists, activists and political workers face the harshest climate, operating in spaces where harassment is already “widespread and normalised.” Lodhi noted that even before AI, morphed images caused serious harm. Now, she said, “AI makes harassment faster, more personalised, and harder to trace.” One interviewee told her that abusers were able to find her residence through “minor details shared over the years,” illustrating how AI-driven data scraping collapses the line between digital and physical danger. Deepfakes, Lodhi argued, weaponise cultural stigma around honour: “A woman’s face can be lifted from a profile photo and placed onto sexualised content within minutes.” View this post on Instagram Her survey of 439 users found that 73pc of women on X had faced harassment, and many now self-censor or withdraw altogether. For her, AI isn’t creating misogyny but “it magnifies it,” making harmful gender norms appear socially acceptable and widely endorsed. System struggling to protect women online For Ambreen, another pseudonym, the terror began quietly after a stranger began using her photos to create fake profiles, messaging her at random, disappearing instantly, and reappearing with new accounts. “He’d message me at 3am and then immediately deactivate his account so we couldn’t trace him,” she recalled. The man repeatedly pushed her to get on a Skype call, something she didn’t fully understand at the time but instinctively felt was unsafe. Isolated and afraid, she first approached the DRF, followed by the FIA’s cybercrime office in Islamabad. “I was in university at the time, studying, so I was very scared but also brave enough to take that step,” she said. She kept the ordeal hidden from her family, relying instead on friends and the few responsive officers she encountered. Eventually, with DRF’s support and multiple complaints filed, the harassment stopped. “Since I took multiple steps at once, I don’t know which one worked, but the messages stopped, and all the fake pages were taken down,” she said. This, however, was not the case with Ayesha, who chose to be identified by her first name only. She told Dawn that her harasser kept reappearing with “obscene profiles and lewd messages for five years before I mustered the courage to tell my husband.” “My husband was very upset with all this and did not agree to go to the FIA to complain,” she said. “He thought we would make matters worse by involving the police.” Ayesha’s experience reflects a broader failure of systems meant to protect women, a reality high court advocate Syed Miqdad Mehdi sees regularly. He said that while Pakistan’s cybercrime law, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016 , has evolved, its implementation still lags behind the scale of abuse. “Law is evolving with the change of modern challenges… but public awareness raising is very important, and capacity building is essential, especially with regards to GBV and TFGBV,” he said. Illustration by Geralt Altmann/ Pixabay He stressed the critical need to sensitise officers, build trust, and create victim-friendly mechanisms so women can report cases without fear of humiliation. “There is no doubt that the FIA… has been getting a lot of successful stories,” he acknowledged, “but despite this, there is a lot of pendency and a lot of load on their work.” With limited staff, long distances to reporting centres, and a lack of specialised GBV-focused infrastructure, many victims lose confidence before their cases even begin. “The specialised courts need to be sensitised,” he added, stressing that TFGBV cases often fall through the cracks of existing legal structures. For Fauzia Yazdani, a gender and governance expert with over three decades of experience, the core issue lies deeper, in social norms and the pace at which digital harms evolve. “When you come into the digital space, your socials and social apps were curated to be gender-blind,” she said. As new forms of online violence emerged, laws were drafted, “but as the digital space is evolving at such a speed, oversight and rules and regulations are not evolving.” Despite the presence of strong laws, from the Pakistan Penal Code to the women protection acts, “are they being implemented? That’s where the issue is,” she said. Yazdani described deepfakes, harassment bots, and algorithm-driven amplification as “crude corners of digital space that need to be monitored and regulated,” warning that the gap between law, oversight, and reality is widening. She argues that the surge in TFGBV is inseparable from Pakistan’s social and political climate. “Our societal narrative is tilted towards gender inequality… it stereotypes women, it categorises or typecasts them into certain roles,” she explained. The result is a landscape where political polarisation and misogyny intertwine and where women’s visibility, whether as journalists, politicians, or ordinary citizens, can become a liability. “It’s very convenient… you’re anonymous, you can harass someone, you can generate bots behind them… and still remain anonymous.” Turning tide against online GBV Technology-facilitated gender-based violence is not just a digital threat. It can change lives, careers, and families. As Yazdani explains, “For transformational change, we have to change the society’s narrative, we have to change the society’s thought process.” Without shifting norms, strengthening oversight, and bringing more women into tech, she warns, the country will continue to see TFGBV grow faster than the systems meant to contain it. Yet even with awareness, enforcement, and advocacy, the human cost is clear. Shukria’s story brings this painfully to life: nearly two years after being targeted online and forced out of journalism, she remains unable to write, speak publicly, or practise her profession. “I am engaged to be married soon, but I feel like I am sitting in a cage, only dreaming of the life I once had,” she says. “I hope that once I am with my husband, I can revive the career that was forcibly taken from me.” Imran Gabol from Lahore and Nadir Guramani from Islamabad contributed to this report.

      "title": "From fake profiles to deepfake porn: The war Pakistani women cannot win alone",
      "summary": "Shukria Ismail, a young woman from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s conservative Kurram district, faced an uphill battle convincing her family to let her pursue journalism as a career. After her parents half-heartedly allowed her, she made sure to follow all the cultural norms expected of a Pathan woman: keeping her dupatta on and being careful about what she said or did. She threw herself into her work, attending training sessions, reporting from the field, appearing on-screen, and building professional networks. Things were going well for her. She was happy. In March 2024, however, her world came to a sudden halt when her sister discovered a fake Facebook profile in Shukria’s name. The profile picture was a screenshot of her reading news on TV, while the cover photo carried a sexually explicit image. “At first, I brushed it off as something common in our field,” she says. “But then my sister told me that obscene messages were being sent to our relatives and even to people who had old property disputes with my father and uncle.” The targeting was precise, suggesting someone close to her was behind it. Eventually, she found out a relative was involved, acting out of a personal grudge. “They attached indecent images to my photos and spread them online,” Shukria recalls. The harassers didn’t stop there. Her family began receiving calls insinuating she was having affairs or questioning her character simply because she was a journalist. Even her younger brother’s college was dragged into the mess, with texts sent to his classmates saying she was involved in “questionable activities.” “It was clear they wanted to push me towards suicide or provoke an ‘ honour killing ,’” she adds. Through it all, her family stood by her, never blaming or abusing her. Yet the biggest blow came when they forced her to quit journalism entirely. “Being on air, reporting, writing — journalism became a crime in my own home. My parents forbade me from going to work. That was the day I died mentally,” she says. Rising cost of being a woman online Shukria is one of thousands of women whose lives have been upended by technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV). The term refers to acts of violence committed, assisted, aggravated, or amplified by the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) or digital media against a person because of their gender. This year, the 16 Days of Activism against GBV runs from November 25 to December 10, under the UN theme “ UNiTE to End Digital Violence against All Women and Girls ,” spotlighting cyber harassment, deepfakes, and attacks that spill into real-world harm. In Pakistan, the damage rarely stays online: it hits mental health, careers, and, for women like Shukria, can end professional lives altogether. The Digital Rights Foundation’s Digital Security Helpline Annual Report 2024 shows a sharp rise in online harassment and TFGBV in the country, with 3,171 new cases recorded. Per the report, the year began with a surge in gendered disinformation and AI-generated images targeting women politicians and journalists during the February elections, aimed at humiliating and discrediting them both personally and professionally.

Gender minorities face even greater risks due to online anonymity and weak accountability. Journalists encounter heightened hostility as well. Pakistan dropped two places to 152 on the 2024 World Press Freedom Index . Women journalists face sexualised threats, gendered disinformation, and image-based abuse, including AI-generated content. DRF research shows 55pc of women in media have experienced online abuse, yet only 14.2pc sought help; 70pc fear misuse of their images online, and 40pc report stalking or harassment. This infographic is created using Imagine Art Meanwhile, data from the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW)’s 2023 report shows that almost 40pc of Pakistani women surveyed had faced digital cyber-bullying or harassment. Conviction rates remain low: only 92 cybercrime convictions were secured out of 1,375 cases in 2023.

This, however, was not the case with Ayesha, who chose to be identified by her first name only. She told Dawn that her harasser kept reappearing with “obscene profiles and lewd messages for five years before I mustered the courage to tell my husband.” “My husband was very upset with all this and did not agree to go to the FIA to complain,” she said. “He thought we would make matters worse by involving the police.” Ayesha’s experience reflects a broader failure of systems meant to protect women, a reality high court advocate Syed Miqdad Mehdi sees regularly. He said that while Pakistan’s cybercrime law, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016 , has evolved, its implementation still lags behind the scale of abuse. “Law is evolving with the change of modern challenges… but public awareness raising is very important, and capacity building is essential, especially with regards to GBV and TFGBV,” he said. Illustration by Geralt Altmann/ Pixabay He stressed the critical need to sensitise officers, build trust, and create victim-friendly mechanisms so women can report cases without fear of humiliation. “There is no doubt that the FIA… has been getting a lot of successful stories,” he acknowledged, “but despite this, there is a lot of pendency and a lot of load on their work.” With limited staff, long distances to reporting centres, and a lack of specialised GBV-focused infrastructure, many victims lose confidence before their cases even begin. “The specialised courts need to be sensitised,” he added, stressing that TFGBV cases often fall through the cracks of existing legal structures. For Fauzia Yazdani, a gender and governance expert with over three decades of experience, the core issue lies deeper, in social norms and the pace at which digital harms evolve. “When you come into the digital space, your socials and social apps were curated to be gender-blind,” she said. As new forms of online violence emerged, laws were drafted, “but as the digital space is evolving at such a speed, oversight and rules and regulations are not evolving.” Despite the presence of strong laws, from the Pakistan Penal Code to the women protection acts, “are they being implemented? That’s where the issue is,” she said. Yazdani described deepfakes, harassment bots, and algorithm-driven amplification as “crude corners of digital space that need to be monitored and regulated,” warning that the gap between law, oversight, and reality is widening. She argues that the surge in TFGBV is inseparable from Pakistan’s social and political climate. “Our societal narrative is tilted towards gender inequality… it stereotypes women, it categorises or typecasts them into certain roles,” she explained. The result is a landscape where political polarisation and misogyny intertwine and where women’s visibility, whether as journalists, politicians, or ordinary citizens, can become a liability. “It’s very convenient… you’re anonymous, you can harass someone, you can generate bots behind them… and still remain anonymous.” Turning tide against online GBV Technology-facilitated gender-based violence is not just a digital threat. It can change lives, careers, and families. As Yazdani explains, “For transformational change, we have to change the society’s narrative, we have to change the society’s thought process.” Without shifting norms, strengthening oversight, and bringing more women into tech, she warns, the country will continue to see TFGBV grow faster than the systems meant to contain it. Yet even with awareness, enforcement, and advocacy, the human cost is clear. Shukria’s story brings this painfully to life: nearly two years after being targeted online and forced out of journalism, she remains unable to write, speak publicly, or practise her profession. “I am engaged to be married soon, but I feel like I am sitting in a cage, only dreaming of the life I once had,” she says. “I hope that once I am with my husband, I can revive the career that was forcibly taken from me.” Imran Gabol from Lahore and Nadir Guramani from Islamabad contributed to this report.

      "summary_orig": "ABBOTTABAD: An anti-terrorism court handed over the accused in the Dr Warda Mushtaq murder case to the police here on Tuesday on a three-day physical remand amid street protests against the medical doctor’s brutal killing in various parts of the province. Waheed Billa, husband of accused Rida, and others were presented before the ATC, which remanded them in police custody. In order to prevent any untoward incident in light of the people’s anger, the district administration sealed all cloth shops in the city belonging to Billa’s family. The key accused in the case, Shamrez, is still at large, increasing people’s resentment against police. Dr Warda was laid to rest in the cantonment area graveyard on Monday night after funeral prayers were offered at 10pm. Medical staff members of the hospital were among the people who took the body toher house for final rituals. A pall of gloom descended over the place, with most people having teary eyes. With the doctor’s children, father, brother and other relatives present, some of them fainted. Fellow doctors went to Dr Warda’s grave and placed wreaths. DIG of Hazara police Nasir Mahmood Satti said the investigation into the murder would consider all aspects. A special police investigation team under the patronage of DPO Haroonur Rashid has already been formed. Those named in the case have been arrested, while special teams have been formed to arrest crime facilitators. “We will fulfil all legal requirements and bring killers and their facilitators to justice,” he said. Meanwhile, the DPO removed Sub-Inspector Zubair Khan from the post of the SHO at the Cantonment Police Station and appointed Inspector Ali Jadoon in his place. Health minister Khaliqur Rehman visited the deceased’s house and offered condolences to the family. He pledged all possible support to it. “The brutal murder of Dr. Warda Mushtaq is a big tragedy. The government is taking it very seriously and will ensure dispensation of justice at all costs. The accused won’t get off scot-free,” he said. The minister later visited the Benazir Teaching Hospital Abbottabad and met the representatives of the doctors association. “The safety of doctors is the top priority of our government. Those serving in the health sector are a valuable asset to us,” he said. He said a JIT had been formed to conduct a transparent investigation into the murder and it was discharging its responsibility in a completely professional manner. Doctors at the Benazir Shaheed Hospital observed a complete strike. A condolence reference was also held to pay tribute to the deceased. Doctors, nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees participated and prayed for Dr Warda. They also demanded exemplary punishment for the killers. The doctors of Ayub Medical Complex staged a protest sit-in on the Silk Road. Along with nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees, they demanded that the killers and their facilitators be brought to justice. The protesters shouted slogans against the district administration and police and demanded the arrest of the SHO of the Cantonment police station and DSP (Cantt). Also, medical staff members at the tehsil headquarters hospitals in Havelian and Lora staged street protests. In Mansehra, doctors, paramedics and nurses from across upper parts of Hazara Division observed a complete strike, suspending all health services, except emergency for patients. They also took to the streets and demanded exemplary punishment for the killers. Healthcare professionals at public-sector facilities in Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Kohistan and Kolai-Palas districts participated in the strike. Published in Dawn, December 10th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The Punjab Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution to ban incarcerated PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his party for being “anti-state”. The development comes days after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”. Since then a war of words continued between the leaders of ruling party Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and PTI over the presser, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition, insisting that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman, while the opposition party emphatically deplored “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson against ex-premier Imran Khan, saying he was “not a security threat”. PML-N MPA Tahir Pervaiz moved the resolution in the House, which was passed by the treasury members amid a boycott of the proceedings by PTI lawmakers. The resolution did not specifically name the PTI or its founder Imran. “The institutions that safeguard Pakistan on every front and have successfully countered an enemy five times larger, such as India, are vital to the country’s integrity and stability,” said the resolution. “A ban should be imposed on the political party and its founder for acting as a tool of the enemy state. He is also accused of making statements against the country and spreading chaos.” The resolution demanded that action be taken against any leader, whether belonging to political or non-political groups, in accordance with the law, and that they be awarded “appropriate punishment”. It also paid tribute to the personnel and leadership of the institutions working for Pakistan’s stability and security. Earlier in 2024, the federal government decided to ban the PTI and sought Article 6 proceedings against Imran, ex-president Dr Arif Alvi, and former National Assembly (NA) deputy speaker Qasim Suri. The move appeared to be an attempt to prevent the PTI from becoming the single largest party in the NA, following the apex court’s ruling in the reserved seats case. However, the government did not follow through with the ban. In October, the federal government approved a ban on the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) under the anti-terrorism act (ATA) following violent protests. However, banning political groups is not a new practice in Pakistan. It has followed the country across decades — from martial laws to seemingly democratic setups.",

      "summary_orig": "BRANDING political leaders traitors and national security threats is nothing new in this country; the practice has long been a part of our political power game. Hardly any top political leader, even one who has held the highest state office, has been spared this abasement. The latest addition to the list is incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, who has been referred to as a “security threat” and as having a “delusional mindset” by the ISPR chief. This labelling of an individual who not too long ago held the country’s highest political office and still leads its largest opposition party is disconcerting. The comments came in the wake of highly provocative remarks by Imran Khan on social media. Yet it is not deemed appropriate for security circles to engage publicly in polemics regarding the issue. While classifying certain political leaders as ‘security risks’ or ‘traitors’ cannot be justified under any pretext, many PML-N ministers have joined in the chorus against their political rival, forgetting what happened to their own leader just a few years ago. Nawaz Sharif faced similar accusations in his last term as prime minister during the ‘Dawn Leaks’ saga in 2016. Though there was no public declaration by security circles, a concerted campaign was nonetheless launched against a sitting prime minister, bringing him in direct confrontation with the powers that be. Not only was he forced to sack a minister as well as a special adviser, the scandal also contributed to his own ouster . Nawaz Sharif also faced similar allegations when he lashed out at the then security leadership after the fall of his government; in contrast, Imran Khan was seen to come to power aided by the establishment in 2018. Ironically, Sharif, who is now viewed as politically kosher, and his party men echoed the charges against Khan and were in favour of the PTI being banned. The revenge game works well with extra-constitutional powers at the expense of constitutional democracy. Asif Ali Zardari, during his first presidential term, had also been a target of a similar ‘security risk’ campaign in ‘Memogate’ . Then, too, the PML-N was instrumental in the drive, which seemed to have been orchestrated by hidden forces. The bogey of ‘security threat’ has conveniently been used to destabilise civilian governments and discredit political leaderships. Unfortunately, political parties have been willing pawns in the game. Perhaps the worst victim of such a campaign was Benazir Bhutto who was constantly targeted, whether in or out of power. It was well known that she was reluctantly handed over the reins of power, although her party swept the 1988 polls, and the conspiracy to oust her government was soon afoot. A smear campaign labelling her a ‘security threat’, spearheaded by the PML-N with the state’s backing, was launched. It is unfortunate that our political leadership has not learnt any lesson from their own history. Her meetings with the then Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi at the Saarc summit and her efforts to normalise relations with India were used to whip up a concerted propaganda against her as a ‘security threat’. The drive was accelerated after the failure of an establishment-backed vote of no-confidence against her government. I remember Gen Hamid Gul, then corps commander Multan, after having been removed as ISI head, telling me in early 1990 that by conducting Zarb-i-Momin , one of the country’s biggest military exercises, the security leadership had undercut her move towards evolving friendlier ties with India. Journalists from all over the country and outside had been invited to watch the exercise as a part of what was described as Pakistan’s ‘glasnost’ moment. A few months later, her government was ousted via a ‘constitutional coup’. Benazir Bhutto was also falsely accused of passing sensitive information about Pakistan’s nuclear programme to the US. It isn’t difficult to see from where such news originates. Anti-state charges against political leaders and elected representatives can only undermine national security, and it is unfortunate that our political leadership has not learnt any lesson from their own history. Meanwhile, criticism of extra-constitutional actions should not be construed as an attack on security institutions. Just a few years ago, Imran Khan was projected by the establishment as an alternative to a ‘corrupt political leadership’. The former prime minister also attempted to cast doubt on the patriotic credentials of his political opponents. With a turn in fortunes, he himself is now branded as a ‘security threat’ by the same elements who helped him rise to power. While Khan’s present personalised campaign against the military leadership cannot be condoned, the treatment meted out to him and his party leaders also cannot be justified. We have seen polarisation deepening with the growing involvement of state elements. Last week’s press conference has only intensified the political confrontation in the country, with the perceived role of the security apparatus raising questions. At this time, total support from the public is required for the defence forces to successfully tackle the multiple internal and external security challenges that Pakistan faces; the worsening confrontation will only exacerbate an already volatile situation. The deeply polarised politics inside the country and a widening trust gap between the public and state can undermine the strong support needed to end the existentialist threat from terrorism in two strategic provinces. Meanwhile, the growing tension between the PTI-led government in KP and the establishment is also a cause of concern given the surge in terrorism in the province and a war-like situation on Pakistan’s western border with Afghanistan. More than ever, the country needs political reconciliation so that it can focus on tackling these challenges. Branding a former prime minister a ‘security threat’ or abusing the security forces will only compound the current crisis.

      "title_orig": "PTI says water cannons used to disperse protesters staging sit-in outside Adiala jail",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI said early on Wednesday that authorities used water cannons to disperse protesters, including the sisters of PTI founder Imran Khan, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier. In a post on X at 3:58am, the party said, “Pakistani authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala Jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM. “This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene. In another post , the party said that Imran’s family was deliberately blocked from meeting him, which led to the sit-in. It said that the use of water cannons was “not only a shameless violation of Imran Khan’s prisoner rights but also an outright assault on the constitutional rights of people who gathered to protest the regime’s atrocities”. “International human rights organisations and champions of democracy must not stay silent in the face of such inhumane and authoritarian actions in Pakistan,” the party said. In yet another post, Imran’s sisters Aleema, telling drenched participants of the sit-in, “Kids, ghabrana nahin hai (don’t panic) … its just water, don’t panic because of water.” PTI stages sit-in The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration. Police had contacted Imran’s sisters twice and suggested that they leave. Later, a heavy contingent of police was deployed at the scene. The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”. Speaking in video statements as she made her way to the prison on Tuesday, Aleema alleged that the state had been breaking the law, while maintaining that the PTI had done nothing illegal. “If they do operate illegally and we do our work according to the law, and if they are right and we are wrong, then that shows just how our system works,” she said, She then highlighted that Imran has not been allowed to meet his personal physician for the past 14 months. “What is the issue in allowing one doctor to meet Imran Khan?” she asked. “When Nawaz Sharif went to jail, a doctor was with him all day, counting his platelets. “What sort of system is this?” Aleema then exited her car and began to walk towards Adiala jail, accompanied by a large crowd of party members and supporters. She made it to Gorakhpur Market on Adiala Road — roughly a kilometre southwest of the prison — before being stopped by riot police. Sitting at the police barricade, Aleema delivered another statement on video. “This is unconstitutional and illegal. Why are they keeping Imran Khan isolated and tortured?” she asked. “These people are violating the Constitution and breaking the law. “We will not move from here; they can beat us with sticks or shoot us,” Aleema added. “Do what you will.” Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan spoke to reporters at Dahgal, just up the road from the prison and urged authorities to allow meetings with Imran, stating that it would “improve the situation”. “We have a right to come here, and there is a court order allowing us to be here,” Gohar argued. “We had an agreement and a consent order that family and legal counsel could meet him (Imran), but even today, we have been stopped.” “There are a lot of things we are trying to do, but they are not in our control. But if we are allowed to meet, if he is allowed to meet his wife then it will improve the situation.” Gohar also said that there cannot be division in the country and while there is disagreement in politics, there should not be hostility. He left the area without meeting the PTI founder. PTI Secretary General Raja said there was no excuse to bar Imran’s sisters from meeting him, as it is one’s right to meet relatives. “No one can deny the right to meet by saying that Imran Khan’s message was shared outside,” he said. PTI provincial president Akbar said that a large number of party workers and supporters reached Adiala Jail because of a challenge from Senator Faisal Vawda. “We have come here prepared and are willing to sit here the whole night,” Akbar said. “We hope that the meeting will be arranged, but workers are charged and we are ready for a prolonged sit-in.” He added that the distance between people and state institutions is increasing, stating that the PTI does not want the gap to grow. “People have started hating you, so you should think wisely,” said Akbar. It remains unclear whom he was addressing. Similarly, PTI MNA Shahid Khattak said that they were peaceful people and would demonstrate peacefully. “I am a parliamentary leader of the PTI in the National Assembly and it is my right to meet Imran Khan,” he said. “Workers have arrived here just because they love Imran Khan and they think that only he can address the issues of Pakistan.” Khattak also said that a policy should be made to address the issue of military operations in tribal areas. “We have no objection to drone attacks, but drones don’t strike the right targets, due to which civilians are being killed. I suggest that the elders of tribal areas be involved in negotiating with the terrorists. In the past, we were having tea in Afghanistan and now Afghans have been declared enemies,” the MNA added. Meanwhile, KP MPA Shafiullah Jan said that in the mainstream media, someone was saying that nobody would reach Adiala Jail. “He should see that we have reached here,” he stated. “I think anger has grown among workers after the press conference of DG ISPR. We will sit here unless one of the sisters is allowed to meet with Imran Khan.” Last Tuesday, Uzma was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as she went inside the prison to meet her brother. When she exited, she delivered remarks on Imran’s behalf, which were later posted to his X account. These remarks were critical of army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and prompted a fiery response from the military’s spokesperson last Friday, who branded Imran “mentally ill” and a “narcissist”. Last Thursday the federal government barred Uzma and others from meeting Imran over alleged violations of the prison code. “There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen,” said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar. That same day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the ninth time. He addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access and said he would update the media on the future course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not. The next day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “the gloves are off” and that anyone protesting outside Adiala jail, where PTI founder Imran Khan is currently incarcerated, would be dealt with harshly . The minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.",

      "title_orig": "Bilawal suggests allowing provinces to collect taxes, says it will ease Centre’s financial woes",
      "summary_orig": "PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Tuesday said that the country’s economy cannot be run with force and suggested that the federal government allow provinces to collect taxes to bolster the economy. Speaking to journalists after meeting with the business community at the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Bilawal also suggested that the provinces could directly collect sales tax, in view of independent reports about a Rs3 trillion leakage. “Wherever you need our help at the level of the president of Pakistan, our governors, we are ready to do so for your district-wise economic uplift plan,” the PPP chief said. “The prime minister also desires to work for this, but the difference between their approach and ours is that they believe in centralisation and we focus on decentralisation,” he added. Bilawal acknowledged the business community’s concerns about high tax rates, but maintained that his party believes in collecting more taxes to strengthen the economy. “Though the goal is the same, the problem is that the sitting and previous governments wanted to run the economy by force. We think that the economy cannot be run by force, but through a soft attitude,” he added. “You can attract more bees with honey than vinegar. Therefore, if we make our tax rates competitive and give respect to taxpayers, instead of snubbing them or bringing them into the tax net by force, we can get better results,” Bilawal argued. He recalled that a major example of tax collection was observed before the 18th Amendment was passed, when the federal government used to collect taxes on services through the Federal Board of Revenue and added how taxes were collected during that time. “After the 18th Amendment, this subject was transferred to the provinces, and Sindh played a leading role, breaking all of the FBR’s previous collection records,” Bilawal stated. “Punjab and Balochistan also broke all records, but Sindh remained on top. It all happened due to decentralisation.” He suggested that the government give tax-collecting responsibilities to provinces. If the provinces collected more than the targets fixed by the federal government, they would return the difference to the Centre. “I think it will greatly help the federal government resolve its financial issues,” the PPP chairman maintained. Bilawal appreciated the proposals presented by the FPCCI and termed them highly valuable, assuring that the PPP would extend its full cooperation through its policy advisory boards. Speaking on the GSP+ status, he highlighted that this policy had led to an 80 per cent increase in Pakistan’s exports to Europe, while European exports to Pakistan rose by 60pc. He expressed his desire to learn from Punjab’s business community and welcomed their positive and practical suggestions, noting that historical narratives are often misrepresented. The PPP chief underscored the vital role of the business community in strengthening the economy and recalled that the PPP laid the foundation of CPEC. He assured that his party would provide full support in addressing issues faced by the business sector and noted China’s keenness to promote Pakistani products in its markets. Reaffirming his commitment, he said his party would continue to play an active role in resolving problems of traders and added that, during his party’s tenure, significant opportunities were created to enhance exports. Bilawal also expressed pride in working closely with China and stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is equally committed to resolving the challenges faced by the business community. Bilawal urged traders and industrialists to increase exports and stressed the collective need to expand Pakistan’s tax base. He noted that the national challenges cannot be attributed solely to the IMF, acknowledging the difficulties in establishing economic zones, and expressed his commitment to working closely with the federal government to overcome these hurdles. Implement consensus on new provinces before creating them: Bilawal At a separate event, Bilawal advised the government to first implement a consensus on forming new provinces in the National Assembly before discussing creating 20 new ones. “Before talking about creating 20 provinces, first implement the consensus that already exists for new provinces,“ he said in a talk with senior journalists at Bilawal House on Tuesday evening. The PPP scion said that the Punjab Assembly had passed a resolution for the creation of a new province. “There is already consensus in the National Assembly on forming new provinces,” he said, suggesting acting on the existing consensus for South Punjab first before moving forward. “I only referred to the Punjab Assembly’s resolution. I cannot even think of dividing Punjab,” he said. A recent campaign for new provinces in Pakistan has gained traction. Federal Minister Abdul Aleem Khan and former Lahore district nazim Mian Amer Mahmood advocated for dividing existing large provinces like Punjab and Sindh into smaller, more manageable administrative units for improved governance, service delivery and local development. The PPP chief said that reconciliation was the only way forward for the country. “If we continue in an environment where we cannot even talk to each other, or if the situation in one province worsens, problems will multiply.” To a question whether he would meet PTI founder Imran Khan in jail, Bilawal said: “I went to meet Nawaz Sharif in Kot Lakhpat Jail, and he even walked free after he launched attacks on us.“ In a reference to the PML-N’s insecurities towards the PPP, he said that when he came to Punjab, he did not speak against anyone, yet even that was not tolerated. “I ask them (PML-N) to appoint their own governor in Sindh, but they don’t. It has always been a hallmark of the PPP that we remained democratic,” he said. Commenting on Imran, he said the PTI leader was still stuck in the same mode when he was ousted from power in 2022. “This is not only creating problems for the PTI but also puts the entire system under stress,” he said, adding that if matters continued this way, there would be no path toward political reconciliation.",

Federal Minister Abdul Aleem Khan and former Lahore district nazim Mian Amer Mahmood advocated for dividing existing large provinces like Punjab and Sindh into smaller, more manageable administrative units for improved governance, service delivery and local development. The PPP chief said that reconciliation was the only way forward for the country. “If we continue in an environment where we cannot even talk to each other, or if the situation in one province worsens, problems will multiply.” To a question whether he would meet PTI founder Imran Khan in jail, Bilawal said: “I went to meet Nawaz Sharif in Kot Lakhpat Jail, and he even walked free after he launched attacks on us.“ In a reference to the PML-N’s insecurities towards the PPP, he said that when he came to Punjab, he did not speak against anyone, yet even that was not tolerated. “I ask them (PML-N) to appoint their own governor in Sindh, but they don’t. It has always been a hallmark of the PPP that we remained democratic,” he said. Commenting on Imran, he said the PTI leader was still stuck in the same mode when he was ousted from power in 2022. “This is not only creating problems for the PTI but also puts the entire system under stress,” he said, adding that if matters continued this way, there would be no path toward political reconciliation.",

      "summary_orig": "As militant attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa surge, the provincial police force has asked the government to grant a special allowance to its personnel, which would cost around Rs4.2 billion per month. Attacks on police personnel have increased by around 56 per cent during the current year. In this regard, the Central Police Office (CPO) moved a summary to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi. The summary stated that the provincial government prioritised the enhancement of police capacity and welfare in view of militancy and security challenges. “Due to the government’s focused efforts and effective administrative measures, not only has the law and order situation improved, but the government’s overall public image has also strengthened,” the summary read. The summary further stated that special financial incentives, such as a militancy allowance, were being provided to police personnel in view of the grave risks, operational responsibilities, and constant exposure to threats they face on a routine basis. It added that these measures were intended to boost the morale of the force and enable them to discharge their duties with greater confidence. The summary further stated that KP police continuously confronted terrorists and insurgents, often at great personal risk, due to their role on the front lines. “KP police have made countless sacrifices, including the loss of precious lives and serious injuries,” the document reads. The department pointed out that police duty in the province remained extremely risky, and exposed personnel to the threats of bombings, targeted attacks and other violent activities carried out by extremist elements. It further stated that the KP police were currently performing their duties without any additional financial incentive, despite the challenging security environment and the operational nature of their assignments, in view of the continuous high-risk duties performed by all cadres of the force. It was proposed that a special allowance, equivalent to one basic pay, be granted to all ranks of the provincial force. “The provision of this allowance will not only recognise the extraordinary services and sacrifices of KP police but will significantly enhance their morale, efficiency, and motivation in carrying out critical security operations throughout the province,” the summary stated. The summary stated that the special allowance would amount to Rs4.2bn per month. Data showed that attacks on police personnel have increased by 56 per cent during the first 11 months of the current year as compared to the corresponding period of last year. Till December 1 of this year, 137 KP police personnel were martyred, while 236 were injured in 510 incidents, as compared to the same period of 2024, in which 147 personnel were martyred in 327 attacks. According to the police officials, the casualties during the current year have decreased by 7pc due to the police department’s focus on strengthening check posts, police stations and up-armouring of vehicles. According to officials, the number of militant attacks repelled at police installations increased by 102pc. Police personnel repelled 320 attacks during the current year, compared to 158 last year “This showed a high level of training, rapid response capacity and effective operational strategy,” an official said. In addition, the KP police’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted 2,791 intelligence-based operations (IBOs), arrested 1,244 terrorists, and killed 420 during the first 11 months of the year — an increase of 61pc and 43pc, respectively. The CTD also arrested 25 high-value targets. On Monday, KP CM Afridi handed over the newly-purchased armoured vehicles, modern weapons and security gadgets to the police at an event at the Malik Saad Shaheed Police Lines. The equipment includes drones, anti-drone guns, anti-drone systems, thermal cameras, jammers, body armour, ballistic helmets, armoured vehicles, sniper rifles, Dragunov marksman rifles, M-16s, sub-machine guns, heavy machine guns, and various other advanced security tools, according to a statement.",

      "summary_orig": "Fresh clashes along the Thai-Cambodia border are being met with grim resignation by civilians, as they flock again to makeshift shelters still standing from the last bout of combat. Displaced children chased each other on the tarmac of Thailand’s Chang International Circuit race track, where hundreds of families were sheltering in vast silo-shaped tents. “I want the government to deal with this decisively so it stops for good,” said handyman Boonsong Boonpimay at the racecourse in Buriram city, 70 kilometres from the fraught frontier. “Otherwise we’ll have to keep living like this — unable to work and constantly on edge,” the 51-year-old told AFP. Thailand and Cambodia have a long-standing dispute over portions of their boundary dating back to their colonial-era demarcation. Residents rest inside a temple after they evacuated following clashes along the Cambodia-Thailand border, in Siem Reap province on December 9. — AFP Five days of combat in July killed dozens of people and displaced around 300,000 on both sides of the border before a truce took effect. But all-out fighting flared again along their jungle-clad frontier this week — with Thailand launching air strikes and Cambodia announcing retaliatory attacks on Tuesday. At least seven Cambodian civilians and three Thai soldiers have been killed so far, according to officials, while more than 125,000 people have been evacuated on the Thai side alone. Chang International Circuit owner Newin Chidchob told AFP he was ready for the surge of his displaced compatriots, sceptical this summer’s armistice would hold. Residents rest inside a temple after they evacuated following clashes along the Cambodia-Thailand border, in Siem Reap province on December 9. — AFP “After the clashes last time, when things quieted down, and villagers returned home, we did not believe it would truly be peaceful,” the former MP said. “So we worked with the province to set up this system and prepare the site, because we felt that real peace or stability was unlikely.” ‘Ears open all the time’ Thai and Cambodian troops laid down their arms in July after intervention by US President Donald Trump as well China and Malaysia — current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Conflict monitors said a follow-on pact failed to adjudicate their core conflict, but Trump nonetheless touted it as a major peace-making achievement of his presidency. Residents take shelter in a bunker following clashes along the Thai-Cambodia border in Thailand’s Sa Kaeo Province on December 9. — AFP Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has said he nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for halting the violence. But cradling her five-year-old son at a makeshift shelter at a temple, Cambodian Ros Sambok lamented how her life was still being uprooted by the conflict. “It is my third time fleeing home, and we have been on alert every day,” the 31-year-old said. “I just want peace so the kids can go to school together.” She fled with around 20 family members from her village, about seven kilometres from the front line, on Monday morning — but her mental peace has remained broken since the original clashes. “I could barely sleep in recent months. Authorities told us to be ready all the time,” she said. “It is not easy. Our ears [are] open all [the] time.” Though divided by a contested border, Thai evacuees expressed near-identical complaints about the conflict disrupting their lives again after a brief interlude of peace. “We live day to day, and we have debts and children to take care of,” said 60-year-old Thai rubber farmer Painee Khengnok, displaced from the borderland where he earns his keep. “Whatever the government needs to do, I just want them to solve this quickly so we can get back to making a normal living.”",

      "summary": "Fresh clashes along the Thai-Cambodia border are being met with grim resignation by civilians, as they flock again to makeshift shelters still standing from the last bout of combat. Displaced children chased each other on the tarmac of Thailand’s Chang International Circuit race track, where hundreds of families were sheltering in vast silo-shaped tents. “I want the government to deal with this decisively so it stops for good,” said handyman Boonsong Boonpimay at the racecourse in Buriram city, 70 kilometres from the fraught frontier. “Otherwise we’ll have to keep living like this — unable to work and constantly on edge,” the 51-year-old told AFP. Thailand and Cambodia have a long-standing dispute over portions of their boundary dating back to their colonial-era demarcation. Residents rest inside a temple after they evacuated following clashes along the Cambodia-Thailand border, in Siem Reap province on December 9. — AFP Five days of combat in July killed dozens of people and displaced around 300,000 on both sides of the border before a truce took effect. But all-out fighting flared again along their jungle-clad frontier this week — with Thailand launching air strikes and Cambodia announcing retaliatory attacks on Tuesday. At least seven Cambodian civilians and three Thai soldiers have been killed so far, according to officials, while more than 125,000 people have been evacuated on the Thai side alone. Chang International Circuit owner Newin Chidchob told AFP he was ready for the surge of his displaced compatriots, sceptical this summer’s armistice would hold. Residents rest inside a temple after they evacuated following clashes along the Cambodia-Thailand border, in Siem Reap province on December 9. — AFP “After the clashes last time, when things quieted down, and villagers returned home, we did not believe it would truly be peaceful,” the former MP said. “So we worked with the province to set up this system and prepare the site, because we felt that real peace or stability was unlikely.” ‘Ears open all the time’ Thai and Cambodian troops laid down their arms in July after intervention by US President Donald Trump as well China and Malaysia — current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Conflict monitors said a follow-on pact failed to adjudicate their core conflict, but Trump nonetheless touted it as a major peace-making achievement of his presidency. Residents take shelter in a bunker following clashes along the Thai-Cambodia border in Thailand’s Sa Kaeo Province on December 9. — AFP Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet has said he nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for halting the violence. But cradling her five-year-old son at a makeshift shelter at a temple, Cambodian Ros Sambok lamented how her life was still being uprooted by the conflict. “It is my third time fleeing home, and we have been on alert every day,” the 31-year-old said. “I just want peace so the kids can go to school together.” She fled with around 20 family members from her village, about seven kilometres from the front line, on Monday morning — but her mental peace has remained broken since the original clashes. “I could barely sleep in recent months. Authorities told us to be ready all the time,” she said. “It is not easy. Our ears [are] open all [the] time.” Though divided by a contested border, Thai evacuees expressed near-identical complaints about the conflict disrupting their lives again after a brief interlude of peace. “We live day to day, and we have debts and children to take care of,” said 60-year-old Thai rubber farmer Painee Khengnok, displaced from the borderland where he earns his keep. “Whatever the government needs to do, I just want them to solve this quickly so we can get back to making a normal living.”",
