      "title_orig": "Trump says US talks with Iran ‘very good,’ more negotiations expected",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said Friday that Washington held “very good talks” on Iran after the two sides held an indirect dialogue in Oman. Iran, for its part, said it expected to hold more negotiations with the United States, hailing a “positive atmosphere” during a day of talks in the Gulf sultanate. With an American naval group led by an aircraft carrier in Middle Eastern waters, US and Iranian delegations held talks in Muscat mediated by Oman without publicly meeting face-to-face. Shortly after the talks concluded, the US announced new sanctions against shipping entities and vessels, aimed at curbing Iran’s oil exports. But it was not clear if the move was linked to the talks. The talks were the first between the two foes since the United States joined Israel’s war with Iran in June with strikes on nuclear sites. “We likewise had very good talks on Iran,” Trump told reporters on board Air Force One en route to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, adding, “we’re going to meet again early next week.” However, as Iran warned against further threats after Washington raised the spectre of new military action, Trump said: “If they don’t make a deal, the consequences are very steep.” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led Iran’s delegation in Muscat, said talks “focused exclusively” on the Iranian nuclear program, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb but Tehran insists is peaceful. The US delegation, led by Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner, had also wanted Tehran’s backing for militant groups, its ballistic missile program and treatment of protesters on the agenda. “In a very positive atmosphere, our arguments were exchanged and the views of the other side were shared with us,” Araghchi told Iranian state TV, adding that the two sides had “agreed to continue negotiations.” Speaking to the official IRNA news agency, Araghchi expressed hope that Washington would refrain from “threats and pressure” so that “the talks can continue.” ‘Destabilizing power’ Admiral Brad Cooper, the commander of US Central Command, was present at the talks, according to images published by the Oman News Agency. Multiple sessions of talks in the morning and afternoon saw both sides shuttling to and from the residence of Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi. The foreign ministry of US ally Qatar expressed hope the talks would “lead to a comprehensive agreement that serves the interests of both parties and enhances security and stability in the region.” The White House has made clear it wants the talks to rein in Tehran’s ability to make a nuclear bomb, an ambition the Islamic republic has always denied. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Friday that Iran should stop being a “destabilizing power,” citing its nuclear program and support for “terrorist” groups. Barrot also called on “groups supported by Iran” to exert “the utmost restraint” in the event of any military escalation involving the Islamic republic. ‘Maximum pressure’ Trump initially threatened military action against Tehran over its crackdown on protesters last month, which rights groups say killed thousands, and even told demonstrators “help is on its way.” Regional powers including Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar urged the United States not to intervene, calling on Washington and Tehran to instead return to talks. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said Friday it has confirmed 6,505 protesters were killed, as well as 214 members of the security forces and 61 bystanders. Those numbers are expected to climb because the magnitude of the crackdown has masked by the blanket internet shutdown imposed by the authorities for a fortnight, rights groups say. Almost 51,000 people are also confirmed to have been arrested amid “the growing use of forced confessions,” according to HRANA. Yet Trump’s rhetoric in recent days has focused on reining in the Iranian nuclear program and the US has maneuvered a naval group led by aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln into the region. Iran has repeatedly vowed it will hit back at US bases in the region if attacked. The new sanctions to curb Iran’s oil exports come with Trump “committed to driving down the Iranian regime’s illicit oil and petrochemical exports under the administration’s maximum pressure campaign,” State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement.",

      "summary_orig": "AFTER every terrorist atrocity, we are left with more questions than answers. This is also true in the case of yesterday’s barbaric suicide bombing of an imambargah in Islamabad during Friday prayers. It was the first sectarian massacre in several years, and the second major attack targeting the federal capital since last November’s blast outside a district and sessions court building. The defence minister has said Afghanistan and India are responsible, but a deeper probe is required, as Pakistan has had to confront home-grown sectarian terrorism for the past four decades now. Officials say that the suspected bomber had travelled to Afghanistan, and initial findings suggest links to IS. Various theories are being advanced by state functionaries, some of whom believe that the bombing could have been a response to the recent action against terrorists in Balochistan, though Baloch separatist groups are not usually known to carry out sectarian assaults. The attack is also being interpreted as the banned TTP’s handiwork — which is a strong possibility. Historically, groups that were known as the ‘Punjabi Taliban’, which later merged with the TTP, have a record of sectarian violence, and may have been reactivated to hit ‘soft’ targets. IS has also been active in Pakistan, though the group has been largely quiet for a few years. This outfit has a similarly rabidly sectarian worldview. Only a thorough probe can unveil the real criminals behind this grotesque act of violence. It must be asked how the terrorists were able to carry out an attack in what is supposed to be Pakistan’s most secure city. No doubt, it is near impossible to prevent a suicide bomber from setting off explosives when he decides to strike. But better intelligence can be employed to foil such attacks. It is also a fact that while the more bloodthirsty sectarian groups in Pakistan, such as the banned Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, have been largely defanged, many of their political supporters remain active, free to take out rallies and indulge in hate speech. The state’s counterterrorism policy will remain ineffective until these groups are put out of business. Such groups, including the banned ASWJ, share a worldview with the TTP, which the state has declared the mortal enemy of Pakistan. Hence it is necessary to take action against the political and ideological backers of violent sectarian groups in order to close the door on further violence in the country. Together, state and society must thwart the efforts of malign actors who wish to foment communal unrest. Pakistan has, over the decades, witnessed numerous instances of sectarian violence. It cannot afford a return to such dark times, which is why the state’s top priority must be to neutralise sectarian terrorist groups. Published in Dawn, February 7th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "In 2015, Coke Studio released ‘ Phir Se Game Uthadein ’ — an anthem for the ODI World Cup set to happen the same year. It was inspired by Slogett and Carlone’s 1992 anthem ‘Who Rules the World’ , the soundtrack to Pakistan’s first and most fabled major victory in cricket . Produced by Strings and sung by Atif Aslam, the song proclaimed “ Jeet ki daastaan, phir ho gi jawaan” to the same tune as “ Who’s gonna be number one, who’s gonna take up the cup?”. There is a dexterity required to mythologise something that has actually happened — Pakistan has done that with the 1992 World Cup. There must have been a time when the historical immediacy of the victory would lend itself as proof that it was real. But ever since I can remember, the 1992 World Cup has been a pedestalised peak that seems harder and harder to re-mount as the years go by. 1992 is invoked in every metaphor for victory in Pakistan, sporting or otherwise. It is the incantation we chant when we are inviting good fortune, and the prayer we use to give shape to this imagined fortune.

But what was perhaps most intriguing about this remake was the fact that a sad follow-up was shot.

Empty rooftops with stray, limp pieces of confetti sadly billowing in the breeze. A sadder version of the song, essentially saying “we lost, but it’s okay.” It’s not the reprise that particularly tickled my fancy, but the idea that a company producing a hype song for one of the decade’s most anticipated cricketing events had the foresight to produce a version for the sadder, but probably likelier outcome. It’s not like it came as a shock — the campaign included the routine defeat to India, the fabled 1-4 collapse against the West Indies that the country woke up before dawn to witness, and of course, an immediately historicised dropped catch in the quarter final. All of this is to say that Pakistan losing or ungracefully bowing out of a tournament isn’t necessarily an unfamiliar feeling. It is often anticipated, often met with a begrudging acknowledgement: “ haan yaar, pata tha yehi hoga.” And yet, I was thirteen years old during that particular World Cup, and while I do remember all the horrors in technicolour, I cannot help but remember the few gleaming specks of joy that somehow muscled their way out of them. I remember a then 27-year-old Sarfaraz Ahmed playing perhaps the first iconic knock of his career against South Africa, falling short of a half-century by one run, and Pakistan winning a game that it probably shouldn’t have. Pakistan player Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates in a match during the 2015 ICC World Cup. — Reuters/File Across the world, as Wahab Riaz was bowling ball after ball of the spell of his life to Shane Watson, I remember loitering around my school’s staffroom during the quarter final, asking the one teacher who would indulge my classmates and me by giving us an update on the score. After each of these trips, we would trundle back to class and take a moment to collectively (mournfully) pray at our desks. I remember realising properly for the first time in my life that all the stretched out, worn out, drawn out cliches about coming back to this team over and over again would be true for my whole life. Cricket feels different now than it did back then — it’s faster and more saturated, with so many more places and people and things involved. There is some form of a “World Cup” every year, and it feels difficult to truly feel what a looming World Cup feels like when one is around the corner every month. Much more recently, the constant uncertainty around cricket has been cause for further disillusionment — a Champions Trophy which was supposed to happen entirely at home not having been so , disappointing showings in 2023 and 2024, and an Asia Cup truncated with political puppet shows. Going into the T20 World Cup, Pakistan is once again at the centre of what looks like a less-than-ideal unfolding: Pakistan has boycotted the match against India in solidarity with Bangladesh against ICC’s inconsistent treatment across teams. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. — AFP As a result of the hybrid-model compromise with India in 2024, which promised neutral venues for both teams in the case of an ICC tournament in either one, Pakistan will be playing its group matches in Colombo, with Sri Lanka being cohosts for the tournament. Of course, we have a long history with our good friend Colombo in the rain, and with a fluctuating percentage of rain in the forecast, the possibility of any of Pakistan’s games being washed out is not zero. There is no margin for error. The realistic thing would be to not hope too much. And yet, one can’t help but feel like that after a while; the Pakistan side showing up to this World Cup feels like a team again. Salman Ali Agha’s success at number 3 has unlocked a vein of potential for Pakistan — while his T20 strike rate is around 122, at this position, he has averaged 37 and struck at a solid 168, especially in the recent series against Sri Lanka and Australia . Batting aside, Agha has amassed T20 series wins against South Africa, Australia, West Indies and Bangladesh, in addition to two tri-series wins and leading Pakistan to be the finalists in the Asia Cup. As we speak, Saim Ayub is the world’s number one all-rounder in T20 cricket, and Usman Tariq, with his perfectly legal action, has provided Pakistan’s bowling line-up with a contested but undeniable innovation. The spin arsenal of Saim, Abrar Ahmed, Usman Tariq, Shadab Khan and Muhammad Nawaz has shaped up to be one of the most promising in the tournament, if the statement 3-0 win against Australia was any indication. Pakistan’s Abrar Ahmed bowls during the second T20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Australia at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on January 31. — AFP All histories up till now have shown that Pakistan’s form before a tournament is just about as untrustworthy as Pakistan’s performances during one — but against all my wisdom, I am compelled to hope. Of course, cricket is currently at the mercy of administrative mishaps and Pakistan fans are at the mercy of the Pakistan cricket team. But sometimes it is good to remember that not even the most illustrious of wisdoms and an undeniable breadth of knowledge does not absolve us of this reality: when Pakistan plays cricket, we will be tuning in. Hopefully, this time, the sadder songs will remain in the archives.

President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grief over the attack and offered condolences to the families of those who lost their lives, according to a statement shared by the PPP on X. “Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity,” he said, and directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to the injured. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the blast and expressed sympathy with the bereaved. In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, he directed that the investigation be completed and those responsible identified. He also ordered that the injured be provided the best possible medical treatment and said the health minister would monitor the situation. “No one will be allowed to spread chaos and unrest in the country,” he said, according to an official statement. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “cowardly suicide attack” on worshippers. He said targeting places of worship and civilians was a “heinous crime against humanity” and a violation of Islamic principles. “Pakistan stands united against terrorism in all its forms,” he said, adding that those responsible would be brought to account. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarf­raz Bugti also condemned the atta­­ck, calling it the worst form of terro­rism and a crime against humanity. He expressed solidarity with the affected families and prayed for the recovery of the injured, stressing that the entire nation was united against terrorist activities and stood with security forces. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi also condemned the blast, stressing that an attack on a place of worship was a heinous crime against humanity. He emphasised that targeting worshippers through a suicide attack reflected extreme brutality and intolerance, which had no place in any religion or society. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq expressed grief over the loss of lives, extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the swift recovery of the injured. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also termed the attack “cowardly” and said the prime minister had instructed that those responsible be brought to justice. He said the state remained committed to protecting lives and places of worship and that action would continue against terrorists under a “zero-tolerance” policy. JUI-F leaders, including Maulana Rashid Mahmood Soomro and Ma­­u­lana Nasir Mahmood Soomro, also con­demned the bombing and dem­a­n­ded swift action against those involved. They called for stronger security measures for places of worship. The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) termed the attack a brutal crime against Islam, humanity and the sanctity of religious spaces. In a video message shared with media outlets, PUC Chairman Allama Tahir Ashrafi said the perpetrators of the attack had no association with Islam or human values. PBC expresses sympathies The Pakistan Bar Council also expressed sympathy with bereaved family members and prayed for the high ranks for the departed soul and early recovery for the injured. The Islamabad Bar Association announced a day of mourning and a strike in protest over the terrorist incident. In a statement, the association expressed deep sorrow over the attack and demanded a thorough investigation. Meanwhile, protests erupted across several parts of the country, as anger and grief spilt onto the streets following the Islamabad attack. In Karachi, mourners and activists blocked major roads, demanding justice for the victims and swift action against those responsible for the attack. Major demonstrations were held at key locations, including the main Malir 15 intersection, Shahrah-i-Pakistan near the Incholi bus stop, Abul Hasan Isphahani Road near Abbas Town and at Numaish. The protesters chanted slogans against terrorism and held placards condemning continued failures to protect places of worship. The protests organised and supported by Majlis Wahdat-i-Musli­meen (MWM), Jafferia Alliance, Imamia Students Organisation and Shia Ulema Council attracted a large number of participants, including women and children. Demonstrations were also held in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza and Nagar districts, with protesters blocking sections of the Karakoram Highway and other roads to condemn the attack. In Skardu, protesters gathered at Yadgar Chowk and chanted slogans against the government over security failures. Speaking on the occasion, the President of Anjuman-i-Imamia Bal­tistan, Agha Syed Baqar Hussaini and other religious scholars dema­nded the immediate arrest of those responsible and announced a peaceful protest in Baltistan on Saturday and three days of mourning. In Hunza and Nagar, protesters blocked the Karakoram Highway at Gulmit and Ganish for several hours, burning tyres and raising slogans against terrorists. In Gilgit, demonstrators described the bombing as an attack on humanity and Islamic values and offered condolences to the victims’ families. GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, caretaker Chief Minister Yar Muhammad, GB Assembly speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate and other political and religious leaders and civil society members also condemned the blast and demanded exemplary punishment for the culprits. Separately, the Shia Ulema Council staged a rally and demonstration in Nawabshah, condemning the bombing and demand-ing immediate action against the perpetrators. Meanwhile, police authorities in Sindh said security arrangements at mosques, imambargahs and other religious sites were being strengthened following the Islamabad blast.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The Friday’s suicide blast at the Tarlai Imambargah is the second major terrorist attack in the federal capital in less than three months despite heightened security measures adopted by the police and the capital administration. On November 11 last year, a lone suicide bomber blew himself up in front of the main entrance of the Judicial Complex in G-11 after a couple of unsuccessful attempts to enter the premises, killing a dozen people and injuring at least 36 others. Soon after the incident, a number of police pickets were established on different roads of the capital. In addition, the Islamabad Traffic Police narrowed some of the busy roads in the capital during rush hours by placing barricades on a daily basis to monitor suspicious activities, causing much difficulties for the commuters. After the Tarlai Imambargah attack on Friday, some of the grief-stricken people, who had reached Pims hospital to trace their missing relatives, expressed their anger over the alleged failure of the police and the law enforcement agencies in preventing the devastating attack. However, a senior police officer, when contacted, said the suicide attack had taken place in a rural area located on the outskirts of the capital city whereas the security measures had been put in place in the urban areas and various sectors of Islamabad. He said the focus of the police was mainly on the government buildings and other sensitive installations, adding the police were also constantly monitoring the movements of the suspicious people within the capital city through the Safe City cameras besides keeping record of visitors staying in hotels and guest houses. The official said only “human intelligence” was possible to monitor such activities in rural areas which generally served as “safe heavens” for the terrorists. It may be recalled that talking to the media outside the Judicial Complex after the November 11 attack, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had declared that he had directed that no vehicle be allowed into Islamabad without an e-tag after two weeks. Later, Minister of State for Interior Senator Talal Chaudhry, while addressing a press conference outside Parliament House alongside Inspector General of Police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi on November 13, had said it would be declared mandatory for all vehicles in the city to have e-tags. Authorities installed e-tag readers and cameras at 11 to 14 different points in the capital. These e-tag readers and cameras were installed under the supervision of the Safe City Authority in Islamabad to read vehicle tags. The tags and cameras were linked with the Safe City system and were installed on newly erected poles at these points to scan e-tags and vehicle registration plates. Officials further said that approximately 400,000 to 500,000 vehicles move on the roads of the capital daily, with a large number entering the city from neighbouring areas, including Rawalpindi. So far, e-tags have been installed on 203,915 vehicles up to February 5, the capital administration said, adding that around 19 points are still operational for installing e-tags on vehicles.

An inconsolable scene was witnessed at the hospital, as family members, including women and children, of the injured and deceased, started arriving. They were wailing and loudly praying. Some women even expressed helplessness while crying, saying their main breadwinners had been hit in the terror attack. The grieving families, friends and emergency responders struggled to manage the chaotic situation, while the rescue teams rushed the wounded into the emergency wards. Ambulances arrived in rapid succession from the blast site in Tarlai situated in the outskirts of the federal capital with rescue workers rushing the wounded into emergency and doctors and paramedics providing immediate medical care. Hospital administration hands over 28 bodies to relatives; 105 injured under treatment Officials at the hospital said an emergency had been declared to ensure the availability of doctors, nurses and essential medical supplies. Additional staffers were called in to assist with treatment and help identify the deceased. Several victims were shifted to operation theatres, while others were treated in the hospital’s emergency wards. The Pims administration handed over 28 bodies to the families from the OPD by late evening and 105 injured were under treatment. Outside the emergency ward, anxious relatives gathered in a large number, seeking information about their loved ones, in tears and later gathered at the parking lot, chanting slogans against terrorism. An injured person is being offloaded from an ambulance at Pims in Islamabad on Friday. — White Star Meanwhile, waiting among the grieved people were two clerics, who were reciting religious sermons and narrating the Karbala incident. The clerics, requesting not to be named, told Dawn that the most important role of community leaders, including religious leaders, was to prevent formation of mobs. “People get upset, disappointed and vent their anger on anything they see. We do not want any mob start damaging property or misbehave with hospital staff,” the clerics added. Police and district administration officials were also present at the hospital to coordinate with medical teams and maintain order as the situation remained tense late into the night. Many of the deceased and injured were originally from the Hazara community of Quetta and had relocated here, along with people from Hangu and Parachinar, escaping repeated terrorism in those areas. Some people from Gilgit-Baltistan also settled in Tarlai as it is a cheaper locality. It was announced that the collective funeral prayers of the deceased will be held at the same place (Imambargah Khadijatul Kubra) at 11am on Saturday (today). Incidentally, the Pims area witnessed very weak mobile network signals and slow data. However, all four telecom companies - Ufone, Jazz, Zong and Telenor - responding to a query said they had not lowered the signals for the area. They explained that the poor network quality could be due to a capacity issue, probably because of the large number of people in the area at the same time. Published in Dawn, February 7th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: At least 31 people were killed and another 169 were injured in a suicide bombing at an imambargah during Friday prayers, according to authorities. Police confirmed the number of casualties. The explosion occurred at Imambargah Khadijah-tul-Kubra in the Tarlai area of the federal capital. Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris, and panicked worshippers. Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the imambargah as people called for help. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif suggested India’s and Afghanistan’s involvement in the attack, stating in a post on social media platform X that “it has been proved that the terrorist involved in the attack travelled to and from Afghanistan”. “The collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed,” he said. The defence minister said that security guards at the site of the incident had “challenged” the attacker, and in response, he opened fire. “He then blew himself up, standing in the last row of worshippers,” he said. Asif said that the state would respond to this “cruelty with full force”. “After a humiliating defeat, India is fighting a war through its proxies. It doesn’t have the courage to fight directly now,” he added. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath ’ later in the day, Asif said that the attack came as Pakistan signed landmark agreements with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and on the same day as the revival of Basant. “The timing, I believe, is an effort to sabotage us and our progress … India cannot engage in an all-out clash with Pakistan, so it is using proxies and Afghanistan to disrupt peace here,” he said. The defence minister said that the suicide bomber was a Pakistani national who had travelled to Afghanistan some time ago and undergone “extreme religious indoctrination”. He added that the bomber returned to Pakistan last year. ‘Attacker travelled to Afghanistan on several occasions’ Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry later told the media in Islamabad that while the attacker was not an Afghan, authorities had been able to determine through forensic tests the number of times he had travelled to Afghanistan. At the outset of his media talk, he said rescue teams from various departments began reaching the site of the incident within 10-12 minutes of the blast. Regarding the attacker, he said: “Information has been obtained about the terrorist who carried out the suicide attack. He is not an Afghan national, but we have information about the number of times he travelled to Afghanistan after the forensics of his remains.” Chaudhry added that a similar pattern was seen in terror incidents in the country, adding that attacks were either carried out “in the name of religion or on the pretext of … linguistic and provincial [differences].” In connection with the latter, he particularly mentioned the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). “They had planned a week ago that they would give a surprise in Balochistan, but they had to pay a heavy price for it and suffered losses. “These terrorists have reached the extremes of cowardliness. They are attacking soft targets, including markets, schools, mosques, imambargahs, banks and other such places,” he added. The state minister also said that a first cousin of the Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi had died in the blast. “All of them are our brothers. Irrespective of any sect, they all are Pakistanis,” he said, adding: “We are resolute and determined that the implementation of the National Action Plan will continue [in the fight against terrorism]. There is no doubt or leniency on this.” Chaudhry also said that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had visited the imambargah that was targeted in the attack and collected relevant information. He said that Pakistan had shared evidence with the rest of the world, including its neighbouring countries, that terrorism in Pakistan was sponsored by India. “We have proof that India has tripled its investment into this. They (terrorists) are not carrying out attacks for religion, but for dollars … Whether they belong to the BLA, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan or any other group, they are paid in dollars,” he added. The minister further stated that Islamabad had repeatedly urged Afghanistan not to provide space to terrorists and not to become India’s proxy. “These proxies will meet the same fate as India did in May [last year],” he added. Speaking about today’s attack, he said “Everything is being monitored at the highest level … But a lot of information cannot be shared at this point because it is important to reach those who were behind them (attacker). And within 72 hours, we will share a detailed report, including information about their handlers.” When asked whether the incident was also not a failure of the authorities and the state in protecting the public, Chaudhry replied: “This is not a failure … We are a frontline state that is protecting the world. And they are attacking us as they just want to weaken the wall that is Pakistan. If this wall weakens, this fire is not going to stop at our border … We are a responsible state and we are going to fulfil our responsibility. We are going to win this war, and we are winning this war.” Earlier, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that “India is behind” the incident. Speaking to the media at Polyclinic Hospital in Islamabad, he expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from Pakistan. The minister further said that Pakistan had always promoted peace and wanted peace in the region. But, he added, Pakistan’s neighbours had been involved in terror activities in the country. In this connection, the minister particularly mentioned India, saying that it was involved in “terrorism activities in Balochistan, Fata and in the incident that took place in Islamabad today”. “We have exposed them to the world,” he said, adding that the nation was united against such “cowardly acts and enemies”. “The fight against them (terrorists) will continue until they are eliminated,” he expressed resolve. The minister said the injured and the dead had been taken to Pims and Polyclinic Hospital, and emergencies had been declared in hospitals across Islamabad. Meanwhile, the district administration spokesperson said the site of the blast had been sealed off by security personnel, and added that assistant commissioners were assigned to oversee the treatment of the injured at various hospitals. Security personnel stand guard outside an imambargah following an explosion, in Islamabad on February 6, 2026. —AFP Pindi police on high alert; Punjab CM dispatches ambulances In view of the prevailing security situation, Rawalpindi police were placed on high-alert, according to a statement by the police spokesperson. “Security duties are being checked and [officials are being] briefed at imambargahs, mosques and other places across the city,” the statement read. According to the statement, the police officials held meetings with the administrators and the guardians of the religious places and informed them about security standard operating procedures and the measures taken in this regard. The Islamabad Bar Association also called for a day of mourning on Saturday. A notice issued by the association said that it strongly condemned the suicide blast and expressed deep sorrow over the lives lost. The association demanded that authorities conduct an immediate investigation into this incident and bring those involved to justice. The lawyer’s body announced a day of mourning and strike for February 7 (tomorrow), saying that lawyers would not appear in court. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in a post on X, said the provincial government had dispatched 25 ambulances to Islamabad. She added that all hospitals across Rawalpindi district had been placed on high alert with “surgical teams, anesthetists, orthopedic and neurosurgical specialists on standby”. “Blood banks are fully staffed, and operation theatres are fully equipped to ensure prompt and effective medical care for the injured.” Maryam added that the commissioner and deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi were also instructed to extend every possible assistance. She later said that she would be cancelling “all my Basant-related activities that were scheduled for tomorrow”. “The mega Basant show at the Liberty Square also stands cancelled,” she said. The chief minister said that it was imperative that the nation was united against “ the khwarji menace and their ‘sympathisers’, shows them no mercy, and stands shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces in defence of the country”. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said the provincial government had decided to cancel the “musical segment of the cultural night planned in honour of the Commonwealth Parliamentarians Association”. “We share the pain of the bereaved families. The dinner will be held simply, without music, out of respect for the victims and our national grief,” he said. President, PM condemn blast Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari extended condolences to the victims who lost their lives in the blast, according to a statement issued by the PPP on X. He expressed grief over the incident, saying, “Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity”. The president prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to them. In a post on X later, he acknowledged the messages of support from around the world. “Such solidarity reinforces our shared stand against violence. Pakistan remains resolute in upholding peace, resilience & national unity,” he said. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the blast, according to a statement. He expressed grief over the deaths in the blast and expressed sympathy with the bereaved. In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the prime minister directed him to complete the investigation of the incident and immediately identify the people responsible for it. He directed that “the injured be provided best medical facilities and the health minister will monitor” the situation, the statement quoted him as saying. “No one will be allowed to disseminate chaos and unrest in the country,” he said. In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said he was grateful for the messages of support and sympathy from across the globe. “The support of our friends and partners has always remained critical in Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts. The perpetrators of this heinous crime will be brought to justice with full force and their nefarious designs will never be allowed to succeed,” he said. “The brave Pakistani nation stands united at this time and we remain fully committed to our resolve to defeat terrorism, as we always have,” he said. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “cowardly suicide attack on innocent worshippers during Friday prayers at a Shia imambargah in Islamabad, killing dozens”. “Targeting places of worship and civilians is a heinous crime against humanity and a blatant violation of Islamic principles,” he said. Dar further said, “Pakistan stands united against terrorism in all its forms. This barbarity will not intimidate us and extremists will be brought to full account.” In his condemnation, Information Attaullah Tarar termed the attack “cowardly”, expressing grief over the loss of lives. He said, “Targeting worshippers is an extremely cowardly, inhuman and detestable act.” The minister added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had instructed that those responsible for the attack should be penalised. Tarar said the state was committed to protect the lives and properties of people, as well as mosques and imambargahs, and actions against miscreant would continue under a zero-tolerance policy. In a later post, he said that those behind the attack could not shake the resolve of the nation through fear and terror. “Until the complete annihilation of khwarijs — the enemies of Muslims and humanity — this nation will never be at peace,” he added. The bombing comes less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. Friday’s attack also occurred as Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev was in the federal capital on an official visit to Pakistan. Additional input from Mohammad Asghar",

In a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the prime minister directed him to complete the investigation of the incident and immediately identify the people responsible for it. He directed that “the injured be provided best medical facilities and the health minister will monitor” the situation, the statement quoted him as saying. “No one will be allowed to disseminate chaos and unrest in the country,” he said. In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said he was grateful for the messages of support and sympathy from across the globe. “The support of our friends and partners has always remained critical in Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts. The perpetrators of this heinous crime will be brought to justice with full force and their nefarious designs will never be allowed to succeed,” he said. “The brave Pakistani nation stands united at this time and we remain fully committed to our resolve to defeat terrorism, as we always have,” he said. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also condemned the “cowardly suicide attack on innocent worshippers during Friday prayers at a Shia imambargah in Islamabad, killing dozens”. “Targeting places of worship and civilians is a heinous crime against humanity and a blatant violation of Islamic principles,” he said. Dar further said, “Pakistan stands united against terrorism in all its forms. This barbarity will not intimidate us and extremists will be brought to full account.” In his condemnation, Information Attaullah Tarar termed the attack “cowardly”, expressing grief over the loss of lives. He said, “Targeting worshippers is an extremely cowardly, inhuman and detestable act.” The minister added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had instructed that those responsible for the attack should be penalised. Tarar said the state was committed to protect the lives and properties of people, as well as mosques and imambargahs, and actions against miscreant would continue under a zero-tolerance policy. In a later post, he said that those behind the attack could not shake the resolve of the nation through fear and terror. “Until the complete annihilation of khwarijs — the enemies of Muslims and humanity — this nation will never be at peace,” he added. The bombing comes less than three months after a suicide blast outside a district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on November 11, 2025. Twelve people were killed and more than 30 were injured in the blast. Friday’s attack also occurred as Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev was in the federal capital on an official visit to Pakistan. Additional input from Mohammad Asghar",

      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: At least 31 people were killed and another 169 were injured in a suicide bombing at an imambargah during Friday prayers, according to authorities. Police confirmed the number of casualties. The explosion occurred at Imambargah Khadijah-tul-Kubra in the Tarlai area of the federal capital. Images from the site showed bloodied bodies lying on the carpeted floor surrounded by shards of glass, debris, and panicked worshippers. Dozens more wounded were lying in the garden outside the imambargah as people called for help. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif suggested India’s and Afghanistan’s involvement in the attack, stating in a post on social media platform X that “it has been proved that the terrorist involved in the attack travelled to and from Afghanistan”. “The collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed,” he said. The defence minister said that security guards at the site of the incident had “challenged” the attacker, and in response, he opened fire. “He then blew himself up, standing in the last row of worshippers,” he said. Asif said that the state would respond to this “cruelty with full force”. “After a humiliating defeat, India is fighting a war through its proxies. It doesn’t have the courage to fight directly now,” he added. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath ’ later in the day, Asif said that the attack came as Pakistan signed landmark agreements with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and on the same day as the revival of Basant. “The timing, I believe, is an effort to sabotage us and our progress … India cannot engage in an all-out clash with Pakistan, so it is using proxies and Afghanistan to disrupt peace here,” he said. The defence minister said that the suicide bomber was a Pakistani national who had travelled to Afghanistan some time ago and undergone “extreme religious indoctrination”. He added that the bomber returned to Pakistan last year. ‘Attacker travelled to Afghanistan on several occasions’ Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry later told the media in Islamabad that while the attacker was not an Afghan, authorities had been able to determine through forensic tests the number of times he had travelled to Afghanistan. At the outset of his media talk, he said rescue teams from various departments began reaching the site of the incident within 10-12 minutes of the blast. Regarding the attacker, he said: “Information has been obtained about the terrorist who carried out the suicide attack. He is not an Afghan national, but we have information about the number of times he travelled to Afghanistan after the forensics of his remains.” Chaudhry added that a similar pattern was seen in terror incidents in the country, adding that attacks were either carried out “in the name of religion or on the pretext of … linguistic and provincial [differences].” In connection with the latter, he particularly mentioned the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). “They had planned a week ago that they would give a surprise in Balochistan, but they had to pay a heavy price for it and suffered losses. “These terrorists have reached the extremes of cowardliness. They are attacking soft targets, including markets, schools, mosques, imambargahs, banks and other such places,” he added. The state minister also said that a first cousin of the Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi had died in the blast. “All of them are our brothers. Irrespective of any sect, they all are Pakistanis,” he said, adding: “We are resolute and determined that the implementation of the National Action Plan will continue [in the fight against terrorism]. There is no doubt or leniency on this.” Chaudhry also said that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had visited the imambargah that was targeted in the attack and collected relevant information. He said that Pakistan had shared evidence with the rest of the world, including its neighbouring countries, that terrorism in Pakistan was sponsored by India. “We have proof that India has tripled its investment into this. They (terrorists) are not carrying out attacks for religion, but for dollars … Whether they belong to the BLA, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan or any other group, they are paid in dollars,” he added. The minister further stated that Islamabad had repeatedly urged Afghanistan not to provide space to terrorists and not to become India’s proxy. “These proxies will meet the same fate as India did in May [last year],” he added. Speaking about today’s attack, he said “Everything is being monitored at the highest level … But a lot of information cannot be shared at this point because it is important to reach those who were behind them (attacker). And within 72 hours, we will share a detailed report, including information about their handlers.” When asked whether the incident was also not a failure of the authorities and the state in protecting the public, Chaudhry replied: “This is not a failure … We are a frontline state that is protecting the world. And they are attacking us as they just want to weaken the wall that is Pakistan. If this wall weakens, this fire is not going to stop at our border … We are a responsible state and we are going to fulfil our responsibility. We are going to win this war, and we are winning this war.” Earlier, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that “India is behind” the incident. Speaking to the media at Polyclinic Hospital in Islamabad, he expressed the resolve to eliminate terrorism from Pakistan. The minister further said that Pakistan had always promoted peace and wanted peace in the region. But, he added, Pakistan’s neighbours had been involved in terror activities in the country. In this connection, the minister particularly mentioned India, saying that it was involved in “terrorism activities in Balochistan, Fata and in the incident that took place in Islamabad today”. “We have exposed them to the world,” he said, adding that the nation was united against such “cowardly acts and enemies”. “The fight against them (terrorists) will continue until they are eliminated,” he expressed resolve. The minister said the injured and the dead had been taken to Pims and Polyclinic Hospital, and emergencies had been declared in hospitals across Islamabad. Meanwhile, the district administration spokesperson said the site of the blast had been sealed off by security personnel, and added that assistant commissioners were assigned to oversee the treatment of the injured at various hospitals. Security personnel stand guard outside an imambargah following an explosion, in Islamabad on February 6, 2026. —AFP Pindi police on high alert; Punjab CM dispatches ambulances In view of the prevailing security situation, Rawalpindi police were placed on high-alert, according to a statement by the police spokesperson. “Security duties are being checked and [officials are being] briefed at imambargahs, mosques and other places across the city,” the statement read. According to the statement, the police officials held meetings with the administrators and the guardians of the religious places and informed them about security standard operating procedures and the measures taken in this regard. The Islamabad Bar Association also called for a day of mourning on Saturday. A notice issued by the association said that it strongly condemned the suicide blast and expressed deep sorrow over the lives lost. The association demanded that authorities conduct an immediate investigation into this incident and bring those involved to justice. The lawyer’s body announced a day of mourning and strike for February 7 (tomorrow), saying that lawyers would not appear in court. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, in a post on X, said the provincial government had dispatched 25 ambulances to Islamabad. She added that all hospitals across Rawalpindi district had been placed on high alert with “surgical teams, anesthetists, orthopedic and neurosurgical specialists on standby”. “Blood banks are fully staffed, and operation theatres are fully equipped to ensure prompt and effective medical care for the injured.” Maryam added that the commissioner and deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi were also instructed to extend every possible assistance. She later said that she would be cancelling “all my Basant-related activities that were scheduled for tomorrow”. “The mega Basant show at the Liberty Square also stands cancelled,” she said. The chief minister said that it was imperative that the nation was united against “ the khwarji menace and their ‘sympathisers’, shows them no mercy, and stands shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces in defence of the country”. Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said the provincial government had decided to cancel the “musical segment of the cultural night planned in honour of the Commonwealth Parliamentarians Association”. “We share the pain of the bereaved families. The dinner will be held simply, without music, out of respect for the victims and our national grief,” he said. President, PM condemn blast Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari extended condolences to the victims who lost their lives in the blast, according to a statement issued by the PPP on X. He expressed grief over the incident, saying, “Targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity”. The president prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and directed that all possible medical facilities be provided to them. In a post on X later, he acknowledged the messages of support from around the world. “Such solidarity reinforces our shared stand against violence. Pakistan remains resolute in upholding peace, resilience & national unity,” he said. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the blast, according to a statement. He expressed grief over the deaths in the blast and expressed sympathy with the bereaved.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Friday extended the judicial remand of lawyer Imaan Zainab Hazir-Mazari and her husband Hadi Ali Chattha for another fortnight. The development came as ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra heard a case registered against the two under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act over their alleged involvement in a lawyers’ protest at Constitution Avenue. The couple was arrested last month while leaving the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in connection with the case. It is worth mentioning that the two have been sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a separate case pertaining to controversial social media posts. During the hearing, the prosecution submitted a notification dated February 5, citing the prevailing law and order situation that, according to authorities, made it difficult to physically produce the accused before the court. It subsequently requested the court to mark the suspects’ attendance via video link. Accepting the request, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra marked the attendance of both accused via video link from Adiala jail. Furthermore, the court extended the judicial remand of Imaan and Hadi for 14 days, directing jail authorities to ensure their virtual presence at the next hearing scheduled for February 19. Separately, the Islamabad High Court issued a two-page written order on a petition filed by Dr Shireen Mazari against the two lawyers being denied visitation rights following their conviction in a separate case. The petition was heard by Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, who noted in the written order that the couple had been sentenced on January 24, but, according to the petitioner, they were not being provided with the facility to meet their family members and lawyers after the sentence. However, the court observed that the petitioner had not “approached the relevant administrative forum regarding the matter”. The IHC converted the petition into an application and forwarded it to the Adiala jail superintendent, directing that the matter be decided “expeditiously in accordance with the law”. The high court further clarified that issues related to facilities provided to prisoners under prison rules must first be raised before the relevant administrative authorities, after which judicial proceedings may be initiated if required.",

      "title_orig": "Sindh IG says operation has been launched against riverine bandits",
      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said on Friday that, on the directives of the provincial government, an operation was launched against riverine bandits last month. Speaking at a press conference at the Central Police Office, the provincial police chief said since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters had taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested. Flanked by Sindh Additional Inspector General of Police Iqbal Dara, Odho said 123 bandits had also surrendered before law enforcers as part of the government’s policy. “These were not ordinary criminals,” he said. He further said that 15 people who had been kidnapped had been recovered safely. He lamented that some of the citizens rescued were in the custody of the bandits for up to three years. Way forward In an oblique reference to past operations against riverine bandits that failed to deliver desirable results, Odho said a comprehensive plan had been chalked out in which socio-economic aspects were also included as part of the government’s policy. He vowed to continue the operation until the “total annihilation” of crime in riverine areas. The Sindh police chief said the riverine areas where military-grade weapons were available would be de-weaponised. He said that under the plan, tribal feuds — which had remained nurseries for bandits in terms of provision of manpower and weapons — would be ended. He said that these tribal feuds were the outcome of “egos, attempts to occupy government lands and petty issues”. Some tribal chiefs had cooperated with the law enforcers for eliminating the criminals, he noted, adding that those who refused to do so would be taken to task. He further said that there would be “permanent presence” of police to prevent the reemergence of the criminals. He declared that a “riverine police unit” would be set up for this purpose. He claimed that recently hard-to-reach areas like Bagarji and Ranwati had been cleared of bandits, adding that notorious gangs were eliminated. He further said that there would be a “socio-economic development plan” for riverine areas. He hoped that with the completion of the Ghotki-Kandhkot bridge on the Indus River, law enforcers would get easy access to riverine areas. He hoped that this proposed bridge would help to eliminate criminals. Odho also said that roads, dispensaries and schools would be set up in these areas. For this purpose, certain non-governmental organisations in Karachi had pledged to help set up educational institutes in the riverine areas, he said. He said that with the help of oil and gas companies, socio-economic uplift projects were launched in Ghotki district in 2003. He noted that these projects benefited local communities and helped in eliminating criminals, particularly from the Chachar community. The police chief said that the riverine area was spread over 450 kilometres in the province. He said that out of this, 50-60km was where bandits had established their hideouts. The police faced two challenges there, he said. “The presence of a significant quantity of water with fertile lands and islands, and the area’s proximity to border areas of other provinces like Punjab,” Odho added. Referring to his recent talk with the newly-appointed Punjab police chief, who also belongs to Nawabshah, Odho said, the two had decided to further strengthen cooperation and joint operations in bordering areas. “An air surveillance unit would also be set up for surveillance of the areas with the help of drones,” he added. In response to a question about the alleged political patronisation of the bandits in areas, Odho said that certain individuals may support criminals due to caste, kinship, or land disputes in their individual capacity. However, he said that the government had given law enforcers a free hand, adding that they were not facing any pressure. Odho said that with the launch of recent operations in Balochistan and the “improvement of the situation in the province”, he hoped that the “flow of sophisticated weapons” to riverine areas would end. “The leakages in de-weaponising the areas will be addressed with the help of the federal government,” he said. The Sindh IG said around 150,000 people were living in riverine areas, adding that the Sindh government had decided to “rehabilitate them”. He further said that if needed, they would be provided state land to sustain their livelihoods. Crime in Karachi During the press talk, the Sindh police chief said that another major challenge for the law enforcers was street crime in Karachi. He said that there was a time when organised crime and terrorism prevailed in the metropolis, saying that there were “no-go areas” and police did not even “dare to go there”. “Peace was restored in the provincial capital following the sacrifices of over 1,100 police officials,” he said. He noted that crime had not been eliminated from Karachi, but said that the “numbers have declined”. He vowed to further improve the situation in the metropolis.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that ties between Pakistan and Uzbekistan from now onwards would be measured by trade flows, investment projects, industrial partnerships and people-to-people exchanges, Radio Pakistan reported. According to the report, he made the remarks while addressing the Pakistan-Uzbekistan Business Forum in Islamabad alongside Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is in Islamabad on an official visit. In his remarks, the premier said that it was in this spirit that both countries had set an “ambitious yet easily achievable target of increasing our bilateral trade to $2 billion”, the report said. He said the two countries had also signed a protocol, which would lead to the constitution of a working group to draft a five-year roadmap in order to promote trade, investment, and joint collaboration in research and development, information technology and agriculture, it added. PM Shehbaz also said that tourism was another area in which both countries could benefit from each other’s experience. “He expressed the confidence that business-to-business memoranda of understanding worth $3.4bn are going to materialise,” the report said. The premier also stated that Pakistan considered Uzbekistan not only a partner but a gateway to Central Asia with great potential for joint ventures with Pakistani entrepreneurs, it added. Meanwhile, the visiting dignitary urged the business communities of both countries to come forward to tap the full trade potential between Pakistan and Uzbekistan. “He assured a ten-year tax exemption to Pakistani businesses in addition to all possible facilitation. The Uzbek president emphasised that both countries have a great trade potential in diverse areas,” the report said. ‘Pakistan committed to boosting ties with Uzbekistan in diverse fields’ Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari said that Pakistan was committed to elevating bilateral relations with Uzbekistan to “new heights” through closer cooperation in connectivity, trade and people-to-people contacts, according to a separate report by Radio Pakistan . According to the report, President Zardari met with Uzbekistan President Mirziyoyev and expressed the confidence that the visit would prove “productive and forward-looking”. “President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with Uzbekistan to further strengthen cooperation in trade, connectivity, defence, security, culture and heritage,” Radio Pakistan said. He noted that direct air links between the two countries had brought the people of the two countries closer and underscored the importance of regional connectivity initiatives, including the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project, while highlighting the need to address remaining challenges through collective efforts, the national radio broadcaster said. During the meeting, President Zardari highlighted the “steady growth in bilateral trade in recent years and underscored the need to realise the true economic potential of the relationship, with the shared objective of expanding trade to two billion dollars as agreed by the two sides,” the report said. “He also stressed the importance of enhancing people-to-people contacts, tourism cooperation and cultural exchanges, drawing on the rich historical and spiritual links between the two nations,” it added. President Zardari also expressed the need to extend collaboration and facilitation between the financial institutions, including banks, to support trade and investment flows, it added. Radio Pakistan quoted Uzbek President Mirziyoyev as saying that the country attached great importance to strengthening friendship and the strategic partnership with Pakistan. “He noted with satisfaction the steady growth in bilateral contacts at various levels, including the expansion of trade, an increase in joint ventures, and the implementation of cooperation projects in priority sectors of the economy,” it said. It added that President Mirziyoyev directed his concerned minister to coordinate with the Pakistani counterpart in this regard. “The Uzbek president emphasised the need to further expand practical cooperation through closer political dialogue, stronger trade, economic and investment ties, and more active business exchanges,” the state-run broadcaster said. It stated that President Mirziyoyev invited his Pakistani counterpart to pay an official visit to Uzbekistan. “He said two additional direct flights would be added between the two countries, taking the total number of weekly flights to six, to further facilitate people-to-people contacts, tourism and business exchanges,” it added. During the meetings, the two presidents also discussed the regional situation, including matters affecting peace, stability and security, it said. Later, President Zardari conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan on President Mirziyoyev in recognition of his contribution to strengthening Pakistan-Uzbekistan relations, the report added. Joint communique underscores commitment to connectivity, cooperation Separately, Pakistan and Uzbekistan underscored their commitment to further deepen bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in a joint declaration, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday. The joint declaration, signed by Mirziyoyev and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said that the leaders held comprehensive and in-depth discussions covering the full spectrum of bilateral relations between the two countries. “The two sides reaffirmed their strong resolve to comprehensively develop and strengthen cooperation in order to support each other’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, while advancing sustainable development aligned with the long-term national interests of the people of both states,” the declaration read. The two sides also exchanged views on key issues, such as regional peace and security, connectivity and trade, and expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation developed over the last 34 years, since the establishment of their diplomatic relations. The declaration noted that these relations were “firmly anchored in longstanding bonds of friendship, as well as deep historical, cultural and spiritual affinities between the two nations”. According to the joint statement, both nations underscored their commitment to deepen bilateral ties and elevate cooperation “to a qualitatively new level that advances the core interests of both nations”, it said. The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the joint declaration signed after PM Shehbaz’s visit to Uzbekistan in February 2025, noting that the roadmap for the implementation of the decisions reached during that visit provided a blueprint for further deepening bilateral relations in multiple areas of cooperation. PM Shehbaz and President Mirziyoyev regarded the decision to establish a High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) during last year’s visit as a significant milestone. “This mechanism provides close guidance and monitoring of the top leadership on bilateral cooperation,” the declaration stated. They welcomed the inaugural meeting of the HLSCC during Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan, wherein the two leaders “reached important decisions on furthering bilateral cooperation”. The leaders also commended the work of the Joint Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation between Uzbekistan and Pakistan in promoting trade and commerce between the two countries. “They noted with satisfaction the conduct of the 10th session of the IGC, held in Islamabad on Feb 2, and hoped to achieve the targets set therein in the stated timeframe,” the statement said. Further, they welcomed the signing of the framework agreement of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in July 2025, and noted the significance of connectivity as a means of regional integration, transit trade and socio-economic development in the region. The two sides reiterated their commitment to enhancing regional connectivity and acknowledged the importance of this cooperation in promoting efficient, reliable, and cost-effective transport links, thereby contributing to deeper economic integration and strengthened bilateral and regional trade relations, according to the declaration. To this end, they expressed their commitment to take measures necessary for the early operationalisation of an MoU on Multimodal Transport that was signed in September 2024. Pakistan also reaffirmed its readiness to provide access to its seaports for Uzbek transit cargo and to make available its road network of international standards to support Uzbek trade and transit requirements, the declaration said. The leaders acknowledged the fact that Uzbekistan was the first country in Central Asia with which Pakistan had signed a Transit Trade Agreement as well as a Preferential Trade Agreement. They welcomed the growing volume of trade and commerce between the two countries. They also reiterated their commitment towards achieving a $2 billion bilateral trade target by 2029. The sides agreed to establish a joint management of economic or industrial zones in each country in order to create favourable conditions for developing industrial cooperation between the two countries, aimed primarily at exporting finished products to third countries, the declaration added. “Noting the important role of interregional dialogue in promoting trade and economic cooperation, unlocking new opportunities and identifying new areas of growth for collaboration, the two leaders welcomed the signing of the framework agreement establishing the Inter-Regional Forum. The sides agreed to hold the first forum of regions of the two countries in the Republic of Uzbekistan in 2026 at mutually agreed dates,” it said. According to the statement, both leaders expressed their satisfaction on the progress made by both sides for completing phase-II of expansion of the PTA, signing the Bilateral Investment Treaty and agreeing to explore the possibility of signing an agreement on aligning SPS measures and mutual recognition of standards to help Joint Ventures in pharmaceuticals, textile, leather industries, agriculture, minerals and engineering goods, and enhancing e-commerce cooperation. They also emphasised the need to further diversify trade corridors between Uzbekistan and Pakistan to amend the existing Intergovernmental Agreement on Transit Trade for this purpose, it said. In addition, both countries expressed their readiness to maintain regular dialogue and build constructive cooperation in the area of security and defence. They expressed satisfaction at the level of defence cooperation, welcoming the recent engagements between the two sides in this regard, including the staff talks and high-level exchanges, the declaration said. “In order to further promote cooperation in this area, they agreed to continue mutual participation in joint military exercises and training, and to cooperate in the field of professional development, exchange of best practices and collaboration between military institutions of the two countries.” Additionally, they reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations (UN) Charter and its purposes and principles. They pledged to consider each other’s initiatives favourably at multilateral fora. “They underlined that sustained dialogue and peaceful engagement in accordance with the UN Charter, General Assembly and Security Council Resolutions remain essential for addressing longstanding issues and disputes, and advancing peace, stability and prosperity in South and Central Asia,” the declaration added. Further, the countries agreed to extend favourable consideration to each other’s upcoming candidatures for various positions within international organisations, particularly at the UN. Uzbekistan commended Pakistan on its contributions to advancing peace and security as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the term 2025-2026, and congratulated Pakistan on its successful presidency of the UNSC during June 2025. Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz congratulated the Uzbek president on the successful hosting of the 43rd session of the Unesco General Conference in Samarkand in 2025. The declaration added that Uzbekistan expressed “full support” for Pakistan to work as the rotating chairman of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) for 2026-2027. It also congratulated Pakistan on assuming the chairmanships of the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) of the SCO for the term 2025-2026, and the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) for the term 2026-2027. “In addition, the Pakistan side noted its regular participation in the meetings of working groups on Uzbekistan’s accession to the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and its support for Uzbekistan’s early accession to the organisation,” it said. Pakistan and Uzbekistan underlined the significance of peace and stability in Afghanistan as being “key to lasting regional peace, stability and prosperity in general and the successful implementation of the UAP Railway Project in particular”. “The two leaders called on Afghanistan to address the threats of terrorism, and to take immediate and concrete actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country,” the declaration said. They also reaffirmed the importance of their constructive roles in promoting peace, stability, and just resolution of global conflicts, including expressing their support for the people of Palestine and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The two sides underscored that the talks held during the visit and the bilateral documents signed will serve to further strengthen the strategic partnership between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Republic of Uzbekistan, the statement added. According to the declaration, Mirziyoyev invited PM Shehbaz to visit Uzbekistan “at a convenient time in order to further develop comprehensive cooperation”. “Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif kindly accepted the invitation,” it said.",

      "summary": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that ties between Pakistan and Uzbekistan from now onwards would be measured by trade flows, investment projects, industrial partnerships and people-to-people exchanges, Radio Pakistan reported. According to the report, he made the remarks while addressing the Pakistan-Uzbekistan Business Forum in Islamabad alongside Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who is in Islamabad on an official visit. In his remarks, the premier said that it was in this spirit that both countries had set an “ambitious yet easily achievable target of increasing our bilateral trade to $2 billion”, the report said. He said the two countries had also signed a protocol, which would lead to the constitution of a working group to draft a five-year roadmap in order to promote trade, investment, and joint collaboration in research and development, information technology and agriculture, it added. PM Shehbaz also said that tourism was another area in which both countries could benefit from each other’s experience. “He expressed the confidence that business-to-business memoranda of understanding worth $3.4bn are going to materialise,” the report said. The premier also stated that Pakistan considered Uzbekistan not only a partner but a gateway to Central Asia with great potential for joint ventures with Pakistani entrepreneurs, it added. Meanwhile, the visiting dignitary urged the business communities of both countries to come forward to tap the full trade potential between Pakistan and Uzbekistan. “He assured a ten-year tax exemption to Pakistani businesses in addition to all possible facilitation. The Uzbek president emphasised that both countries have a great trade potential in diverse areas,” the report said. ‘Pakistan committed to boosting ties with Uzbekistan in diverse fields’ Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari said that Pakistan was committed to elevating bilateral relations with Uzbekistan to “new heights” through closer cooperation in connectivity, trade and people-to-people contacts, according to a separate report by Radio Pakistan . According to the report, President Zardari met with Uzbekistan President Mirziyoyev and expressed the confidence that the visit would prove “productive and forward-looking”. “President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with Uzbekistan to further strengthen cooperation in trade, connectivity, defence, security, culture and heritage,” Radio Pakistan said. He noted that direct air links between the two countries had brought the people of the two countries closer and underscored the importance of regional connectivity initiatives, including the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project, while highlighting the need to address remaining challenges through collective efforts, the national radio broadcaster said. During the meeting, President Zardari highlighted the “steady growth in bilateral trade in recent years and underscored the need to realise the true economic potential of the relationship, with the shared objective of expanding trade to two billion dollars as agreed by the two sides,” the report said. “He also stressed the importance of enhancing people-to-people contacts, tourism cooperation and cultural exchanges, drawing on the rich historical and spiritual links between the two nations,” it added. President Zardari also expressed the need to extend collaboration and facilitation between the financial institutions, including banks, to support trade and investment flows, it added. Radio Pakistan quoted Uzbek President Mirziyoyev as saying that the country attached great importance to strengthening friendship and the strategic partnership with Pakistan. “He noted with satisfaction the steady growth in bilateral contacts at various levels, including the expansion of trade, an increase in joint ventures, and the implementation of cooperation projects in priority sectors of the economy,” it said. It added that President Mirziyoyev directed his concerned minister to coordinate with the Pakistani counterpart in this regard. “The Uzbek president emphasised the need to further expand practical cooperation through closer political dialogue, stronger trade, economic and investment ties, and more active business exchanges,” the state-run broadcaster said. It stated that President Mirziyoyev invited his Pakistani counterpart to pay an official visit to Uzbekistan. “He said two additional direct flights would be added between the two countries, taking the total number of weekly flights to six, to further facilitate people-to-people contacts, tourism and business exchanges,” it added. During the meetings, the two presidents also discussed the regional situation, including matters affecting peace, stability and security, it said. Later, President Zardari conferred the Nishan-i-Pakistan on President Mirziyoyev in recognition of his contribution to strengthening Pakistan-Uzbekistan relations, the report added. Joint communique underscores commitment to connectivity, cooperation Separately, Pakistan and Uzbekistan underscored their commitment to further deepen bilateral ties and strengthen cooperation in a joint declaration, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Friday. The joint declaration, signed by Mirziyoyev and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said that the leaders held comprehensive and in-depth discussions covering the full spectrum of bilateral relations between the two countries. “The two sides reaffirmed their strong resolve to comprehensively develop and strengthen cooperation in order to support each other’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, while advancing sustainable development aligned with the long-term national interests of the people of both states,” the declaration read. The two sides also exchanged views on key issues, such as regional peace and security, connectivity and trade, and expressed satisfaction with the level of cooperation developed over the last 34 years, since the establishment of their diplomatic relations. The declaration noted that these relations were “firmly anchored in longstanding bonds of friendship, as well as deep historical, cultural and spiritual affinities between the two nations”. According to the joint statement, both nations underscored their commitment to deepen bilateral ties and elevate cooperation “to a qualitatively new level that advances the core interests of both nations”, it said. The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment to the joint declaration signed after PM Shehbaz’s visit to Uzbekistan in February 2025, noting that the roadmap for the implementation of the decisions reached during that visit provided a blueprint for further deepening bilateral relations in multiple areas of cooperation. PM Shehbaz and President Mirziyoyev regarded the decision to establish a High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) during last year’s visit as a significant milestone. “This mechanism provides close guidance and monitoring of the top leadership on bilateral cooperation,” the declaration stated. They welcomed the inaugural meeting of the HLSCC during Mirziyoyev’s visit to Pakistan, wherein the two leaders “reached important decisions on furthering bilateral cooperation”. The leaders also commended the work of the Joint Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation between Uzbekistan and Pakistan in promoting trade and commerce between the two countries. “They noted with satisfaction the conduct of the 10th session of the IGC, held in Islamabad on Feb 2, and hoped to achieve the targets set therein in the stated timeframe,” the statement said. Further, they welcomed the signing of the framework agreement of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in July 2025, and noted the significance of connectivity as a means of regional integration, transit trade and socio-economic development in the region. The two sides reiterated their commitment to enhancing regional connectivity and acknowledged the importance of this cooperation in promoting efficient, reliable, and cost-effective transport links, thereby contributing to deeper economic integration and strengthened bilateral and regional trade relations, according to the declaration. To this end, they expressed their commitment to take measures necessary for the early operationalisation of an MoU on Multimodal Transport that was signed in September 2024. Pakistan also reaffirmed its readiness to provide access to its seaports for Uzbek transit cargo and to make available its road network of international standards to support Uzbek trade and transit requirements, the declaration said. The leaders acknowledged the fact that Uzbekistan was the first country in Central Asia with which Pakistan had signed a Transit Trade Agreement as well as a Preferential Trade Agreement. They welcomed the growing volume of trade and commerce between the two countries. They also reiterated their commitment towards achieving a $2 billion bilateral trade target by 2029. The sides agreed to establish a joint management of economic or industrial zones in each country in order to create favourable conditions for developing industrial cooperation between the two countries, aimed primarily at exporting finished products to third countries, the declaration added. “Noting the important role of interregional dialogue in promoting trade and economic cooperation, unlocking new opportunities and identifying new areas of growth for collaboration, the two leaders welcomed the signing of the framework agreement establishing the Inter-Regional Forum. The sides agreed to hold the first forum of regions of the two countries in the Republic of Uzbekistan in 2026 at mutually agreed dates,” it said. According to the statement, both leaders expressed their satisfaction on the progress made by both sides for completing phase-II of expansion of the PTA, signing the Bilateral Investment Treaty and agreeing to explore the possibility of signing an agreement on aligning SPS measures and mutual recognition of standards to help Joint Ventures in pharmaceuticals, textile, leather industries, agriculture, minerals and engineering goods, and enhancing e-commerce cooperation. They also emphasised the need to further diversify trade corridors between Uzbekistan and Pakistan to amend the existing Intergovernmental Agreement on Transit Trade for this purpose, it said. In addition, both countries expressed their readiness to maintain regular dialogue and build constructive cooperation in the area of security and defence. They expressed satisfaction at the level of defence cooperation, welcoming the recent engagements between the two sides in this regard, including the staff talks and high-level exchanges, the declaration said. “In order to further promote cooperation in this area, they agreed to continue mutual participation in joint military exercises and training, and to cooperate in the field of professional development, exchange of best practices and collaboration between military institutions of the two countries.” Additionally, they reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations (UN) Charter and its purposes and principles.

In a post on X, the US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA) said it stood “steadfast with Pakistan” in the wake of the attacks, which it described as “horrific”. The bureau noted that the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) remains a designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO). In August last year, the US State Department added the BLA and its alias, the Majeed Brigade, to its FTO list, according to a press release . FTO designations are made by the secretary of state, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”. “We support efforts to hold the perpetrators of these horrific attacks accountable,” the SCA added. Earlier on Thursday, security forces concluded “ Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in Balochistan, killing a total of 216 terrorists in days-long clearance operations, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). The military’s media wing said the operation was launched following a spate of coordinated attacks across the province on January 31, which disrupted normal life in several areas. The ISPR said the intelligence-based operations targeted what it described as Indian-sponsored terrorist elements. According to the ISPR, 36 civilians, including women and children, were killed during the violence, while 22 security forces and law enforcement personnel also lost their lives. It added that a substantial cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was recovered during the operations. The attacks have also drawn condemnation from the United Nations, with UN officials earlier expressing concern over the violence and stressing the need to hold those responsible accountable.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed 24 terrorists in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) released on Friday. “On 4-5 February 2026, twenty four khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,” said the statement from the military’s media wing. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Two intelligence-based operations were conducted in the province’s Orakzai and Khyber districts. During the operation conducted in Orakzai district, troops engaged the terrorists and killed 14. While in Khyber, during the conduct of another IBO, security forces killed 10 terrorists. “On reported presence of khwarij, an intelligence-based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Orakzai District. During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen khwarij were sent to hell,” said the ISPR, adding that “ten more khwarij were effectively neutralised” in Khyber. Following the engagements, security forces conducted sanitization operations in the areas “to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area”. The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism operation “under [the] vision [of] “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by Security Forces and Law Enforcement Agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”. Earlier in January, 11 terrorists were killed in two separate IBOs in KP. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. Despite record militant deaths , Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.",
