      "summary_orig": "When officials first arrived in villages near Qadirabad in 2014, they brought promises wrapped in the language of progress. The Sahiwal coal-fired power plant, they told residents, would be Pakistan’s flagship energy project — a 1,320 megawatt giant that would end electricity shortages and bring prosperity to central Punjab’s fertile heartland. They promised jobs, schools, hospitals and a brighter future. In Village 76-5R, the local member of the provincial assembly and member of the National Assembly told farmers this was a “once-in-a-generation opportunity”. China was investing billions in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), they said, and Sahiwal would be at its centre. There would be 3,700 construction jobs and 1,600 permanent positions. Technical training centres would teach youth valuable skills. Girls’ schools would be built. A hospital with seven to 10 beds would serve the community. Roads connecting villages to markets would be paved. The three most-affected villages would receive free electricity. What officials didn’t tell communities — what they conveniently left out — was that none of this would come to pass. What they didn’t say was that fertile fields, cultivated since the British built the Canal Colonies in the 1800s, would become a wasteland of coal ash and contaminated water. They didn’t mention that families would watch their children struggle to breathe, their orchards wither and their groundwater sink deeper into the earth year after year. Promised as a beacon of progress and development, the decade-old Sahiwal coal-fired power plant was meant not just to address Pakistan’s crushing energy shortages but to bring prosperity\nto Punjab’s heartland. Instead, its bright lights have darkened the lives of those who gave up\ntheir land for it, leading to displacement, disease, environmental disaster and despair… “ANOTHER 1947” Muhammad Siddique’s family had worked their six murabbas [one murabba is equivalent to 25 acres] of land for generations. “We had been cultivating this land since our grandfathers’ time,” he says, his voice breaking. “Suddenly, without any real consultation, it was taken from us.” The acquisition happened fast — too fast for most families to fathom what was happening. District officials didn’t come to negotiate. They came to inform. Through politically aligned local leaders, word spread that the land was being taken for a development project that would both serve the communities and the national interest by increasing energy production. When Siddique hesitated to accept the compensation — approximately Rs 2.07 million per acre for land worth far more — a district education official threatened him with disciplinary action. What the government did next was particularly cunning. Instead of negotiating with family patriarchs who controlled large holdings, they unilaterally processed hereditary divisions. Compensation checks were issued directly to individual heirs, including women. A female assistant commissioner was brought in specifically to encourage women to claim their shares. While this appeared progressive on paper, it served a backhanded purpose: it atomised large landholdings into hundreds of small claims, fracturing families and preventing unified resistance. Najam, another landowner, acknowledges bitterly that they’d failed to challenge the acquisition within the legal timeframe required by the Land Acquisition Act . By the time they mobilised, it was too late. When legal action was eventually pursued, it met a swift and decisive end. The Multan bench of the Lahore High Court dismissed the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant case, with the government’s point of view on such cases being that the land was acquired in the larger public interest, to keep the lights on nationally. According to a community elder, “This act illustrates a clear alignment of the judiciary with the executive’s interests and priorities. It left us with the widespread sentiment that institutional mechanisms were rigged against us, prioritising national-scale infrastructure over the rights and grievances of the citizens.” One villager describes the loss as “another 1947” — invoking the trauma of Partition, when millions were stripped of their homes and lands. The comparison isn’t hyperbolic. For farming families whose identity, livelihood and generational continuity were rooted in that soil, the displacement was indeed a rupture comparable to a historical catastrophe. The promise of jobs turned out to be perhaps the cruellest deception, if only because the plant jeopardised the existing farmland livelihoods. While officials claimed the plant would create thousands of positions, the reality is starkly different. Only 67 per cent of residents say the plant generated more than 50 jobs. A striking 27 per cent believed no jobs were created at all. A MANUFACTURED WASTELAND Walking through Village 76-5R, one hears the same refrain: “Not a single promise was fulfilled.” Before the plant, farmers in the area relied on three moghas [canal water outlets] for irrigation. Now, only one functions. The Irrigation Department shut down the other two to divert water to the coal plant’s massive cooling systems. Despite repeated complaints to the executive engineer of the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC), nothing has been done. The numbers tell a grim tale. Groundwater levels have plummeted from an average depth of 68 feet to 172 feet. In Village 62-4R, the worst-affected area, water that once flowed at 100 feet now requires drilling to 250 feet. Over 80 percent of surveyed residents reported deteriorating water quality. The water that remains is often contaminated, unfit for drinking or irrigation. Farmers have been forced to turn to expensive tube wells powered by diesel or solar. Muhammad from Village 75-5R calculated that his irrigation costs have tripled. “We tried to build our own mogha through collective effort,” he says, “but without departmental approval, it remains non-functional. They’ve left us to fend for ourselves.” Furthermore, the air quality deterioration in the neighbourhoods around the plant is too palpable to ignore. When asked about environmental changes, 89 percent of residents say the air has grown noticeably worse since the plant began operations. “Black soot settles over clothes left outside overnight, especially during summer,” one woman shares. Rickshaw drivers state that winter air has become increasingly polluted, making it difficult to breathe — a problem they never experienced before. One elderly resident of Village 64-5L put it simply: “This has been the hottest summer I’ve experienced in 40 years.” Coal dust from the plant’s open-air storage and transportation doesn’t just pollute the air, it coats crops, blocking sunlight and disrupting growth cycles. The 4.4 million tonnes of imported coal arriving annually from Indonesia, South Africa and Australia leaves its mark on every surface, every lung and every leaf. As per our findings, the health crisis is perhaps the most heartbreaking reality. Local clinics report that respiratory illnesses now dominate their workload, accounting for 47 per cent of all cases. Chronic coughing, shortness of breath, asthma and lung infections have become endemic in villages surrounding the plant. A doctor in Village 76-5R couldn’t have put it more plainly: “We are seeing more patients with lung issues than ever before.” But it’s not just respiratory problems. Eye irritation, recurring fevers, skin allergies, hepatitis, liver dysfunction — the catalogue of ailments grows longer each year. According to the doctor, there have even been “unexplained sudden deaths.” The crisis extends beyond humans. A veterinarian notes rising livestock illnesses, particularly among buffaloes. A farmer from 76-5R explains: “Foot-and-mouth disease has increased dramatically since the plant was built. Our animals drool, stop eating fodder and their milk production decreases. We don’t know if it’s the air or the water, but this situation didn’t exist before.” Community members say the villages, in what was once known as Punjab’s ‘fruit basket’, is dying. Orchards that produced abundant guava and black plums for generations are withering. “The trees don’t grow like before, and fruits have disappeared,” farmers state repeatedly. Vegetables such as bitter gourd, pumpkin and onions — once commonly grown — are now difficult to cultivate. Even wheat yields are declining. Ali, a lawyer from Village 76-5R, has become one of the plant’s most vocal critics. He has documented his dying orchards through videos on TikTok and Facebook, showing guava trees that failed to survive despite repeated replanting efforts. Several of his videos were later removed from both platforms without explanation — an act he believes was intended to silence dissent. The plant generates approximately 3,000 kilogrammes of coal ash daily. This waste contaminates both land and water. Wastewater from the plant is channelled through pipelines into the Ravi River via the Seem Nala drainage channel. Farmers such as Siddique report that this polluted water, when reused for agriculture through solar-powered pumps, damages soil fertility and reduces crop productivity. A rather alarming number of farmers say that agricultural productivity has declined. The ash that settles on fields chokes crops and diminishes fertility. Some farmers even point to the plant’s intense floodlights as an additional factor disrupting natural growth cycles.

While officials claimed the plant would create thousands of positions, the reality is starkly different. Only 67 percent of residents say the plant generated more than 50 jobs. A striking 27 percent believed no jobs were created at all. Sunny Shah of Village 76 says, “Sepco [Southern Electric Power Company], one of the plant’s key contractors, pays local workers just Rs 25,000 per month. No one from my village earns more than that.” Most locals were hired only during construction. The few who secured operational jobs work as labourers, cooks or electricians — low-paid positions with no career advancement. High-paying technical and managerial positions went to Chinese staff or workers brought in from other cities. The promised technical training centre either doesn’t exist or remains irrelevant to local needs. Young people who expected career opportunities found themselves relegated to cleaning, construction support or cooking. The pay disparities are particularly galling. Some cooks reportedly earn up to Rs 100,000 per month — nearly four times more than plant labourers — mainly because they prepare food for Chinese staff. This creates not just economic inequality but social resentment. The disruption to local mobility has also been catastrophic. Before the plant’s construction, residents of Villages 75-4R, 76-5R and 77-5R could reach Yousafwala market — their lifeline for trade and supplies — in 10-15 minutes via a railway crossing. That crossing is now permanently closed. Today, the same trip requires a 12-15 kilometre detour through an incomplete road that adds six to eight extra km to their daily commute. Nearly a decade after construction began, the roadwork remains unfinished. What was once a routine journey has become a daily grind that increases transport costs, reduces productivity and weighs heavily on families. The alternate route, nestled between the railway line and the LBDC, has become dangerous. Residents report frequent incidents of robbery and snatching. Farmers and traders transporting goods have become routine targets. With poor lighting and no security, the road has turned into a corridor of fear, especially at dusk and dawn. Meanwhile, the Yousafwala railway station — though close by — remains inaccessible to locals. It has been configured exclusively for the plant’s coal logistics, reinforcing the bitter reality that infrastructure now serves coal, not communities. UNKEPT PROMISES Of the many promises made by the authorities as listed below, few have come to fruition. Promised: Higher secondary schools for boys and girls. Delivered: Nothing. The existing high school was supposed to be upgraded. Ten years later, it hasn’t been. Promised : A seven to 10-bed hospital. Delivered: Nothing. Villagers must travel hours to Sahiwal city for medical care. Promised: Improved roads connecting villages to markets and highways. Delivered: Incomplete, dangerous routes that have worsened mobility. Promised: Free electricity to the three most-affected villages. Delivered: Nothing. The irony of living in darkness beside a power plant is not lost on anyone. Promised : Technical training centre for the youth. Delivered: Either non-existent or irrelevant to community needs. Promised: Clean water schemes. Delivered : Nothing. Water quality has deteriorated and groundwater continues to deplete. Promised: Improvements to irrigation and sewerage. Delivered: Nothing. Canal outlets were shut down and no sewerage improvements were made. Even the symbolic gestures ring hollow. A girls’ school was established within the plant premises, but it remains inaccessible to the local community. It’s widely seen as a box-ticking exercise in corporate social responsibility rather than genuine investment in local education.

Residents of Villages 75-5R, 76-5R and 77-5R report frequent visits from police and elite force personnel who check national identity cards — including those of guests — and enter homes without notice or female officers present. The absence of female constables during searches violates cultural norms and leaves families feeling vulnerable and humiliated. Women in Village 76-5R repeatedly requested that Yousafwala police station provide female officers during inspections. Their appeals were consistently ignored. The plant’s private security teams enter villages in convoys at least once a month. Surveillance cameras around the plant trigger alerts whenever villagers approach the boundary wall, prompting rapid deployment of elite police — even when there’s no threat. “It’s as if our voices don’t matter,” one villager says. “They treat us like criminals in our own homes.” The intimidation intensified after security incidents around the Diamer-Basha dam. Punjab’s special police unit and suspected military personnel were deployed in the area. Though the threat was unrelated to Sahiwal, it became justification for tightening control over the local population. ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT PIPEDREAM Time and again, the government or company officials, including the Chinese, have painted a rosy picture of the project. However, given the human and ecological cost of the project, it has turned out to be a pipedream, as is often the case with most development projects the state continues to pursue in isolation and at the cost of public interest. Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy (Pvt.) Limited is responsible for the operating of the Sahiwal power plant and is the Pakistani counterpart of the project’s Chinese patrons. We reached out to an official from Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy (Pvt.) Limited, who declined to comment on our questions regarding the promises that locals say were not fulfilled. Government officials were also contacted for their responses, but none were willing to come on the record for this Eos story. Two officials did, however, speak with us on the condition of anonymity. Sources in a government institution affiliated with the federal power ministry say that the social and economic situation in Pakistan when the Sahiwal coal power plant was envisioned was very different from what it is now. A highly placed official of the institution reveals, on the condition of anonymity, “Between 2013 and 2015, our biggest challenge was to keep the lights on. We were running all over the world, seeking investments in power plants that could help us overcome more than 12 hours of electricity outages every day and in every part of the country. We were more concerned about adding sufficient electricity to our system than being worried about the environment.” When asked why the government decided to set up a coal power plant in Sahiwal, the veritable food basket of the country, he says, “We needed a large power plant close to our biggest electricity load centres of Lahore and Faisalabad [which lie within a 150 kilometres radius from Sahiwal].” He explains that the plant could not be set up on the coast because “our transmission system was incapable of transmitting electricity efficiently and smoothly from the south” of the country to its centre. “Karachi’s coastline was dotted with several power projects and we knew that setting up another power plant there would totally choke our south to centre transmission system,” he says. One of his immediate subordinates acknowledges that, in today’s circumstances, the Sahiwal coal power plant would never have been built where it has been built. “Importing, transporting and burning coal for power generation has serious environmental costs,” he says. Though he emphasises that the machinery used in the Sahiwal coal power plant is based upon ‘super critical technology’ and thus, according to him, emits much less pollutants than other power plants, he understands why the communities living in its shadow should be worried. According to him, “Coal power plants all over the world are known to have serious impacts on water resources and air quality in their vicinity. That is why they are being phased out from most of the European countries and that is why the government should immediately pay heed if people in and around Sahiwal have any complaints about the plant.” But he also adds: “Pakistan does not have the luxury to phase out its coal power plants immediately, mainly because we don’t have the money required for that. Also, our coal power fleet is much smaller compared to the coal power fleets of India and China, both still getting more than 50 percent of their electricity from coal. So, even if we shut down our coal power plants tomorrow, we’ll still be feeling the climatic impacts of coal being burned in the power plants of our two big neighbours.” THE RESISTANCE On September 10, 2025, farmers gathered outside the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant for the Asia Day of Action Against Coal . Organised by the Pakistan Kissan Rabita Committee, in collaboration with the Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development, the protest highlighted coal’s impacts, such as increased flooding, erratic rainfall, heat waves and economic losses. Protesters rejected government and corporate narratives of ‘clean coal’ and ‘transition fuels’. Their message was clear: “There is no such thing as clean coal.” They called for a just, fully funded phase-out plan that safeguards workers, communities and the planet. But resistance comes at a cost. Several research participants shared accounts of being threatened when they tried to raise concerns. Villages such as 76-5R, 77-5R, and 75-4R remain under close surveillance. Police continue to question guests, conduct random ID checks and monitor daily life. When asked whether the plant should continue operating, 64.6 per cent of the local respondents opposed its continuation. Only 20.2 per cent supported keeping it running. Some respondents chose to remain silent about their views due to security concerns — a silence that speaks volumes. THE LARGER PICTURE When China, capitalising on its solar energy achievements, proposed a $62 billion investment package for CPEC, many Pakistanis held optimistic expectations for the development of a clean energy future. However, such hopes were dashed as CPEC’s $34 billion “clean energy portfolio” was substantially compromised by the incorporation of at least nine coal-fired power facilities. Consequently, CPEC’s operational projects continue to rely heavily on coal. Thirty-eight percent of the total generation capacity of active CPEC projects comes from coal, with wind and solar contributing only eight percent and hydro-electric power accounting for 54 per cent. This dependency persists despite coal’s severe public health impacts. Air pollution causes annually an estimated 128,000 deaths, with Pakistan home to three of the world’s most polluted cities. The Sahiwal plant isn’t just one failed development project — it’s a symptom of Pakistan’s broken development model. Constructed as part of CPEC’s $34 billion energy portfolio, it represents the contradiction at the heart of the China-Pakistan partnership: while the world moves away from coal, Pakistan has doubled down on it. The project has also been plagued by procurement scandals. A National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) fact-finding committee in 2024 uncovered serious irregularities: limited competition, inflated prices and procedural changes that restricted fair bidding. Coal was reportedly contracted at Rs 75,000 per tonne, while other industries paid Rs 45,000 rupees for comparable quality. Payment disputes have strained Pakistan-China relations. By mid-2024, the Sahiwal plant alone was owed Rs 87 billion. Chinese Independent Power Producers under CPEC face total overdue payments of Rs 500 billion. China has linked future investments to Pakistan’s ability to settle these dues. Moreover, the plant’s performance has deteriorated sharply. According to a 2024 report by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), energy output dropped from 7,500 GWh in 2021 to 2,000 GWh in 2024. Utilisation fell from 99 percent (2020-2022) to 41 percent. Capacity factors declined from 54-63 percent to just 19 per cent by 2024. THE WAY FORWARD Listening to farmers, doctors, lawyers, teachers and ordinary villagers, one comes away with the impression that their demand, their resistance, is not just clear but reasonable. However, local communities must strengthen their bargaining power by forming village-level committees or coalitions that represent farmers, women and the youth collectively in order to avoid fragmentation and ensure that their voices are heard in negotiations. Rather than relying on sporadic protests, communities should insist on formalised dialogue mechanisms with project operators and government departments, as structured engagement through public hearings, grievance committees and participatory monitoring can yield more sustained benefits. Where collective action becomes necessary, mobilisation should remain strategic, lawful and safety-conscious, avoiding confrontations that could invite repression. Legal aid groups can assist communities in filing cases on compensation disputes, land rights and environmental non-compliance. Communities should prioritise achievable demands that can bring immediate relief, including improved access to healthcare, provision of clean drinking water, restoration of canal water, reopening of the blocked bridge at Qadirabad, and employment guarantees for local youth. Focusing on such tangible needs proves more practical in the short term than solely pressing for the closure of the coal plant, which remains unlikely in the immediate future. Young people should harness social media, local networks and people assemblies’ gatherings to raise their voices and mobilise around shared concerns, while also drawing on lived experiences of village elders. Communities should convene an awami akath [a community meeting] or other collective forums to develop a unified stance, ensuring that village-wise demands are clearly documented and communicated to the authorities. Legal recourse should also be considered, even though approaching courts proves time-consuming and exhausting. Communities can seek help from civil society organisations, legal aid groups or sympathetic lawyers to navigate these processes and strengthen their chances of achieving justice. People should reach out to courts regarding remaining land issues and must not compromise on the impacts causing harm, such as water depletion, increased agricultural costs, health concerns, mobility challenges and business losses. They can invoke environmental laws and connect with the right people who will help them speak up and defend their rights. A FINAL WORD The elderly farmer Rana Ali Hassan’s orchard in Village 76-5 R is now dilapidated and filled with dying trees surrounded by air heavy with coal dust. “They called this development,” he says as he looks out over fields his grandfather had cultivated. “They said we were building Pakistan’s future. But whose future? Not ours. Not our children’s.” After a pause he says, “If development means destroying the land that feeds us, poisoning the air we breathe and stealing the water we need to survive — what kind of development is that?” There is no easy answer to this. But one thing is for certain: these countless stories of loss and betrayal demand more than sympathy. They demand justice. They demand accountability. They demand that we redefine what development means and for whom. Until that happens, the coal will keep burning, the ash will keep falling and communities will keep bearing costs they never agreed to pay. The megawatts will flow to distant cities, while the people who sacrificed their land, their health and their futures will remain in darkness. That is the real story of Sahiwal. Not a success story of energy security, but a tragedy of broken promises and betrayed communities. Not a model for development, but a warning of what happens when profit trumps people, when national interest erases local lives and when the costs of progress are borne by those who benefit least.

Some cooks reportedly earn up to Rs 100,000 per month — nearly four times more than plant labourers — mainly because they prepare food for Chinese staff. This creates not just economic inequality but social resentment. The disruption to local mobility has also been catastrophic. Before the plant’s construction, residents of Villages 75-4R, 76-5R and 77-5R could reach Yousafwala market — their lifeline for trade and supplies — in 10-15 minutes via a railway crossing. That crossing is now permanently closed. Today, the same trip requires a 12-15 kilometre detour through an incomplete road that adds six to eight extra km to their daily commute. Nearly a decade after construction began, the roadwork remains unfinished. What was once a routine journey has become a daily grind that increases transport costs, reduces productivity and weighs heavily on families. The alternate route, nestled between the railway line and the LBDC, has become dangerous. Residents report frequent incidents of robbery and snatching. Farmers and traders transporting goods have become routine targets. With poor lighting and no security, the road has turned into a corridor of fear, especially at dusk and dawn. Meanwhile, the Yousafwala railway station — though close by — remains inaccessible to locals. It has been configured exclusively for the plant’s coal logistics, reinforcing the bitter reality that infrastructure now serves coal, not communities. UNKEPT PROMISES Of the many promises made by the authorities as listed below, few have come to fruition. Promised: Higher secondary schools for boys and girls. Delivered: Nothing. The existing high school was supposed to be upgraded. Ten years later, it hasn’t been. Promised : A seven to 10-bed hospital. Delivered: Nothing. Villagers must travel hours to Sahiwal city for medical care. Promised: Improved roads connecting villages to markets and highways. Delivered: Incomplete, dangerous routes that have worsened mobility. Promised: Free electricity to the three most-affected villages. Delivered: Nothing. The irony of living in darkness beside a power plant is not lost on anyone. Promised : Technical training centre for the youth. Delivered: Either non-existent or irrelevant to community needs. Promised: Clean water schemes. Delivered : Nothing. Water quality has deteriorated and groundwater continues to deplete. Promised: Improvements to irrigation and sewerage. Delivered: Nothing. Canal outlets were shut down and no sewerage improvements were made. Even the symbolic gestures ring hollow. A girls’ school was established within the plant premises, but it remains inaccessible to the local community. It’s widely seen as a box-ticking exercise in corporate social responsibility rather than genuine investment in local education.

Residents of Villages 75-5R, 76-5R and 77-5R report frequent visits from police and elite force personnel who check national identity cards — including those of guests — and enter homes without notice or female officers present. The absence of female constables during searches violates cultural norms and leaves families feeling vulnerable and humiliated. Women in Village 76-5R repeatedly requested that Yousafwala police station provide female officers during inspections. Their appeals were consistently ignored. The plant’s private security teams enter villages in convoys at least once a month. Surveillance cameras around the plant trigger alerts whenever villagers approach the boundary wall, prompting rapid deployment of elite police — even when there’s no threat. “It’s as if our voices don’t matter,” one villager says. “They treat us like criminals in our own homes.” The intimidation intensified after security incidents around the Diamer-Basha dam. Punjab’s special police unit and suspected military personnel were deployed in the area. Though the threat was unrelated to Sahiwal, it became justification for tightening control over the local population. ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT PIPEDREAM Time and again, the government or company officials, including the Chinese, have painted a rosy picture of the project. However, given the human and ecological cost of the project, it has turned out to be a pipedream, as is often the case with most development projects the state continues to pursue in isolation and at the cost of public interest. Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy (Pvt.) Limited is responsible for the operating of the Sahiwal power plant and is the Pakistani counterpart of the project’s Chinese patrons. We reached out to an official from Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy (Pvt.) Limited, who declined to comment on our questions regarding the promises that locals say were not fulfilled. Government officials were also contacted for their responses, but none were willing to come on the record for this Eos story. Two officials did, however, speak with us on the condition of anonymity. Sources in a government institution affiliated with the federal power ministry say that the social and economic situation in Pakistan when the Sahiwal coal power plant was envisioned was very different from what it is now. A highly placed official of the institution reveals, on the condition of anonymity, “Between 2013 and 2015, our biggest challenge was to keep the lights on. We were running all over the world, seeking investments in power plants that could help us overcome more than 12 hours of electricity outages every day and in every part of the country. We were more concerned about adding sufficient electricity to our system than being worried about the environment.” When asked why the government decided to set up a coal power plant in Sahiwal, the veritable food basket of the country, he says, “We needed a large power plant close to our biggest electricity load centres of Lahore and Faisalabad [which lie within a 150 kilometres radius from Sahiwal].” He explains that the plant could not be set up on the coast because “our transmission system was incapable of transmitting electricity efficiently and smoothly from the south” of the country to its centre. “Karachi’s coastline was dotted with several power projects and we knew that setting up another power plant there would totally choke our south to centre transmission system,” he says. One of his immediate subordinates acknowledges that, in today’s circumstances, the Sahiwal coal power plant would never have been built where it has been built. “Importing, transporting and burning coal for power generation has serious environmental costs,” he says. Though he emphasises that the machinery used in the Sahiwal coal power plant is based upon ‘super critical technology’ and thus, according to him, emits much less pollutants than other power plants, he understands why the communities living in its shadow should be worried. According to him, “Coal power plants all over the world are known to have serious impacts on water resources and air quality in their vicinity. That is why they are being phased out from most of the European countries and that is why the government should immediately pay heed if people in and around Sahiwal have any complaints about the plant.” But he also adds: “Pakistan does not have the luxury to phase out its coal power plants immediately, mainly because we don’t have the money required for that. Also, our coal power fleet is much smaller compared to the coal power fleets of India and China, both still getting more than 50 percent of their electricity from coal. So, even if we shut down our coal power plants tomorrow, we’ll still be feeling the climatic impacts of coal being burned in the power plants of our two big neighbours.” THE RESISTANCE On September 10, 2025, farmers gathered outside the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant for the Asia Day of Action Against Coal . Organised by the Pakistan Kissan Rabita Committee, in collaboration with the Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development, the protest highlighted coal’s impacts, such as increased flooding, erratic rainfall, heat waves and economic losses. Protesters rejected government and corporate narratives of ‘clean coal’ and ‘transition fuels’. Their message was clear: “There is no such thing as clean coal.” They called for a just, fully funded phase-out plan that safeguards workers, communities and the planet. But resistance comes at a cost. Several research participants shared accounts of being threatened when they tried to raise concerns. Villages such as 76-5R, 77-5R, and 75-4R remain under close surveillance. Police continue to question guests, conduct random ID checks and monitor daily life. When asked whether the plant should continue operating, 64.6 per cent of the local respondents opposed its continuation. Only 20.2 per cent supported keeping it running. Some respondents chose to remain silent about their views due to security concerns — a silence that speaks volumes. THE LARGER PICTURE When China, capitalising on its solar energy achievements, proposed a $62 billion investment package for CPEC, many Pakistanis held optimistic expectations for the development of a clean energy future. However, such hopes were dashed as CPEC’s $34 billion “clean energy portfolio” was substantially compromised by the incorporation of at least nine coal-fired power facilities. Consequently, CPEC’s operational projects continue to rely heavily on coal. Thirty-eight percent of the total generation capacity of active CPEC projects comes from coal, with wind and solar contributing only eight percent and hydro-electric power accounting for 54 per cent. This dependency persists despite coal’s severe public health impacts. Air pollution causes annually an estimated 128,000 deaths, with Pakistan home to three of the world’s most polluted cities. The Sahiwal plant isn’t just one failed development project — it’s a symptom of Pakistan’s broken development model. Constructed as part of CPEC’s $34 billion energy portfolio, it represents the contradiction at the heart of the China-Pakistan partnership: while the world moves away from coal, Pakistan has doubled down on it. The project has also been plagued by procurement scandals. A National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) fact-finding committee in 2024 uncovered serious irregularities: limited competition, inflated prices and procedural changes that restricted fair bidding. Coal was reportedly contracted at Rs 75,000 per tonne, while other industries paid Rs 45,000 rupees for comparable quality. Payment disputes have strained Pakistan-China relations. By mid-2024, the Sahiwal plant alone was owed Rs 87 billion. Chinese Independent Power Producers under CPEC face total overdue payments of Rs 500 billion. China has linked future investments to Pakistan’s ability to settle these dues. Moreover, the plant’s performance has deteriorated sharply. According to a 2024 report by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), energy output dropped from 7,500 GWh in 2021 to 2,000 GWh in 2024. Utilisation fell from 99 percent (2020-2022) to 41 percent. Capacity factors declined from 54-63 percent to just 19 per cent by 2024. THE WAY FORWARD Listening to farmers, doctors, lawyers, teachers and ordinary villagers, one comes away with the impression that their demand, their resistance, is not just clear but reasonable. However, local communities must strengthen their bargaining power by forming village-level committees or coalitions that represent farmers, women and the youth collectively in order to avoid fragmentation and ensure that their voices are heard in negotiations. Rather than relying on sporadic protests, communities should insist on formalised dialogue mechanisms with project operators and government departments, as structured engagement through public hearings, grievance committees and participatory monitoring can yield more sustained benefits. Where collective action becomes necessary, mobilisation should remain strategic, lawful and safety-conscious, avoiding confrontations that could invite repression. Legal aid groups can assist communities in filing cases on compensation disputes, land rights and environmental non-compliance. Communities should prioritise achievable demands that can bring immediate relief, including improved access to healthcare, provision of clean drinking water, restoration of canal water, reopening of the blocked bridge at Qadirabad, and employment guarantees for local youth. Focusing on such tangible needs proves more practical in the short term than solely pressing for the closure of the coal plant, which remains unlikely in the immediate future. Young people should harness social media, local networks and people assemblies’ gatherings to raise their voices and mobilise around shared concerns, while also drawing on lived experiences of village elders. Communities should convene an awami akath [a community meeting] or other collective forums to develop a unified stance, ensuring that village-wise demands are clearly documented and communicated to the authorities. Legal recourse should also be considered, even though approaching courts proves time-consuming and exhausting. Communities can seek help from civil society organisations, legal aid groups or sympathetic lawyers to navigate these processes and strengthen their chances of achieving justice. People should reach out to courts regarding remaining land issues and must not compromise on the impacts causing harm, such as water depletion, increased agricultural costs, health concerns, mobility challenges and business losses. They can invoke environmental laws and connect with the right people who will help them speak up and defend their rights. A FINAL WORD The elderly farmer Rana Ali Hassan’s orchard in Village 76-5 R is now dilapidated and filled with dying trees surrounded by air heavy with coal dust. “They called this development,” he says as he looks out over fields his grandfather had cultivated. “They said we were building Pakistan’s future. But whose future? Not ours. Not our children’s.” After a pause he says, “If development means destroying the land that feeds us, poisoning the air we breathe and stealing the water we need to survive — what kind of development is that?” There is no easy answer to this. But one thing is for certain: these countless stories of loss and betrayal demand more than sympathy. They demand justice. They demand accountability. They demand that we redefine what development means and for whom. Until that happens, the coal will keep burning, the ash will keep falling and communities will keep bearing costs they never agreed to pay. The megawatts will flow to distant cities, while the people who sacrificed their land, their health and their futures will remain in darkness. That is the real story of Sahiwal. Not a success story of energy security, but a tragedy of broken promises and betrayed communities. Not a model for development, but a warning of what happens when profit trumps people, when national interest erases local lives and when the costs of progress are borne by those who benefit least. Adapted from the study ‘Megawatts of Betrayal: Sahiwal’s Broken Social Contract’, undertaken by the independent public interest think tank Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development (PRIED). The study involved field research conducted in 12 villages surrounding the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant between June and September 2025, surveying nearly a 100 respondents, and holding focus group discussions with directly affected residents, farmers, teachers, lawyers and community leaders Hussain Assad is a researcher with an academic background in anthropology and political science Zahra Naeem has studied gender studies and anthropology, and has experience in gender activism, research and advocacy Published in Dawn, EOS, October 26th, 2025",
      "title": "SAHIWAL’S MEGAWATTS OF BETRAYAL",
      "summary": "When officials first arrived in villages near Qadirabad in 2014, they brought promises wrapped in the language of progress. The Sahiwal coal-fired power plant, they told residents, would be Pakistan’s flagship energy project — a 1,320 megawatt giant that would end electricity shortages and bring prosperity to central Punjab’s fertile heartland. They promised jobs, schools, hospitals and a brighter future. In Village 76-5R, the local member of the provincial assembly and member of the National Assembly told farmers this was a “once-in-a-generation opportunity”. China was investing billions in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), they said, and Sahiwal would be at its centre. There would be 3,700 construction jobs and 1,600 permanent positions. Technical training centres would teach youth valuable skills. Girls’ schools would be built. A hospital with seven to 10 beds would serve the community. Roads connecting villages to markets would be paved. The three most-affected villages would receive free electricity. What officials didn’t tell communities — what they conveniently left out — was that none of this would come to pass. What they didn’t say was that fertile fields, cultivated since the British built the Canal Colonies in the 1800s, would become a wasteland of coal ash and contaminated water. They didn’t mention that families would watch their children struggle to breathe, their orchards wither and their groundwater sink deeper into the earth year after year. Promised as a beacon of progress and development, the decade-old Sahiwal coal-fired power plant was meant not just to address Pakistan’s crushing energy shortages but to bring prosperity\nto Punjab’s heartland. Instead, its bright lights have darkened the lives of those who gave up\ntheir land for it, leading to displacement, disease, environmental disaster and despair… “ANOTHER 1947” Muhammad Siddique’s family had worked their six murabbas [one murabba is equivalent to 25 acres] of land for generations. “We had been cultivating this land since our grandfathers’ time,” he says, his voice breaking. “Suddenly, without any real consultation, it was taken from us.” The acquisition happened fast — too fast for most families to fathom what was happening. District officials didn’t come to negotiate. They came to inform. Through politically aligned local leaders, word spread that the land was being taken for a development project that would both serve the communities and the national interest by increasing energy production. When Siddique hesitated to accept the compensation — approximately Rs 2.07 million per acre for land worth far more — a district education official threatened him with disciplinary action. What the government did next was particularly cunning. Instead of negotiating with family patriarchs who controlled large holdings, they unilaterally processed hereditary divisions. Compensation checks were issued directly to individual heirs, including women. A female assistant commissioner was brought in specifically to encourage women to claim their shares. While this appeared progressive on paper, it served a backhanded purpose: it atomised large landholdings into hundreds of small claims, fracturing families and preventing unified resistance. Najam, another landowner, acknowledges bitterly that they’d failed to challenge the acquisition within the legal timeframe required by the Land Acquisition Act . By the time they mobilised, it was too late. When legal action was eventually pursued, it met a swift and decisive end. The Multan bench of the Lahore High Court dismissed the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant case, with the government’s point of view on such cases being that the land was acquired in the larger public interest, to keep the lights on nationally. According to a community elder, “This act illustrates a clear alignment of the judiciary with the executive’s interests and priorities. It left us with the widespread sentiment that institutional mechanisms were rigged against us, prioritising national-scale infrastructure over the rights and grievances of the citizens.” One villager describes the loss as “another 1947” — invoking the trauma of Partition, when millions were stripped of their homes and lands. The comparison isn’t hyperbolic. For farming families whose identity, livelihood and generational continuity were rooted in that soil, the displacement was indeed a rupture comparable to a historical catastrophe. The promise of jobs turned out to be perhaps the cruellest deception, if only because the plant jeopardised the existing farmland livelihoods. While officials claimed the plant would create thousands of positions, the reality is starkly different. Only 67 per cent of residents say the plant generated more than 50 jobs. A striking 27 per cent believed no jobs were created at all. A MANUFACTURED WASTELAND Walking through Village 76-5R, one hears the same refrain: “Not a single promise was fulfilled.” Before the plant, farmers in the area relied on three moghas [canal water outlets] for irrigation. Now, only one functions. The Irrigation Department shut down the other two to divert water to the coal plant’s massive cooling systems. Despite repeated complaints to the executive engineer of the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC), nothing has been done. The numbers tell a grim tale. Groundwater levels have plummeted from an average depth of 68 feet to 172 feet. In Village 62-4R, the worst-affected area, water that once flowed at 100 feet now requires drilling to 250 feet. Over 80 percent of surveyed residents reported deteriorating water quality. The water that remains is often contaminated, unfit for drinking or irrigation. Farmers have been forced to turn to expensive tube wells powered by diesel or solar. Muhammad from Village 75-5R calculated that his irrigation costs have tripled. “We tried to build our own mogha through collective effort,” he says, “but without departmental approval, it remains non-functional. They’ve left us to fend for ourselves.” Furthermore, the air quality deterioration in the neighbourhoods around the plant is too palpable to ignore. When asked about environmental changes, 89 percent of residents say the air has grown noticeably worse since the plant began operations. “Black soot settles over clothes left outside overnight, especially during summer,” one woman shares. Rickshaw drivers state that winter air has become increasingly polluted, making it difficult to breathe — a problem they never experienced before. One elderly resident of Village 64-5L put it simply: “This has been the hottest summer I’ve experienced in 40 years.” Coal dust from the plant’s open-air storage and transportation doesn’t just pollute the air, it coats crops, blocking sunlight and disrupting growth cycles. The 4.4 million tonnes of imported coal arriving annually from Indonesia, South Africa and Australia leaves its mark on every surface, every lung and every leaf. As per our findings, the health crisis is perhaps the most heartbreaking reality. Local clinics report that respiratory illnesses now dominate their workload, accounting for 47 per cent of all cases. Chronic coughing, shortness of breath, asthma and lung infections have become endemic in villages surrounding the plant. A doctor in Village 76-5R couldn’t have put it more plainly: “We are seeing more patients with lung issues than ever before.” But it’s not just respiratory problems. Eye irritation, recurring fevers, skin allergies, hepatitis, liver dysfunction — the catalogue of ailments grows longer each year. According to the doctor, there have even been “unexplained sudden deaths.” The crisis extends beyond humans. A veterinarian notes rising livestock illnesses, particularly among buffaloes. A farmer from 76-5R explains: “Foot-and-mouth disease has increased dramatically since the plant was built. Our animals drool, stop eating fodder and their milk production decreases. We don’t know if it’s the air or the water, but this situation didn’t exist before.” Community members say the villages, in what was once known as Punjab’s ‘fruit basket’, is dying. Orchards that produced abundant guava and black plums for generations are withering. “The trees don’t grow like before, and fruits have disappeared,” farmers state repeatedly. Vegetables such as bitter gourd, pumpkin and onions — once commonly grown — are now difficult to cultivate. Even wheat yields are declining. Ali, a lawyer from Village 76-5R, has become one of the plant’s most vocal critics. He has documented his dying orchards through videos on TikTok and Facebook, showing guava trees that failed to survive despite repeated replanting efforts. Several of his videos were later removed from both platforms without explanation — an act he believes was intended to silence dissent. The plant generates approximately 3,000 kilogrammes of coal ash daily. This waste contaminates both land and water. Wastewater from the plant is channelled through pipelines into the Ravi River via the Seem Nala drainage channel. Farmers such as Siddique report that this polluted water, when reused for agriculture through solar-powered pumps, damages soil fertility and reduces crop productivity. A rather alarming number of farmers say that agricultural productivity has declined. The ash that settles on fields chokes crops and diminishes fertility. Some farmers even point to the plant’s intense floodlights as an additional factor disrupting natural growth cycles.

While officials claimed the plant would create thousands of positions, the reality is starkly different. Only 67 percent of residents say the plant generated more than 50 jobs. A striking 27 percent believed no jobs were created at all. Sunny Shah of Village 76 says, “Sepco [Southern Electric Power Company], one of the plant’s key contractors, pays local workers just Rs 25,000 per month. No one from my village earns more than that.” Most locals were hired only during construction. The few who secured operational jobs work as labourers, cooks or electricians — low-paid positions with no career advancement. High-paying technical and managerial positions went to Chinese staff or workers brought in from other cities. The promised technical training centre either doesn’t exist or remains irrelevant to local needs. Young people who expected career opportunities found themselves relegated to cleaning, construction support or cooking. The pay disparities are particularly galling. Some cooks reportedly earn up to Rs 100,000 per month — nearly four times more than plant labourers — mainly because they prepare food for Chinese staff. This creates not just economic inequality but social resentment. The disruption to local mobility has also been catastrophic. Before the plant’s construction, residents of Villages 75-4R, 76-5R and 77-5R could reach Yousafwala market — their lifeline for trade and supplies — in 10-15 minutes via a railway crossing.

Utilisation fell from 99 percent (2020-2022) to 41 percent. Capacity factors declined from 54-63 percent to just 19 per cent by 2024. THE WAY FORWARD Listening to farmers, doctors, lawyers, teachers and ordinary villagers, one comes away with the impression that their demand, their resistance, is not just clear but reasonable. However, local communities must strengthen their bargaining power by forming village-level committees or coalitions that represent farmers, women and the youth collectively in order to avoid fragmentation and ensure that their voices are heard in negotiations. Rather than relying on sporadic protests, communities should insist on formalised dialogue mechanisms with project operators and government departments, as structured engagement through public hearings, grievance committees and participatory monitoring can yield more sustained benefits. Where collective action becomes necessary, mobilisation should remain strategic, lawful and safety-conscious, avoiding confrontations that could invite repression. Legal aid groups can assist communities in filing cases on compensation disputes, land rights and environmental non-compliance. Communities should prioritise achievable demands that can bring immediate relief, including improved access to healthcare, provision of clean drinking water, restoration of canal water, reopening of the blocked bridge at Qadirabad, and employment guarantees for local youth. Focusing on such tangible needs proves more practical in the short term than solely pressing for the closure of the coal plant, which remains unlikely in the immediate future. Young people should harness social media, local networks and people assemblies’ gatherings to raise their voices and mobilise around shared concerns, while also drawing on lived experiences of village elders. Communities should convene an awami akath [a community meeting] or other collective forums to develop a unified stance, ensuring that village-wise demands are clearly documented and communicated to the authorities. Legal recourse should also be considered, even though approaching courts proves time-consuming and exhausting. Communities can seek help from civil society organisations, legal aid groups or sympathetic lawyers to navigate these processes and strengthen their chances of achieving justice. People should reach out to courts regarding remaining land issues and must not compromise on the impacts causing harm, such as water depletion, increased agricultural costs, health concerns, mobility challenges and business losses. They can invoke environmental laws and connect with the right people who will help them speak up and defend their rights. A FINAL WORD The elderly farmer Rana Ali Hassan’s orchard in Village 76-5 R is now dilapidated and filled with dying trees surrounded by air heavy with coal dust. “They called this development,” he says as he looks out over fields his grandfather had cultivated. “They said we were building Pakistan’s future. But whose future? Not ours. Not our children’s.” After a pause he says, “If development means destroying the land that feeds us, poisoning the air we breathe and stealing the water we need to survive — what kind of development is that?” There is no easy answer to this. But one thing is for certain: these countless stories of loss and betrayal demand more than sympathy. They demand justice. They demand accountability. They demand that we redefine what development means and for whom. Until that happens, the coal will keep burning, the ash will keep falling and communities will keep bearing costs they never agreed to pay. The megawatts will flow to distant cities, while the people who sacrificed their land, their health and their futures will remain in darkness. That is the real story of Sahiwal. Not a success story of energy security, but a tragedy of broken promises and betrayed communities. Not a model for development, but a warning of what happens when profit trumps people, when national interest erases local lives and when the costs of progress are borne by those who benefit least. Adapted from the study ‘Megawatts of Betrayal: Sahiwal’s Broken Social Contract’, undertaken by the independent public interest think tank Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development (PRIED). The study involved field research conducted in 12 villages surrounding the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant between June and September 2025, surveying nearly a 100 respondents, and holding focus group discussions with directly affected residents, farmers, teachers, lawyers and community leaders Hussain Assad is a researcher with an academic background in anthropology and political science Zahra Naeem has studied gender studies and anthropology, and has experience in gender activism, research and advocacy Published in Dawn, EOS, October 26th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) laun­ched a strong verbal attack on the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)-led Sindh government on Saturday, accusing it of failing to curb street crimes in the metropolis, improve law and order, tackle corruption and address inflation and police excesses across the province. Addressing a press conference at the party’s city office, Insaf House, Karachi, Sindh chapter president Haleem Adil Sheikh said that state institutions in the province had “ceased to function effectively”. “Sindh is the land of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai and hospitality, but today, oppression and lawlessness prevail,” he lame­nted, holding the PPP government responsible for the province’s deteriorating situation. Citing a recent case of “pol­ice brutality,” he referred to the case of a young labourer, Irfan Baloch, who had come from Uch Sharif, Punjab, to Karachi for work, and was allegedly abduc­ted and tortured to death by the CIA police. Haleem Adil says over 50 citizens killed by robbers this year “No FIR has been registered yet,” he said, warning that if jus­t­ice was denied, it would pro­ve that “the police institution itself is complicit in this brutality.” Accompanied by PTI Sindh leaders Jamal Siddiqui, Farukh Khan and others, the PTI provincial chief also highlighted the alarming rise in street crimes in the metropolis. “In September alone, 199 cars, 3,698 motorcycles, and 1,542 mobile phones were snatched, while 51 citizens were killed resisting robberies this year,” he said. Mr Sheikh questioned why the authorities had failed to take action against the patrons of 72 dacoits who recently surrendered in Shikarpur’s Katcha area, noting that “no hostages had been recovered”. “The Katcha areas have tur­ned into no-go zones. Law and order in Sindh has collapsed, and police excesses are rampant,” he said. Referring to the Auditor General of Pakistan’s 2024-25 report , the PTI provincial chief said that “financial irregularities worth Rs836 billion” had been unearthed in Sindh government departments. “Seventeen years of PPP rule have pushed Sindh to the brink of destruction. Corruption has infested every institution,” he said. He said the citizens were being “crushed under rising inflation” and that “corruption” had become routine. “Flour, sugar, vegetables, pulses, ghee, electricity, and gas have all become unaffordable. People must break their silence, as remaining quiet now means abetting crime,” he warned. Mr Sheikh also deplored the dismal state of education and healthcare in Sindh, saying that “more than six million children are out of school,” hospitals lack basic facilities, and dengue cases are surging. He criticised the provincial government for “denying” citizens access to the Sehat Card and “exploiting” farmers who were not getting fair prices for their crops. He further alleged large-scale corruption in the Sindh Solar Energy Programme, which is a Rs28 billion World Bank-funded project. “Fake import documents were used, and the actual price of solar fans was $23.4 per unit, but the Sindh government contracted them for $151 per unit. On top of that, Rs127 million in fake tax claims were filed,” he claimed. Published in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "OTTAWA: The premier of Canada’s most populous province has again complicated the country’s delicate trade negotiations with the US, this time with a political ad targeting Americans that has drawn the ire of US President Donald Trump. The ad, commissioned by Doug Ford, Ontario’s outspoken Conservative premier who is sometimes compared to Trump, uses a snippet of Republican icon and former President Ronald Reagan saying that tariffs cause trade wars and economic disaster. Prime Minister Mark Carney, unlike Ford, has sought to lower the temperature with Trump since taking office in March and had hoped for a deal to eliminate US tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium imports. In March, Ford, who often sports a “ Canada is not for sale ” hat, threatened to implement a surcharge on energy going to several American states if the US moved ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminium. Ford later relented, and the White House claimed victory, saying he had backed down. Ford said in a Friday statement that after discussions with Carney, Ontario would pause the US advertising campaign on Monday so that trade talks could resume. But the disputed commercial will continue to air this weekend as the Toronto Blue Jays play in the first two games of the World Series, he added. Ford said the message has reached US audiences “at the highest levels.” Some analysts suggested that Ford’s ad was only a pretext for Trump’s outburst. Mr Trump doesn’t like to be confronted with the truth, said Asa McKercher, an expert in US-Canada politics at St. Francis Xavier University. He said that the ad is an accurate representation of Reagan’s views. “If I was Canada, I’d take that same ad also,” McKercher said that Ford has often used his aggressive and populist style to appeal to American audiences in appearances on conservative-leaning outlets like Fox News, but his latest ad may have misfired. The Canadian dollar weakened after Trump broke off trade talks, and Ontario is the province most impacted by auto and steel tariffs. When you use Ford’s attack-dog approach, there’s always a risk that you’re going to get smacked, McKercher said, adding it would be Carney who might need to make concessions to get Trump back to trade negotiations. Still, Ford’s approach attracted some unusual support from politicians on the other side of the political spectrum. Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew, who heads the left-leaning New Democratic Party in the province, posted a message for his “good friend Doug Ford,” calling on him to keep running the ads. Green Party leader Elizabeth May cheered “Go Doug Ford!” as she arrived at Parliament in Ottawa on Friday. Pollster Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, said Ford has acted “as the more pugilistic foil” when the prime minister has adopted a more conciliatory approach to Trump, noting that “it’s not a stance that generally hurts him (Ford).” In February, Ford handily won a rare third term as Ontario premier. Earlier this month, Ford said he confronted and threatened to beat up a suspected shoplifter at a Home Depot store, telling an audience at a Toronto club, Screw this, Im going after this guy.

      "summary_orig": "Recently, Pakistan went to war against Afghanistan. From the Afghan side, one began hearing the old trope that “Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires”. First of all, Pakistan is not an empire, and secondly, the trope is mostly a myth. In an August 2021 speech, delivered during the withdrawal of US military forces from Afghanistan, former US President Joe Biden said, “The events we’re seeing now are sadly proof that no amount of military force would ever deliver a stable, secure Afghanistan that is known in history as the graveyard of empires.” The researcher Alexander Hainy-Khaleeli wasn’t impressed. He wrote, “Biden labelling Afghanistan ‘the graveyard of empires’ is historically illiterate.” Truth is, the phrase has nothing to do with any grand historic narrative or fact. According to Hainy-Khaleeli, the phrase (in the context of Afghanistan) first appeared in a 2001 article written for the magazine Foreign Affairs by the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) former Pakistan Station Chief, Milton Bearden. The article was titled ‘Afghanistan: Graveyard of Empires’. There is scarce evidence of this phrase being used before Bearden’s article. In 2001, when US forces were readying themselves to invade Afghanistan to dislodge the Taliban regime and hunt down the Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden, Bearden cautioned the US government, claiming that major armies across history had tried to conquer Afghanistan but had run into trouble in their encounters with the unruly Afghan tribes. Bearden named the armies of the ancient Greek king Alexander, the ferocious Mongol warlord Genghis Khan, the British Empire and the Soviet Union that were all ‘defeated’ by the Afghans. The phrase ‘Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires’ is perpetuated by the Taliban as a way to mythologise the image of the ‘invincible’ Afghan, while non-Afghans use the trope as a way to rationalise defeat. But does this phrase make any historical sense? But according to Hainy-Khaleeli, “Bearden’s argument is utterly at odds with the realities of history.” Alexander and Genghis Khan not only conquered Afghanistan, their successors ruled it for centuries after them. The ‘graveyard’ narrative also overlooks the fact that many empires — such as the Achaemenids, Kushans, Mughals and others — successfully ruled large parts of Afghanistan for extended periods. Indeed, in the 19th century, British armies did suffer defeats in Afghanistan (after conquering Kabul), but this hardly dented the British Empire as a whole. The Empire remained one of the largest and most powerful in the world till its disintegration from the mid-1940s onwards. This was mainly due to the impact of World War II and the period of decolonisation that followed. Afghanistan had absolutely nothing to do with this. Yet, many military experts do agree that Afghanistan is a tough nut to crack. However, their views in this regard have little to do with the mostly romanticised and idealised notion of the ‘legendary fighting spirit of the Afghans’ that turns empires into dust. According to Patrick Porter, who teaches defence studies at Kings College in London, it is Afghanistan’s geography that makes it a tough country to conquer and keep. It is a country of mountains, deserts and severe winters that make it difficult not only to fight in but also to operate logistically. It limits mobility and it is difficult for an invading force to project power. The phrase “Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires” is likely to have been extracted from Bearden’s experiences as a CIA man during the anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan in the 1980s. The CIA and Pakistan’s premier intelligence agency, the ISI, were working together to finance, arm and train Afghan groups (the mujahideen) to fight against Soviet troops that had invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. The mujahideen were also provided narratives to rationalise their insurgency. The fight was explained as a ‘jihad’ against an ‘atheist invader’ and a war of liberation. From within these macro-narratives also emerged many micro-narratives based on mythologised portrayals of the ‘historical warrior ethos’ of the Afghans. American and Pakistani governments strengthened these portrayals. Popular culture tools were also employed to solidify them. Examples include the Hollywood blockbuster movie Rambo 3 and the Pakistan TV play, Panah. A 1985 pamphlet published in Peshawar by an anti-Soviet jihadist group claimed that the mujahideen had begun to blow up Soviet tanks by simply standing in front of them and shouting “Allah-o-Akbar [God is great]!” One can therefore assume that the “Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires” myth, too, could’ve been circulating as one of the many micro-narratives at the time. But it was mainstreamed by Bearden in 2001. It most certainly has immediate roots in the anti-Soviet insurgency. But there are scholars who claim that the story of the mujahideen single-handedly defeating the Soviet military with American weapons is also a myth. In his 2011 book Afgansty , British diplomat Rodric Braithwaite wrote that the war between Soviet troops and the mujahideen actually ended in a stalemate. The Soviet Army successfully controlled major cities and infrastructure, while the mujahideen controlled the countryside. According to Braithwaite, Soviet withdrawal (in 1989) was driven more by domestic Soviet politics and a desire to end a costly war than by a decisive military defeat. The ‘graveyard’ narrative has often been worked in two ways. The Taliban began to use it from the early 2000s as a warning to invaders and as a way to further fortify the mythologised image of the ‘invincible’ Afghan. On the other hand, non-Afghans use the trope as a way to rationalise a defeat: everyone loses here, so did we. Biden was doing exactly that in his speech. Either way, it is a simplistic trope that trivialises the geopolitical complexities that have shaped Afghanistan and the wars that have been fought there. As the Serbian historian Nemanja Jovanovi noted in 2022, despite its scarcity and lack of any desirable resources, Afghanistan has stood as an important geopolitical position for millennia. This made it a constant target for others to invade. Jovanovi suggests that it would be more apt to call Afghanistan a “battleground of empires” instead of ‘graveyard of empires.’ It is a place where major powers clash in their search for global/regional domination. Attacks by India-backed Islamist militants on Pakistan from Afghanistan are, therefore, treated by Pakistan as a threat to Pakistan’s growing reputation of becoming a rising power in South Asia.

      "summary_orig": "Even before the volley of gunfire shattered the peace of the night, a sense of foreboding had gripped the sleepy town of Muridke in Punjab’s Sheikhupura district as residents observed the quick buildup of security forces in its streets. A day earlier, hundreds of supporters of the now-proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) had arrived in town, en route to Islamabad, where they planned to stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. As they reached Muridke, roughly an hour’s drive from Lahore, where they had started the march, the protesters found there was no way to move forward as the police had dug trenches along the main roads. Police personnel patrol a street following crackdown on Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan activists during an anti-Israel protest in Muridke on October 13, 2025. — AFP Unwilling to turn back, the protesters had set up camp for the night on GT Road — the main artery linking Lahore to Gujranwala — intending to strategise on the next move in the morning. Before dawn, however, all hell broke loose. The buildup Even a week after that fateful night between Oct 12 and 13, the almost one-kilometre stretch of GT Road, where the TLP had set up camp, bore marks of the deadly scuffles between the protesters and law enforcers. For the purpose of this report, Dawn spoke to a number of residents on both sides of GT Road, traders who run shops in the area and local correspondents affiliated with newspapers and TV channels. On Oct 12, the local correspondents, who seldom find their news reports broadcast on national TV, suddenly found their phones buzzing nonstop as reports of law enforcers making their way to the town to take on the TLP protesters started surfacing. For residents, the thousands of law enforcers, including the Punjab Police, FC and Rangers, taking up positions in adjoining streets and corners was a worrying sight. “We saw for the first time over 3,000 personnel of the FC and the Pakistan (Punjab) Rangers in the streets of Muridke on October 13,” a local trader, who runs a grocery shop in Malkan Wala Bazaar, told Dawn . The trader, A*, lives with his five-member family in an adjoining street of the same bazaar and witnessed the entire saga unfold firsthand. “Muridke city is home to three major bazaars — Malkan Wala, Tanki and Service Bazaar — on both sides of GT Road, and this is where the TLP protesters and police forces clashed early on October 13,” he reminisced. As the night wore on, A* narrated, many of his friends and relatives who lived in the area exchanged messages with each other on what was going on in their respective streets and lanes. But communication wasn’t smooth either, likely due to the jammers activated by the law enforcers before they launched the crackdown, said A*. Police personnel patrol a street following crackdown on Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party activists during an anti-Israel protest in Muridke on October 13, 2025. — AFP “Some of my relatives and friends narrated that they saw unusually heavy movement of security forces in their respective streets and mohallas,” he said. At around 3:30am, he continued, all hell broke loose. It started with what sounded like small explosions as police fired tear gas shells, followed by the sound of heavy gunfire. The streets echoed with the clackety-clack of boots as the law enforcers advanced toward the TLP camp. “All my family members were terrified,“ recounted A*. “We switched off all the lights in the house and kept listening to the cries outside the house,” he added. A pitched battle This next part of the saga has been stitched together from the accounts of local correspondents, traders and residents of Muridke, as well as corroborated by senior officials of the Punjab Police. According to senior police officials and representatives of Muridke’s traders’ union, over 10,000 personnel of law enforcement agencies, including the Punjab Police, participated in the large-scale ‘cordon-and-search operation’. Units of FC and Rangers had reached Muridke earlier in the day from Rawalpindi on a special train, as the roads had already been dug up by the authorities. By late evening, the law enforcers had mapped out all the streets and neighbourhoods near the protest camp through surveillance drones. The forces were then split up and deployed at the identified points with the aim of launching an operation from all four sides. In previous encounters with the police, workers of the religio-political outfit have used smaller streets and bazaars as hideouts to regroup and launch counter-attacks on law enforcers. Locals look at the remains of a charred container truck following violent clashes between police personnel and anti-Israel protesters from the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan in Muridke on October 13, 2025. — AFP “This time, the authorities came up with a new strategy: they blocked all the streets and bazaars by deploying hundreds of law enforcers an hour before launching the final operation,” explained a local correspondent, B*, of a TV channel. Meanwhile, elite police units were put on high alert for hostage rescue, in case the situation took a turn for the worse. B* added that the Tehsil Headquarter Hospital (THQ) Muridke was converted into a ‘temporary headquarters’, wherefrom senior officials of the federal and Punjab governments, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Punjab Police chief Dr Usman Anwar and the head of a federal security agency, supervised the operation. A few minutes before the operation officially commenced at 3:30am, the law enforcers gave a final warning to the protesters to surrender themselves. The TLP leadership, however, ignored the warning and responded with threats of “a befitting response”. On finding the TLP chief and his supporters unmoved, the law enforcers started moving towards the protest camp, led by six armoured personnel carriers (APCs), and followed by hundreds of anti-riot personnel. The teams were supervised by the Regional Police Officers (RPOs) of Sheikhupura, Multan, Faisalabad and Gujranwala, who led their respective units on both sides of GT Road. Seeing the police personnel advancing towards the camp, the protesters who had taken up positions on an overhead pedestrian bridge pelted them with stones. In response, the police fired teargas at the crowd in a bid to disperse them, which led to scuffles between the two sides. According to a senior police officer, who was leading one of the units in the operation, the majority of protesters at the time had gone to nearby mosques and the homes of local supporters to rest, leaving around 1,500-2,000 of them at the protest camp on GT Road. As the law enforcers moved closer towards the camp, the TLP leaders asked their workers to make announcements in the local mosques about the imminent police operation and to urge them to return to the camp immediately. Soon after, a mob attacked the police. Amid the scuffle, a heavy trailer, which had been part of the TLP convoy, drove into an APC. At this point, senior officials were informed that several protesters had dragged a police inspector and beaten him black and blue; he later succumbed to his injuries. According to police officials who spoke to Dawn , they were shocked to see that several TLP protesters started firing at the police convoy. A senior police officer said the firing from the protest camp continued for several minutes, leaving the law enforcers stunned as they had not expected the TLP workers to be armed. At this point, the police command decided to act swiftly — to first rescue the personnel stuck in the APC and then launch a round-up operation against the TLP workers from all sides. On receiving the instructions, the police personnel deployed in the streets and bazaars moved forward, while other formations also marched towards the protest camp. According to residents who spoke to Dawn , the police personnel retaliated against the TLP protesters and returned fire, which continued sporadically for over three hours. The residents said that the gunshots echoed through the streets as the bullets ricocheted off buildings and structures, shattering windows and doors in some instances. Meanwhile, the air grew thick with white smoke from the tear gas and hung over the town like fog for the next several hours. Several residents recounted a thick smoke and a pungent smell, which made their eyes burn, constricted their throats and made it difficult to breathe even inside their homes. Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan activists run as they escape police personnel during an anti-Israel protest in Muridke on October 13, 2025. — AFP When the operation finally ended at around 7:30am, the police made several announcements on loudspeakers, instructing residents to stay in their homes. When they were finally allowed to leave several hours later, they found thousands of cartridges and bullet casings strewn on the roads and streets, besides bloodstains at the protest camp. A Muridke-based trader, who asked not to be named, told Dawn that when he reached the venue in the morning, the air hung heavy with the acrid smell of smoke and gunpowder. The road was littered with wreckage, including several vehicles that had been burned beyond recognition. Surprisingly, he said, he found no trace of any TLP worker, nor anyone who may have been injured or died in the four-hour-long skirmish with the police. “No one knows who took them [injured persons or bodies] away,” said the trader, adding that on the previous night, around 5,000 to 7,000 protesters had been present at the camp on GT Road. Not a single one remained when the operation ended. Claims, counter-claims As the country awoke the next day to find the protest camp disbanded, news reports started trickling in on what had gone down in Muridke in the dead of the night. While there was no official word on the death count, TLP-affiliated social media accounts claimed hundreds of their workers had been killed. Locals look at the remains of a charred container truck following violent clashes between police personnel and protesters of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in Muridke on Oct 13. — AFP Punjab Police chief Dr Usman Anwar later rubbished the reports, saying two TLP workers had died during scuffles in Lahore, while seven had been killed in Muridke. “The police force opened fire in self-defence and that too in response to the armed attack carried out by some of the protesters,” the Punjab Police said. “The Punjab police have so far registered 75 cases under sections of terrorism, murder and attempt to murder, while 30 FIRs were registered for other offences against the TLP chief, its senior leaders and workers,” said the IGP.

      "summary_en": "Even before the volley of gunfire shattered the peace of the night, a sense of foreboding had gripped the sleepy town of Muridke in Punjab’s Sheikhupura district as residents observed the quick buildup of security forces in its streets. A day earlier, hundreds of supporters of the now-proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) had arrived in town, en route to Islamabad, where they planned to stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. As they reached Muridke, roughly an hour’s drive from Lahore, where they had started the march, the protesters found there was no way to move forward as the police had dug trenches along the main roads. Police personnel patrol a street following crackdown on Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan activists during an anti-Israel protest in Muridke on October 13, 2025. — AFP Unwilling to turn back, the protesters had set up camp for the night on GT Road — the main artery linking Lahore to Gujranwala — intending to strategise on the next move in the morning. Before dawn, however, all hell broke loose. The buildup Even a week after that fateful night between Oct 12 and 13, the almost one-kilometre stretch of GT Road, where the TLP had set up camp, bore marks of the deadly scuffles between the protesters and law enforcers. For the purpose of this report, Dawn spoke to a number of residents on both sides of GT Road, traders who run shops in the area and local correspondents affiliated with newspapers and TV channels. On Oct 12, the local correspondents, who seldom find their news reports broadcast on national TV, suddenly found their phones buzzing nonstop as reports of law enforcers making their way to the town to take on the TLP protesters started surfacing. For residents, the thousands of law enforcers, including the Punjab Police, FC and Rangers, taking up positions in adjoining streets and corners was a worrying sight. “We saw for the first time over 3,000 personnel of the FC and the Pakistan (Punjab) Rangers in the streets of Muridke on October 13,” a local trader, who runs a grocery shop in Malkan Wala Bazaar, told Dawn . The trader, A*, lives with his five-member family in an adjoining street of the same bazaar and witnessed the entire saga unfold firsthand. “Muridke city is home to three major bazaars — Malkan Wala, Tanki and Service Bazaar — on both sides of GT Road, and this is where the TLP protesters and police forces clashed early on October 13,” he reminisced. As the night wore on, A* narrated, many of his friends and relatives who lived in the area exchanged messages with each other on what was going on in their respective streets and lanes. But communication wasn’t smooth either, likely due to the jammers activated by the law enforcers before they launched the crackdown, said A*. Police personnel patrol a street following crackdown on Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party activists during an anti-Israel protest in Muridke on October 13, 2025. — AFP “Some of my relatives and friends narrated that they saw unusually heavy movement of security forces in their respective streets and mohallas,” he said. At around 3:30am, he continued, all hell broke loose. It started with what sounded like small explosions as police fired tear gas shells, followed by the sound of heavy gunfire. The streets echoed with the clackety-clack of boots as the law enforcers advanced toward the TLP camp. “All my family members were terrified,“ recounted A*. “We switched off all the lights in the house and kept listening to the cries outside the house,” he added. A pitched battle This next part of the saga has been stitched together from the accounts of local correspondents, traders and residents of Muridke, as well as corroborated by senior officials of the Punjab Police. According to senior police officials and representatives of Muridke’s traders’ union, over 10,000 personnel of law enforcement agencies, including the Punjab Police, participated in the large-scale ‘cordon-and-search operation’. Units of FC and Rangers had reached Muridke earlier in the day from Rawalpindi on a special train, as the roads had already been dug up by the authorities. By late evening, the law enforcers had mapped out all the streets and neighbourhoods near the protest camp through surveillance drones. The forces were then split up and deployed at the identified points with the aim of launching an operation from all four sides. In previous encounters with the police, workers of the religio-political outfit have used smaller streets and bazaars as hideouts to regroup and launch counter-attacks on law enforcers. Locals look at the remains of a charred container truck following violent clashes between police personnel and anti-Israel protesters from the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan in Muridke on October 13, 2025. — AFP “This time, the authorities came up with a new strategy: they blocked all the streets and bazaars by deploying hundreds of law enforcers an hour before launching the final operation,” explained a local correspondent, B*, of a TV channel. Meanwhile, elite police units were put on high alert for hostage rescue, in case the situation took a turn for the worse. B* added that the Tehsil Headquarter Hospital (THQ) Muridke was converted into a ‘temporary headquarters’, wherefrom senior officials of the federal and Punjab governments, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Punjab Police chief Dr Usman Anwar and the head of a federal security agency, supervised the operation. A few minutes before the operation officially commenced at 3:30am, the law enforcers gave a final warning to the protesters to surrender themselves. The TLP leadership, however, ignored the warning and responded with threats of “a befitting response”. On finding the TLP chief and his supporters unmoved, the law enforcers started moving towards the protest camp, led by six armoured personnel carriers (APCs), and followed by hundreds of anti-riot personnel. The teams were supervised by the Regional Police Officers (RPOs) of Sheikhupura, Multan, Faisalabad and Gujranwala, who led their respective units on both sides of GT Road. Seeing the police personnel advancing towards the camp, the protesters who had taken up positions on an overhead pedestrian bridge pelted them with stones. In response, the police fired teargas at the crowd in a bid to disperse them, which led to scuffles between the two sides. According to a senior police officer, who was leading one of the units in the operation, the majority of protesters at the time had gone to nearby mosques and the homes of local supporters to rest, leaving around 1,500-2,000 of them at the protest camp on GT Road. As the law enforcers moved closer towards the camp, the TLP leaders asked their workers to make announcements in the local mosques about the imminent police operation and to urge them to return to the camp immediately. Soon after, a mob attacked the police. Amid the scuffle, a heavy trailer, which had been part of the TLP convoy, drove into an APC. At this point, senior officials were informed that several protesters had dragged a police inspector and beaten him black and blue; he later succumbed to his injuries. According to police officials who spoke to Dawn , they were shocked to see that several TLP protesters started firing at the police convoy. A senior police officer said the firing from the protest camp continued for several minutes, leaving the law enforcers stunned as they had not expected the TLP workers to be armed. At this point, the police command decided to act swiftly — to first rescue the personnel stuck in the APC and then launch a round-up operation against the TLP workers from all sides. On receiving the instructions, the police personnel deployed in the streets and bazaars moved forward, while other formations also marched towards the protest camp. According to residents who spoke to Dawn , the police personnel retaliated against the TLP protesters and returned fire, which continued sporadically for over three hours. The residents said that the gunshots echoed through the streets as the bullets ricocheted off buildings and structures, shattering windows and doors in some instances. Meanwhile, the air grew thick with white smoke from the tear gas and hung over the town like fog for the next several hours. Several residents recounted a thick smoke and a pungent smell, which made their eyes burn, constricted their throats and made it difficult to breathe even inside their homes. Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan activists run as they escape police personnel during an anti-Israel protest in Muridke on October 13, 2025. — AFP When the operation finally ended at around 7:30am, the police made several announcements on loudspeakers, instructing residents to stay in their homes. When they were finally allowed to leave several hours later, they found thousands of cartridges and bullet casings strewn on the roads and streets, besides bloodstains at the protest camp. A Muridke-based trader, who asked not to be named, told Dawn that when he reached the venue in the morning, the air hung heavy with the acrid smell of smoke and gunpowder. The road was littered with wreckage, including several vehicles that had been burned beyond recognition. Surprisingly, he said, he found no trace of any TLP worker, nor anyone who may have been injured or died in the four-hour-long skirmish with the police. “No one knows who took them [injured persons or bodies] away,” said the trader, adding that on the previous night, around 5,000 to 7,000 protesters had been present at the camp on GT Road. Not a single one remained when the operation ended. Claims, counter-claims As the country awoke the next day to find the protest camp disbanded, news reports started trickling in on what had gone down in Muridke in the dead of the night. While there was no official word on the death count, TLP-affiliated social media accounts claimed hundreds of their workers had been killed. Locals look at the remains of a charred container truck following violent clashes between police personnel and protesters of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in Muridke on Oct 13. — AFP Punjab Police chief Dr Usman Anwar later rubbished the reports, saying two TLP workers had died during scuffles in Lahore, while seven had been killed in Muridke. “The police force opened fire in self-defence and that too in response to the armed attack carried out by some of the protesters,” the Punjab Police said. “The Punjab police have so far registered 75 cases under sections of terrorism, murder and attempt to murder, while 30 FIRs were registered for other offences against the TLP chief, its senior leaders and workers,” said the IGP.

      "summary_orig": "AFTER Doha a week ago, the venue for talks on Saturday between Islamabad and Kabul shifted to Istanbul in an attempt to find ways to prevent the TTP from using its sanctuaries along the border in Afghanistan to mount terror attacks in Pakistan. A wave of lethal attacks on its security forces in the erstwhile tribal districts along the Durand Line had triggered a response by the Pakistani military in which aerial assets were used to target TTP safe havens on Afghan soil as deep inside as the capital Kabul. The Afghan Taliban forces had retaliated by firing artillery on Pakistani positions along the border and as Pakistan responded with military muscle, international calls for restraint led to a ceasefire which was cemented in the Doha round between the two sides mediated by Qatar. In Doha, the Afghan Taliban delegation was led by the militant movement founder Mullah Omar’s son, Defence Minister Mullah Mohammed Yaqoob, who is said to be aligned with the Haqqani group led by Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani rather than the hard(er)-line ideologues’ Kandahar group under the supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhunzada. To a rank outsider like me, some of the speculation of serious internal differences within the Afghan Taliban movement between the Kandahar group and the Haqqanis seems exaggerated as decisions taken by the supreme leader are implemented by all, even if this happens after a bit of to and fro, indicating a process of consultation. Despite some Taliban leaders’ apparently feigned unease over issues such as the bar on women’s education and consultation which led to the rescinding of the recent decision to ban the internet after realising it would not be in the Afghan Taliban’s interest, the movement seems united. For now, at least, both the Kandahar ideologues and the Haqqani group seem to be on the same page on the TTP. There can be no stressing enough the ideological affinity the Afghan Taliban feel towards the TTP. Of course, this poses a huge dilemma for Pakistan’s security agencies which had patronised and harboured ‘Haqqani Network’ leaders and foot soldiers throughout the two decades of the occupation of Afghanistan by the US-led Nato forces, in the hope of cashing in one day. When the US withdrew and its propped-up Afghan government collapsed in a day, leaving the field open for the Taliban to take over the capital and the country (large parts of which they controlled during the US occupation too), Pakistan soon realised there was nothing for it to cash in on. With the defence and interior ministries firmly in the Haqqani group’s grip, the hope was that the TTP would be put on a tight leash. That did not happen. If anything, the TTP’s terror attacks on Pakistani forces intensified , drawing considerable blood. The resultant escalation eventually led to the Doha ceasefire, which went from temporary to ‘permanent’. The Istanbul round of the consultations will focus on how to ensure the permanence of this cessation of hostilities. The Hangu IED blast that took the lives of three policemen including an SP underlined the difficulties in ensuring the ceasefire lasts. Dawn ’s defence and foreign affairs correspondent Baqir Sajjad Syed in his lead story on Saturday suggests that the Turk mediators are likely to play a role in evolving a verification mechanism for the terms of the ceasefire agreement, given their experience in dealing with their own violent Kurdish rebel group — the PKK. It is still not clear how much leverage Qatar, Turkiye and Saudi Arabia have with the Afghan Taliban. These are some of the major players who brought both sides to the negotiating table, but can they convince the Afghan Taliban to place restrictions on the TTP, or to, as was suggested at one point, relocate them far from the Pak-Afghan border areas? Sources familiar with the thinking of the Afg­han Taliban do not find credible the speculation that Kabul fears antagonising the TTP because the terror group may join hands with Daesh or IS-K terrorists in Afghanistan and challenge them. On the contrary, they say, that the Afghan Taliban at least privately justify their inaction against, even support to, the TTP, saying the latter supported them and fought alongside them during the long US occupation and, therefore, they would be reluctant to turn their back on their ideological twins from across the Durand Line. The irony of this state of affairs can’t be stressed enough. Many TTP factions were the creation of the Pakistan’s security establishment, so that, in future, influence could be exercised over the Afghan Taliban to ensure a rock solid Western border with no vulnerabilities. But now, the TTP itself has become that vulnerability, the Achilles heel. Also, there can be no stressing enough the ideological affinity the Afghan Taliban feel towards the TTP. All our theories of the ‘good vs bad Taliban’ have been shredded in the terror attacks which have claimed the lives of thousands of Pakistanis. What can the mediators offer the Afghan Taliban to prise them away from their TTP twins? For now, whatever is in the public domain suggests very little. Who knows, recognising the Taliban regime and other forms of political and economic incentives might work. Or for that matter if there is a will at all in the first place to dangle good behaviour prizes before them. What Pakistan can do in the meantime is to revise and implement the National Action Plan which was approved in 2014 after the Peshawar APS massacre and revised in 2021. This must be done whatever the long-term outcome of the Istanbul talks. Not just this. The state, which injected the body politic with the CIA-developed-supplied ‘extremism virus’ to counter the Red Army in Afghanistan, must ask itself if it has an antidote for that? Like me, I am sure, you’d be eager to learn the answer too. The writer is a former editor of Dawn. abbas.nasir@hotmail.com Published in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",

      "title": "Kabul-TTP ties overshadow talks",
      "summary": "AFTER Doha a week ago, the venue for talks on Saturday between Islamabad and Kabul shifted to Istanbul in an attempt to find ways to prevent the TTP from using its sanctuaries along the border in Afghanistan to mount terror attacks in Pakistan. A wave of lethal attacks on its security forces in the erstwhile tribal districts along the Durand Line had triggered a response by the Pakistani military in which aerial assets were used to target TTP safe havens on Afghan soil as deep inside as the capital Kabul. The Afghan Taliban forces had retaliated by firing artillery on Pakistani positions along the border and as Pakistan responded with military muscle, international calls for restraint led to a ceasefire which was cemented in the Doha round between the two sides mediated by Qatar. In Doha, the Afghan Taliban delegation was led by the militant movement founder Mullah Omar’s son, Defence Minister Mullah Mohammed Yaqoob, who is said to be aligned with the Haqqani group led by Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani rather than the hard(er)-line ideologues’ Kandahar group under the supreme leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhunzada. To a rank outsider like me, some of the speculation of serious internal differences within the Afghan Taliban movement between the Kandahar group and the Haqqanis seems exaggerated as decisions taken by the supreme leader are implemented by all, even if this happens after a bit of to and fro, indicating a process of consultation. Despite some Taliban leaders’ apparently feigned unease over issues such as the bar on women’s education and consultation which led to the rescinding of the recent decision to ban the internet after realising it would not be in the Afghan Taliban’s interest, the movement seems united. For now, at least, both the Kandahar ideologues and the Haqqani group seem to be on the same page on the TTP. There can be no stressing enough the ideological affinity the Afghan Taliban feel towards the TTP. Of course, this poses a huge dilemma for Pakistan’s security agencies which had patronised and harboured ‘Haqqani Network’ leaders and foot soldiers throughout the two decades of the occupation of Afghanistan by the US-led Nato forces, in the hope of cashing in one day. When the US withdrew and its propped-up Afghan government collapsed in a day, leaving the field open for the Taliban to take over the capital and the country (large parts of which they controlled during the US occupation too), Pakistan soon realised there was nothing for it to cash in on. With the defence and interior ministries firmly in the Haqqani group’s grip, the hope was that the TTP would be put on a tight leash. That did not happen. If anything, the TTP’s terror attacks on Pakistani forces intensified , drawing considerable blood. The resultant escalation eventually led to the Doha ceasefire, which went from temporary to ‘permanent’. The Istanbul round of the consultations will focus on how to ensure the permanence of this cessation of hostilities.

In this regard, the signing of the Pakistan-Saudi Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement last month was seen as a major development in the geopolitical and defence spheres. Though Islamabad and Riyadh have been allies for decades, the pact has solidified the defence relationship, even though questions remain about some of the finer details of the deal. Regardless, comments by Pakistani officials that the pact could be expanded to other states have led to speculation in global media that a ‘Muslim Nato’ may be in the works, specifically due to the stated mutual defence clause of the Pak-Saudi deal. It is indeed an enticing — if difficult to achieve — idea that a collective defensive arrangement could prevent aggression against Muslim states. In the past year, Pakistan has faced aggression from India. Elsewhere, Israel has been on the rampage. In the current year alone, apart from the genocide in Gaza, the Zionist state has attacked Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Qatar and Iran. Perhaps if the Muslim states had a stronger defensive arrangement, Tel Aviv might have thought twice about carrying out the slaughter in occupied Palestine, as well as attacking sovereign countries at will. While bilateral pacts are one thing, as this paper has previously noted, the framework for a defensive arrangement of Muslim states already exists in the shape of the Saudi Arabia-based Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, headed by former army chief Gen Raheel Sharif. The need is to extend this coalition to all OIC members, and ensure that aggression against one is indeed considered aggression against all. Excluding any Muslim state will defeat the purpose of the entire endeavour. This reformed alliance should focus on collective defence, and no other states or blocs should feel threatened by it. Though the OIC has hardly lived up to its potential, perhaps facing existential challenges to their sovereignty, Muslim states may now seriously consider putting up a united political and military defence to prevent aggression against all OIC members. Such an alliance can work on several principles, foremost of which can be defending against external threats and coordinating action against transnational terrorist groups. Moreover, once Muslim states bind themselves under a collective defence framework, it may be easier to resolve intra-Muslim disputes peacefully, such as the Pakistan-Afghan stalemate . Nato may not be the best exemplar, but it has proven that European states that were once at war with each other have now combined forces for a common defence. Muslim states can choose to work in silos and pursue narrow interests. Or they can pool their resources and put up a collective defence in times of immense insecurity.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Early voting for New York City’s mayoral election began on Saturday, with Zohran Mamdani — a 34-year-old state lawmaker of South Asian origin and self-described democratic socialist — emerging as the surprise frontrunner. Once a political outsider, Mamdani’s campaign has surged , powered by young progressive volunteers and growing frustration over the city’s soaring cost of living. His pledge to freeze rents for two million New Yorkers in rent-stabilised properties has resonated in a city where affordable housing is increasingly out of reach. If elected, Mamdani would be New York’s first Muslim mayor — a historic milestone. Observers, however, note that his popularity stems primarily from his progressive and socialist positions rather than his faith. If elected, the lawmaker of South Asian origin would be NYC’s first Muslim mayor Mamdani champions labour unions, wealth taxation, expanded public transit, and climate-friendly housing.  He also emphasises social inclusion, protecting undocumented immigrants through sanctuary city policies, defending LGBTQ rights, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare and education. These stances earned him strong support from younger and diverse voters, including African American and Hispanic communities. “Mamdani has energised people who feel shut out of traditional politics,” said Moviz Siddiqui of Queens. “He talks about fairness and affordability in a way that connects with everyone — Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists — it doesn’t matter.” Opponents have sought to make his faith an issue. Responding, Mr Mamdani pledged to embrace his Muslim identity more openly, calling such attacks “racist and baseless”. “The dream of every Muslim is simply to be treated the same as any other New Yorker,” he told a Muslim gathering outside a Brooklyn mosque on Friday. Mamdani, who has denounced Israel’s military actions in Gaza as “genocide,” has faced online abuse and political backlash. Yet a Victory Insights poll from October 22-23 shows him leading former Governor Andrew Cuomo by 18 points, with 47 per cent support. Republican Curtis Sliwa stands at 16 pc. After a long hesitation, Dem­ocratic leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have also endorsed Mamdani, signalling party unity ahead of the November 4 election. Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers,” Mr Jeffries said. Mr Schumer added, “He ran an impressive campaign that connected with New Yorkers about affordability, fairness, and opportunity,” defending him against conservative calls to denaturalise him. Born in Kampala, Uganda, Mr Mamdani moved to New York as a child. His father is a Ugandan Mus­lim scholar, and his mother, Mira Nair, is a Hindu Indian filmmaker. This diverse heritage has resonated across New York’s South Asian community, uniting voters from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Muslim leaders, however, remain divided.

      "summary_en": "WASHINGTON: Early voting for New York City’s mayoral election began on Saturday, with Zohran Mamdani — a 34-year-old state lawmaker of South Asian origin and self-described democratic socialist — emerging as the surprise frontrunner. Once a political outsider, Mamdani’s campaign has surged , powered by young progressive volunteers and growing frustration over the city’s soaring cost of living. His pledge to freeze rents for two million New Yorkers in rent-stabilised properties has resonated in a city where affordable housing is increasingly out of reach. If elected, Mamdani would be New York’s first Muslim mayor — a historic milestone. Observers, however, note that his popularity stems primarily from his progressive and socialist positions rather than his faith. If elected, the lawmaker of South Asian origin would be NYC’s first Muslim mayor Mamdani champions labour unions, wealth taxation, expanded public transit, and climate-friendly housing.  He also emphasises social inclusion, protecting undocumented immigrants through sanctuary city policies, defending LGBTQ rights, and ensuring equitable access to healthcare and education. These stances earned him strong support from younger and diverse voters, including African American and Hispanic communities. “Mamdani has energised people who feel shut out of traditional politics,” said Moviz Siddiqui of Queens. “He talks about fairness and affordability in a way that connects with everyone — Muslims, Jews, Hindus, atheists — it doesn’t matter.” Opponents have sought to make his faith an issue. Responding, Mr Mamdani pledged to embrace his Muslim identity more openly, calling such attacks “racist and baseless”. “The dream of every Muslim is simply to be treated the same as any other New Yorker,” he told a Muslim gathering outside a Brooklyn mosque on Friday. Mamdani, who has denounced Israel’s military actions in Gaza as “genocide,” has faced online abuse and political backlash. Yet a Victory Insights poll from October 22-23 shows him leading former Governor Andrew Cuomo by 18 points, with 47 per cent support. Republican Curtis Sliwa stands at 16 pc. After a long hesitation, Dem­ocratic leaders like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have also endorsed Mamdani, signalling party unity ahead of the November 4 election. Zohran Mamdani has relentlessly focused on addressing the affordability crisis and committed to being a Mayor for all New Yorkers,” Mr Jeffries said. Mr Schumer added, “He ran an impressive campaign that connected with New Yorkers about affordability, fairness, and opportunity,” defending him against conservative calls to denaturalise him. Born in Kampala, Uganda, Mr Mamdani moved to New York as a child. His father is a Ugandan Mus­lim scholar, and his mother, Mira Nair, is a Hindu Indian filmmaker. This diverse heritage has resonated across New York’s South Asian community, uniting voters from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Muslim leaders, however, remain divided.

      "summary_orig": "• Citywide AQI hits 412; PM2.5 concentrations far above safe limits • Citizens urged to wear masks, avoid unnecessary outdoor activity • PDMA says smog intensity expected to rise from Nov to mid-Dec • Govt imposes blanket ban on stubble, solid waste, plastic burning LAHORE: Lahore has ranked as the world’s most polluted city for the past three days, with air quality plummeting to hazardous levels as smog blanketed the city and the overall Air Quality Index (AQI) hitting 412, prompting health warnings and a province-wide crackdown on pollution sources. Data revealed that Lower Mall was the worst-affected neighbourhood, with an AQI of 680, followed by Iqbal Town (577), Syed Maratib Ali Road (543), Shadman (507), the Punjab University area (506), and Shalimar (495). Environmental experts have urged residents to avoid unnecessary outdoor activity, particularly in the morning and evening, and to wear masks when outside. PM2.5 concentrations in Lahore’s air are multiple times above global safety thresholds, raising risks of respiratory and cardiovascular illness among other serious health issues, especially for children and the elderly. The Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a high alert across eastern districts of the province, including Lahore, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura, Kasur, Nankana Sahib, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Khanpur. “The intensity of smog is expected to increase from November to mid-December,” warned DG PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia, citing forecasts from the Meteorological Department. The PDMA has directed all commissioners and deputy commissioners to ensure the implementation of government measures to combat smog. The authorities have announced a strict, multi-pronged strategy to tackle the pollution at its source. A comprehensive ban has been imposed on the burning of crop residues, solid waste, tires, plastic and rubber. Mr Kathia stated that a case would be registered for any violation, including the burning of crop stubble and garbage. Simultaneously, the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) has intensified its anti-smog operations, using advanced drone cameras to monitor industrial zones, agricultural land, and urban areas. In the last 24 hours, this tech-driven initiative identified over 460 smog-related violations. More than 200 e-challans were issued to smoke-emitting vehicles, with real-time data shared with departments for immediate action. While enforcement is critical, the government is also pushing for long-term, sustainable solutions. At a seminar in the Kabirwala town of Khanewal district, the Department of Environmental Protection and Climate Change educated farmers on using modern machinery to manage crop residue, particularly rice stubble, without burning. Officials and experts highlighted that this waste can be repurposed in biomass plants to generate steam and energy, turning an environmental problem into an economic opportunity. “Smog is a serious environmental and public health issue, requiring collective and coordinated efforts to address it,” said Project Coordinator Dr Younus Zahid. As the government leverages technology for enforcement and promotes alternative farming practices, the public has been urged to play its part. Citizens have been asked to report smog-inducing activities on the emergency helpline 15, with authorities emphasising that only a collective effort can clear the hazardous air and protect public health. Earlier, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said that nine departments were conducting large-scale operations against smog. The minister said that the environmental protection force and the department were fully mobilised, that all sectoral squads were present in the field, and that brick kilns were being monitored through drones, in addition to issuing a live report. She added that anti-smog cannons and air-quality monitors are deployed and that AQI forecasting, which she said has been introduced for the first time in Punjab, has enabled earlier interventions to curb pollution spikes.

Only a picture of Mr Zardari’s meeting with the lawmakers was issued by Saturday night, while a handout issued by the PPP regarding the meeting with Mr Bhutto-Zardari also did not mention the possibility of a no-confidence motion against the AJK premier. The party leaders discussed the AJK’s “political situation” in the meeting, said the official statement. Sources, however, claimed the party meeting considered names for Mr Haq’s successor. They said the PPP had “almost finalised” the decision to oust the AJK prime minister through a no-trust motion. A formal decision, according to sources, is likely in a day or two. The insiders said the party leaders deliberated upon all possible options, including giving some time to the AJK prime minister for “an honourable exit”, before making any move to remove the premier through a no-trust vote. According to the sources, the meeting also explored potential successors, with Chaudhry Yaseen, Chaudhry Latif Akbar and Sardar Yaqoob emerging as strong contenders for the coveted post. In the AJK assembly, the PPP, with the support of the PML-N, has the support of more than 27 lawmakers — a magic number required to form the government. The PPP has 17 members in the house, 10 of whom are ministers and two are advisers, while AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar also hails from the PPP. It may be noted that the PPP had already decided it would not remain a part of the government, but it remained undecided about whether to sit on the opposition benches or form its own government in the region. Meanwhile, the official statement by the party said that Mr Bhutto-Zardari presided over the PPP AJK Parliamentary group meeting and “discussed the political situation” in AJK. The statement added that the PPP leaders of the AJK chapter discussed improving the organisational structure of the party in the region and the current political situation in AJK. The meeting was also attended by former prime minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and former Kashmir affairs minister Qamar Zaman Kaira, who had recently led a federal government delegation to talk to the protesters in AJK and remained successful in ending the protest after an agreement was signed in the first week of October. At least 10 had been killed while scores were injured in clashes between the law enforcers and the protesters that lasted for days. PPP Women Wing’s Central President Faryal Talpur was also present in the meeting. Others who attended the meeting included Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, Faisal Mumtaz, Chaudhry Latif Akbar, Sardar Javed Ayub, Sardar Muhammad Yaqub Khan, Mian Abdul Waheed, Javed Iqbal Bandhanvi, Syed Bazil Naqvi, Syed Zia Qamar, Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, Chaudhry Aamir Yasin, Aamir Ghaffar Lone, Javed Butt, Rafiq Nayyar, Nabila Ayub, Chaudhry Muhammad Riaz, and Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.

      "summary_orig": "The Karachi police arrested two of the seven cops who were booked after a “teenage boy” died under controversial circumstances in the Special Investigation Unit’s (SIU) custody, while the victim’s relatives held a sit-in at Sohrab Goth on Saturday to demand justice. The seven cops were suspended a day ago after the incident came to light. While the police claimed that Muhammad Irfan died of heart attack, his relatives alleged that he was tortured to death. A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered the same day at the Saddar Police Station on the complaint of SIU and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Ahmed under Sections 34 (common intention) and 319 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against seven nominated SIU/CIA officers. “The SIU/CIA police have handed over custody of two suspects nominated in FIR … who have been arrested. If need be, we shall convert the case to 302 (premeditated murder) and arrest more SIU officials if they were found involved,” said South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza whicle speaking to Dawn . He confirmed that “preliminary post-mortem report establishes torture”. Meanwhile, a large number of relatives and members of the community staged a sit-in at an Edhi morgue at Sohrab Goth while carrying the coffin of the victim, whose body was kept at the morgue, and blocked the main road. Senior journalist Shahid Jatoi, one of the protesters, told Dawn that the people were demonstrating because “the case has been registered on complaint of the killers”. He said the policemen had promised the relatives that  the FIR would be registered on the family’s complaint. “The relatives visited the SIU/CIA centre on Friday night for the purpose of the FIR, but the police had already got the FIR registered on behalf of the state. They were informed that since FIR had already been registered, a second case could not be registered for the same offence,” Jatoi said. He added that since then, three other people, who were detained along with Irfan, were released and cleared of any wrongdoing, the family and those gathered believed that the four were “innocent” and were tortured in custody, leading to Irfan’s death. The protesters urged the Sindh chief minister and police chief to provide justice in the matter. Following the sit-in, thousands were stranded on major thoroughfares as traffic piled up and spilled onto nearby routes. In a post on X after 10:30pm, Karachi Traffic Police said the road at Edhi Center in Sohrab Goth had reopened for traffic following the conclusion of the protest. The road linking Sohrab Goth and Rashid Minhas Road was restored to normal traffic flow, according to traffic police officials. Earlier in the evening, Karachi Traffic Police said in a statement that traffic at Edhi Centre Sohrab Goth, towards Shafiq Mor main Rashid Minhas Road was closed for traffic. A map of the traffic in Karachi as of 8:33pm. — Google Maps Traffic coming from Gulshan-i-Iqbal was being diverted under Sohrab Goth bridge towards Sharea Pakistan, while traffic coming from Water Pump was being diverted towards Al-Asif Square. FIR The FIR said that four people were detained by the SIU police party from Lilly Bridge near Cantonment Station in the limits of Frere Police Station on Wednesday. A day ago, the SIU had told Dawn that they were arrested from Ayesha Manzil in the FB Area of the city. The FIR added they were detained on information provided by a special informant, a case was registered against the four on the same day, and they were handed over to an assistant sub-inspector (ASI). SHO Ahmed said he came to know through the investigating office of the case that two other ASIs had continued interrogating Irfan when his health deteriorated suddenly and he became unconscious. The SHO added that the IO took Irfan to the hospital without informing him. SHO Ahmed said the SIU personnel had committed “negligence” during Irfan’s arrest and custody. He said it transpired that the registration of the case against the deceased was also “dubious” and the entire matter raised suspicion.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Saturday claimed the federal government owed the province Rs550 billion, calling for the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting to be convened immediately. He made these remarks while addressing a jirga in the province’s Khyber district today. Last week, CM Afridi had called for a grand peace jirga in a bid to discuss avenues for “establishment of peace” in the province. “After 9/11, Pakistan entered a foreign war without our consent,” CM Afridi said, referring to the attacks of Sept 11, 2001, when deadly plane hijackings claimed almost 3,000 lives. “It was said that Pakistan needs sacrifices. For Pakistan, we left our houses. Drone strikes and military operations started here,” Afridi said. “We were made the scapegoats,” he told the crowd. “Our homes, markets, and mosques were destroyed, yet we gave sacrifices for Pakistan.” The chief minister warned against the launching of any new military operation in the province’s tribal districts, saying the people will “not be made into scapegoats again”. Afridi added that despite the claims of security forces in 2018 that Khyber district and other tribal areas had been cleared [of militants], “preparations are again being made for new military operations”. The newly elected provincial chief executive said KP stands with the state when it comes to peace, but “under no circumstance will we support collateral damage”. “If any innocent life is lost this time, there will be accountability,” Afridi said. He also demanded that any future decisions regarding the region “must include the provincial government and parliamentarians from KP,” rejecting decisions made behind “closed doors”. PTI leadership meet at CM House Prior to the jirga, a meeting of PTI’s senior leadership took place at CM House in Peshawar, according to a statement by press secretary to CM Sahibzada Hassan. Chairman PTI Barrister Gohar, CM Sohail Afridi, PTI Provincial President Junaid Akbar, Asad Qaiser and other leaders participated in the meeting, per the statement. The law and order situation of the province was discussed in detail during the meeting. It was decided to convene a peace jirga in the KP Assembly, with former CMs, governors, scholars, jirga leaders, civil society, lawyers and important personalities to be invited. “The aim of the peace jirga is to eliminate terrorism and formulate a unified strategy for sustainable peace,” said the statement. “Participants of the meeting paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police.’ “Provincial government stands by the police force,” CM Afridi was quoted as saying. “Providing modern equipment, training and resources to the police is the top priority of the government.” Rise in terrorist incidents Pakistan has witnessed a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) personnel. Earlier this week, Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government. The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations , which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements. Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan . A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed three terrorists while foiling an attempted suicide attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said on Saturday. A statement issued today from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that security forces foiled a “major terrorist incident and averted a potential catastrophic attack” a day ago after conducting an intelligence-based operation  (IBO) in the district’s general area of Jhallar based on credible intelligence about reported terrorist presence belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna al-Khawarij preparing a vehicle-borne suicide bomber for a major terrorist activity”. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It added that troops effectively engaged them at their location and destroyed the vehicle being prepared for the suicide attack while eliminating three “Indian-sponsored” terrorists through “precise and skillful engagement”. The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area. “Relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR concluded. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Earlier this week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government. The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations , which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements . Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counter-terrorism operations under the National Action Plan . A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Saturday that the government was committed to making Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) a profitable institution. He made the remarks during a ceremony at the Islamabad International Airport to mark the national flag carrier’s inaugural flight from the capital to the United Kingdom (UK) after a gap of nearly five years. Last month, the airline had received Third Country Operator approval for the UK. The development came after Britain’s Department of Transport concluded that security arrangements in the country were “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. Flight operations to Manchester are resuming in the first phase, with plans to extend them to Birmingham and London in the second. “After a long and difficult delay of five years, today the resumption of flights from Islamabad to Manchester is a feat we have achieved through our hard work and determination,” Asif said. “This success is not a coincidence, but a living testament of the government’s priorities, strong leadership, and efforts,” he said. The minister said that the country’s image suffered immensely when the national carrier faced international bans. “We took it as a national challenge. The government, without wasting a single moment, empowered and provided resources to the country’s aviation bodies,” he said. “To meet the standards of the world’s strictest aviation bodies, we completely restructured pilot training, the licensing system, aircraft maintenance, and safety protocols,” he added. “It is a matter of great pride that we raised our standards to such a level that the European Union’s Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) restored its confidence in PIA,“ the minister said. Asif also expressed gratitude to Pakistani diplomats and staff based in Britain and Europe, saying that they “presented Pakistan’s case effectively at a diplomatic level, provided evidence, and maintained continuous engagement” with the relevant authorities. He said that their persistent efforts had enabled the national carrier to resume its regular flight operations. “I would especially like to thank the staff of the British High Commission in Pakistan and their team leader Jane Marriott,” he said, adding that they also played a part in accelerating the process and removing obstacles. “Their cooperation highlights the strong friendship between the two countries,” he said. The minister added that the government was committed to making PIA a profitable institution so that it could support the economy instead of being a burden. The minister said that the flights to Manchester were an “excellent start” but the government would not stop there. “We plan that after Manchester, flights to London and Birmingham will also be started,” he said. The minister directed the PIA management to ensure safety, punctuality and customer satisfaction. “Let us vow today to make PIA reach the status it had once achieved,” he said. In a post on X, Asif said the restoration of flights was part of a series of measures taken by the government for the restoration of national institutions, improvement of public facilities, and the promotion of Pakistan’s image at the international level. He said that the statement of the aviation minister during the PTI era “caused damage to the reputation of our beloved country, the aviation sector, and the national airline PIA, which the current government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has rectified”. “The resumption of direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester marks the beginning of a new era of connectivity between Pakistan and the UK, which will provide significant convenience to the Pakistani community residing there,” Asif said. Meanwhile, Marriott, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, said: “A genuine joy to wave off the first flight by a Pakistani carrier to the UK in five years. Here’s to more destinations and connections!” PM Shehbaz felicitated the nation, especially Pakistanis residing in the UK, on the commencement of direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester. The prime minister also lauded the efforts of Asif, the Civil Aviation Authority, PIA and the officials of the relevant entities in this regard. “Pakistans image is being restored across the world,” he said, adding that the suspension had damaged PIAs reputation, which was now restored after years of dedicated efforts. The prime minister further observed that the Pakistani community living in the UK would greatly benefit from these direct flights. “The resumption of direct flights will further strengthen Pakistan-UK bilateral ties,” he said, adding that the journey of improvement in every national institution, through reforms, was progressing at a rapid pace. The EASA had barred PIA from operating in EU countries in June 2020 over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near the Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament terming pilots’ licences “dubious”. EASA lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28 last year. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. It should also be mentioned that the government is making efforts to sell the struggling national flag carrier, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. In June, it received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm.",
