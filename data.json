      "title_orig": "Record-setting Hamza Asif, treble winner Faiqa Riaz steal National Games spotlight",
      "summary_orig": "At the 35th National Games, the story of sport has so often been of sheer will against long odds. But on Wednesday, the narrative splintered into two distinct, dazzling truths: one written in the chronometric perfection of chlorinated water, the other etched in the sun-baked sand of the long jump pit. In the pool, a digital clock froze at a number never before seen in Pakistan: 29.99 seconds. On the track, a measuring tape confirmed a distance of 5.52 metres, sealing a historic triple crown. The fourth day of the competitions belonged to 19-year-old swimmer Hamza Asif, who shattered a time barrier and a 26-year-old Olympian who shattered expectations, proving that national sporting history can be made in parallel universes. The sun played the role of spotlight over the swimming arena, its zenith aligning with the men’s 50m breaststroke final. The audience was on its feet, phone cameras held horizontally. In lane six was Rayan Awan, the national record holder in the event. The buzzer sounded. Seven swimmers flew off the blocks, emerging from shadow into liquid light. It was not Rayan, but Wapda’s Hamza who touched first. After a wait of several seconds, a cluster of red numbers appeared. A voice screamed from the stands: “National record! National record!” Hamza had done the unthinkable — he became the first Pakistani to swim the event in under 30 seconds. Rayan, in a gracious twist of fate, also improved his personal time (30.55) for silver. But this was Hamza’s moment. Race-mates reached over lane lines to high-five the teenager, who trains at the University of Tennessee. His father was hugged tight by proud men; his mother bent down in prostration. “My coach has worked hard on me, we’ve been training for this very event and I was expecting the record,” a remarkably composed Hamza, who would later top off his day with another gold in the 50m freestyle, told Dawn . As the aquatic celebrations subsided, the searing Karachi sun refocused its attention on the track and field stadium. Here, Faiqa Ilyas, the Wapda sprinter and Pakistan’s representative at the Paris 2024 Olympics, was chasing a different kind of immortality. She had already secured the 100m and 200m golds. Now, she stood at the long jump runway for her final attempt. A brief, taut silence followed her leap. She locked eyes with the technical official. The winning distance was announced. A yell of pure, unfiltered joy erupted. Faiqa put her hands on her head, knowing the gold — and a historic third individual title — was hers. When the last competitor failed to match it, she collapsed into the arms of her coaches. “I thought I had to settle for a silver today,” Faiqa confessed to Dawn . “But on my last attempt, I was like it’s do or die and I ran with my full strength for the jump.” Her main target had always been the 100m, the event she trained for most intensely. The 200m and long jump were audacious, successful experiments. Her triumph, however, is framed by the stark realities of Pakistani sport. Managing two distinct disciplines is a complex science. “For jumps, training for explosive [power] I do with sprint. But run-up is the main issue… in sprint you need speed while in long jump you need more control with speed,” she explained, noting she doesn’t train specifically for jumps to protect her sprinting prowess. THE SUPPORTING CAST The day’s drama was not confined to these twin peaks. The penultimate day of the athletic meet began in the pre-dawn dark at Mazar-e-Quaid, with the marathoners setting off on their 42.195km odyssey, where Navy’s Shahbaz Masih claimed marathon gold in 2:25:23.6 — almost four minutes ahead of his nearest rival Wapda’s Sher Khan. Elsewhere on the track and field of the NPT&SC, Army’s Mohammad Akhtar executed a perfectly timed final burst in the men’s 10,000m, roaring past Wapda’s Mohammad Irfan in the last 150 metres to claim gold. The women’s 100m hurdles saw a thrilling mid-race shift, as Wapda’s Ghazala Ramzan edged ahead of her department-mate Amina Saeed to secure the top spot. The men’s 4x100m relay provided a thrilling finale, with Wapda clinging to a razor-thin lead against a charging Army team in a photo finish. The event, however, was marred by controversy as the Sindh team failed to field a squad, citing a lack of communication from their absent manager and grievances over unpaid daily allowances. In the field, Uzma Azan (Wapda) added to her department’s gold haul in the hammer throw, while Army’s Waqas Akbar cruised to victory in a tactical men’s 1500m. Over in the pool, 13-year-old Riah Mirza won her first national medal —gold— in the women’s 100m backstroke in 1:16.50, a personal record for the teenager. Watching, with pride in her eyes, was her mother Shaan Kandawalla, who swam at the first national women’s championships 30 years ago. “My mom’s my inspiration,” Riah said. “And she’s mine,” Shaan replied, kissing her forehead. “I hope she now gets a chance to swim internationally, which I never got a chance to do.” The waves of victory kept coming. Jehanara Nabi and Ahmed Durrani (800m and 200m freestyle) added multiple individual golds for Army. Mishael Hayat Ayub won Wapda’s first aquatics gold medal in the women’s 100m butterfly in 1:11.12. Ayesha Zeeshan followed it up with a gold in 50m freestyle (28.69), while earlier in the day Hareem Malik won Sindh’s second gold in the 50m breaststroke, coming moderately close to breaking her own national record in the event. Ali Mitha won Sindh’s first gold on the men’s side in 1:01.64 in 100m backstroke. Army’s other individual gold was won by Syed Daniyal Hatim in the 100m butterfly, where he’s the record holder, with 57.72. FOOTBALL FRACAS Aside from the sporting glories, the men’s football event descended into a farce after a violent brawl during a heated semi-final clash between Army and Wapda at the KPT Sports Complex. A heated exchange, after Army won 4-3, flared into a full-scale brawl, culminating in players allegedly forcing their way into the officials’ room and assaulting the referee. A detailed report is being prepared, with disciplinary action expected against both sides. In judo, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) emerged as the leading force, with Mohammad Saleem (-50kg), Olympian Shah Hussain Shah (-110kg) and Sadaqat Ali (-66kg) all securing gold, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Syed Faisal Shah (-55kg) and Navy’s Akhas (-60kg) also topped their categories. In the women’s events, PAF continued their strong showing through Naseema (-40kg) and Iram Shahzadi (-48kg), with Wapda’s Fozia Yasir (+70kg) and Navy’s Areeba Ameer (-44kg) claiming titles. Taekwondo kyorugi saw Army dominate the mats, with Haroon (U-58kg), Arbaz Khan (U-68kg) and Ikhtasham-ul-Haq (U-87kg) winning the men’s titles, while Fateema (U-49kg) and Sarah (U-67kg) claimed gold for Army in the women’s events. Badminton belonged emphatically to Wapda, who swept both the men’s and women’s team event finals. In the men’s final, Wapda outclassed Army 3-1 with standout performances from Mohammad Ali Larosh and Irfan Saeed. The women’s final was even more one-sided, as Mahoor Shahzad led Wapda to a clinical 3-0 victory. In softball, Pakistan Army edged Wapda 9-6 to secure the gold medal, while Wapda were crowned overall bodybuilding champions, claiming eight gold medals to continue their dominance in strength sports. In tug of war, Pakistan Railways claimed gold in the men’s category, while Wapda secured the women’s title. At the PNS Karsaz range, Navy’s shooters shone brightly. Hadiqa Iqbal took gold in the women’s 50m rifle event, while Navy swept the team category as well. Abdul Qudoos also delivered gold in the 25m standard pistol, with the Navy team repeating that success. Army’s Colonel Farrukh Nadeem topped the individual trap event. In wrestling, Wapda extended their grip on the medals table with gold medals for Hammad Butt (61kg) and Inayatullah (74kg), while Army’s Haider Ali delivered a strong performance to win the 86kg title.",

Ayesha Zeeshan followed it up with a gold in 50m freestyle (28.69), while earlier in the day Hareem Malik won Sindh’s second gold in the 50m breaststroke, coming moderately close to breaking her own national record in the event. Ali Mitha won Sindh’s first gold on the men’s side in 1:01.64 in 100m backstroke. Army’s other individual gold was won by Syed Daniyal Hatim in the 100m butterfly, where he’s the record holder, with 57.72. FOOTBALL FRACAS Aside from the sporting glories, the men’s football event descended into a farce after a violent brawl during a heated semi-final clash between Army and Wapda at the KPT Sports Complex. A heated exchange, after Army won 4-3, flared into a full-scale brawl, culminating in players allegedly forcing their way into the officials’ room and assaulting the referee. A detailed report is being prepared, with disciplinary action expected against both sides. In judo, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) emerged as the leading force, with Mohammad Saleem (-50kg), Olympian Shah Hussain Shah (-110kg) and Sadaqat Ali (-66kg) all securing gold, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Syed Faisal Shah (-55kg) and Navy’s Akhas (-60kg) also topped their categories. In the women’s events, PAF continued their strong showing through Naseema (-40kg) and Iram Shahzadi (-48kg), with Wapda’s Fozia Yasir (+70kg) and Navy’s Areeba Ameer (-44kg) claiming titles. Taekwondo kyorugi saw Army dominate the mats, with Haroon (U-58kg), Arbaz Khan (U-68kg) and Ikhtasham-ul-Haq (U-87kg) winning the men’s titles, while Fateema (U-49kg) and Sarah (U-67kg) claimed gold for Army in the women’s events. Badminton belonged emphatically to Wapda, who swept both the men’s and women’s team event finals. In the men’s final, Wapda outclassed Army 3-1 with standout performances from Mohammad Ali Larosh and Irfan Saeed. The women’s final was even more one-sided, as Mahoor Shahzad led Wapda to a clinical 3-0 victory. In softball, Pakistan Army edged Wapda 9-6 to secure the gold medal, while Wapda were crowned overall bodybuilding champions, claiming eight gold medals to continue their dominance in strength sports. In tug of war, Pakistan Railways claimed gold in the men’s category, while Wapda secured the women’s title. At the PNS Karsaz range, Navy’s shooters shone brightly. Hadiqa Iqbal took gold in the women’s 50m rifle event, while Navy swept the team category as well. Abdul Qudoos also delivered gold in the 25m standard pistol, with the Navy team repeating that success. Army’s Colonel Farrukh Nadeem topped the individual trap event. In wrestling, Wapda extended their grip on the medals table with gold medals for Hammad Butt (61kg) and Inayatullah (74kg), while Army’s Haider Ali delivered a strong performance to win the 86kg title.",

      "title_orig": "US approves $686 million F-16 technology sale to Pakistan, highlighting interoperability and fleet modernisation",
      "summary_orig": "The United States has approved the sale of advanced technology and support for Pakistan’s F-16 fighter jets, valued at $686 million, according to a letter the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) sent to Congress on December 8. The package includes Link–16 systems, cryptographic equipment, avionics updates, training, and comprehensive logistical support. The DSCA letter makes clear the rationale for the sale, stating that it “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations.” The proposed sale is also aimed at modernising Pakistan’s F-16 fleet and addressing operational safety concerns. The letter notes that it will “maintain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future threats by updating and refurbishing its Block–52 and Mid Life Upgrade F–16 fleet.” These updates will provide more “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns,” the letter adds. The letter also emphasises Pakistan’s readiness to absorb the technology, stating that the country “has shown a commitment to maintaining its military forces and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” It also addresses regional concerns, asserting that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.” Lockheed Martin Company of Fort Worth, Texas, will serve as the principal contractor for the sale. The US defence agency pointed out that “implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional US Government or contractor representatives to Pakistan” and that there will be “no adverse impact on US defence readiness as a result of this proposed sale.” The total estimated value of the sale is $686 million, with major defence equipment valued at $37 million and other items at $649 million. The major defence equipment (MDE) component includes 92 Link–16 data link systems and six inert Mk–82 500-lb general purpose bomb bodies; the latter will have no explosive payload and will be used for weapons integration testing. Link-16 is an advanced command, control, communications and intelligence system. It is a secure, real-time communication network that shares tactical data among allied forces and is used by US and allied Nato forces. The system is also resistant to electronic jamming from enemy air and ground assets. “It provides the warfighter key theatre functions such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons engagement coordination, and direction for all services and allied forces,” the letter read. The rest of the deal consists of $649m worth of non-MDE equipment, including the AN/APQ–10C Simple Key Loaders and AN/APX–126 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe system — used to identify hostile and allied aircraft. It also includes hardware and software modifications to support the Operational Flight Program and mandated avionics updates, as well as KY–58M and KIV–78 cryptographic appliqués, which are National Security Agency (NSA)-certified modules used in military aircraft and other tactical systems for secure communications and identification. The equipment also covers additional secure communications, precision navigation and cryptographic devices, Joint Mission Planning Systems and support, Common Munitions Built-in-test Reprogramming Equipment, and ADU–981 missile adaptor units. Other weapons integration, test and support equipment, spare and repair parts, software delivery and support, publications and technical documentation, full motion simulators, personnel training, and training equipment are also included. The package will also provide Pakistan with US government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services, studies and surveys, and other related elements of logistical and program support. Pakistan had requested upgrades to its F-16 fleet in 2021 amid strained relations, but Washington delayed its response. The country is now less dependent on the F-16s, having acquired and jointly developed other platforms, which proved their worth during the May 2025 air war by inflicting significant damage on the Indian fleet. “Pakistan still welcomes the US offer, as it will enhance the shelf life of its F-16s until 2040,” a diplomatic source said. The DSCA letter, sent to the Speaker of the House and the chairmen of the relevant congressional committees, concludes that the sale “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States” while ensuring that Pakistan can continue to operate its F-16 fleet safely and effectively.",

      "summary_orig": "The PPP accused the PML-N of “colluding” with the PTI during National Assembly proceedings on Wednesday, after the speaker ended the session early when PTI’s Iqbal Afridi pointed out a “lack of quorum” ahead of an agenda item regarding the renaming of Islamabad International Airport. The last item on the day’s agenda was a calling-attention notice from First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari and other PPP lawmakers, intended to draw the defence minister’s attention to the delay in naming the New Islamabad International Airport after former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in recognition of her services to democracy and the country. However, as the day’s proceedings continued, presiding officer Ali Zahid, who belongs to the PML-N, ended the session abruptly during the question hour while PPP MNA Abdul Qadir Patel was speaking. PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi pointed out the lack of quorum while Patel spoke, prompting the speaker to have the members counted. “63 members are present, the house is not in order,” Zahid said, ending the session early. With their mics switched off, PPP lawmakers staged a noisy protest on the floor of the house. Addressing the media after the session’s abrupt end, PPP MNA Shazia Marri termed the move “a conspiracy” against the PPP, alleging that “it appeared as if the PML-N and PTI were colluding.” “This reeks of a conspiracy […] the session ended at 11-11:15, not even an hour had passed, and we are now standing here holding a press conference.” Addressing the media, she said, “Qadir Patel also went to the speaker and spoke to him,” she said, adding that “now that we are standing here with you, it does feel like a conspiracy and intentional”. “PTI is already quite non-serious[…]however, we were not expecting this from PML-N,” the PPP leader lamented. The PPP leader, in a veiled warning to the coalition partner, said that “given the state of the country, […] the PML-N ought to be more careful”. “Meting out such treatment to a party that is mature and sensible is unacceptable,” she said. Separately, Patel, while speaking to the media afterwards, alleged that PML-N leaders were “sitting in the lobby” while the quorum was called, also terming it a “well-thought-out conspiracy.” “My question had not yet been completed during the question hour, so how was a member allowed to point out a lack of quorum?” he asked. “If the location of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Airport has been changed, then why can the name not be changed?” “Shaheed Benazir does not need any praise; these people are small-minded, and they will remain as such,” Patel said. Patel vowed that, in case the government does not respond, “the party will decide its future course of action during its next meeting”. ‘Petty tactic’ Meanwhile, in a post on X, Aseefa expressed disappointment “at the behaviour of acting NA speaker,” terming the move a “petty tactic.” “It has become a mockery to constantly suspend the session despite having quorum. Many had heard the speaker was given instructions to avoid my calling attention notice. A very petty tactic,” the first lady said. The New Islamabad International Airport (IIAP) was inaugurated by then-prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on May 2, 2018. In February this year, PPP leader and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor, Faisal Karim Kundi, in a letter to the prime minister, had requested that the airport be renamed to honour the former prime minister, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported. “Governor Kundi emphasised that the old Islamabad airport was originally named Benazir Bhutto International Airport on June 21, 2008, following her assassination in December 2007,” the report said. “However, in April 2018, the Aviation Division renamed the newly constructed airport as New Islamabad International Airport, removing Bhutto’s name,” it added.",

      "title_orig": "Bilawal says PTI’s ‘extreme politics’ is ‘putting the party in jeopardy’, opposes ban",
      "summary_orig": "PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday warned that a political party, in an apparent reference to the PTI, risks being banned due to its deliberate targeting of state institutions on social media, and urged it to “abandon such politics.” A day earlier, the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution to ban the incarcerated PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his party for being “anti-state”, following remarks by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, who assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric and stated that such narratives were now beyond politics and had become a “national security threat”. Speaking to the media after visiting the residence of a late senior party worker in Lahore’s Baghbanpura neighbourhood, Bilawal said that the PTI is “targeting” the military leadership through social media and “concocting political conspiracies”. “They attack institutions when Pakistan is passing through a critical phase,” he said. “I urge them to abandon these politics immediately. They have not only put their own party in jeopardy, but they have also left the political system and the people of Pakistan in a difficult spot.” In response to a question about whether the PTI should be banned, the PPP chairman said that no political power wants conditions to become so bad that political voices are silenced. “This will not be my preference or my choice, but what can I do when they continue to pursue extreme politics?” Bilawal asked. “Protest is your right, not entering and attacking military installations.” The PPP chief also noted that amid a spike in terrorism, the PTI is attacking the institution combating militancy. “We do not want a ban on any political party, but political forces must adopt a democratic attitude,” he said, adding that it was the government’s responsibility to provide political space to the opposition. “They (PTI) are creating an environment in which bans could be imposed, what I want is irrelevant,” he said. “Someone needs to tell that man (Imran) to come to his senses and engage in politics. If he wants to do that, political doors will open, but if he wants to lead his party like an army, then he will be dealt with accordingly.” Bilawal also demanded that the PTI focus on the problems of the people rather than “attacking our national heroes”. “We will not stand silent while these people abuse our armed forces. We believe that this party is doing the work of the political antichrist,” Bilawal said. He noted that the PTI’s behaviour amid a deteriorating security landscape in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa may even trigger discussions of governor’s rule, although he had not seen the KP governor’s statement on the matter. “Governor’s rule is an extreme proposition, but if the political parties and leadership there (KP) weaken the nation and create conditions where it becomes difficult to fight terrorism, then we have the constitutional and legal obligation to impose it. “The PPP is not demanding it, but the PTI’s actions and choices may lead to governor’s rule or a ban. Neither of those things are good.” Referring to the brief war with India in May, the PPP chief claimed that Pakistan had responded firmly to Indian aggression, but noted that threats from New Delhi remain present, while terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is an alarming reality. Bilawal stressed that internal challenges were also being addressed, and at such a time, “It is the responsibility of every patriotic citizen to stand with the country and its armed forces.” Earlier in 2024, the federal government decided to ban the PTI and sought Article 6 proceedings against Imran, ex-president Dr Arif Alvi, and former National Assembly (NA) deputy speaker Qasim Suri. The move appeared to be an attempt to prevent the PTI from becoming the single largest party in the NA, following the apex court’s ruling in the reserved seats case. However, the government did not follow through with the ban. In October, the federal government approved a ban on the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) under the anti-terrorism act (ATA) following violent protests. However, banning political groups is not a new practice in Pakistan. It has followed the country across decades — from martial laws to seemingly democratic setups.",

      "summary_en": "PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday warned that a political party, in an apparent reference to the PTI, risks being banned due to its deliberate targeting of state institutions on social media, and urged it to “abandon such politics.” A day earlier, the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution to ban the incarcerated PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his party for being “anti-state”, following remarks by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, who assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric and stated that such narratives were now beyond politics and had become a “national security threat”. Speaking to the media after visiting the residence of a late senior party worker in Lahore’s Baghbanpura neighbourhood, Bilawal said that the PTI is “targeting” the military leadership through social media and “concocting political conspiracies”. “They attack institutions when Pakistan is passing through a critical phase,” he said. “I urge them to abandon these politics immediately. They have not only put their own party in jeopardy, but they have also left the political system and the people of Pakistan in a difficult spot.” In response to a question about whether the PTI should be banned, the PPP chairman said that no political power wants conditions to become so bad that political voices are silenced. “This will not be my preference or my choice, but what can I do when they continue to pursue extreme politics?” Bilawal asked. “Protest is your right, not entering and attacking military installations.” The PPP chief also noted that amid a spike in terrorism, the PTI is attacking the institution combating militancy. “We do not want a ban on any political party, but political forces must adopt a democratic attitude,” he said, adding that it was the government’s responsibility to provide political space to the opposition. “They (PTI) are creating an environment in which bans could be imposed, what I want is irrelevant,” he said. “Someone needs to tell that man (Imran) to come to his senses and engage in politics. If he wants to do that, political doors will open, but if he wants to lead his party like an army, then he will be dealt with accordingly.” Bilawal also demanded that the PTI focus on the problems of the people rather than “attacking our national heroes”. “We will not stand silent while these people abuse our armed forces. We believe that this party is doing the work of the political antichrist,” Bilawal said. He noted that the PTI’s behaviour amid a deteriorating security landscape in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa may even trigger discussions of governor’s rule, although he had not seen the KP governor’s statement on the matter. “Governor’s rule is an extreme proposition, but if the political parties and leadership there (KP) weaken the nation and create conditions where it becomes difficult to fight terrorism, then we have the constitutional and legal obligation to impose it. “The PPP is not demanding it, but the PTI’s actions and choices may lead to governor’s rule or a ban. Neither of those things are good.” Referring to the brief war with India in May, the PPP chief claimed that Pakistan had responded firmly to Indian aggression, but noted that threats from New Delhi remain present, while terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is an alarming reality. Bilawal stressed that internal challenges were also being addressed, and at such a time, “It is the responsibility of every patriotic citizen to stand with the country and its armed forces.” Earlier in 2024, the federal government decided to ban the PTI and sought Article 6 proceedings against Imran, ex-president Dr Arif Alvi, and former National Assembly (NA) deputy speaker Qasim Suri. The move appeared to be an attempt to prevent the PTI from becoming the single largest party in the NA, following the apex court’s ruling in the reserved seats case. However, the government did not follow through with the ban. In October, the federal government approved a ban on the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) under the anti-terrorism act (ATA) following violent protests. However, banning political groups is not a new practice in Pakistan. It has followed the country across decades — from martial laws to seemingly democratic setups.",

      "summary_orig": "Wolves are returning across Europe — but not to the UK and Ireland, where public support is lukewarm at best. Ecologists point out their benefits, while farmers worry about their livestock. But another influence on public opinion is rarely discussed: Hollywood’s obsession with the wolf as a monster. ​This is a particular issue in places where wolves are native yet have been extinct for centuries. Though wolves once roamed across Britain and Ireland, for most people there today, they exist only in stories or on screen. The tropes we absorb through entertainment can carry far more weight than scientific facts and have an outsized impact on how we think and feel about these animals. Think of the Big Bad Wolf or Little Red Riding Hood. Nearly every child in the English-speaking world is introduced to the villainous wolf from a young age. They’re cunning, cruel and ravenous. However, we don’t leave that imagery behind us in childhood. Horror cinema keeps our nightmares full of wolves, drawing on familiar — and often entirely false — tropes. Recent films offer some particularly clear examples. Hollywood horror’s ‘killer wolf’ trope is sabotaging rewilding efforts… In Guillermo del Toro’s recent adaptation of Frankenstein, wolves are depicted as villains. After escaping Dr Frankenstein, the monster takes refuge in an isolated farmstead and tries to help its residents. Twice, wolves descend on the farmstead — not only taking sheep but breaking into the house and attacking humans. During the first attack, the monster muses that “the hunter did not hate the wolf. The wolf did not hate the sheep. But violence felt inevitable between them. This was the way of the world. It would hunt you and kill you, just for being who you are.” Del Toro uses wolves as a metaphor for the world’s brutality. To make that connection, he depicts conflict between wolf and human as “inevitable”, along with portraying wolves — very inaccurately — as determined home invaders. This negative portrayal is not drawn from Mary Shelley’s novel, which contains no such scenes. Del Toro appears to have inserted it to heighten tension and scare viewers. ​Metaphors and monsters Robert Eggers’s Nosferatu offers another recent big-budget example. When Nicholas Hoult’s character tries to escape the vampire Count Orlok’s castle, he is pursued by a pack of wolves. This is very close to older fairytale wolf characters, depicted as overtly evil or demonic. This was reinforced by the film’s promotional campaign. In a widely reported interview, Hoult claimed he was “nearly attacked” by “real wolves.” In fact, the animals involved were Czech shepherd dogs who played their roles a little too convincingly — not wolves at all. Horror producers sometimes play up events like this to heighten the sense of threat and drum up ticket sales, in this case using an erroneous wolf attack to do so. ​This isn’t limited to big-budget cinema. A recent independent horror, Out Come The Wolves, shows two men and a woman who are attacked by wolves during a weekend getaway. Meanwhile, a menacing love triangle plot plays out, in which a jealous would-be lover abandons his competition to a wolf attack. ​The behaviour of wild predators is presented as an allegory for an opportunistic approach to romance. All’s fair in love and wolves. The film also contains an explicit reference to wolf reintroduction: when hearing about the wolf attack, one character is sceptical, saying, “There haven’t been wolves in this area for years!” The message here is clear: as wolves come back to a landscape, so does the danger of attack. ​Each of these films draws on existing tropes and fears in slightly different ways. This is what horror does as a genre: it works with what scares us already and amplifies it for entertainment. But, in doing so, as high profile cinema events, they risk playing into inaccurate public perceptions. And because most people in Britain and Ireland will never encounter a wolf in the wild, these fictional wolves become their reference points. On screen versus reality ​There are valid concerns around wolves preying on sheep, calves or other livestock, but attacks on humans are extremely rare. A pack of wolves surrounding and repeatedly terrorising a home simply doesn’t happen. There is a strong ecological case for reintroducing wolves where they once lived. As apex predators, they reduce populations of deer and other animals, which can otherwise damage the environment, often by overgrazing. In Yellowstone National Park in the US, grey wolf reintroductions triggered a cascade of unexpected biodiversity benefits, as overgrazing elk were forced on the move, trees recovered, rivers stabilised, and beaver populations grew. ​The same is happening in Europe as wolves spread back into their original range. But to reintroduce wolves to the UK or Ireland, conservationists would have to physically transport them there. Opinion polls show approval rates of 52 percent in Ireland and just 36 percent in the UK. ​It’s hard to extract these numbers from the cumulative effect of centuries of storytelling, from ancient folklore through Victorian Gothic novels to modern Hollywood horror. They all contribute to the idea that wolves are dangerous and unpredictable and should be nowhere near humans. It’s meant as entertainment. But horror’s ongoing reliance on the wolf as a symbol of evil or violence may be damaging efforts to promote coexistence with healthy wild populations. Our natural landscapes need wolves. And right now, wolves need all the good PR they can get.

      "summary_orig": "The PTI announced on Wednesday that it would hold a “national conference” later this month, where a “national agenda” would be presented. The development comes days after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”. Since then, a war of words continued between the leaders of the ruling PML-N and PTI over the presser, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition. He insisted that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman, while the opposition party emphatically deplored “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson against ex-premier Imran Khan, saying he was “not a security threat”. The PTI has also faced restrictions in meeting the party’s incarcerated founder, with authorities using water cannons earlier today to disperse protesters, including Imran’s sisters, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier. The announcement was made by PTI leader Asad Qaiser after a meeting of the party’s parliamentary group at the Parliament House. Speaking to the media outside Parliament, he said the conference was scheduled for December 20-21. When asked about the conference’s agenda, the former speaker said the country was “facing serious issues” of instability and uncertainty. “Being an opposition alliance, it is the responsibility of the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to invite political parties, bar associations, civil society, media and other stakeholders to get together for brainstorming and finding a way forward,” said Qaiser while speaking to Dawn . Elaborating further, the senior PTI leader said the situation was tense on the country’s international borders and commercial activity, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, had declined. “Multinational companies have been leaving Pakistan. TTAP is the only platform from which a message can be given that things can be streamlined. In the conference, we will provide a solution for ongoing issues and outline the way forward,” he added. The PTI, earlier this week, said that excluding the party founder from politics would only weaken the political system. Last week, Barrister Gohar had extended an olive branch, saying there was a need to soften tones to break the political deadlock. However, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar stated that negotiations would not be held with the PTI and in case the government agreed to talks, it would be held in parliament and without Imran. Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, PTI’s relations with the government and the establishment have deteriorated sharply, marked by protests that frequently escalated into violence amid state repression .",

Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, PTI’s relations with the government and the establishment have deteriorated sharply, marked by protests that frequently escalated into violence amid state repression .",
      "title": "PTI announces ‘national conference’, claims Pakistan faces ‘serious issues’",
      "summary": "The PTI announced on Wednesday that it would hold a “national conference” later this month, where a “national agenda” would be presented. The development comes days after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”. Since then, a war of words continued between the leaders of the ruling PML-N and PTI over the presser, with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif saying Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition. He insisted that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman, while the opposition party emphatically deplored “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson against ex-premier Imran Khan, saying he was “not a security threat”. The PTI has also faced restrictions in meeting the party’s incarcerated founder, with authorities using water cannons earlier today to disperse protesters, including Imran’s sisters, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier. The announcement was made by PTI leader Asad Qaiser after a meeting of the party’s parliamentary group at the Parliament House. Speaking to the media outside Parliament, he said the conference was scheduled for December 20-21. When asked about the conference’s agenda, the former speaker said the country was “facing serious issues” of instability and uncertainty. “Being an opposition alliance, it is the responsibility of the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to invite political parties, bar associations, civil society, media and other stakeholders to get together for brainstorming and finding a way forward,” said Qaiser while speaking to Dawn . Elaborating further, the senior PTI leader said the situation was tense on the country’s international borders and commercial activity, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, had declined. “Multinational companies have been leaving Pakistan. TTAP is the only platform from which a message can be given that things can be streamlined. In the conference, we will provide a solution for ongoing issues and outline the way forward,” he added. The PTI, earlier this week, said that excluding the party founder from politics would only weaken the political system. Last week, Barrister Gohar had extended an olive branch, saying there was a need to soften tones to break the political deadlock. However, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar stated that negotiations would not be held with the PTI and in case the government agreed to talks, it would be held in parliament and without Imran. Since Imran’s incarceration in several cases, PTI’s relations with the government and the establishment have deteriorated sharply, marked by protests that frequently escalated into violence amid state repression .",

      "summary_orig": "The war of words between members of the PTI and ruling coalition continued on Wednesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”. The tensions have particularly intensified in recent days after the spokesperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on December 6, in response to Imran’s latest outburst against the military leadership. Politicians from various parties have rallied behind the armed forces since, chastising the PTI. Yesterday, the Punjab Assembly also adopted a resolution calling for a ban on Imran and his party, terming them “anti-state”. ‘Things have reached a point of no return’ Earlier today, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan said that “things have reached a point of no return”. Addressing a press conference, Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance.” “All doors to talks are now closed,” Wali said. He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour, and development”. “We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what [else] can be done”. Wali alleged that “PTI, in its four years in power, had done nothing,” challenging the party to “show at least one university, hospital or dam” they built. “It was a blessing from God that the Centre, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan have remained safe from the PTI’s dirty politics,” he remarked, warning that the government “will now set KP free as well.” ‘Common sense should prevail’ Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament. Among them, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections. “We did not stage a sit-in back then […] We sat in Parliament, believing that our voices will be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties will be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years. But, he continued, “at some point, common sense should prevail”. Seemingly referring to the bar on meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, he added: “If you keep parents in jail, […] how can the children sit together with you? And if you don’t understand this, then probably the public will make you understand.” He again stressed that the use of force would not yield any results. “Common sense should prevail.” Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.” In this connection, he also claimed that Imran had the support of at least 70 per cent people in the country. “Don’t enrage the people of Pakistan,” he warned, adding that “we haven’t done anything in violation of the Constitution”. He emphasised that meetings with Imran should be allowed, pointing out that the high court had also issued an order, directing that meetings with the former prime minister be permitted. “If you create hurdles [in this regard], then we don’t know what your intentions are. But if you get a response from the other side, the country and democracy would suffer a loss,” he warned, adding that whether the government did not want the PTI to sit in Parliament. He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday. The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.” “You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked. ‘Meeting necessary for dialogue’ Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside Parliament. Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan. “How can we negotiate without his permission?” Referring to the PTI’s sit-in outside the Adiala jail the previous night for Imran’s visitation rights and the alleged use of force by authorities to disperse the protesters, he said the leg of PTI parliamentary leader in the National Assembly Shahid Khattak “had been broken”. He warned, “If the public rises, everything will burn down. Before destruction strikes, we should move towards dialogue.” And for that, he reiterated, meetings with the PTI founder should be allowed. For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “national conference” on December 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited. A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.“ Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adialia jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”. Moreover, he demanded that merit should be considered in cases concerning Imran, further stating: “We are united; we will not be afraid.” ‘Dark period’ Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addresses a press conference, assailing the PTI its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history. “He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said. “It is the same Khan who was willing to give General Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.” “Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?” The senior minister stressed that PTI’s narrative “hinged only on the release of Imran and the party coming back into power,” adding that “they did not care about the common people.” PTI’s ‘venomous rhetoric should be recognised abroad’: Aun Chaudhry Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakistanis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI. “I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these groups,” Chaudhry said. “I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong,” he urged. “Our country is progressing towards success, but this group is creating such an environment,” the minister said. He continued: “It’s tweeting against the military leadership, sometimes against the government, who is getting it done? Who is the mastermind behind it? Whoever is behind it does not want peace in this country. They don’t want this country to progress.” “Don’t you think about the martyred soldier and his orphaned kids? Don’t you pay heed that the soldier sacrifices his life and leaves his own kids as orphans so that other kids don’t become orphans? So that we can enjoy a sound sleep?” the minister questioned. “We have a secure border and a secure future because our armed forces are backing us,” Chaudhry added.",

      "summary_en": "The war of words between members of the PTI and ruling coalition continued on Wednesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”. The tensions have particularly intensified in recent days after the spokesperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on December 6, in response to Imran’s latest outburst against the military leadership. Politicians from various parties have rallied behind the armed forces since, chastising the PTI. Yesterday, the Punjab Assembly also adopted a resolution calling for a ban on Imran and his party, terming them “anti-state”. ‘Things have reached a point of no return’ Earlier today, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan said that “things have reached a point of no return”. Addressing a press conference, Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance.” “All doors to talks are now closed,” Wali said. He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour, and development”. “We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what [else] can be done”. Wali alleged that “PTI, in its four years in power, had done nothing,” challenging the party to “show at least one university, hospital or dam” they built. “It was a blessing from God that the Centre, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan have remained safe from the PTI’s dirty politics,” he remarked, warning that the government “will now set KP free as well.” ‘Common sense should prevail’ Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament. Among them, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections. “We did not stage a sit-in back then […] We sat in Parliament, believing that our voices will be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties will be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years.

      "summary_orig": "Senior PTI leader and former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi was discharged from hospital - where he was admitted for a surgery - and transferred back to Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat prison, his lawyer Rana Mudassar Umer said on Wednesday. Qureshi was hospitalised last month at the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute for gallbladder stone complications, where he underwent a successful procedure to remove the stone. Umer said he was discharged from the hospital after his condition improved, while tests were conducted, and their reports would be released in 15 days. The PTI leader has been indicted in multiple cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023, riots and has remained behind bars since August 2023.

      "summary_orig": "The Supreme Court (SC) will take up on Thursday (December 11) the application of lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir, seeking an early hearing of her plea for a stay in the trial of the controversial social media post case. On December 4, Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, were facing trial before the additional sessions judge and Peca (Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016) special judge in the controversial tweets case. On December 1, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) denied the couple ad-interim relief of staying the trial. They appealed the IHC order before the SC through their counsel, Faisal Siddiqi. In their subsequent application from December 4, the petitioners pleaded that the criminal trial against them was at its concluding stage and therefore, extreme urgency in the matter was required. The application also pleaded that the petitioners filed a criminal revision before the IHC to question the trial proceedings in view of violations of due process as prescribed under CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in the absence of the petitioners. Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, a three-judge SC bench also consisting of Justices Salahuddin Panwhar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim will hear the plea. The application argued that the petitioners have a clear prima facie case because the recording of evidence in their absence was not only a violation of Section 353 (evidence to be taken in the presence of the accused) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), but also their due process and fair trial rights under Article 10A of the Constitution. “As the criminal trial is at its concluding stage, the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioners because the prosecution would not be prejudiced if the trial is delayed for two weeks,” the application argued. However, the criminal revision application filed by the couple before the IHC would be rendered unnecessary, due to the lack of ad-interim relief to stay the trial. Mazari and Chatha would suffer irreparable loss, not only because the criminal revision application would become infructuous, but because of the violations of due process and principles of fair trial in the trial proceedings. “It is obvious and apparent that this unfair trial is leading to a criminal conviction of the petitioners,” the application stated. “The November 29 order of the additional sessions judge and Peca special judge clearly showed that the trial was at the stage of recording a statement under Section 342 (power to examine the accused) of the CrPC, and there was a clear and present danger that this trial would lead to the criminal conviction of the petitioners. Thus, the present criminal appeal will become infructuous,” the application argued. “In terms of Section 7 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, it is expressly stated that any application pleading urgency will be fixed for hearing within a period of 14 days,” the application pleaded. It further argued that this is a criminal appeal involving the liberty of the petitioners and therefore should be treated urgently as per the SC’s policy on urgent applications, the application pleaded. “Failing an urgency being allowed by this court, the interest of justice will seriously be prejudiced and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioners in the form of possible criminal convictions,” the application argued. The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered a case against Mazari and Chatha, accusing the two of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country. Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka had indicted the two in the case, in which both denied the charges. The complaint had accused Mazari of having disseminated and “propagated narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for re-posting some posts of his wife. According to the appeal, the complainants disclosed no specific allegations and cherry-picked a few posts made by the petitioners on social media platform X, as far back as 2021.",

      "summary_orig": "Japan has scrambled jets to monitor Russian and Chinese air forces conducting joint patrols around the country, the Japanese defence ministry said late Tuesday, amid rising tensions between Tokyo and Beijing. Two Russian Tu-95 nuclear-capable strategic bombers flew from the Sea of Japan toward the East China Sea to rendezvous with two Chinese H-6 bombers, and performed a “long-distance joint flight” in the Pacific, the ministry said. Four Chinese J-16 fighter jets joined the bombers as they made a round-trip flight between Japan’s Okinawa and Miyako islands, it added. The Miyako Strait between the two islands is classified as international waters. Japan also detected simultaneous Russian air force activity in the Sea of Japan, consisting of one early-warning aircraft A-50 and two Su-30 fighters, the ministry said. Japanese Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said in a post on X on Wednesday that the Russian and Chinese joint operations were “clearly intended as a show of force against our nation, which is a serious concern for our national security.” Japan’s fighter jets “strictly implemented air defence identification measures,” Koizumi added. Russian news agencies reported that the Russian-Chinese joint flight near Japan lasted for eight hours, citing Moscow’s defence ministry. South Korea’s military also said on Tuesday that seven Russian planes and two Chinese planes had entered its air defence zone. Japan said on Sunday that Chinese carrier-launched fighter jets aimed radar at Japanese military aircraft a day earlier, an claim Beijing disputed. Beijing’s rising military actions near Japan follow Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s comment last month that Tokyo could respond to any Chinese military action against Taiwan that also threatened Japan’s security. China and Russia have been ramping up military cooperation in recent years elsewhere, conducting joint operations such as an anti-missile training on Russian territory and live-fire naval exercises in the South China Sea.",

      "summary_orig": "Venezuela’s Maria Corina Machado is safe and will be in Oslo, the Norwegian Nobel Institute said in a statement on Wednesday. Earlier, the organisers said the Venezuelan opposition leader, who lives in hiding, will not attend Wednesday’s Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, and the award will be accepted by her daughter. Machado has only been seen once in public since going underground in August last year, amidst a tense showdown with President Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela’s attorney general has said the 58-year-old would be considered a “fugitive” if she left the country to accept the award. It was not known in the hours before the ceremony whether Machado was in Norway for the event due to start at 1pm (5pm PKT). The Nobel Institute finally confirmed that she would not be there. “It will be her daughter Ana Corina Machado who will receive the prize in her mother’s name,” Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken told Norway’s NRK radio. “Her daughter will give the speech that Maria Corina herself wrote.” Harpviken said he “simply” did not know where Machado was. Few people were informed of Machado’s movements because of the nature of Maduro’s “repressive regime, which is willing to use absolutely all means against the opposition”, he said, noting that she “lives under a death threat from the regime”. Machado’s mother and three daughters, and some Latin American heads of state, including Argentine President Javier Milei, are in Norway for the prize-giving at Oslo’s City Hall. ‘Fugitive’ laureate While organisers said Machado had previously indicated she would attend, suspicions had already been raised when a traditional press conference with the award winner on Tuesday was first postponed and then cancelled. Machado has accused Maduro of stealing Venezuela’s July 2024 election, which she was banned from. Her claim is backed by much of the international community. Machado has been hailed for her efforts in favour of democracy, but she has also been criticised for aligning herself with US President Donald Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel Prize. The Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug smuggling boats. Maduro insists that the goal of the US operations —  which Machado has said are justified —  is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves. Since going into hiding, her only public appearance was on January 9 in Caracas, where she protested against Maduro’s inauguration for his third term. The opposition claimed its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the election. He now lives in exile and was also in Oslo on Wednesday. Machado was awarded the Nobel on October 10 for her efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela, challenging Maduro’s iron-fisted rule since 2013. Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, said last month the opposition leader would be considered a “fugitive” if she travelled to Norway to accept the prize. “By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive,” Saab told AFP , adding that she is accused of “acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism”. “It has happened multiple times in the history of the Peace Prize that the laureate has been prevented from attending the ceremony, and on those occasions it’s always been the case that close family members of the laureate will receive the prize and give the lecture in the place of the laureate,” Harpviken explained this week. Doubts had been raised about how Machado would return to Venezuela. “She risks being arrested if she returns, even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value,” said Benedicte Bull, a professor specialised in Latin America at the University of Oslo. On the other hand, “she is the undisputed leader of the opposition, but if she were to stay away in exile for a long time, I think that would change, and she would gradually lose political influence,” she added. Both pro- and anti-Machado protests are expected in Oslo on Wednesday. The Nobel laureates in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics will receive their prizes at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Wednesday.",

      "title_orig": "Water cannons used to disperse PTI protesters staging sit-in outside Adiala jail",
      "summary_orig": "The PTI said early on Wednesday that authorities used water cannons to disperse protesters, including the sisters of PTI founder Imran Khan, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier. In a post on X at 3:58am, the party said, “Pakistani authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala Jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM. “This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene. In another post , the party said that Imran’s family was deliberately blocked from meeting him, which led to the sit-in. It said that the use of water cannons was “not only a shameless violation of Imran Khan’s prisoner rights but also an outright assault on the constitutional rights of people who gathered to protest the regime’s atrocities”. “International human rights organisations and champions of democracy must not stay silent in the face of such inhumane and authoritarian actions in Pakistan,” the party said. In yet another post, Imran’s sisters Aleema, telling drenched participants of the sit-in, “Kids, ghabrana nahin hai (don’t panic) … its just water, don’t panic because of water.” PTI stages sit-in The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration. Police had contacted Imran’s sisters twice and suggested that they leave. Later, a heavy contingent of police was deployed at the scene. The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”. Speaking in video statements as she made her way to the prison on Tuesday, Aleema alleged that the state had been breaking the law, while maintaining that the PTI had done nothing illegal. “If they do operate illegally and we do our work according to the law, and if they are right and we are wrong, then that shows just how our system works,” she said, She then highlighted that Imran has not been allowed to meet his personal physician for the past 14 months. “What is the issue in allowing one doctor to meet Imran Khan?” she asked. “When Nawaz Sharif went to jail, a doctor was with him all day, counting his platelets. “What sort of system is this?” Aleema then exited her car and began to walk towards Adiala jail, accompanied by a large crowd of party members and supporters. She made it to Gorakhpur Market on Adiala Road — roughly a kilometre southwest of the prison — before being stopped by riot police. Sitting at the police barricade, Aleema delivered another statement on video. “This is unconstitutional and illegal. Why are they keeping Imran Khan isolated and tortured?” she asked. “These people are violating the Constitution and breaking the law. “We will not move from here; they can beat us with sticks or shoot us,” Aleema added. “Do what you will.” Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan spoke to reporters at Dahgal, just up the road from the prison and urged authorities to allow meetings with Imran, stating that it would “improve the situation”. “We have a right to come here, and there is a court order allowing us to be here,” Gohar argued. “We had an agreement and a consent order that family and legal counsel could meet him (Imran), but even today, we have been stopped.” “There are a lot of things we are trying to do, but they are not in our control. But if we are allowed to meet, if he is allowed to meet his wife then it will improve the situation.” Gohar also said that there cannot be division in the country and while there is disagreement in politics, there should not be hostility. He left the area without meeting the PTI founder. PTI Secretary General Raja said there was no excuse to bar Imran’s sisters from meeting him, as it is one’s right to meet relatives. “No one can deny the right to meet by saying that Imran Khan’s message was shared outside,” he said. PTI provincial president Akbar said that a large number of party workers and supporters reached Adiala Jail because of a challenge from Senator Faisal Vawda. “We have come here prepared and are willing to sit here the whole night,” Akbar said. “We hope that the meeting will be arranged, but workers are charged and we are ready for a prolonged sit-in.” He added that the distance between people and state institutions is increasing, stating that the PTI does not want the gap to grow. “People have started hating you, so you should think wisely,” said Akbar. It remains unclear whom he was addressing. Similarly, PTI MNA Shahid Khattak said that they were peaceful people and would demonstrate peacefully. “I am a parliamentary leader of the PTI in the National Assembly and it is my right to meet Imran Khan,” he said. “Workers have arrived here just because they love Imran Khan and they think that only he can address the issues of Pakistan.” Khattak also said that a policy should be made to address the issue of military operations in tribal areas. “We have no objection to drone attacks, but drones don’t strike the right targets, due to which civilians are being killed. I suggest that the elders of tribal areas be involved in negotiating with the terrorists. In the past, we were having tea in Afghanistan and now Afghans have been declared enemies,” the MNA added. Meanwhile, KP MPA Shafiullah Jan said that in the mainstream media, someone was saying that nobody would reach Adiala Jail. “He should see that we have reached here,” he stated. “I think anger has grown among workers after the press conference of DG ISPR. We will sit here unless one of the sisters is allowed to meet with Imran Khan.” Last Tuesday, Uzma was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as she went inside the prison to meet her brother. When she exited, she delivered remarks on Imran’s behalf, which were later posted to his X account. These remarks were critical of army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and prompted a fiery response from the military’s spokesperson last Friday, who branded Imran “mentally ill” and a “narcissist”. Last Thursday the federal government barred Uzma and others from meeting Imran over alleged violations of the prison code. “There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen,” said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar. That same day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the ninth time. He addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access and said he would update the media on the future course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not. The next day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “the gloves are off” and that anyone protesting outside Adiala jail, where PTI founder Imran Khan is currently incarcerated, would be dealt with harshly . The minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.",

In yet another post, Imran’s sisters Aleema, telling drenched participants of the sit-in, “Kids, ghabrana nahin hai (don’t panic) … its just water, don’t panic because of water.” PTI stages sit-in The sit-in, led by Aleema and also including Imran’s other sisters Uzma and Noreen, was staged outside the jail on Tuesday after she was once again denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Senior party members, including PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and PTI KP Provincial President Junaid Akbar Khan, had also joined the demonstration. Police had contacted Imran’s sisters twice and suggested that they leave. Later, a heavy contingent of police was deployed at the scene. The PTI has made multiple attempts to meet the incarcerated party founder, being denied an audience each time by jail authorities despite a court order allowing meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, last week, the authorities allowed Uzma Khan, another one of Imran’s sisters, to meet her incarcerated brother. After the visit, she said he was “perfectly fine”. Speaking in video statements as she made her way to the prison on Tuesday, Aleema alleged that the state had been breaking the law, while maintaining that the PTI had done nothing illegal. “If they do operate illegally and we do our work according to the law, and if they are right and we are wrong, then that shows just how our system works,” she said, She then highlighted that Imran has not been allowed to meet his personal physician for the past 14 months. “What is the issue in allowing one doctor to meet Imran Khan?” she asked. “When Nawaz Sharif went to jail, a doctor was with him all day, counting his platelets. “What sort of system is this?” Aleema then exited her car and began to walk towards Adiala jail, accompanied by a large crowd of party members and supporters. She made it to Gorakhpur Market on Adiala Road — roughly a kilometre southwest of the prison — before being stopped by riot police. Sitting at the police barricade, Aleema delivered another statement on video. “This is unconstitutional and illegal. Why are they keeping Imran Khan isolated and tortured?” she asked. “These people are violating the Constitution and breaking the law. “We will not move from here; they can beat us with sticks or shoot us,” Aleema added. “Do what you will.” Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan spoke to reporters at Dahgal, just up the road from the prison and urged authorities to allow meetings with Imran, stating that it would “improve the situation”. “We have a right to come here, and there is a court order allowing us to be here,” Gohar argued. “We had an agreement and a consent order that family and legal counsel could meet him (Imran), but even today, we have been stopped.” “There are a lot of things we are trying to do, but they are not in our control. But if we are allowed to meet, if he is allowed to meet his wife then it will improve the situation.” Gohar also said that there cannot be division in the country and while there is disagreement in politics, there should not be hostility. He left the area without meeting the PTI founder. PTI Secretary General Raja said there was no excuse to bar Imran’s sisters from meeting him, as it is one’s right to meet relatives. “No one can deny the right to meet by saying that Imran Khan’s message was shared outside,” he said. PTI provincial president Akbar said that a large number of party workers and supporters reached Adiala Jail because of a challenge from Senator Faisal Vawda. “We have come here prepared and are willing to sit here the whole night,” Akbar said. “We hope that the meeting will be arranged, but workers are charged and we are ready for a prolonged sit-in.” He added that the distance between people and state institutions is increasing, stating that the PTI does not want the gap to grow. “People have started hating you, so you should think wisely,” said Akbar. It remains unclear whom he was addressing. Similarly, PTI MNA Shahid Khattak said that they were peaceful people and would demonstrate peacefully. “I am a parliamentary leader of the PTI in the National Assembly and it is my right to meet Imran Khan,” he said. “Workers have arrived here just because they love Imran Khan and they think that only he can address the issues of Pakistan.” Khattak also said that a policy should be made to address the issue of military operations in tribal areas. “We have no objection to drone attacks, but drones don’t strike the right targets, due to which civilians are being killed. I suggest that the elders of tribal areas be involved in negotiating with the terrorists. In the past, we were having tea in Afghanistan and now Afghans have been declared enemies,” the MNA added. Meanwhile, KP MPA Shafiullah Jan said that in the mainstream media, someone was saying that nobody would reach Adiala Jail. “He should see that we have reached here,” he stated. “I think anger has grown among workers after the press conference of DG ISPR. We will sit here unless one of the sisters is allowed to meet with Imran Khan.” Last Tuesday, Uzma was accompanied by scores of PTI supporters who gathered outside the jail as she went inside the prison to meet her brother. When she exited, she delivered remarks on Imran’s behalf, which were later posted to his X account. These remarks were critical of army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and prompted a fiery response from the military’s spokesperson last Friday, who branded Imran “mentally ill” and a “narcissist”. Last Thursday the federal government barred Uzma and others from meeting Imran over alleged violations of the prison code. “There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen,” said Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar. That same day, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the ninth time. He addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access and said he would update the media on the future course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not. The next day, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that “the gloves are off” and that anyone protesting outside Adiala jail, where PTI founder Imran Khan is currently incarcerated, would be dealt with harshly . The minister said that strict action would be taken against any individual who creates a law and order situation outside the prison, including arrests and the registration of legal cases.",

      "summary": "The PTI said early on Wednesday that authorities used water cannons to disperse protesters, including the sisters of PTI founder Imran Khan, who were staging a sit-in outside Adiala jail after being denied a meeting with the ex-premier. In a post on X at 3:58am, the party said, “Pakistani authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala Jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM. “This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said.

      "summary_orig": "Thailand and Cambodia accused each other of targeting civilians in border attacks on Wednesday, as US President Donald Trump said he would make a phone call to stop the fighting and salvage a ceasefire he brokered in July. The two Southeast Asian nations have each blamed the other for the clashes that started on Monday, and remain at odds on a diplomatic solution to the border tensions that have been simmering for months. Thailand’s foreign minister said in an interview on Tuesday that he saw no potential for negotiations, adding the situation was not conducive to third-party mediation, while a top adviser to Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet told Reuters his country was “ready to talk at any time”. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania on Tuesday evening, Trump listed a number of wars that he claimed he helped stop, including between Pakistan and India , and Israel and Iran, before commenting on the renewed conflict in Southeast Asia. “I hate to say this one, named Cambodia–Thailand and it started up today and tomorrow I am going to have to make a phone call. Who else could say I’m going to make a phone call and stop a war of two very powerful countries, Thailand and Cambodia.” Asked about the prospect of Trump intervening again, Cambodian government spokesperson Pen Bona said Phnom Penh’s position remained the same, that it wanted only peace. A Thai government spokesperson said he did not know if the prime minister had spoken to Trump, as he was in parliament. Claims civilian areas hit Cambodia on Wednesday withdrew its athletes from the Southeast Asian Games in Thailand, citing safety reasons and serious concerns from the team’s families. Thailand’s military said BM-21 rockets fired by Cambodian forces landed near the Phanom Dong Rak Hospital in Surin district on Wednesday morning, forcing the evacuation of patients and staff to a shelter. It also said drones, BM-21 rockets and tanks were used at other border points, including near the contested Preah Vihear temple complex. “Our forces destroyed an anti-drone position to the south of Chong Chom in order to support operations to clear Cambodian elements in a mango plantation that has been planted across the line of operations,” the military said in a situation update. Cambodia’s military said Thailand had used artillery fire and armed drones to launch attacks in Pursat province, fired mortars into civilian residences in Battambang province, and Thai F-16 fighter jets had entered Cambodian airspace and dropped bombs near civilian areas. Land mine allegations raised tensions Trump has previously spoken to leaders of both countries and been central to the fragile truce between them since five days of fighting in July, which killed at least 48 people and was the heaviest clashes between the two in recent history. In July, Trump used the leverage of trade negotiations to broker a ceasefire. Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow told Reuters on Tuesday he did not think the threat of tariffs should be used to pressure his country into talks. Thailand last month suspended de-escalation measures that were agreed at an October summit in Trump’s presence, after a Thai soldier was maimed by a landmine that Bangkok said was newly laid by Cambodia, which rejects the allegation. Both countries have said they have evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from border areas. As of Tuesday night, Cambodia’s Defence Ministry said nine civilians had been killed since Monday and 20 seriously injured, while Thai officials said four soldiers had been killed and 68 had been injured.",

      "summary_orig": "ABBOTTABAD: An anti-terrorism court handed over the accused in the Dr Warda Mushtaq murder case to the police here on Tuesday on a three-day physical remand amid street protests against the medical doctor’s brutal killing in various parts of the province. Waheed Billa, husband of accused Rida, and others were presented before the ATC, which remanded them in police custody. In order to prevent any untoward incident in light of the people’s anger, the district administration sealed all cloth shops in the city belonging to Billa’s family. The key accused in the case, Shamrez, is still at large, increasing people’s resentment against police. Dr Warda was laid to rest in the cantonment area graveyard on Monday night after funeral prayers were offered at 10pm. Medical staff members of the hospital were among the people who took the body toher house for final rituals. A pall of gloom descended over the place, with most people having teary eyes. With the doctor’s children, father, brother and other relatives present, some of them fainted. Fellow doctors went to Dr Warda’s grave and placed wreaths. DIG of Hazara police Nasir Mahmood Satti said the investigation into the murder would consider all aspects. A special police investigation team under the patronage of DPO Haroonur Rashid has already been formed. Those named in the case have been arrested, while special teams have been formed to arrest crime facilitators. “We will fulfil all legal requirements and bring killers and their facilitators to justice,” he said. Meanwhile, the DPO removed Sub-Inspector Zubair Khan from the post of the SHO at the Cantonment Police Station and appointed Inspector Ali Jadoon in his place. Health minister Khaliqur Rehman visited the deceased’s house and offered condolences to the family. He pledged all possible support to it. “The brutal murder of Dr. Warda Mushtaq is a big tragedy. The government is taking it very seriously and will ensure dispensation of justice at all costs. The accused won’t get off scot-free,” he said. The minister later visited the Benazir Teaching Hospital Abbottabad and met the representatives of the doctors association. “The safety of doctors is the top priority of our government. Those serving in the health sector are a valuable asset to us,” he said. He said a JIT had been formed to conduct a transparent investigation into the murder and it was discharging its responsibility in a completely professional manner. Doctors at the Benazir Shaheed Hospital observed a complete strike. A condolence reference was also held to pay tribute to the deceased. Doctors, nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees participated and prayed for Dr Warda. They also demanded exemplary punishment for the killers. The doctors of Ayub Medical Complex staged a protest sit-in on the Silk Road. Along with nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees, they demanded that the killers and their facilitators be brought to justice. The protesters shouted slogans against the district administration and police and demanded the arrest of the SHO of the Cantonment police station and DSP (Cantt). Also, medical staff members at the tehsil headquarters hospitals in Havelian and Lora staged street protests. In Mansehra, doctors, paramedics and nurses from across upper parts of Hazara Division observed a complete strike, suspending all health services, except emergency for patients. They also took to the streets and demanded exemplary punishment for the killers. Healthcare professionals at public-sector facilities in Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Kohistan and Kolai-Palas districts participated in the strike. Published in Dawn, December 10th, 2025",

DIG of Hazara police Nasir Mahmood Satti said the investigation into the murder would consider all aspects. A special police investigation team under the patronage of DPO Haroonur Rashid has already been formed. Those named in the case have been arrested, while special teams have been formed to arrest crime facilitators. “We will fulfil all legal requirements and bring killers and their facilitators to justice,” he said. Meanwhile, the DPO removed Sub-Inspector Zubair Khan from the post of the SHO at the Cantonment Police Station and appointed Inspector Ali Jadoon in his place. Health minister Khaliqur Rehman visited the deceased’s house and offered condolences to the family. He pledged all possible support to it. “The brutal murder of Dr. Warda Mushtaq is a big tragedy. The government is taking it very seriously and will ensure dispensation of justice at all costs. The accused won’t get off scot-free,” he said. The minister later visited the Benazir Teaching Hospital Abbottabad and met the representatives of the doctors association. “The safety of doctors is the top priority of our government. Those serving in the health sector are a valuable asset to us,” he said. He said a JIT had been formed to conduct a transparent investigation into the murder and it was discharging its responsibility in a completely professional manner. Doctors at the Benazir Shaheed Hospital observed a complete strike. A condolence reference was also held to pay tribute to the deceased. Doctors, nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees participated and prayed for Dr Warda. They also demanded exemplary punishment for the killers. The doctors of Ayub Medical Complex staged a protest sit-in on the Silk Road. Along with nurses, paramedics and Class IV employees, they demanded that the killers and their facilitators be brought to justice. The protesters shouted slogans against the district administration and police and demanded the arrest of the SHO of the Cantonment police station and DSP (Cantt). Also, medical staff members at the tehsil headquarters hospitals in Havelian and Lora staged street protests. In Mansehra, doctors, paramedics and nurses from across upper parts of Hazara Division observed a complete strike, suspending all health services, except emergency for patients. They also took to the streets and demanded exemplary punishment for the killers. Healthcare professionals at public-sector facilities in Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Kohistan and Kolai-Palas districts participated in the strike. Published in Dawn, December 10th, 2025",
