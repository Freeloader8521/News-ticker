The airport operator said its aviation security level has been raised to the third tier out of a five-level security system, up one tier from its previous status.

New X-ray screening requirements will lead to women having to remove shoes with heels higher than 3.5 centimeters, due to potential safety threats.

      "title_orig": "Kundi seeks PM’s intervention against ‘unconstitutional’ restrictions on inter-provincial movement of wheat",
      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Monday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif against “unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province. The development comes as the Punjab government has faced criticism by the KP and Sindh governments for choking wheat flow to the two provinces. However, a day earlier, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari insisted that there was no ban on the inter-provincial movement of wheat, terming the “ongoing propaganda in this regard baseless and contrary to facts”. In a post on social media platform X today, the KP governor said he had written to the premier, urging his “immediate intervention to lift the unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province. “Such limitations not only affect the province’s food security but also go against the spirit of cooperative federalism enshrined in our Constitution,” he said. He expressed his confidence that the matter would be resolved promptly “under the prime minister’s leadership”. The letter, which Kundi also posted on X, termed the restrictions a “serious concern”, pointing out that KP was a “wheat-deficient province and depends substantially on inter-provincial inflows to meet its essential food requirements”. It said that the restrictions were against Article 151 of the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse among the provinces. “Any disruption in supply risks creating artificial shortages, price escalation and public hardship,” he said. “It has further been observed that these limitations are unintentionally encouraging illegal and informal transportation of wheat through alternate means and routes, which is resulting in uncontrollable supply distortions in the open market. This diversion is causing [a] rapid escalation in wheat and flour prices, directly burdening the general public and potentially triggering unwarranted public resentment,” he said. Kundi requested PM Shehbaz’s “kind and immediate intervention in this matter and direction to the concerned authorities” to withdraw the restrictions in order to ensure the “uninterrupted and legally protected movement of wheat” into KP. “I remain confident that, under your leadership, the constitutional rights of the people of KP will be safeguarded effectively and without delay,” he said. Kundi seeks restoration of daily int’l flights from Peshawar Separately, the KP governor wrote to Defence Minister Khawaja Asif requesting him to restore daily flights between Peshawar and Karachi, as well as international ones, “particularly to the Gulf and Middle Eastern countries”. “The suspension of these (international) flights has caused considerable hardship for overseas Pakistanis, entrepreneurs and their families,” Kundi said in a later post on X, noting that a “large expatriate population” from KP was employed in the Middle East. Kundi further said a “single private airline is operating with absolute monopoly” on the route between Peshawar and Karachi, inconveniencing people and traders due to exorbitant fares and limited seat availability. The governor requested Asif to issue directions to restore the flight services, adding, “I also earnestly hope and pray that our National Flag Bearer airline will once again ascend to command the skies of the world as it gloriously did during the golden decades of the 1960s and 1970s.” KP’s grievances In the aftermath of the recent floods, the Punjab government had begun tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage. The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement. While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement. On Sept 7, Kundi had regretted the reports that Punjab had banned the movement of wheat to other provinces. He had issued another condemnation of the reported ban the very next day in a post on social media platform X. “The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi had said on X. The Constitution’s Article 151 states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”. The KP governor had further said: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation. “On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban.” Meanwhile, on Sept 7, the KP Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province. Subsequently, the government had approved a national wheat policy earlier this month. According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, stakeholders were told during a briefing about the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat. Then, in a letter dated October 23, the KP government had asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province. KP’s food secretary, in a letter to his Punjab counterpart, said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security. The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depended on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day. “The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read. While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements. KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force. “This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said. The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by PM Shehbaz, on October 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025 . “The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said. Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed. Last week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had again condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to the province, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province. Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat. Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable. Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5m tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces.",

      "summary_orig": "Six people, including five Levies Force personnel, were injured in a bomb blast targeting the convoy of Kech Deputy Commissioner (DC) Major (retd) Bashir Barech in Balochistan’s Turbat on Monday, according to police. Kech Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Captain (retd) Zohaib Mohsin told Dawn.com that a remote-controlled bomb was used in the attack that took place at Press Club road. “The bomb, which was planted in a motorcycle, was triggered using a remote control when the DC’s convoy was passing by the area,” he said, adding that five Levies personnel and a passerby were injured in the incident. The Kech DC remained safe, he added. One of the vehicles in his convoy was also severely damaged, the SSP said. Police and Frontier Corps personnel had reached the site of the incident and were further investigating the matter, he said. Pakistan has witnessed an increase in terrorist attacks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The increase followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s move to end a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. On Saturday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while addressing the Balochistan Workshop in Islamabad, regretted the resurgence of terrorism in Balochistan and other regions, calling for a serious look at “the reasons that led to the unrest”. One of the recent incidents of terrorism in the province took place on October 9, when a bomb exploded on a railway track near Dera Murad Jamali. The track connects Balochistan to the rest of the country. A railway employee was killed in the incident while train services were suspended following the fourth incident of such nature in a month. This incident followed a blast in the provincial capital of Quetta on September 30. At least 10 people were martyred and 32 injured in the incident when a bomb blast had ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s FC headquarters. A week prior to that, women and chil­dren were among 12 people injured wh­en the Quetta-bound Jaf­far Express was targeted in a bomb blast in the Spizend area of Balochistan’s Mas­tung district. In another explosion near a taxi stand in the Pak-Afghan border area of ​​Chaman on September 18, at least five people were killed and one was injured. Similarly, at least five people were killed and 29 injured in a blast at a rally of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium on September 2.",

      "summary_orig": "After staying out of favour in the Twenty20 International format for Pakistan’s last five assignments, former skipper Babar Azam was picked for the upcoming three-match series against South Africa only after fellow batter Fakhar Zaman decided to skip it, white-ball head coach Mike Hesson said on Sunday. Since Hesson took over the role in June, Babar hasn’t featured for Pakistan in T20Is with the national side playing series against Bangladesh, the West Indies and a tri-nation series followed by the Asia Cup during that period. Hesson had cited the right-hander’s low strike-rate as the reason for his absence. But Babar’s selection for the series, which starts in Rawalpindi on Tuesday raised suggested a change of mind for the coach before the New Zealander clarified it. “I certainly endorse his selection,” Hesson said of Babar while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of Pakistan’s training session at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. “We’ve sent him (Fakhar) back to first-class cricket after a conversation with him. “He wanted to focus on improving his technique for one-day cricket, so we gave him a bit of a break from T20s. That’s created an opportunity for another top-order player.” Hesson confirmed that Babar will take the number three spot instead of the batter’s preferred opening position, where he flourished for Pakistan for a substantial period before eventually falling in form and then out of favour. The coach, however, has expectations from Babar to make a strong comeback and suggested he saw him in Pakistan’s plans for the T20 World Cup, which is set to be held in February-March next year in India and Sri Lanka. “It’s a great chance to have Babar back,” said the coach. “He’s likely to bat at number three, a role I’m confident he’ll perform well in. “It also gives our squad some flexibility ahead of the [T20] World Cup.” ‘Haris needs to work’ Babar’s unexpected return also coincided with the axing of wicket-keeper-batter Mohammad Haris from the Pakistan squad even after he received ample backing from the team management across Hesson’s tenure so far. The 24-year-old proved his mettle with a century against Bangladesh back in June but gradually lost form amid frequent change of batting positions. Hesson believed Haris needed to go back to the drawing board to fix his issues. “Haris has had a number of opportunities recently, and he’d be the first to admit he hasn’t made the most of them,” he said. “But he’s still young and developing, so I wouldn’t say his career is over. “He needs to work on his decision-making with the bat. Even in domestic T20s, he averages around 17, similar to international cricket, so that’s an area for improvement.” Haris has been replaced by Usman Khan — who last year gave up on a career in the United Arab Emirates to play for Pakistan before being eventually dropped. He emerged out of nowhere and Hesson said he sees the right-hander, who keeps wickets as well, as a good player of spin. “We see our wicket-keeper batting more through the middle rather than at the top, especially with spin being such a big factor in Sri Lanka during the World Cup. That’s why Usman has been given this opportunity.”",

      "summary_orig": "IN many parts of the world, including South Asia, Generation Z has emerged as a political force to be reckoned with. Gen Z refers to those born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s. In almost every continent their protests have led to the ouster of governments or put rulers on notice of the price they have to pay for misgovernance. Popular demonstrations led predominantly by youth have been sweeping the world since the ‘Aragalya’ movement in Sri Lanka in 2022. Mass student protests produced the downfall of the long-entrenched regime of Hasina Wajed in Bangladesh in 2024. This September, Gen Z protests forced the resignation of the Nepalese prime minister. Earlier this month, youth-led protests helped to topple the government in Madagascar. Gen Z has also been prominent in pro-Palestinian demonstrations across the world to express solidarity with the people of Gaza. In Morocco, Indonesia, the Philippines, Kenya and Peru, Gen Z has taken to the streets to voice its rejection of the political status quo. What lies behind this global wave of youth discontent? The drivers and triggers of these protests vary as do the underlying causes because the issues and political contexts are different and specific to each country. But there are common features. The protests are principally against the abuse of power, authoritarian governance, incompetent rule, elite privileges, nepotism, corruption, rising inequality and joblessness amid deteriorating economic conditions. These protests have occurred in countries with youthful populations so demographics is an obvious consequential factor. The use of social media platforms as mobilising avenues is also a common characteristic for a generation that has grown up in the age of communication technology and internet, and is adept at using these tools to spread their message and rally support. Digital protests have played a pivotal role in all Gen Z political movements. Youth-led protests reflect anger at the abuse of power, corruption, nepotism and inequality. A familiar target of Gen Z’s anger is what are popularly known as political ‘nepo-babies’ or ‘nepo-kids’. A political nepo-baby is described as a beneficiary of nepotism — the offspring of someone who achieves high political office and ascends to power by virtue of that (a familiar phenomenon in Pakistan). Nepo-babies also includes spouses or siblings, who make it in politics due to family connections. It extends to their children (nepo-kids) who reap benefits from their parents’ position and lead a life of ostentatious luxury. The domination of political systems by dynasties is generally resented by Gen Z as it is the antithesis of meritocracy, which young people aspire to for their societies. A privileged DNA that advantages nepo-babies reinforces political monopolies, that Gen Z take exception to and associate with corruption. Antipathy towards nepo-babies has been evident in protests in several countries including Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In Nepal, anger against the plush lifestyle of children of political leaders played a key role in revving up Gen Z protests. Hashtag #nepokids in social media found tens of thousands of followers. Posts of privileged offspring of politicians photographed with their luxury cars and designer accessories went viral. This offered a sharp contrast to the living conditions of ordinary Nepalese and contributed to protesters’ fury. In Indonesia too #nepobabies became a social media trend. The demonstration effect of Gen Z protests has been widely noted. Youth protesters in one country have been inspired by and learnt lessons from others. The revolt against the status quo and demand for change obviously connects protesters in solidarity across different countries. In media interviews, protesters in Nepal, for example, said they were inspired by the youth movement in Bangladesh and demonstrations in Indonesia. Madagascar’s youth looked to Nepal as an example to emulate. Some have called these “contagious uprisings”. The lexicon of young protesters has also been similar. In Bangladesh the spark that fuelled student-led mass demonstrations was discriminatory quotas for public sector jobs. Although the courts abolished the quotas that did not end the protests. The ‘July uprising’ morphed into a movement against the government and attracted wider public support. Popular discontent with the government had been building up over the years on several counts, including Hasina’s autocratic conduct, corruption and youth unemployment. When a violent crackdown on demonstrators left hundreds dead, it provoked furious protests and led to a nationwide civil disobedience movement. This culminated in the toppling of Hasina Wajed’s government. Student leaders were part of a coalition that influenced the army to name Muhammed Yunus as interim prime minister. In Nepal, the trigger for Gen Z protests was a social media ban by the government. This was seen as an effort to muzzle freedom of expression and silence dissent. Again, there were deeper causes for discontent — a governing elite out of touch with the people, social inequality, corruption, and deteriorating economic conditions. A crackdown on youth demonstrators, that claimed scores of lives, only intensified the protests. They eventually forced the resignation of prime minister K.P. Sharma Oli. In Madagascar, water shortages and power cuts were the trigger for the unrest and youth-led protests. But the backdrop was the country’s poverty, public revulsion for nepotism and long-standing grievances with bad governance. Protests led to the fall of the government and a military coup. Morocco, too, has witnessed youth-led protests calling for better healthcare and education. An online group named Gen Z 212, representing a grassroots movement, organised the protests which were driven by resentment against corruption and inequality. This compelled the government to announce social reforms. The various youth-led protests have produced varying outcomes. They range from the ouster of governments and promise of reforms to military coups. None of the outcomes — thus far — have involved a fundamental break from the status quo or yielded the social changes hoped for by Gen Z protesters. This may be disappointing. But they have put governments on notice about the consequences they face for their misrule, corruption and incompetence. In marginalising established political parties by their protests, Gen Z has also shown how out of touch they are with public grievances and unless they reinvent themselves, they might become politically irrelevant. In any case, all indications are that Gen Z protests will continue as a global trend. The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN. Published in Dawn, October 27th, 2025",

According to official sources, the abducted officials, both from Punjab, were working on the Diamer-Bhasha Dam project. Police said that on Saturday, their off-day, the officials went to the Gabar area of Thore to buy walnuts, accompanied by six local colleagues. Upon reaching the area, they were intercepted and abducted by militants, who took them into the nearby mountainous region. An official, requesting anonymity, told Dawn that the area was a known haven for militants. In August, two Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts personnel were  martyred and another injured when terrorists opened fire on a checkpoint  along the Karakoram Highway (KKH) near Thore. The official said that local religious leaders had been engaged to negotiate with the abductors for the safe release of the officials. So far, three rounds of talks have been held, though the militants have made certain demands, which the source declined to disclose. Jirga held Meanwhile, local residents of the Thore valley, where the two men resided, held a jirga on Sunday to condemn the abduction and demand strong action against the militants. A large number of people participated in the gathering, which unanimously passed a resolution declaring that the abduction had nothing to do with the people of Thore. The resolution stated that the incident was an individual act, strongly condemned by the local community. It urged the government and administration not to harass innocent residents, but to arrest those involved and punish them according to the law. “The government should take strict action against these terrorists so that no one dares to commit such an act in the future,” the resolution said. It further clarified that the terrorists involved in the abduction have no connection with the people of Thore. Published in Dawn, October 27th, 2025",

In August, two Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts personnel were  martyred and another injured when terrorists opened fire on a checkpoint  along the Karakoram Highway (KKH) near Thore. The official said that local religious leaders had been engaged to negotiate with the abductors for the safe release of the officials. So far, three rounds of talks have been held, though the militants have made certain demands, which the source declined to disclose. Jirga held Meanwhile, local residents of the Thore valley, where the two men resided, held a jirga on Sunday to condemn the abduction and demand strong action against the militants. A large number of people participated in the gathering, which unanimously passed a resolution declaring that the abduction had nothing to do with the people of Thore. The resolution stated that the incident was an individual act, strongly condemned by the local community. It urged the government and administration not to harass innocent residents, but to arrest those involved and punish them according to the law. “The government should take strict action against these terrorists so that no one dares to commit such an act in the future,” the resolution said. It further clarified that the terrorists involved in the abduction have no connection with the people of Thore. Published in Dawn, October 27th, 2025",

      "summary": "GILGIT: Two officials of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) were allegedly abducted from the Thore area in Chilas, Diamer district, near the Diamer-Bhasha Dam construction site. According to official sources, the abducted officials, both from Punjab, were working on the Diamer-Bhasha Dam project. Police said that on Saturday, their off-day, the officials went to the Gabar area of Thore to buy walnuts, accompanied by six local colleagues.

      "summary_orig": "PARIS: French authorities have detained two of the suspected robbers believed to have stolen precious crown jewels from the Louvre in a museum heist that stunned the world, officials said on Sunday. A swarm of investigators had been mobilised to track down the thieves who robbed the world-renowned museum in broad daylight on Oct 19, making off with jewellery worth an estimated $102 million in just a few minutes. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said they had “carried out arrests on Saturday evening”. “One of the men arrested was about to leave the country” from Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport, Beccuau said. A source close to the case told AFP the man was about to board a plane for Algeria. The second man had been detained not long afterward in the Paris region, media reports said. The two men were taken into police custody on suspicion of organised theft and criminal conspiracy. They could be held up to 96 hours. Beccuau deplored the public revelation of the arrests, first revealed in media reports, warning they “can only hinder the efforts of the 100 investigators mobilised” in the hunt for the jewels and the perpetrators. Interior Minister Laurent Nunez also called for confidentiality while congratulating the investigators “who have worked tirelessly”, in a post on X (formerly Twitter). In the heist last Sunday, the robbers clambered up the extendable ladder of a stolen movers’ truck and, using cutting equipment, broke into a first-floor gallery that houses royal gems. They dropped a diamond- and emerald-studded crown as they fled down the ladder and onto scooters, but managed to steal eight other pieces, include an emerald-and-diamond necklace that Napoleon Bonaparte gave his wife.

      "summary_orig": "• Held under watchful eye of Qatari, Turkish mediators, talks spill over into second day after Pak-Afghan delegations fail to reach consensus • Pakistani officials share photo, documentary evidence of terror groups operating from Afghan territory • Amid mixed signals from Taliban power centres in Kabul & Kandahar, Islamabad refuses suggestion to directly negotiate with TTP ISLAMABAD: Stalemate persisted on Sunday at the Pakistan-Afghanistan talks in Istanbul, with the Afghan Taliban delegation appearing reluctant to take verifiable action against sanctuaries of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and other militant groups operating from Afghan soil. This was the second day of the dialogue, which stretched into Sunday after both sides failed to find common ground on the issue of ending terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan. After nearly nine hours of intense discussions late into the night, Pakistani security officials said their delegation had presented its “final position” to the Afghan side, insisting that the Taliban regime must take “concrete and verifiable steps to eliminate cross-border terrorism from and inside Afghanistan”. “Pakistan has made it clear that the ongoing patronage of terrorists by the Afghan Taliban is unacceptable,” the senior security official said. Taliban responses to Pakistani assertions about terrorism emanating from Afghan soil were rejected as “illogical and opposite to ground realities”. In a thinly veiled reference to India, which has recently deepened ties with Kabul, the security official said the Taliban delegation “appeared to be following someone else’s agenda”. This stance seemed to be vindicated when, in the midst of the Istanbul process, Indian forces apparently violated the cea­sefire in the Leepa Sector of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. While there was no official word on losses, locals reported an intense exchange of fire on Sunday evening. The official cautioned that this position of the Taliban “was not in the interest of Afghanistan, Pakistan, or the region”. The source added that any further progress in the talks would depend on the “positive attitude of the Afghan Taliban”. Earlier in the day, the Afghan delegation presented a written response to Pakistan’s demands submitted the previous day, after which Pakistan shared its counter-response. A second session subsequently began after midday, in the presence of senior Turkish and Qatari mediators. There was initial optimism following the exchange of documents and the start of a second session that had not been planned earlier. However, after protracted negotiations, the optimism faded as the Taliban delegation refused to provide any written assurances. The Afghan representatives, who were receiving directions from Kabul and Kandahar, appeared to lack the mandate to make decisions, officials said. Their reluctance to provide written commitments was interpreted by the Pakistani side as a sign of unwillingness to act against the TTP and other militant groups with hideouts in Afghanistan. During the two days of talks, Pakistan presented photographic and documentary evidence of TTP, BLA, and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, including details of their leadership and movements. The Pakistani delegation also shared photographs and Afghan identity documents of infiltrators captured during recent border incidents, insiders said. At one stage, the Afghan Taliban offered to bring the TTP to the table for direct talks with Pakistani authorities. Islamabad, however, categorically refused, reiterating that it would not negotiate with a terrorist group and that it was the Taliban’s responsibility to end their patronage of the TTP. Echoing Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s earlier remarks, Pakistani negotiators told the Afghan side that Islamabad was ready to pay any price to neutralise the threat emanating from Afghan soil for the safety of its people. They cautioned that the Afghan population would suffer because of the Taliban regime’s continued intransigence. Pakistan’s core demand throughout the talks remained decisive action against terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan. While the dialogue continued in Istanbul, Pakistan’s military reported major infiltration attempts across the Pak-Afghan border, further casting doubt on the Taliban’s intentions. The two attempts, occurring in Kurram and North Waziristan, were framed by ISPR as occurring “while delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye”. “This casts doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan government regarding its commitment to addressing terrorism emanating from its soil,” the military noted. The two-day talks followed the Oct 19 Doha ceasefire , mediated by Qatar, which ended a week of deadly border clashes . Türkiye hosted the current round as part of its expanded mediation role, while Qatar acted as guarantor of the truce and facilitator of dialogue. The Pakistani delegation comprised senior security and intelligence officials, including representatives from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Directorate of Military Operations, and the Foreign Office. The Afghan side was led by Deputy Interior Minister Mawlawi Rahmatullah Najeeb and included senior Taliban figures such as Anas Haqqani, Suhail Shaheen, Noorur Rahman Nusrat, and Abdul Qahar Balkhi. Diplomatic sources said mediators were attempting to keep both sides engaged to prevent a complete breakdown in communication. Published in Dawn, October 27th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces foiled two major terrorist infiltration attempts from Afghanistan on 24-25 October 2025, killing 25 militants, including four suicide bombers, and seizing a large cache of weapons and explosives in separate operations in North Waziristan and Kurram districts, the military’s media wing said on Sunday. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), on 24-25 October 2025, security forces detected movements of two large groups of khwarij attempting to infiltrate Pakistan from Afghanistan near Ghaki in Kurram District and Spinwam in North Waziristan District. “Own troops effectively engaged these groups of khwarij [and] as a result of precise and skilful engagements, fifteen khwarij , including four suicide bombers belonging to [the] Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in Spinwam, North Waziristan District,” the statement said. It added that another ten infiltrating khwarij were killed in Ghaki, Kurram District, and a large cache of weapons, ammunition, and explosives was recovered from the slain militants. Fitna al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The statement added that despite successfully thwarting the infiltration attempt, five soldiers sacrificed their lives during the intense firefights. The fallen included Havildar Manzoor Hussain (35, District Ghizar), Sepoy Nauman Ilyas Kiyani (23, District Poonch), Sepoy Muhammad Adil (24, District Kasur), Sepoy Shah Jehan (25, District Vehari), and Sepoy Ali Asghar (25, District Pak Pattan), who embraced martyrdom while fighting gallantly. “It is significant to point out that these infiltration attempts by Fitna al Khwarij are being carried out at a time when delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye; casting doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan Government with regards to addressing the issue of terrorism emanating from its soil,” the statement said. It added that Pakistan had consistently been asking the Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations of the Doha Agreement and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij against Pakistan. “The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers, and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” it said. Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country, it said. President Asif Zardari lauded the security forces for rendering the infiltration attempts by the terrorists unsuccessful, according to a statement on the PPP’s X account. He also paid tributes to the martyred “who laid down their live while defending the country”, adding that the “nefarious designs of Fitna-al-Khawarij and their Indian patrons would never be successful”. According to state broadcaster Radio Pakistan , Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the five personnel who embraced martyrdom while “bravely fighting” the terrorists. He prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs and expressed condolences with their families, the Radio Pakistan report said, adding that PM Shehbaz further stated that the entire nation “salutes the security forces for their courage and sacrifices”. He reaffirmed the government’s resolve to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country. Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned TTP’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Last week, security forces neutralised 34 “India-ba­cked” terrorists during multiple operations across KP.",

      "summary_orig": "Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar on Sunday ordered a judicial inquiry into the custodial death of a teenager in Karachi due to alleged torture. The teenager, 18-year-old Muhammad Irfan, was arrested by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of police along with three of his friends on October 22. SIU Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ahmed Shaikh told Dawn that they were taken to the SIU/ CIA Centre in Saddar at around 5:30pm the same day, and 15 minutes later, the health condition of Irfan deteriorated. He was taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival, he said. The police claimed that the boy died of a heart attack, while his relatives allege that he was tortured to death. Preliminary findings from his post-mortem examination — conducted in the presence of a judicial magistrate at JPMC —  suggested the presence of multiple injuries on the teenager’s body, according to doctors and the police. In a statement issued today, the spokesperson for the home ministry said, “The home minister has directed the additional chief secretary (home) to initiate the process of judicial inquiry into the case.” It has been directed that “a thorough forensic investigation of the incident be carried out, and whosoever is involved should be taken to task”. “The case should be taken to a logical conclusion with the help of modern techniques,” the statement said. “I feel sorry that the child has died in the custody of the police,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. Protest On Saturday, relatives of the deceased and others staged a sit-in at an Edhi morgue at Sohrab Goth while carrying the coffin of the victim, whose body was kept at the morgue, and blocked the main road. The hours-long protest ended on Saturday night after assurances by “higher police authorities” that justice would be provided to them, said senior journalist Shahid Jatoi, who was one of the protesters. He said Irfan’s coffin was taken to his native village, Bait Ahmed, in Ahmedpur East, Bahawalpur district, on Saturday night, where “thousands of people” attended his funeral prayer. He said that “Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) and Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) SIU spoke to the relatives and promised that after receipt of the final report of the doctors, section 302 (intentional murder) would be incorporated in the first information report (FIR) of the case”. FIR An FIR of the incident was registered at the Saddar Police Station on the complaint of SIU and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Ahmed under Sections 34 (common intention) and 319 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against seven nominated SIU/CIA officers. The FIR said that four people were detained by the SIU police party from Lilly Bridge near Cantonment Station in the limits of Frere Police Station on October 22. The FIR added that they were detained on information provided by a special informant, a case was registered against the four on the same day, and they were handed over to an assistant sub-inspector (ASI). SHO Ahmed said he came to know through the investigating officer (IO) of the case that two other assistant sub-inspectors had continued interrogating Irfan when his health deteriorated suddenly and he became unconscious. The SHO added that the IO took Irfan to the hospital without informing him. SHO Ahmed said the SIU personnel had committed “negligence” during Irfan’s arrest and custody. He said it transpired that the registration of the case against the deceased was also “dubious” and the entire matter raised suspicion. On Saturday, Karachi police arrested two cops who were named in the FIR. Earlier, on Friday, seven policemen were suspended after the incident came to light.",

FIR An FIR of the incident was registered at the Saddar Police Station on the complaint of SIU and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Ahmed under Sections 34 (common intention) and 319 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against seven nominated SIU/CIA officers. The FIR said that four people were detained by the SIU police party from Lilly Bridge near Cantonment Station in the limits of Frere Police Station on October 22. The FIR added that they were detained on information provided by a special informant, a case was registered against the four on the same day, and they were handed over to an assistant sub-inspector (ASI). SHO Ahmed said he came to know through the investigating officer (IO) of the case that two other assistant sub-inspectors had continued interrogating Irfan when his health deteriorated suddenly and he became unconscious. The SHO added that the IO took Irfan to the hospital without informing him. SHO Ahmed said the SIU personnel had committed “negligence” during Irfan’s arrest and custody. He said it transpired that the registration of the case against the deceased was also “dubious” and the entire matter raised suspicion. On Saturday, Karachi police arrested two cops who were named in the FIR. Earlier, on Friday, seven policemen were suspended after the incident came to light.",

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday granted nine-day physical remand of 16 activists of the banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to the police in multiple cases registered under terrorism charges. ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill heard the police’s request when the suspects were produced before the court. The investigating officer sought a 27-day physical remand, arguing that the custody of the suspects was needed for interrogation in cases of violent protests and attacks on law enforcement officials. After examining the record, the judge allowed a nine-day remand and directed the police to produce the suspects again on November 3, along with a progress report on the investigation. The suspects are facing cases registered with the Nawab Town, Kahna and Shahdara police stations under different provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997. CONVICTION: An ATC on Saturday sentenced two members of a banned outfit to five-year rigorous imprisonment each after finding them guilty of possessing explosive material. Judge Arshad Javed announced the guilty verdict in the presence of convicts Habibullah and Muhammad Jawad. The judge also ordered the prosecution to confiscate the properties of the convicts as part of the punishment. The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) registered the case against the convicts in 2024 under relevant sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997. The CTD had recovered explosive material from the possession of the convicts, who were members of a banned organization. Published in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",
