The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday. According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieving security and peace in the region and the world”. “[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details. Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. Official Saudi media outlets also carried reports of the signing ceremony, but they offered no further details about the accord or its provisions. A high-level delegation, including Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik, PM’s Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, accompanied PM Shehbaz. Saudi F-15 fighter jets escorted the PM’s plane after it entered the Kingdom’s airspace, and a special ceremony was held at the royal palace ahead of Pakistani delegation’s talks with the crown prince. Upgrade in defence ties The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure , when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram. In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms. In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In Feb, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges. The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella though finer details of the agreement were not made public. For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider. For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time. Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Today, Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkey and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses. Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represents Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf. To celebrate the solemnisation of the defence accord with Saudi Arabia, the Capital Development Authority decked out prominent buildings in Islamabad with green lighting. Buildings such as the Supreme Court, Islamabad High Court, Parliament House, Cabinet Secretariat, Prime Minister’s House, and the Diplomatic Enclave along Constitution Avenue, as well as prominent hotels and commercial centres were emblazoned with emerald hues. Digital channel launched Earlier on Wednesday, PM Shehbaz also inaugurated ‘Pakistan TV Digital’, an English news channel aimed at delivering Pakistani voice to the world and offering the country’s perspective on national and international developments, besides countering anti-Pakistan narratives and propaganda. During the visit to the offices of Pakistan TV Digital , housed on the premises of state-run Pakistan Television ( PTV ), the prime minister unveiled a plaque to launch the news channel, which aims to enable Pakistan to communicate with the world, and deliver its perspective. He said that the primary objective of launching this digital news channel was to provide authentic coverage, while effectively countering misinformation and propaganda about Pakistan. PM Shehbaz also recorded his first interview for broadcast on Pakistan TV Digital , which is reportedly a subsidiary of PTV . Published in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",

WE are at a turning point of regional and global history because of several seminal developments. The moral, institutional, political, and economic degeneration of the US. The berserk aggression of Israel , which has finally destroyed the credibility of the US as a force for regional and international stability. The realisation among Arab elites that they can no longer rely on a trade-off between national humiliation and external protection against Arab streets. China’s recognition that its diplomacy will not significantly postpone a day of reckoning with a fearful and implacable US. The emergence of a vast Afro-Asian Muslim playground waiting to be co-opted by the East as deliverance from the West. India’s failure to transition from regional power status to international power status, and become a credible partner for the US against China. Above all, climate change in the Anthropocene age, in which human activity becomes a principal determinant of the rate of global warming and the fate of plant and animal species, including human beings. Because of the irresponsibility of the principal industrial powers, climate change will shortly become irreversible. Management of and adaptation to climate change may at most delay, but not avert the demise of human civilisation — possibly within this century. As a result, Noam Chomsky observed that far from the noblest of God’s creatures, mankind will be the stupidest and most short-lived of animal species. All of the above is reflected in the last reset of the Doomsday Clock , which at 89 seconds to ‘midnight’, is the closest yet to doomsday. The next reset next January will be even closer. This is the global context in which we are today witnessing the culmination of a century-long genocidal process against the trapped and defenceless Palestinian people. This unparalleled crime against humanity was initiated by Imperial Britain , and is culminating in the comprehensive connivance of the US. If, God forbid, Palestine dies, the Arab and Muslim world will face a colossal moral and civilisational failure, which it may not survive. The genocidal policy of the US and Israel has made the two-state solution for Palestine, as mandated by the UN, impossible to achieve. Accordingly, Israel has forfeited the right to exist. The only just solution now is the liberation of the State of Palestine in which people of all faiths who have the right to be there — including all Palestinians who have an internationally recognised right of return — are encouraged and assisted to live together in harmony, peace and justice. All other proposed solutions to the Palestinian tragedy have been rendered impossible by the violence, greed, guilt and hypocrisy of the US and its European allies, in support of the rabid racism of the criminal and illegitimate State of Israel. What is to be done? What can be done? How can it be done? Where do we begin? If answers to such questions regarding the genocide in Palestine can be agreed upon and implemented, it will be possible to similarly address other challenges that in greater or lesser measure threaten the future of humanity. What is to be done? What can be done? How can it be done? Where do we begin? Historically, power systems have always opposed the implementation of sensible and practical answers to such questions. This has been the warp and woof of human history. The finest brains have been selected to conjure up appealing or convincing reasons for such perversity. The difference today is that mankind has the capacity to destroy itself. The stakes are globally existential. Alex Carey noted that ‘grass-roots’ propaganda is designed to sway the masses through their beliefs, fears and prejudices, as well as their ignorance which is sustained by the social system in which they are confined. ‘Tree-top’ propaganda, on the contrary, is designed to comfort the upper- and middle-class intelligentsia who like to see themselves as decent human beings while serving the avarice and rapacity of their masters, who similarly wish to see themselves in a benevolent light. The comprador intellectual, whatever his or her profession, is accordingly among the vilest of social beings. Nevertheless, Chomsky suggests there are things that can be done to make a difference. One is for concerned people “not to be passive and quiescent” and to make life uncomfortable for exploiting elites and their cohorts who wish to preserve a decent opinion of themselves. Just persistently asking questions in all kinds of forums can be effective. Being a pest can also make a significant contribution. But he also notes that whatever one does should be done consistently. Power systems do not mind occasional protesters. In fact, they welcome them as proof of their tolerance and respect for free speech. A jihad or struggle has to be an organised and sustained learning process for it to be meaningful and ultimately successful. And this is where the men are distinguished from the boys. And this is also where women are often ‘more men’ than most men. They “hold up half the sky”, according to Mao. That is why they are taught by men — and unfortunately but understandably often enough by their mothers — to see their world in the household and virtue in obedience, tolerance, and suffering. Those women who excel in these docile qualities are worshipped by men — largely in the abstract. Men never seem to ask why God gave human intelligence to women if it was superfluous, even when they rightly suspect women are wiser, stronger, and braver than them. To sum up, starting with turning points, I focused on Palestine, asked questions, quoted Chomsky and Carey, and paid due homage to women. Good things can lead to more good things. So let us begin by feeling uncomfortable about the prevailing situation at home and abroad. That might lead to reflection, anger, action and eventually deliverance from climate catastrophe and political evil. Let us then resolve to keep doing something good for Pakistan, our only country, and for Earth, our Mother Planet.

Khalil’s lawyers said they intended to appeal against the deportation order, and that a federal district court’s separate orders remain in effect prohibiting the government from immediately deporting or detaining him as his federal court case proceeds.

According to the military’s media wing, the terrorists were killed in the district on the night of September 14-15. The ope­r­a­tion was conducted aft­er the “reported presence of terrorists” belonging to the separatist Baloch outfits, it added. ISPR said the forces eff­e­c­tively engaged the ter­­­r­­o­­rists’ location, five terrorists were killed after aft­er an intense exchange of fire. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained act­ively involved in num­erous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR said, adding that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any oth­er terrorists found in the area. Four killed in Kech Four alleged militants were also killed in the Kech district. The Counter-Terrorism Department of the Balochistan police claimed two suspects were killed in Dasht, Turbat, at a crossing of the M-8 motorway. They were allegedly spotted in the CCTV footage planting an explosive device. The CTD personnel immediately acted and killed the suspects. Policeman slain In the Sherani district, an official of the Balochistan Police Constabulary was martyred and two Levies men were injured in the attack on the police and Levies stations on Tuesday night in Mir Ali Khel area of the district. The assailants used heavy weapons, including rockets, to target the personnel from nearby mountains. The law enforcement officials immediately took positions and returned fire. “A heavy gun battle continued for over two hours in the area,” Deputy Commissioner Hazrat Wali Kakar told Dawn . He said the attack was repulsed and the militants’ effort to enter the police lines was foiled. In the exchange of fire, Balochistan Police Constabulary’s Aftabur Rehman, a resident of Muslim Bagh, was martyred, while two Levies personnel were injured in the attack. “One Levies man is missing,” DC Kakar said, adding that the search operation in the area was ongoing. The assailants set a Levies vehicle on fire, and buildings also sustained damage. Landmine blasts In another incident, three civilians were killed and a girl was injured in two landmine explosions in the Dera Bugti district. Officials said that both incidents occurred in the Lanjo Saghari area of the Sui tehsil. In the first explosion, a woman was killed, while in the second blast, two men were killed. No one had claimed responsibility by the time this report went to press. Published in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",

The commitment was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Wednesday. The plan, aligned with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), seeks to enhance maritime cooperation with China while promoting economic connectivity with Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The framework emphasises infrastructure development, including the expansion of Gwadar Port, completion of Free Zone Stage II, and acceleration of East Bay Expressway Phase II to improve inland accessibility. A key component is the integration of the airport with the port to support multi-modal transit and regional logistics. The plan also supports the adoption of electronic data interchange systems and smart port technologies to integrate Gwadar with Chinese and international shipping networks. Development of port-related industries, cold storage facilities, and warehousing is part of the strategy to facilitate transshipment and regional trade. Govt plans strategic leap with port and airport integration Beyond logistics, the framework outlines initiatives for scientific cooperation, industrial development, and maritime tourism. Proposed projects include joint marine science research centres, CPEC-linked industrial parks for fisheries, shipbuilding and aquaculture, as well as tourism ventures along Balochistan’s coast. Education and human resource development are positioned as cross-cutting priorities, with proposed academic partnerships and training exchanges between Pakistani and Chinese institutions to develop skilled manpower in logistics, port management, and fisheries.

      "summary_orig": "IT is clear to any observer that what Israel is doing in Gaza is not about destroying Hamas, but exterminating and ethnically cleansing the Palestinian population of the besieged Strip. Soon after Tel Aviv launched its barbaric assault on Gaza, following the Hamas attacks of Oct 7, 2023, there were clear signs that Israel was indiscriminately and purposefully targeting civilians, including children. In the years since, credible voices from around the world have said that what the Zionist state is doing in Gaza amounts to genocide. The UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry is the latest to endorse this view . On Tuesday, the UN body said that Israel’s leadership, including its prime minister, president and former defence minister “incited the commission of genocide”. Many other respectable voices have earlier come to the same conclusion. This includes Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , MSF , UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese , as well as the International Association of Genocide Scholars . Israel may dismiss all of this as “distorted and false”, but the evidence against it is damning. It has also been pointed out that the descendants of those who themselves faced a genocide are today perpetrating a modern-day holocaust. It is a shocking irony that the children of Holocaust survivors should themselves have unleashed monstrous violence on the men, women and youngsters of occupied Palestine. Some argue that the seeds of the present butchery were sown during the Nakba. But while the events of eight decades ago may be open to historical interpretation, Israel’s holocaust in Gaza is being carried out live , unfolding on our TV and mobile screens. Despite Tel Aviv’s repeated denials, the tiny corpses of Palestinian children murdered by Israel, as well the lifeless bodies of toddlers wasting away due to a man-made famine , are undeniable evidence of the Zionist state’s cold-blooded, inhuman tactics in the occupied territories. There should be no more waffling about what is going on in Gaza. Those who raise the slogan of ‘ never again ’, and keep reminding humanity of the horrors Europe’s fascists unleashed on the continent’s Jewish population, need to help bring to an immediate end the Gaza genocide. In fact, the global community must unite to bring the perpetrators of the Palestinian genocide to justice. The Israeli leadership, as identified by the UN commission, must be tried for crimes against humanity, just as Nazi Germany’s leaders faced the law at the Nuremberg trials . Moreover, there should be a global, UN-backed arms, economic and diplomatic embargo — along the lines of what apartheid-era South Africa faced — of Israel until it stops its campaign of extermination in Gaza. And if states refuse to cooperate and continue to arm and fund Israel, they must be considered partners in crime with Tel Aviv. Published in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",

Soon after Tel Aviv launched its barbaric assault on Gaza, following the Hamas attacks of Oct 7, 2023, there were clear signs that Israel was indiscriminately and purposefully targeting civilians, including children. In the years since, credible voices from around the world have said that what the Zionist state is doing in Gaza amounts to genocide. The UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry is the latest to endorse this view . On Tuesday, the UN body said that Israel’s leadership, including its prime minister, president and former defence minister “incited the commission of genocide”. Many other respectable voices have earlier come to the same conclusion. This includes Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch , MSF , UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese , as well as the International Association of Genocide Scholars . Israel may dismiss all of this as “distorted and false”, but the evidence against it is damning. It has also been pointed out that the descendants of those who themselves faced a genocide are today perpetrating a modern-day holocaust. It is a shocking irony that the children of Holocaust survivors should themselves have unleashed monstrous violence on the men, women and youngsters of occupied Palestine. Some argue that the seeds of the present butchery were sown during the Nakba. But while the events of eight decades ago may be open to historical interpretation, Israel’s holocaust in Gaza is being carried out live , unfolding on our TV and mobile screens. Despite Tel Aviv’s repeated denials, the tiny corpses of Palestinian children murdered by Israel, as well the lifeless bodies of toddlers wasting away due to a man-made famine , are undeniable evidence of the Zionist state’s cold-blooded, inhuman tactics in the occupied territories. There should be no more waffling about what is going on in Gaza. Those who raise the slogan of ‘ never again ’, and keep reminding humanity of the horrors Europe’s fascists unleashed on the continent’s Jewish population, need to help bring to an immediate end the Gaza genocide. In fact, the global community must unite to bring the perpetrators of the Palestinian genocide to justice. The Israeli leadership, as identified by the UN commission, must be tried for crimes against humanity, just as Nazi Germany’s leaders faced the law at the Nuremberg trials . Moreover, there should be a global, UN-backed arms, economic and diplomatic embargo — along the lines of what apartheid-era South Africa faced — of Israel until it stops its campaign of extermination in Gaza.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Pakistan has warned the UN Security Council that terrorist groups operating from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan pose the gravest threat to its national security, urging stronger international action against networks using both physical and digital platforms to target the country. Ambassador Asim Ifti­khar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told a Council meeting on Afghanistan on Tuesday that entities like Al Qaeda, IS-Khorasan, TTP, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Baloch insurgent groups such as the BLA and Majeed Brigade continue to operate with impunity from across the border. “We have credible evidence of collaboration among these groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists and coordinated attacks,” he said. More than 60 terrorist camps function as hubs for infiltration, targeting civilians, security forces and development projects inside Pakistan, he added. The envoy said the threat extended to cyberspace, where nearly 70 propaganda accounts traced to Afghan IP addresses were spreading extremist messaging. “Curb­ing these networks requires full cooperation from social media platforms with governments,” he stressed. Ambassador Ahmed said Pakistan and China had jointly asked the Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions Committee to designate the BLA and Majeed Brigade as terrorist organisations. He urged the Council to act swiftly on the request to curb their terrorist activities. He also pointed to the TTP, describing it as the largest UN-designated group on Afghan soil with nearly 6,000 fighters. Pakistan, he said, had thwarted multiple infiltration attempts, seizing caches of sophisticated military equipment abandoned by international forces during their withdrawal from Afghanistan. “These efforts come at a heavy price … just this month, 12 Pakistani soldiers were martyred in a single incident,” he noted. He said that while four years of Taliban rule had ended decades of civil war, the country remained mired in sanctions, poverty, narcotics and human rights concerns. He lamented that the UN’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan had received only 27pc of its required $2.42 billion. The envoy reminded the Council that Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for over four decades, often with inadequate international assistance. Published in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Israel strikes more than 150 targets, kills 62 across the enclave • New route opened for Palestinians fleeing the embattled city • EU proposes curbing Israel trade ties, sanctioning far-right ministers GAZA CITY: Huge numbers of Palestinians were fleeing Gaza City by any means on Wednesday as the Israeli military pressed its ground offensive, killing dozens in strikes. The Israeli army said it had struck more than 150 targets in Gaza City since launching a major ground offensive on the Gaza Strip’s main urban hub early on Tuesday. AFP images showed a steady stream of Gazans heading south on foot, by car and on donkey carts, with their few belongings piled high as Israel bombarded the city. Israel had announced the day before that the US-backed campaign in the Gaza Strip’s largest city had begun, pledging to destroy Hamas in the area. The offensive has sparked outrage among the international community, with the Palestinian territory already devastated by nearly two years of war and the Gaza City region gripped by a UN-declared famine. Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire had killed at least 62 people across the territory on Wednesday. The Israeli military said it was opening a temporary new route on Wednesday to allow people to flee, after unleashing a massive bombardment before dawn on Tuesday and pushing its troops deeper into Gaza City. It came as a United Nations probe accused Israel of committing genocide in the Palestinian territory, saying Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other senior officials had incited the crime. On Wednesday, the Israeli military said it was opening “a temporary transportation route via Salah al-Din Street”, as AFP images showed fresh bombardments. Its Arabic-language spokesman, Colonel Avichay Adraee, said the corridor would remain open for just 48 hours from midday (0900 GMT). ‘Death is cheaper’ The United Nations estimated at the end of August that about one million people were living in Gaza City and its surroundings. The Israeli military said Wednesday that more than 350,000 had so far fled south. But many Gazans say nowhere is safe and have vowed to stay in their homes. “I won’t leave Gaza. There’s shelling here and there,” said Umm Ahmed Yunes, who is living in her partially destroyed home. “Where would I find $1,000 or $2,000 for transport costs? Where would I buy a tent? There are no tents and prices are insane,” said the 44-year-old. “Death is cheaper and more merciful.” Mother of four Fatima Lubbad left Gaza City with 10 relatives but said the ordeal was unbearable. “I wish we would all die together,” said the 36-year-old. “Last night we slept in the street by the sea in Deir el-Balah — there was nowhere to put a tent… I cried all night as I looked at my children sleeping on the ground.” In Gaza City’s Shati camp, an Israeli air strike killed four people, including a woman and her child, according to the civil defence agency. “Enough, we want to be free. We want to live, we don’t want to die, who told you we want to die? Tell Netanyahu: we don’t want to die!” said Mohammed al-Danf, an eyewitness. EU sanctions The European Union on Wednesday proposed curbing trade ties with Israel and sanctioning ministers in its strongest action yet over the war in Gaza, though reluctance from key member states risks blocking adoption. The bloc’s executive, however, said it would take immediate action by freezing some 20 million euros ($23.7m) in support for Israel. “The horrific events taking place in Gaza on a daily basis must stop,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said. “There needs to be an immediate ceasefire, unrestrained access for all humanitarian aid, and the release of all prisoners.” Under its new proposals, Brussels is pressing to suspend the parts of a cooperation deal that allow for reduced tariffs on goods coming from Israel. The EU also called for asset freezes and visa bans on far-right Israeli government ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich over their “extremist” rhetoric. Those measures — initially floated by von der Leyen in a speech last week — represent the firmest attempt by the EU chief to pressure Israel. “Today marks a critical turning point in holding Israel accountable,” said Irish foreign minister Simon Harris.

There are no tents and prices are insane,” said the 44-year-old. “Death is cheaper and more merciful.” Mother of four Fatima Lubbad left Gaza City with 10 relatives but said the ordeal was unbearable. “I wish we would all die together,” said the 36-year-old. “Last night we slept in the street by the sea in Deir el-Balah — there was nowhere to put a tent… I cried all night as I looked at my children sleeping on the ground.” In Gaza City’s Shati camp, an Israeli air strike killed four people, including a woman and her child, according to the civil defence agency. “Enough, we want to be free. We want to live, we don’t want to die, who told you we want to die? Tell Netanyahu: we don’t want to die!” said Mohammed al-Danf, an eyewitness. EU sanctions The European Union on Wednesday proposed curbing trade ties with Israel and sanctioning ministers in its strongest action yet over the war in Gaza, though reluctance from key member states risks blocking adoption. The bloc’s executive, however, said it would take immediate action by freezing some 20 million euros ($23.7m) in support for Israel. “The horrific events taking place in Gaza on a daily basis must stop,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said. “There needs to be an immediate ceasefire, unrestrained access for all humanitarian aid, and the release of all prisoners.” Under its new proposals, Brussels is pressing to suspend the parts of a cooperation deal that allow for reduced tariffs on goods coming from Israel. The EU also called for asset freezes and visa bans on far-right Israeli government ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich over their “extremist” rhetoric. Those measures — initially floated by von der Leyen in a speech last week — represent the firmest attempt by the EU chief to pressure Israel. “Today marks a critical turning point in holding Israel accountable,” said Irish foreign minister Simon Harris.

      "summary_orig": "It is unclear how anti-fascists, an umbrella term for far-left-leaning groups, which is not a singular entity, will be labeled Donald Trump said early on Thursday that he plans to designate antifa as a “major terrorist organization”. Antifa, short for “anti-fascists,” is an umbrella term for far-left-leaning activist groups and is not a singular entity. They consist of groups that resist fascists and neo-Nazis, especially at demonstrations. It was unclear how the administration would label what is effectively a decentralized movement as a terrorist organization, and the White House on Wednesday did not immediately offer more details. The US president, who is on a state visit to the UK, made the announcement in a social media post shortly before 1.30am Thursday local time. He called antifa a “SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER”. He also said he will be “strongly recommending” that funders of antifa be investigated. Antifa is a domestic entity and, as such, is not a candidate for inclusion on the state department’s list of foreign terror organizations. Dozens of groups, including extremist organizations like the Islamic State and al-Qaida, are included on that list. The designation matters in part because it enables the justice department to prosecute those who give material support to entities on that list even if that support does not result in violence. There is no domestic equivalent to that list in part because of broad first amendment protections enjoyed by organizations operating within the United States. And despite periodic calls, particularly after mass shootings by white supremacists, to establish a domestic terrorism law, no singular statute now exists. In an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump said he would pursue a domestic terrorism designation for antifa if such a move had the support of Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and others in his cabinet. “It’s something I would do, yeah,” Trump said. “I would do that 100%. Antifa is terrible.” Wednesday night, Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican senator, praised Trump’s announcement, saying: “Antifa seized upon a movement of legitimate grievances to promote violence and anarchy, working against justice for all. The President is right to recognize the destructive role of antifa by designating them domestic terrorists.” In July 2019, Cassidy and Ted Cruz, Texas Republican senator, introduced a resolution in the Senate to condemn the violent acts of antifa and to designate the group a domestic terror organization. In 2020, in the midst of the George Floyd protests, Trump also raised the idea of designating antifa as a terror organization. Trump’s previous FBI director, Christopher Wray, said in testimony that year that antifa is an ideology, not an organization, lacking the hierarchical structure that would usually allow it to be designated as a terror group by the federal government. The president made the announcement less than an hour after ABC bowed to pressure from the Federal Communications Commission and cancelled Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show “indefinitely” following complaints about his comments on the killing of Kirk.

      "title_orig": "Trump begins historic state visit to UK amid pomp and protests",
      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump was treated to a royal reception featuring gun salutes, soldiers on horseback and bagpipes as he met Wednesday with Britain’s King Charles III for a historic second state visit, which unfolded far from marching protesters. The pair laughed and joked as Trump inspected troops at Windsor Castle, west of London, in an elaborate spectacle featuring a carriage procession designed to play into the mercurial American leader’s love of pomp and pageantry. Some 120 horses, and 1,300 members of the British military — some in red tunics and gold plumed helmets — feted Trump during a ceremonial guard of honour that United Kingdom officials called the largest for a state visit to Britain in living memory. The president and First Lady Melania Trump were greeted by heir-to-the-throne Prince William and wife Catherine at Windsor after stepping off the Marine One helicopter under grey skies at 12:15pm (1115 GMT). Inside a ring of steel and out of sight from thousands of demonstrators shouting anti-Trump slogans in London, William and Catherine then walked Trump and his wife a short distance to meet the waiting Charles and Queen Camilla. As the president shook hands with the king, a 41-gun salute was fired simultaneously from six World War One-era guns on the castle’s east lawn, as a similar display occurred at the Tower of London, in the centre of the capital. The Trumps and the royals were then taken in a black and gold coach, surrounded by mounted cavalry, through the Windsor estate towards the nearly 1,000-year-old castle, where Trump and Charles inspected the guard of honour. The pair were seen sharing smiles, and the president saluted as the US national anthem played, before the royals and their guests headed inside for lunch. They exchanged gifts, with the royals giving Trump a book to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US declaration of independence next year, and Trump gifting Charles a replica of President Dwight Eisenhower’s sword. ‘Warm my heart’ Britain is pulling out all the stops to dazzle and flatter the unpredictable Trump as the UK government tries to keep him onside during a host of international crises. The 79-year-old Republican is, however, being kept far away from Britons as polls indicate he remains unpopular with the public, with the entire visit happening behind closed doors. An estimated 3,000 people marched through central London waving Palestinian flags and displaying banners with slogans, including “Migrants welcome, Trump not welcome”. “I’m just scared of the way the world’s being taken over by really nasty men,” Jo Williamson, a 58-year-old funeral director from Kent, southeast England, told AFP . Trump is the first US president to receive two state visits, after his previous one with Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. At Windsor, he laid a wreath on the tomb of Charles’s mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, and viewed a collection of US-related items, including a letter sent from president Abraham Lincoln to Queen Victoria in 1862 after the death of Prince Albert. The president and Charles will wrap up with a white-tie state banquet, where they are due to make speeches. Trump’s unpredictability on everything from tariffs to Ukraine and Gaza has caused global turmoil and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will be hoping the president leaves on Thursday feeling the warm glow of royal soft power — but there are no guarantees. Epstein’s shadow “A lot of things here warm my heart,” the president, whose mother hailed from Scotland and who owns two golf resorts in the country, said on arriving late on Tuesday at the US ambassador’s official residence in London. The US leader may also relish a chance to escape a turbulent period at home, where the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has caused deep turmoil. But the spectre loomed of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who is providing domestic headaches for both Trump and Starmer . Police arrested four people after they projected images of Trump and Epstein onto Windsor Castle late Tuesday. Starmer will host Trump on the second day of the visit on Thursday at his country residence, Chequers. The pair will be buoyed by the announcement of billions of pounds of investment in each other’s economies, including from British pharmaceutical group GSK and Google, but there could be awkward moments. Starmer’s government seeks to cement the two nations’ “special relationship”, deepen economic ties, secure billions of dollars of investment, discuss tariffs and press the US president on Ukraine and Israel. Companies including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and OpenAI have already pledged 31bn pounds ($42bn) in British investments over the next few years, in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy. Starmer also wants further progress on trade, after Britain secured the first deal with Trump to lower some tariffs. Talks may touch on remaining levies on steel, whisky and salmon. “They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” Trump said when he left the White House for Britain on Tuesday. But while Starmer is banking on the unrivalled royal allure helping cajole the Anglophile president, many pitfalls for Britain’s prime minister remain. Polls show Trump is widely unpopular in Britain and Starmer, faced with plummeting poll ratings of his own and economic woes, will need to show that his royal trump card can reap benefits. Starmer faces political troubles at home after sacking his UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, over his links to the late Epstein. Awkward questions about Epstein could also come to the fore. Commuters in the capital had mixed views about the visit, with some angry about the invitation and others saying it was smart politics and a good use of Britain’s soft power. “We’re looking to sort of make the best of a bad situation,” said lawyer Kirstie Robertshaw, 54. For Charles himself, the visit might provoke mixed emotions. He has little in common with Trump, from his 50 years championing environmental causes to his efforts to bring harmony between religions and his recent steadfast support for Canada, where he is head of state. But the occasion will also afford him the greatest global attention since his coronation. “If it goes well … I think this will go down as the most consequential event in his reign,” said historian Anthony Seldon.",

They exchanged gifts, with the royals giving Trump a book to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US declaration of independence next year, and Trump gifting Charles a replica of President Dwight Eisenhower’s sword. ‘Warm my heart’ Britain is pulling out all the stops to dazzle and flatter the unpredictable Trump as the UK government tries to keep him onside during a host of international crises. The 79-year-old Republican is, however, being kept far away from Britons as polls indicate he remains unpopular with the public, with the entire visit happening behind closed doors. An estimated 3,000 people marched through central London waving Palestinian flags and displaying banners with slogans, including “Migrants welcome, Trump not welcome”. “I’m just scared of the way the world’s being taken over by really nasty men,” Jo Williamson, a 58-year-old funeral director from Kent, southeast England, told AFP . Trump is the first US president to receive two state visits, after his previous one with Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. At Windsor, he laid a wreath on the tomb of Charles’s mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, and viewed a collection of US-related items, including a letter sent from president Abraham Lincoln to Queen Victoria in 1862 after the death of Prince Albert. The president and Charles will wrap up with a white-tie state banquet, where they are due to make speeches. Trump’s unpredictability on everything from tariffs to Ukraine and Gaza has caused global turmoil and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will be hoping the president leaves on Thursday feeling the warm glow of royal soft power — but there are no guarantees. Epstein’s shadow “A lot of things here warm my heart,” the president, whose mother hailed from Scotland and who owns two golf resorts in the country, said on arriving late on Tuesday at the US ambassador’s official residence in London. The US leader may also relish a chance to escape a turbulent period at home, where the killing of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk has caused deep turmoil. But the spectre loomed of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who is providing domestic headaches for both Trump and Starmer . Police arrested four people after they projected images of Trump and Epstein onto Windsor Castle late Tuesday. Starmer will host Trump on the second day of the visit on Thursday at his country residence, Chequers. The pair will be buoyed by the announcement of billions of pounds of investment in each other’s economies, including from British pharmaceutical group GSK and Google, but there could be awkward moments. Starmer’s government seeks to cement the two nations’ “special relationship”, deepen economic ties, secure billions of dollars of investment, discuss tariffs and press the US president on Ukraine and Israel. Companies including Microsoft, Nvidia, Google and OpenAI have already pledged 31bn pounds ($42bn) in British investments over the next few years, in AI, quantum computing and civil nuclear energy. Starmer also wants further progress on trade, after Britain secured the first deal with Trump to lower some tariffs. Talks may touch on remaining levies on steel, whisky and salmon. “They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” Trump said when he left the White House for Britain on Tuesday. But while Starmer is banking on the unrivalled royal allure helping cajole the Anglophile president, many pitfalls for Britain’s prime minister remain. Polls show Trump is widely unpopular in Britain and Starmer, faced with plummeting poll ratings of his own and economic woes, will need to show that his royal trump card can reap benefits. Starmer faces political troubles at home after sacking his UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, over his links to the late Epstein. Awkward questions about Epstein could also come to the fore. Commuters in the capital had mixed views about the visit, with some angry about the invitation and others saying it was smart politics and a good use of Britain’s soft power. “We’re looking to sort of make the best of a bad situation,” said lawyer Kirstie Robertshaw, 54. For Charles himself, the visit might provoke mixed emotions. He has little in common with Trump, from his 50 years championing environmental causes to his efforts to bring harmony between religions and his recent steadfast support for Canada, where he is head of state. But the occasion will also afford him the greatest global attention since his coronation. “If it goes well … I think this will go down as the most consequential event in his reign,” said historian Anthony Seldon.",

      "summary": "United States President Donald Trump was treated to a royal reception featuring gun salutes, soldiers on horseback and bagpipes as he met Wednesday with Britain’s King Charles III for a historic second state visit, which unfolded far from marching protesters. The pair laughed and joked as Trump inspected troops at Windsor Castle, west of London, in an elaborate spectacle featuring a carriage procession designed to play into the mercurial American leader’s love of pomp and pageantry. Some 120 horses, and 1,300 members of the British military — some in red tunics and gold plumed helmets — feted Trump during a ceremonial guard of honour that United Kingdom officials called the largest for a state visit to Britain in living memory. The president and First Lady Melania Trump were greeted by heir-to-the-throne Prince William and wife Catherine at Windsor after stepping off the Marine One helicopter under grey skies at 12:15pm (1115 GMT). Inside a ring of steel and out of sight from thousands of demonstrators shouting anti-Trump slogans in London, William and Catherine then walked Trump and his wife a short distance to meet the waiting Charles and Queen Camilla. As the president shook hands with the king, a 41-gun salute was fired simultaneously from six World War One-era guns on the castle’s east lawn, as a similar display occurred at the Tower of London, in the centre of the capital. The Trumps and the royals were then taken in a black and gold coach, surrounded by mounted cavalry, through the Windsor estate towards the nearly 1,000-year-old castle, where Trump and Charles inspected the guard of honour. The pair were seen sharing smiles, and the president saluted as the US national anthem played, before the royals and their guests headed inside for lunch.

      "summary_orig": "Multiple users on X on Tuesday shared a video, claiming that it showed schoolgirls falling sick after being vaccinated. However, the clip is of teargas shelling in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and not linked to the current Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination campaign against cervical cancer. A day ago, Abdullah Gul, son of former intelligence chief Hamid Gul, shared a video on X showing girls in school uniforms in a hospital ward appearing sick with the following caption: “After forced vaccination in schools, several girls fell ill and had to be transferred to the hospital. For God’s sake! Take a clear and firm stance in the matter of your children. All the world’s experiments are always conducted on us poor people. No help for flood victims, but the West is giving free vaccines.” The post gained over 290,000 views, 2,700 reactions and 1,800 shares. The post did not provide other crucial information, such as the location and date of the video or specify what vaccine was administered. The same video was shared with a similar claim by a user on X, who appears to be a PTI supporter based on their past posts and profile picture. The user referred to a HPV vaccination campaign in the caption: “Big revelation. In Pakistan, the HPV vaccine is being administered to children. Protect your children from this vaccine. Look at the condition of the girls. Share this video with every household.” The post gained over 30,000 views The same video with similar claims was shared by multiple users on X as can be seen here and here and on Instagram as well. A fact-check was initiated to verify the claim due to its virality, keen public interest in vaccine-related matters and to address the harm of such content. A reverse image search yielded a YouTube video dated May 9, 2024, with the following title: “Police fired tear gas at girls’ schools in Dadyal”. Dadyal is a tehsil in Mirpur district of AJK. A keyword search for “tear gas”, “Dadyal” and “school girls” yielded a May 9, 2024, X post by journalist Basharat Raja, who had shared the same video with the following caption: “This is also a clip from Dadyal where tear gas was excessively used by police and unidentified individuals dressed in civilian clothes on schools, causing female students engaged in annual examinations to faint.” A keyword search to corroborate the incident through credible media outlets yielded a May 10, 2024, news report from leading English publication Dawn titled “Police crackdown in AJK prompts ‘shutter-down strike’ call”. The report stated that police fired tear gas shells during clashes, and some landed in a school, affecting several girls. The demonstrations were part of a wider movement against high electricity bills and taxes in AJK. A keyword search to determine whether any vaccination campaigns were underway in Pakistan yielded a World Health Organisation (WHO) article dated Sept 16, 2025, titled: “Pakistan joins 150 countries to protect 13 million girls from cervical cancer with WHO-prequalified vaccine”. The report stated that the WHO, in collaboration with the Federal Directorate of Immunisation (FDI), launched the country’s first-ever HPV vaccination campaign to protect 13 million adolescent girls from cervical cancer, in partnership with vaccine alliance Gavi and Unicef. It added that Pakistan now joined more than 150 countries that include the WHO-prequalified vaccine in their immunisation schedules. According to the landing page for the campaign on FDI’s website: “The HPV vaccine is safe, free and effective and girls aged 9–14 years will be vaccinated from September 15-27, 2025, in schools, madrassas and health facilities across Punjab, Sindh, AJK and Islamabad.” In its announcement of the campaign, Gavi noted that the vaccine has “mild side-effects”, such as pain in the injected part of the body or a low fever that might occur, adding, however, that this was “similar to other vaccines”. Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows schoolgirls in pain after being inoculated amid the current HPV vaccination campaign is false . The video shows schoolgirls affected by tear gas shelling in AJK in May 2024, not the HPV vaccine — which is safe and only has mild side effects.

      "summary_orig": "The wife of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said Wednesday that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning while incarcerated at an Arctic prison in February 2024. Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most formidable critic for years, died in mysterious circumstances while serving a 19-year prison sentence on a string of charges widely seen as retribution for his opposition. The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-got gains of Putin’s inner circle. His allies allege he was murdered in prison, and Moscow has never fully explained the causes of his death, saying only that he fell ill while walking in the prison yard on February 16, 2024. Before he was buried, his wife Yulia Navalnaya said his allies “were able to obtain and securely transfer biological samples of Alexei abroad”. “Laboratories in two countries came to the conclusion that Alexei was killed. Specifically: poisoned,” she said in a video posted on social media. She did not divulge details of what samples were obtained nor the results of the analysis, but she urged the labs to independently release their results and to specify which poison they believe was used. Navalnaya also published unverified photos she said were of his prison cell after his body was removed, showing a pool of vomit on the floor, and claimed that testimony from prison officials said he had been convulsing on the floor. ‘Murder’ Navalny was previously poisoned with a nerve agent of the Novichok type in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering. Jailed upon his return to Russia in January 2021, he was convicted on a series of charges, including “extremism”. From behind bars, he continued to campaign against Putin and spoke out against the invasion of Ukraine. Russian authorities said he died suddenly after falling ill while walking outside after lunch in his prison colony. Following Navalny’s death, officials refused for days to release his body to his relatives, raising suspicions among his followers. Navalnaya has maintained that her husband was killed on Putin’s orders, an accusation she repeated Wednesday.\n“Vladimir Putin is guilty of the murder of my husband, Alexei Navalny,” she said. The Kremlin denies the charges. It escalated a crackdown against his allies and opponents even after his death, adding Navalnaya to a “terrorists and extremists” blacklist and sentencing his lawyers and journalists who followed his court cases to years in prison. Most of his family and key allies have long lived abroad. The Russian opposition, plagued by infighting, has struggled for relevance in exile following Navalny’s death. Public displays of opposition to Putin inside Russia have become exceptionally rare since he invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin introduced military censorship, ramped up its targeting of dissenters and critics and effectively outlawed criticism both of the Kremlin and the invasion.",

      "summary_orig": "At least three terrorists were killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district as the police foiled two attacks, officials said on Wednesday. Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com , “Three terrorists were killed in the Bannu operation responding to the attacks,\nbut the rest of the terrorists fled, taking away the bodies.” The terrorists launched attacks on the Miryan Police Station and Mazang Checkpoints late at night, according to Bannu police spokesperson Kashif Nawaz. “Due to the timely and effective response by the police, both attacks were successfully repelled,” he said, adding that four police officers were injured. He also said that the attack on the Miryan Police Station was thwarted within 20 minutes, while an exchange of fire at the Mazang Checkpoint continued for about an hour. Bannu Deputy Inspector General of Police Sajjad Khan praised the bravery and timely response of the police in a statement. “Bannu Police stands firm against terrorists on every front. Protecting the lives and property of the public is our top priority, and such cowardly acts only strengthen the morale of our force,” he said. Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks , particularly targeting police personnel.

      "summary_orig": "Security forces earlier this week killed five “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Wednesday. The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. In a press release, the ISPR said security forces conducted the IBO on the night of 14/15 September on the “reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan”. “During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the military’s media wing added. “Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” the ISPR noted. Sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area, according to the ISPR. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the military reaffirmed. The operation comes after five security personnel, including an officer, were martyred in an explosion in Balochistan’s Kech district on Monday. Over the weekend, security forces had killed 31 terrorists in two separate INOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, ISPR said. On September 12, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung. On September 7, two people were seriously injured in Khuzdar’s Naal area when an improvised explosive device was detonated, police said. Last month, security forces gunned down 50 terrorists over a four-day operation, foiling an attempt by militants to cross over from Afghanistan into Balochistan.",
