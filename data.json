The ISPR statement said that during his visit to GIDS, the Jordanian king was given a comprehensive briefing on the structure, capabilities, and product portfolio of the conglomerate. “The briefing showcased Pakistan’s progress in indigenous defence production, technological innovation, and potential avenues for bilateral defence cooperation between Pakistan and Jordan,” the statement added. Later, it said, King Abdullah visited Tilla Field Firing Ranges, where he was joined by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “Vugar Valeh oglu Mustafayev, minister of defence industry of the Republic of Azerbaijan, was also amongst the distinguished guests at the firing ranges.” At the firing ranges, the “distinguished guests witnessed a joint fire and manoeuvre exercise”, the ISPR statement said, adding that the “exercise demonstrated multi-domain operations, including conventional and air firepower, coordinated manoeuvres, spectrum warfare capabilities supported by multi-purpose drones employed in various configurations and roles”.

      "summary_orig": "Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has said that “Pakistan will respond to those who impose war on it in the same way as it did in May” this year during the brief, but intense, conflict with India, Daily Jang reported on Sunday. The army chief made these comments to the Urdu newspaper during a luncheon held in honour of King Abdullah II of Jordan, who arrived in Islamabad yesterday for a two-day visit. “During the war with India, Allah helped us raise our heads high,” Field Marshal Munir said. “When a Muslim puts their trust in Allah, He turns the dirt thrown at the enemy into missiles.” The COAS added that he performs his duties according to the command of Allah and said it was by God’s grace that Pakistan defeated its enemy. “This army is an army of Allah and our soldiers fight in His name,” the field marshal added. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched the retaliatory ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire. Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul last month, Field Marshal Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.” Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.“",

      "summary_orig": "More than 100 people were injured and 20 arrested during a massive protest on Saturday in Mexico City against the president’s handling of violent crime, local government officials said. Thousands marched on the capital’s historic main public square, the Zocalo, in a demonstration fueled by young Mexicans with ties to a global wave of Generation Z protests as well as supporters of the domestic “Sombrero Movement,” which emerged after the recent assassination of a mayor known for his fight against organised crime. View this post on Instagram AFP observed participants of all ages taking part in the rally in front of the National Palace, where President Claudia Sheinbaum lives and works. Several protesters, some wearing balaclavas, toppled the metal barriers protecting the palace and threw paving stones at riot police, who responded with tear gas, according to AFP journalists. “For many hours, this mobilisation proceeded and developed peacefully, until a group of hooded individuals began to commit acts of violence,” Pablo Vazquez, Mexico City’s security chief, told reporters. Twenty protesters and 100 police were injured, with 40 officers hospitalised for cuts and bruises, he added. Police arrested 20 people for theft and assault, Vazquez said, and had also launched an investigation into the assault of a journalist from La Jornada newspaper, who alleged that police officers were behind the incident. Inspired by murdered mayor Sheinbaum, in power since October 2024, maintained approval ratings above 70 per cent in her first year in office but faced growing criticism of her security policies in the wake of several high-profile murders. “This is one of the most corrupt governments we’ve ever had,” said Valentina Ramirez, a student interviewed by AFP . “It’s a corrupt narco-government that wants to defend the corrupt and the cartels instead of the people.” On Saturday, several protesters wore sombreros similar to the style of hat made famous by Carlos Manzo, a mayor in western Michoacan state who was assassinated on November 1. He had been known for his crusade against drug-trafficking gangs in his hometown Uruapan. The assassinated mayor’s widow, however, distanced her husband’s movement from the demonstration on Saturday. Bernardo Bravo, a leader of lime producers in the same region, had also been shot dead in late October. Earlier this week, Sheinbaum questioned the motivations for the demonstration and said at her regular morning news conference that the protest was “inorganic” and “paid for”. “It is a movement promoted from abroad against the government,” she said. Demonstrators displayed banners bearing messages such as “We are all Carlos Manzo” alongside the iconic pirate flag from the Japanese manga One Piece, which has become a symbol of youth protest around the world, from Madagascar to the Philippines and Peru. “You should have protected Carlos Manzo like this!” some protesters shouted at security forces, who responded with fire extinguishers and tear gas.",

Inspired by murdered mayor Sheinbaum, in power since October 2024, maintained approval ratings above 70 per cent in her first year in office but faced growing criticism of her security policies in the wake of several high-profile murders. “This is one of the most corrupt governments we’ve ever had,” said Valentina Ramirez, a student interviewed by AFP . “It’s a corrupt narco-government that wants to defend the corrupt and the cartels instead of the people.” On Saturday, several protesters wore sombreros similar to the style of hat made famous by Carlos Manzo, a mayor in western Michoacan state who was assassinated on November 1. He had been known for his crusade against drug-trafficking gangs in his hometown Uruapan. The assassinated mayor’s widow, however, distanced her husband’s movement from the demonstration on Saturday. Bernardo Bravo, a leader of lime producers in the same region, had also been shot dead in late October. Earlier this week, Sheinbaum questioned the motivations for the demonstration and said at her regular morning news conference that the protest was “inorganic” and “paid for”. “It is a movement promoted from abroad against the government,” she said. Demonstrators displayed banners bearing messages such as “We are all Carlos Manzo” alongside the iconic pirate flag from the Japanese manga One Piece, which has become a symbol of youth protest around the world, from Madagascar to the Philippines and Peru. “You should have protected Carlos Manzo like this!” some protesters shouted at security forces, who responded with fire extinguishers and tear gas.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Gomal University has expelled several students after a series of serious campus unrest incidents, according to an official handout issued by the varsity administration. The statement said that on various dates in October, students along with external accomplices stormed the registrar’s office, assaulted a female student, attempted to forcefully enter the vice-chancellor’s office, attacked a police guard, and showed deliberate disrespect during the national anthem at an event. Another reported incident involved anti-Pakistan slogans during a cricket match screening. A fact-finding committee was formed to investigate the incidents, after which the case was referred to the university’s disciplinary committee. The accused students were issued show-cause notices and given the opportunity to present their defence. Their replies were found unsatisfactory. Under university discipline rules, the administration expelled the involved students and cancelled their admissions. Hostel rooms were vacated and sealed. Those expelled include Aman Burki, Irfanullah, Nangyal Bittani, Ehsan Mehsud, and Tariq Bittani, while former student Amir Bittani has been banned from campus for five years. The university clarified that expelled students cannot seek admission in any other institution. The administration stated that a small group, backed by disruptive elements, has been attempting to disturb the university’s peaceful environment. It added that despite recent improvements in academics and administration under Vice-Chancellor Dr Zafar Iqbal, certain groups tried to incite unrest through false propaganda. The university has also sought support from district authorities and the police to maintain security on the campus. Published in Dawn, November 16th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "The PTI claimed on Saturday that the report by The Economist , widely circulated on social media, was nothing more than recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary. The report covered PTI founder Imran Khan’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as prime minister. Imran married Bushra in February 2018. An official response, issued by the party’s media wing, claimed that co-writer Bushra Taskeen was a known critic of PTI and the “so-called” analysis published in the report was to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and stolen elections. The party said it had the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and publication, if they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology. “We have seen this narrative play out before. Half-truths, innuendo, selective outrage, all packaged and presented as ‘objective analysis’. This attempt to misrepresent facts is not intended to inform Pakistan or its people, but rather to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and systematically stolen elections,” it claimed. “What is most striking is the convenient targeting of Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, who have been incarcerated for two years and three months, while the article remains silent on what has been happening in Pakistan for the last three years and seven months. There is no mention of human rights violations, the rigged elections confirmed even by the Commonwealth observers , the hundreds of PTI supporters who have recently been convicted to 10-year sentences in fabricated cases, or the systematic political persecution the party has faced. “Instead, the writers chose to focus on the personal lives of the country’s most popular and courageous leader, a man revered by millions of Pakistanis, while ignoring the glaring injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens, party members, and the democratic system itself.” The party further claimed that the Al Qadir Trust case, frequently cited in the article, was ongoing and had not been “fixed” as implied. “PTI has consistently sought transparency and judicial resolution. The Constitution itself has been repeatedly tampered with, in fear of Imran Khan, undermining the rule of law. One must ask the writers why they did not highlight these grave concerns and instead chose to sensationalise the personal life of the PTI leader? Furthermore, co-writer Bushra Taskeen is a known critic of PTI, demonstrating clear bias against Imran Khan and favouring the PML-N, calling into question the objectivity of this analysis,” the party stated. “Imran Khan’s own trials are far from open and fair. They are being conducted inside prison, denying him his basic rights, including meetings with family, friends, and legal counsel, despite explicit court orders. This systematic denial of due process exposes the politically motivated nature of these proceedings, yet the article conspicuously omits these facts.“ The PTI added that they “reserve the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and The Economist , should they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology for this baseless, reckless, and defamatory personal attack on the leader of 240 million Pakistanis and the millions of devoted supporters of Imran Khan worldwide”. “The people of Pakistan know the truth. They see through these attempts to malign their leader and continue to revere Imran Khan for his courage, integrity, and steadfast commitment to the nation. His moral leadership and dedication to justice remain a beacon of hope for millions, despite the relentless political persecution he and his family have endured,” the response concluded.",
