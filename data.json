The drone went down near Maldo-ri Island off the western city of Gunsan, about 180 kilometers south of Seoul, according to the officials. The U.S. 8th Fighter Wing based at Kunsan Air Base in Gunsan said the drone was involved in an \"incident\" during a routine mission at around 4:35 a.m. \"No injuries or damage to public property are reported in relation to this incident and it is currently under investigation,\" it said in a release.

The U.S. military had previously deployed Reapers to the country on a rotational basis.

      "summary_orig": "United Nations experts on Monday sounded the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the Indian government, issuing the warning in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack. Pahalgam is the site where gunmen on April 22 killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists. New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation, triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict . In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown . The arrests were carried out across multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam. “We unequivocally condemn the brutal terrorist attack on a tourist area and extend our condolences to the victims, their families, and the Government of India. However, all governments must respect international human rights law while combating terrorism,” the experts said in a press release issued today on India’s response to the attack. They noted that Indian authorities launched sweeping operations across the territory in the attack’s wake, resulting in the arrest and detention of around 2,800 individuals, including journalists and human rights defenders. They pointed out that some were detained and charged under the Public Safety Act or the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which permitted prolonged detention without charge or trial and contained “vague and overbroad definitions of terrorism”. The experts noted that some detainees were allegedly tortured, held incommunicado, and denied access to lawyers and family members. “We condemn reports of arbitrary arrests and detentions, suspicious deaths in custody, torture and other ill-treatment, lynchings, and discriminatory treatment of Kashmiri and Muslim communities,” the experts said. They further highlighted reports of punitive house demolitions and forced evictions and arbitrary displacement, targeting families of individuals perceived as supporting freedom fighters, and carried out without court orders or due process. “Such actions constitute collective punishment and defy the 2024 ruling by India’s Supreme Court, which found that such demolitions are unconstitutional and violate the rights to life and human dignity, which includes the right to protection against arbitrary displacement,” the experts said. They also expressed concern at communication blackouts and restrictions on press freedom, saying that authorities reportedly suspended mobile internet services and blocked around 8,000 social media accounts, including those of journalists and independent media outlets. “These measures are disproportionate restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” the experts noted. They remarked that India’s response to the attacks was “also felt elsewhere in India”, with Kashmiri students subjected to surveillance and harassment, following government directives requiring universities to collect their personal data. “Hate speech and incitement to violence increased against Muslims, inflamed by political figures in the ruling party. Demolitions were reported in Gujarat and Assam, where thousands of Muslim homes, mosques, and businesses were destroyed.” “Nearly 1,900 Muslims and Rohingya refugees were also expelled to Bangladesh and Myanmar, often without due process,” the press release said. The experts stressed that such expulsions violated the international obligation of non-refoulement, which prohibited returning individuals to countries where they risked persecution, arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, or other serious harm. They further highlighted what they said was the “persistent nature of violations” in the territory with several human rights defenders, including Irfan Mehraj and Khurram Parvez , being arbitrarily detained for years under draconian security laws. “We urge the immediate unconditional release of all individuals arbitrarily detained in Jammu and Kashmir.” The experts also urged India to bring its counter-terrorism laws and practices “in line with international human rights obligations and independently investigate all alleged violations” and ensure accountability, including through prosecutions. “Excessive counter-terrorism measures not only violate human dignity, the Indian constitution and international law but counter-productively fuel social division and grievances that can spiral into further violence,” the experts warned. They lastly asked Pakistan and India to peacefully resolve the Kashmir dispute, which they said had “fuelled human rights violations and the destructive cycle of cross-border violence”.",

      "summary_orig": "A Pakistani diplomat in Afghanistan met a key Afghan governor amid tensions over rising terror incidents in Pakistan, saying efforts were underway to thaw bilateral ties, according to Afghan state media and Pakistani sources who spoke to Dawn . The meeting was held hours after three Federal Constabulary men were martyred in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area this morning. Security forces quickly neutralised the attackers. This was the first high-level contact in months between the Pakistani Consul General in Jalalabad, Shafqatullah Khan and Nangarhar Governor Mullah Muhammad Naeem Akhund. Akhund is an important Taliban leader and is considered a confidant of Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada. Governor Akhund has previously served as deputy minister of Borders and Tribal Affairs and deputy minister of Civil Aviation during the Taliban’s first government from 1996-2001. He had played a key role in the Taliban’s military commission during the 20-year war against the US and its NATO allies and also led the Taliban’s military activities in southern Helmand province. He was a close confidante of the late Taliban’s chief, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, and is considered a close associate of Defense Minister Mullah Yaqoob Mujahid. “The Islamic Emirate has a constructive stance towards good relations, cooperation, and safeguarding common interests with the region, neighbouring countries, and other countries of the world, and relevant efforts in this regard are ongoing,” Afghanistan’s official Bakhtar news agency reported. Pakistan has long said that terrorist groups have used Afghan soil to plot and stage attacks across the border; a charge the Afghan Taliban deny . “The governor of Nangarhar noted the goodwill, brotherhood, and historical kinship of the Afghan people, and explained that the foundation of positive relations can remain strong in the presence of mutual respect, understanding and systematic coordination,” according to the report. No statement was issued by the Pakistani consulate about the meeting. The consulate and the Foreign Office spokesman did not reply to queries when approached for comments. However, sources with knowledge about the meeting said the Afghan governor told the diplomat that he has already “made efforts to reduce tension between the two countries”. The diplomat explained Pakistan’s position on the current security issues to Akhund, who is also keen to bring the relationship back on track. “The meeting discussed ethnicity, language, religion, culture, and other commonalities, and discussed the current situation in the region and the daily amenities of the people based on the tradition of good neighbourliness,” Bakhtar said. The meeting was attended by Nangarhar Deputy Governor Maulvi Azizullah Mustafa, Foreign Affairs Director Maulvi Jan Mohammad Inqelab, provincial spokesman Qari Ehsanullah Usmani and a number of other officials. Breakdown in Pak-Afghan ties Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.",

Pakistan has long said that terrorist groups have used Afghan soil to plot and stage attacks across the border; a charge the Afghan Taliban deny . “The governor of Nangarhar noted the goodwill, brotherhood, and historical kinship of the Afghan people, and explained that the foundation of positive relations can remain strong in the presence of mutual respect, understanding and systematic coordination,” according to the report. No statement was issued by the Pakistani consulate about the meeting. The consulate and the Foreign Office spokesman did not reply to queries when approached for comments. However, sources with knowledge about the meeting said the Afghan governor told the diplomat that he has already “made efforts to reduce tension between the two countries”. The diplomat explained Pakistan’s position on the current security issues to Akhund, who is also keen to bring the relationship back on track. “The meeting discussed ethnicity, language, religion, culture, and other commonalities, and discussed the current situation in the region and the daily amenities of the people based on the tradition of good neighbourliness,” Bakhtar said. The meeting was attended by Nangarhar Deputy Governor Maulvi Azizullah Mustafa, Foreign Affairs Director Maulvi Jan Mohammad Inqelab, provincial spokesman Qari Ehsanullah Usmani and a number of other officials. Breakdown in Pak-Afghan ties Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.",

Saudi Armed Forces Chief of General Staff General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili is currently on a visit to Pakistan and held meetings with senior officials. A statement from state broadcaster PTV News, on his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said: “General Al-Rowaili conveyed felicitations from the Saudi leadership to the prime minister and the people of Pakistan. He reaffirmed the kingdom’s strong desire to elevate the current excellent defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.” PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed his firm commitment to further strengthening the “historic fraternal relations” between the countries in all sectors, including economic, defence and security. “The prime minister welcomed General Al-Rowaili and commended Saudi Arabia for the unwavering support and solidarity it has always extended to Pakistan. He emphasised that the relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are based on shared faith, common values, and mutual trust. “The prime minister mentioned his highly successful visits to Riyadh over the past two months, during which historic Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement was signed between the two sides. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to further deepening bilateral defence cooperation, including joint training, exercises, and exchange of expertise.” PM Shehbaz also highlighted the joint resolve of both countries to combat all forms of terrorism and extremism and to promote peace and stability in the region. Earlier, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s military leadership discussed strengthening the “longstanding and strategic” cooperation between the two countries, focusing on defence, security and counterterrorism efforts, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement. The discussion took place during a meeting between Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir and General Al Rowaili at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, according to the ISPR. “During the meeting, both leaders discussed matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening the longstanding and strategic military cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” the statement said. “They emphasised the importance of further enhancing defence collaboration, security cooperation, and counter-terrorism efforts, which continue to be pillars of the deep-rooted bilateral relationship,” it added. The visiting dignitary, according to ISPR’s statement, appreciated Pakistan’s cooperation in multiple fields with the Saudi armed forces and “reaffirmed his commitment to furthering the strong bonds of cooperation”. “Upon arrival at GHQ, General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and was presented a Guard of Honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army,” said the statement. General Al Rowaili later called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters. “During the meeting, both sides discussed evolving global and regional security environment. The dignitaries also explored concrete measures to deepen engagements between the armed forces of both countries and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen defence and security ties. “The CJCSC reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and ensuring the protection of Harmain al-Sharifain,” the ISPR said. In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both. Earlier this month , CGS Lieutenant General Aamer Raza met General Rowaily in Riyadh to discuss broadening strategic ties and strengthening the mutual defence agreement signed by the two nations.

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz claimed on Monday that the PTI did not boycott yesterday’s by-elections but rather participated in all 13 constituencies up for grabs. By-elections were held on six National Assembly and seven Punjab Assembly seats on Sunday. The PML-N fielded its candidates on all seats except a provincial one in Muzaffargarh, and secured victory on all 12 of them. The PPP contested on three seats but could only win the Punjab Assembly seat from Muzaffargarh. The PTI failed to grab either of the Haripur or Lahore NA seats it campaigned for. “This was not even a boycott of the elections. What they are describing as a boycott, I have not seen such hypocrisy during my entire life,” CM Maryam said while addressing a meeting of provincial ministers today. “PTI candidates contested in all constituencies. They contested on ‘ qaidi No. 804’ (Imran) with photos of their leader. They set up polling camps, displayed pictures and campaigned while taking the [PTI’s] name. “And when they lost, they said ‘we boycotted’,” the chief minister said. The PML-N leader said the PTI employed a strategy where it would claim popular support “despite a boycott” if it won, but also attribute any loss to its boycott call. “This is a drama,” she quipped. During her address, Maryam repeatedly criticised the PTI’s “narrative” of a boycott, contending that politicians never opt out of democratic processes even if they have slim chances of emerging victorious. “[Lt] General Faiz Hameed went to jail, Umar Ata Bandial and Imran-daar judges went home, so they do not want to contest elections now,” she said, referring to the former intelligence chief and the ex-chief justice. The Punjab CM slammed the PTI for indulging in “politics of narrative”, saying that narratives had a shelf-life, which had now ended. The PML-N leader also recalled the July 2018 elections won by the PTI in the wake of the imprisonment of the top PML-N leadership, including her and her father Nawaz Sharif, who had been ousted as the prime minister the year prior. “Even us in 2018, when Nawaz Sharif sahib and I were in jail, I was perhaps the first Pakistani woman they jailed and did many injustices to,” Maryam claimed. “But we did not boycott the elections. We contested even in the worst circumstances,” she added, terming them the “most difficult elections” of the PML-N’s history. “I was alone here; Maryam Nawaz vs the entire power of the state,” she said, adding that the now-banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was “also created during that election”. “General Faiz’s entire power was with the PTI and Yasmin Rashid. It was the most difficult election in history [for us],” Maryam said. Addressing the PTI, the Punjab CM said, “When you break laws, when you take up militancy, you have no right to call yourself a political party.” “You conducted rigging, but were allowed to continue. You did manipulation and made people lose elections, but no one said anything. But the day you attacked your own country, your downfall started,” she said, referring to the May 9, 2023 riots . Maryam went on to assert that the “extra votes in all constituencies” were from people who switched support from PTI to PML-N. “The public accepted service, they stamped Nawaz’s ideology and buried the politics of lies, hypocrisy and conspiracy forever,” she added.",

What they are describing as a boycott, I have not seen such hypocrisy during my entire life,” CM Maryam said while addressing a meeting of provincial ministers today. “PTI candidates contested in all constituencies. They contested on ‘ qaidi No. 804’ (Imran) with photos of their leader. They set up polling camps, displayed pictures and campaigned while taking the [PTI’s] name. “And when they lost, they said ‘we boycotted’,” the chief minister said. The PML-N leader said the PTI employed a strategy where it would claim popular support “despite a boycott” if it won, but also attribute any loss to its boycott call. “This is a drama,” she quipped. During her address, Maryam repeatedly criticised the PTI’s “narrative” of a boycott, contending that politicians never opt out of democratic processes even if they have slim chances of emerging victorious. “[Lt] General Faiz Hameed went to jail, Umar Ata Bandial and Imran-daar judges went home, so they do not want to contest elections now,” she said, referring to the former intelligence chief and the ex-chief justice. The Punjab CM slammed the PTI for indulging in “politics of narrative”, saying that narratives had a shelf-life, which had now ended. The PML-N leader also recalled the July 2018 elections won by the PTI in the wake of the imprisonment of the top PML-N leadership, including her and her father Nawaz Sharif, who had been ousted as the prime minister the year prior. “Even us in 2018, when Nawaz Sharif sahib and I were in jail, I was perhaps the first Pakistani woman they jailed and did many injustices to,” Maryam claimed. “But we did not boycott the elections. We contested even in the worst circumstances,” she added, terming them the “most difficult elections” of the PML-N’s history. “I was alone here; Maryam Nawaz vs the entire power of the state,” she said, adding that the now-banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was “also created during that election”. “General Faiz’s entire power was with the PTI and Yasmin Rashid. It was the most difficult election in history [for us],” Maryam said. Addressing the PTI, the Punjab CM said, “When you break laws, when you take up militancy, you have no right to call yourself a political party.” “You conducted rigging, but were allowed to continue. You did manipulation and made people lose elections, but no one said anything. But the day you attacked your own country, your downfall started,” she said, referring to the May 9, 2023 riots . Maryam went on to assert that the “extra votes in all constituencies” were from people who switched support from PTI to PML-N. “The public accepted service, they stamped Nawaz’s ideology and buried the politics of lies, hypocrisy and conspiracy forever,” she added.",

      "summary_orig": "Saudi Arabia plans to open two new alcohol stores, including one serving non-Muslim, foreign staff at state oil giant Aramco, as the kingdom further eases restrictions, according to people briefed on the plans. The launch of outlets in the eastern province of Dhahran and one for diplomats in the port city of Jeddah would be a further milestone in efforts, led by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to open up the country. The kingdom last year opened an alcohol store serving non-Muslim diplomats in the capital Riyadh — the first such outlet since a ban was brought in 73 years ago. Store planned in Aramco compound, says source The new store in Dhahran will be set up in a compound owned by Aramco, one of the three people who talked to Reuters said. That store would be open for non-Muslims working for Aramco, the source added, who said Saudi authorities had informed them of the plan. Two of the sources said a third liquor store was also in the works for non-Muslim diplomats in the city of Jeddah, where many missions have honorary consuls. Both stores were expected to open in 2026, but no timelines had been released, two of the sources said. The government media office did not immediately reply to questions over the plans for the stores in both locations, which were previously unreported. Aramco declined to comment. There was no officially announced change made to regulations after the opening of the Riyadh store in a nondescript building in the diplomatic quarter known to some diplomats as the “booze bunker”. The Riyadh store’s customer base was recently expanded to include non-Muslim Saudi Premium Residency holders, two of the sources said. Premium residencies have been awarded to entrepreneurs, major investors and those with special talents. Before the Riyadh store, alcohol was largely only available through diplomatic mail, the black market or home brewing. In other Gulf countries, apart from Kuwait, alcohol is available with some restrictions. Reforms cover events, women’s driving While alcoholic drinks are still off limits for the vast majority of the population, under the crown prince’s reforms, both Saudis and foreigners can now take part in once-unthinkable activities, from dancing at desert raves to going to the cinema. Other reforms have included allowing women The kingdom has been easing restrictions to lure tourists and international businesses as part of an ambitious plan to diversify its economy and make itself less dependent on oil. In May, a media report , picked up by some international media after appearing on a wine blog, said Saudi authorities had planned to allow alcohol sales in tourist settings as the country prepares to host the 2034 soccer World Cup. The report, which was denied at the time by a Saudi official, did not give a source for the information. That report had sparked a vigorous online debate in the kingdom. Social liberalisation has proceeded at a breakneck pace, but the leadership have taken a more gradual and cautious approach to the question of alcohol. The ban on alcohol is still in place, a measure not uncommon in Muslim countries, where alcohol use is often restricted. Saudi Arabia has been aggressively expanding its local tourism portfolio with the giant Red Sea Global development , which includes plans to open 17 new hotels by next May. These ultra-luxury resorts remain dry. Asked by Reuters this month if there were any plans to ease restrictions on alcohol to help attract foreign visitors, Saudi Tourism Minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb said: “We do understand that some of the international travellers want to enjoy alcohol when they visit the Saudi destinations, but nothing has changed yet.” Pressed on whether “yet” meant that it could soon change, he said: “I will leave it to you on how to elaborate on it.” Saudi residents report booze ban eased for select foreigners Separately, diplomats and premium visa-holders in Saudi Arabia also told AFP that the conservative kingdom has quietly eased restrictions on purchasing alcohol for select foreign residents. While the government has not made any statements regarding the sale of alcohol in recent days, the sources said non-Muslim individuals with so-called premium resident status are now able to buy booze at the country’s sole liquor store in Riyadh, which was previously reserved for diplomats. AFP spoke with four people who said the rules had changed, including two diplomatic sources and a couple of residents with premium visa status. “I heard about it from friends who tried it. I went there two days ago and it actually worked,” one premium visa-holder told AFP on condition of anonymity. “It saved me a lot of money rather than buying from the black market. Prices are reasonable and we finally can buy alcohol.” AFP reached out to Saudi authorities for comment on the reports, but they did not respond by the time the story was published. Started in 2019, premium resident status in Saudi Arabia is available to a select group of foreigners who meet a variety of requirements, including making a one-time payment of 800,000 riyals ($213,000). The visa allows people to live, work and invest freely in Saudi Arabia without a local “sponsor” — a kind of guarantor required for other non-nationals to live in the kingdom. A premium residency-holder told AFP that he went to the liquor store and saw a man with the same status purchase alcohol before buying bottles himself. “It actually worked for me, it’s so easy,” he said. ‘Walking out with 30 bottles’ A Western diplomat told AFP that acquaintances of his with premium residency had managed to buy alcohol in the past few days. “Expats WhatsApp groups are being flooded with the news,” he added. A diplomat told AFP that “the [liquor] store was packed” on Saturday, when she saw “people walking out with 30 bottles”. The apparent loosening of the liquor regulations comes nearly two years after the kingdom opened its first and only liquor store in January 2024 in the capital’s diplomatic quarter, catering exclusively to non-Muslim foreign envoys. There was no official announcement at the time, with two sources confirming the reports to AFP at the time.",

Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British army, and David Evans, Lord Evans of Watford, were filmed breaking the rules in undercover footage recorded by the Guardian. In June 2022 , Dannatt lobbied ministers and officials to provide millions of pounds in financial support for a venture looking to purchase a fertiliser factory. Three days after the meeting with a minister, he was paid £2,000, followed by a further three payments of £2,000 months later. In January 2023 and September 2024 , at the instigation of executives at Teledyne, a US defence company that paid him, Dannatt wrote to Home Office ministers to lobby them for “assurances” the government was taking action against Palestine Action. The letters followed an attack by the group on the company’s factory. In January 2024 , Dannatt wrote to the UK’s top diplomat in Ghana to organise a meeting with her that he attended with the director of a British goldmine company. They used that meeting to lobby her to get support from the Ghanaian government for the company, in which Dannatt had shares. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "Three Federal Constabulary (FC) men were martyred in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area on Monday morning. The attack occurred on one of the city’s busiest roads just after 8am. Video footage of the incident showed one terrorist, clad in a chaddor, approaching the gate and detonating himself. Seconds later, two other terrorists tried to enter the compound. The attack occurred as an assembly for the first working day of the week was being held at the main compound. “Initially, three militants tried to attack the headquarters. One terrorist blew himself up at the gate, while two others tried to enter the premises but were gunned down by FC personnel,” Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad said while speaking to reporters. He further said that three FC men had been martyred in the suicide attack at the gate, while two others were injured. He added that a clearance operation had been carried out. Asked whether a threat alert had been issued prior to the incident, the police official said, “You are aware of the overall situation of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the country, so we are on high alert. They were unable to enter [the headquarters] due to this alertness. They were neutralised at the gate.” The Jamatul Ahrar faction of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack. The paramilitary force, originally called the Fron­tier Constabulary, was renamed by the government in July. The headquarters of the force is located in a crowded area, close to a military cantonment. The headquarters building houses barracks, hospitals, and residential quarters. Meanwhile, an emergency was declared at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), Peshawar’s largest public sector hospital, and Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH). The spokesmen of the hospitals confirmed that 11 injured had been brought to LRH while one injured person had been brought to KTH. Today’s incident is the second major terrorist attack on a security installation in Peshawar in the last three years. In February 2023, 84 people were killed in a suicide attack on a mosque in Peshawar’s Police Lines. Terror attack condemned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the terrorist attack and lauded security forces for their “timely action,” as per a statement issued by the PM Office. “Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” he said, praying for the recovery of the injured. He reaffirmed that the government remained resolute in eradicating terrorism, and vowed to crush any terrorist plots against Pakistan. President Asif Ali Zardari also condemned the attack, offering condolences to the families of the martyrs. He affirmed that “externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses to refer to the TTP. In a statement condemning the attack, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the sacrifices of the martyred personnel would always be remembered. Naqvi also paid tribute to the “brave soldiers of FC, who foiled the Fitna-Al-Khwarij attack by taking timely action”. He also expressed “heartfelt sympathies for the families of the martyred”. KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement, paid tribute to the martyrs and security forces, stressing that “such cowardly attacks can not weaken our morale”. Their sacrifice would not go in vain, he said, vowing to bring the terrorists to justice and continuing the war against terrorism with a “stronger resolve”. CM Afridi affirmed that the provincial government stood with the police and law enforcement agencies, adding that “every resource available will be utilised to eliminate terrorism”. The chief minister directed authorities to treat the injured and prayed for the families of the martyrs. Later, he attended the funeral prayers of the martyred personnel, a statement issued by the CM’s Office said. It added that CM Afridi paid tribute to the martyrs and said that their sacrifices “strengthen our resolve against terrorism”. He also visited LRH before attending the funeral prayers and spoke to the media. The CM said,“Terrorists have always intended to disturb peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan […]Those who will resort to this are our and Pakistan’s enemies, and we will not let them do this. “They cannot weaken our resolve and courage.” Asked whether he had held any talks with security agencies regarding security issues, CM Afridi said: “I have been briefed. The provincial government has ordered modern equipment for [police], but unfortunately, its delivery is taking time. Bullet cars are here, and we are working on capacity building of police.” KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi posted on X that he “strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist attack on the FC Headquarters in Peshawar. Such acts of violence are an affront to the peace and security of our nation”. “I commend the swift and courageous response of the FC personnel, which successfully prevented a greater tragedy. I extend my deepest condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs, and pray for the swift and full recovery of all those injured in this attack. “Let there be no doubt: neither cowardly attacks nor external threats can weaken our resolve. The entire nation, and especially the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, stand firmly with our security forces in the fight against terrorism,” he added. In its condemnation, the PTI termed the attack “unfortunate”. The party posted on X that it extended condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the quick recovery of the injured. “We salute the sacrifices of our security institutions and are standing with them for the protection of our country,” the party’s statement read. Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti also paid tribute to the security forces for foiling the attack. PPP’s Sherry Rehman also condemned the attack. “Heartfelt condolences to the families of the FC martyrs. We all laud the courageous defenders from our security forces whose vigilance prevented the suicide bombers from going inside to pursue their nefarious goals,” she said in a post on X. “No such #terrorist plots or attackers backed by external sources, which it seems they were, can or will weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve,” she said. PPP Chairperson and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack, saying that “such cowardly attacks cannot weaken our resolve” to end terrorism. A statement on the PPP’s official X account further quoted him as saying: “The PPP will continue its struggle for the elimination of terrorism, safety of the people and lasting peace in the country. “Our nation’s unity, courage and resolve against terrorism will ensure the failure of every conspiracy by terrorists.” Bilawal also paid tribute to the martyred FC personnel and said their “sacrifices will not go in vain”. He prayed for the martyred personnel and their families, as well as for those injured in the attack, the statement said. Senator Allama Raja Nasir posted on X: “I unequivocally condemn this morning’s despicable terrorist attack on the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Peshawar, which claimed the lives of three brave personnel and left two others wounded. My deepest condolences go to the bereaved families of the shaheeds (martyrs), and I pray for the early recovery of the injured.” He further said, “Although terrorism has intensified in recent years, a disturbing pattern has emerged in recent weeks with first the Cadet College in Wana , then the blast at Islamabad’s district courts , and now this assault on the FC Headquarters. These are not random acts, they are part of a calculated campaign by enemies of Pakistan who are exploiting our vulnerabilities.” The senator asserted that “at this critical juncture, the country expects complete transparency, effective intelligence coordination, and decisive action so that those who plan and finance these attacks are brought to justice, no matter where the trail leads. We want our troops and law enforcement agencies to focus singularly on eliminating the menace of the TTP and its affiliates.” Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Today’s incident comes less than three months after a similar one in September, during which six soldiers were martyred and five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the FC Headquarters in Bannu. According to the military, the attack was carried out by “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij ” . Additional input from Reuters",

The party posted on X that it extended condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the quick recovery of the injured. “We salute the sacrifices of our security institutions and are standing with them for the protection of our country,” the party’s statement read. Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti also paid tribute to the security forces for foiling the attack. PPP’s Sherry Rehman also condemned the attack. “Heartfelt condolences to the families of the FC martyrs. We all laud the courageous defenders from our security forces whose vigilance prevented the suicide bombers from going inside to pursue their nefarious goals,” she said in a post on X. “No such #terrorist plots or attackers backed by external sources, which it seems they were, can or will weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve,” she said. PPP Chairperson and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack, saying that “such cowardly attacks cannot weaken our resolve” to end terrorism. A statement on the PPP’s official X account further quoted him as saying: “The PPP will continue its struggle for the elimination of terrorism, safety of the people and lasting peace in the country. “Our nation’s unity, courage and resolve against terrorism will ensure the failure of every conspiracy by terrorists.” Bilawal also paid tribute to the martyred FC personnel and said their “sacrifices will not go in vain”. He prayed for the martyred personnel and their families, as well as for those injured in the attack, the statement said. Senator Allama Raja Nasir posted on X: “I unequivocally condemn this morning’s despicable terrorist attack on the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Peshawar, which claimed the lives of three brave personnel and left two others wounded. My deepest condolences go to the bereaved families of the shaheeds (martyrs), and I pray for the early recovery of the injured.” He further said, “Although terrorism has intensified in recent years, a disturbing pattern has emerged in recent weeks with first the Cadet College in Wana , then the blast at Islamabad’s district courts , and now this assault on the FC Headquarters. These are not random acts, they are part of a calculated campaign by enemies of Pakistan who are exploiting our vulnerabilities.” The senator asserted that “at this critical juncture, the country expects complete transparency, effective intelligence coordination, and decisive action so that those who plan and finance these attacks are brought to justice, no matter where the trail leads. We want our troops and law enforcement agencies to focus singularly on eliminating the menace of the TTP and its affiliates.” Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies. Today’s incident comes less than three months after a similar one in September, during which six soldiers were martyred and five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the FC Headquarters in Bannu. According to the military, the attack was carried out by “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij ” . Additional input from Reuters",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated PML-N candidates on Monday for their overwhelming win in yesterday’s by-polls , which were held amid an election boycott by the opposition PTI in all constituencies except for two, low voter turnout and rigging allegations. According to provisional results, the PML-N won all six National Assembly (NA) seats and six of seven Punjab Assembly seats up for grabs. One provincial seat was won by the PPP, which fielded its candidates in only three of the 13 constituencies. Most of these seats were vacated following the disqualification of PTI members due to their convictions in May 9 cases . In separate but similar statements, PM Shehbaz congratulated the PML-N candidates for their victories in NA-18 (Haripur), NA-96 and NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan), PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), and Faisalabad’s PP-98, PP-116 and PP-115. The statements issued by the PM’s Office said the premier congratulated the candidates for their “brilliant success”. The statements quoted him as saying that the PML-N’s success in the by-polls was a result of party supremo Nawaz Sharif’s vision and “exemplary leadership”, as well as the hard work of party workers. “The success in the by-elections reflects public trust in Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s hard work for the progress of people of the province,” he said, adding that the public had expressed confidence in the PML-N during the by-polls. “The success in elections is a reflection of the public confidence in the government’s performance,” he reiterated. Separately, he mentioned the PML-N’s win in NA-143 (Sahiwal), PP-203 (Sahiwal) and NA-129 (Lahore), saying that the people expressed confidence in the “PML-N’s objectives of development, stability, and public welfare” during the by-elections. Here, too, he credited Nawaz’s leadership and Maryam’s hard work for these wins. Nawaz himself also offered congratulations to the party’s winners. PTI alleges polling discrepancies in Haripur On Monday morning, the provisional results for NA-18 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur were also issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), according to which PML-N’s Babar Nawaz Khan secured victory with 163,996 votes. The Form-47 for the constituency — the provisional consolidated statement of results for vote count of all polling stations prepared by the returning officer (RO) concerned — showed that PTI-backed independent candidate Shehrnaz Omar Ayub was the first runner-up with 120,220 votes. Shehrnaz is the wife of PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the NA opposition leader. The seat had fallen vacant following Ayub’s disqualification. Shehrnaz had contested the polls against PML-N’s Nawaz and PPP’s Irum Fatima Turk with the “kettle” symbol. While Ayub and former MPA Momina Basit had been campaigning for her, Shehrnaz herself abstained from appearing in public meetings. Speaking to reporters today, Ayub rejected the results and said he would challenge them before a court tribunal and launch a series of peaceful protests. “The returning officer (RO) stole our election,” he alleged, asserting that his wife was ahead of her PML-N rival by over 27,000 votes from over 500 polling stations. The PTI leader said that their candidate’s results were changed: “We have the Form-45s of all polling stations but the results compiled by the RO and displayed on screen were totally different.” In an earlier video statement, Ayub had said that the RO was “refusing to accept the original Form-45s and saying he will only acknowledge the forms brought to him”. “They have prepared duplicate Form-45s,” Ayub alleged. Senior PTI leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser also “rejected” the by-election results in a statement and termed the voting process “fraudulent and ridden by rigging”. He described the by-polls as a “flagrant violation of the constitutional rules for conducting the voting process in the country”. Qaiser said the handling of the by-election reflected “open rigging and has once again exposed its dark face before the nation“. In a separate post on X, Qaiser claimed that the Form-45s showed Shehrnaz was leading by a margin of 25,000 votes from 519 polling stations. However, the ECP staff was “uploading the wrong results on the official website”, he alleged, raising serious questions over the transparency and credibility of the electoral process. Taking note of the low voter turnout in other constituencies, the PTI leader also claimed that the public heeded the party’s call to boycott those by-elections. He said that reports indicated that voter turnout remained between 15 and 18 per cent, while “over 80pc of citizens rejected the polls, opting to stay home”. Qaiser termed the elections unrepresentative and demanded that the “non-transparent” results be annulled immediately. He claimed that the present government and the ECP “failed to provide an environment” where citizens could freely choose their leadership. The former speaker further said that practices of “abductions, arrests, intimidation, restrictions on campaigning, voter manipulation, and tampering with Form-47 are routine” for the ECP. Yesterday, Ayub’s brother, Yusuf Ayub, accused the ECP of being biased against Shehrnaz, citing the “posting of presiding officers, other polling staff and changing our election symbol”. Babar, who had earlier served as MNA during 2015-2018, has won the support of his party leaders, including CM Maryam’s husband, retired Captain Safdar Awan. According to observers , Haripur’s political landscape remains dominated by patronage rather than ideology. Not a single woman in the district’s history could ever make it to the provincial or the National Assembly in a direct election. Other by-election results According to provisional results , PML-N candidates emerged victorious in NA-104 (Faisalabad-X), NA-129 (Lahore-XIII) , NA-143 (Sahiwal-III), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-II), PP-73 (Sargodha-III), PP-87 (Mianwali-III), PP-115 (Faisalabad-XVIII), PP-116 (Faisalabad-XIX) and PP-203 (Sahiwal-VI). The provisional results for NA-96 (Faisalabad-II) showed PML-N’s Bilal Badar Chaudhry, the brother of Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, won the race with 93,009 votes. He was competing against 15 aspirants, among whom independent candidate Nawab Sher bagged 43,025 votes to come out as the first runner-up. For PP-98 (Faisalabad-I) , the Form-47 showed that PML-N’s Azad Ali Tabassum had secured victory, bagging 44,388 votes and beating independent candidate Muhammad Ajmal by a margin of 9,142 ballots. The PPP, which had contested in Haripur’s NA-18, DG Khan’s NA-185 and Muzaffargarh’s PP-269, managed to emerge victorious on the Muzaffargarh provincial seat. The ruling PML-N had not fielded any candidate against PPP’s Alamdar Qureshi in the constituency, which was among the by-elections boycotted by the PTI, paving the way for the PPP’s win. Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency, said on social media platform X yesterday that if the PML-N managed to win five NA seats in these by-polls, it would “not need PPP votes for a simple majority in [the] NA in future”. “In other words, PML-N can stay in power without PPP’s support!” the election expert added.",

      "summary_orig": "Washington and Kyiv said that any eventual deal to halt the war with Russia must fully uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty, after “constructive” talks between US, Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva. After a day of meetings that kicked off based on a United States’ proposal that was criticised as being in Russia’s favour, negotiators have drafted “an updated and refined peace framework”, a US-Ukraine joint statement said on Sunday. US President Donald Trump had given Ukraine until November 27 to approve his plan to end the nearly four-year conflict, which began after Russia launched a full-scale invasion . But Kyiv was seeking changes to the draft that accepted a range of Russia’s hardline demands, with the 28-point plan requiring the invaded country to cede territory, cut its army and pledge never to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( Nato ). “The talks were constructive, focused, and respectful, underscoring the shared commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace,” the joint statement said. “They reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty and deliver a sustainable and just peace,” it said, noting “meaningful progress”. Both sides pledged to keep working on joint proposals “in the coming days”. But even as the White House said in a separate statement that the talks marked a “significant step forward”, a Russian drone strike on the major Ukrainian city of Kharkiv killed four people, its mayor said. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of “tremendous” progress after a day of meetings, while the head of Ukraine’s delegation Andriy Yermak also told reporters the sides had made “very good progress”. The Ukrainian delegation referred to a new version of the US draft plan , which has yet to be published, saying it “already reflects most of Ukraine’s key priorities”. This photo shows a general view of a room inside a house that was partially destroyed by a Russian drone strike in Kharkiv late on Nov 23, 2025, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. — AFP Rubio, whose delegation included Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff, told reporters that the work to narrow the areas of disagreement had advanced “in a very substantial way”. “I can tell you that the items that remain open are not insurmountable,” he said, adding: “I honestly believe we’ll get there.” Rubio stressed that any final agreement would “have to be agreed upon by the presidents, and there are a couple [of] issues that we need to continue to work on” before trying to bring on board the Kremlin, which welcomed the original proposal. “Obviously, the Russians get a vote.” Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would speak with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Monday. Turkey has hosted three rounds of talks on ending the war. ‘Zero gratitude’ claim His comments came after Trump earlier lashed out at Ukraine. “Ukraine ‘leadership’ has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts,” Trump wrote in uppercase on his Truth Social platform, also accusing European countries of not doing enough to stop the war, but offering no direct condemnation of Moscow. Not long after, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X that his country was “grateful to the United States… and personally to President Trump” for the assistance that has been “saving Ukrainian lives”. Announcing a deadly Russian drone strike, Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram yesterday it was “truly horrible” that despite the negotiations, “Russian troops are attacking civilian objects, civilian infrastructure, residential buildings”. At the end of the day, Rubio said he thought Trump was “quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made”. Asked about whether he believed a deal could be reached by Thursday, he said the “deadline is we want to get this done as soon as possible”. “I think we made a tremendous amount of progress. I feel very optimistic that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.” European ‘centrality’ The US plan was drafted without input from Ukraine’s European allies, who were scrambling on Sunday to make their voices heard and boost Kyiv’s position. EU countries plan to discuss the Ukraine situation on the sidelines of a meeting with African leaders in Angola today. “Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, stressing that the “centrality” of the European Union’s role must be “fully reflected” in any peace plan. A number of leaders called Trump on Sunday, with Downing Street saying United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the US president had agreed “that we all must work together at this critical moment to bring about a just and lasting peace”.",

      "title_orig": "Two courts jostle for space in ‘joint-family home’",
      "summary_orig": "AFTER receiving a warm and cordial welcome during its inauguration at the Islamabad High Court (IHC) building, calls are now growing to shift the newly-formed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) to its originally-designated premises, in the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) building. The ongoing tug-of-war over who gets control of the Constitution Ave­nue premises is increasingly starting to resemble a joint family squeezed into an old ancestral home, where every member complains about inadequate space and competing needs. Last week, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) demanded that the FCC be moved out of its temporary location within the IHC building, asserting that the new court must eventually operate from the FSC premises. The bar leadership also warned that any attempt to relocate the IHC itself would be met with determined legal and democratic resistance. Islamabad judiciary wary as newly formed Federal Constitutional Court could potentially usurp its coveted Constitution Avenue location The establishment of the FCC has exposed what many observers describe as a lack of planning on the part of policymakers. The FCC — initially part of the 26th Constitutional Amendment package, but removed shortly before its passage — was reintroduced in the 27th Amendment. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had reportedly finalised the FSC building for the FCC days before the amendment was tabled in parliament. However, the decision to convert the FSC building into the FCC’s permanent home was taken unilaterally, without consulting Shariat Court judges. Under the plan, four FSC judges and a backlog of only 56 pending petitions were to be shifted to the IHC’s third floor, where the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was instructed to urgently prepare four new courtrooms. Simultaneously, the CDA was tasked with renovating FSC courtrooms for FCC judges. But when CDA teams arrived to take possession of the Shariat Court premises, the administration strongly resisted, even preventing their entry. FSC Chief Justice Iqbal Hameedur Rehman, along with other judges, subsequently met Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and conveyed their reservations over what they termed a unilateral and abrupt order, requiring them to vacate their purpose-built premises within a week. A senior lawyer remarked that the situation was ironic: “A tenant is normally granted at least a month to vacate a rented property, yet the FSC judges were expected to leave within a week from a building acquired specifically for the Shariat Court”. Cramped space After the 27th Amendment was passed and received presidential assent, the oath-taking ceremony of the FCC Chief Justice was held at the Presidency, attended by the top civil, military and legal leadership. But with the FSC building still not handed over to the FCC, the oath-taking for the judges had to be held at the Islamabad High Court. The initial oath ceremony for three judges took place on November 14 at an open space at the IHC, where IHCBA office-bearers and senior lawyers warmly greeted the newly-appointed judges. The following day, Justice K.K. Agha was administered the oath in a cramped conference room, which could accommodate barely 25-30 people. On November 17, the oaths of Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah were also conducted in the same congested room. The IHC administration arranged seven courtrooms to enable the FCC to function temporarily until its permanent premises were finalised. But once senior staff of the FCC — many of them brought in from the Supreme Court — assumed their roles, the shortage of space became even more pronounced. The allocation of courtrooms also caused unease. The FCC chief justice was assigned Courtroom No. 2, previously used by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani for his own judicial work. Senior officials within the high court expressed the apprehension that since the FCC is the highest constitutional forum, its chief justice could potentially assume control of the IHC building if he so desired. Bar divided At Friday’s press conference, IHCBA President Wajid Ali Gilani emphasised that the FCC’s use of IHC premises must remain temporary. “The FCC must first be moved to the Supreme Court building, and permanently to the FSC, where the caseload is lower and infrastructure already exists,” he said. “No institution will be allowed to impose itself on the site of the high court.” “Any administrative decision taken without consultation with the legal community is unacceptable and will be vigorously resisted,” he warned. Mr Gilani recalled that Islamabad’s judicial framework had evolved from a single court functioning in Melody Market in 1960, to a full-fledged system with more than a hundred judges. He said buildings constructed through public funds must operate according to constitutional norms rather than administrative convenience. IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said rumours of the IHC’s relocation stemmed from a private TV report with “no legal or administrative standing”. He warned: “If anyone tries to wall off the High Court, there will be a strong protest. This community will not allow the judiciary’s independence to be compromised.” In stark contrast to the high court bar’s position, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) — commonly known as the District Bar — welcomed the proposal to shift the high court back to its old premises in Sector G-10. After a cabinet meeting on Friday, IBA President Chaudhry Naeem Ali Gujjar said the proposal would alleviate difficulties faced by lawyers and litigants. “Shifting the high court back to G-10 is a practical and long-awaited step. It will facilitate the legal community and improve access to justice,” he said. Published in Dawn, November 24th, 2025",
