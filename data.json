The Seoul Central District Court held the hearing to determine whether Yoon should be held further on charges of aiding the enemy and power abuse in connection with his alleged drone deployment to North Korea in October last year. Yoon, who has been held in custody since July on charges of obstructing justice by blocking his detention by investigators in January, is currently set to be released after his six-month arrest expires Jan. 18. Special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team requested an extension of his arrest last month while additionally indicting him over the alleged drone operation, which it claimed was aimed at inciting the North's retaliation and using it as a pretext for the martial law declaration in December last year. The hearing was held behind closed doors. In the event an extension is granted, Yoon could be jailed for up to six more months. A verdict on the obstruction of justice charge is set to be delivered Jan. 16. A s",

      "summary_orig": "Korea's homegrown KF-21 fighter jets under development will be fitted with air-to-ground capabilities starting in 2027, ahead of schedule, the state arms procurement agency said Tuesday. The plan comes as authorities plan to spend around 700 billion won ($472 million) to conduct a series of tests involving 10 different types of air-to-ground weapons until the end of 2028, according to the Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA). The plan is expected to secure ground attack capabilities for the homegrown fighter jet around 1 1/2 years earlier than planned, in a move strengthening the Air Force's strength and positively affecting potential exports, DAPA said. Korea launched the KF-21 development program in 2015 to acquire a homegrown supersonic fighter to replace the Air Force's aging fleet of U.S.-made jets, including the F-5. The first production model of the indigenous fighter jet entered final assembly in May.",

      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump, who has now on several occasions in the past praised Chief of Defence Force and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, has now called him a “highly respected general”. The US president’s latest remarks came as he addressed a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida. During the press conference, Trump announced a new class of heavily armed warships that will be named after himself — an honour usually reserved for leaders who have left office. Asked about the progress of talks between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said that his administration had so far “stopped eight wars” — a claim that he has repeated in the past. “We stopped a potential nuclear war between Pakistan and India,” Trump said. “The head of Pakistan and a highly respected general — he is a field marshal — and also the prime minister of Pakistan said that President Trump saved 10 million lives, maybe more, by getting that war [ sic ].” “You know, eight planes were shot down, the war was starting to rage,” he said. “We have solved many wars; the only one we have not solved yet is Russia and Ukraine,” the US president said. He noted that there was a lot of “hatred” between the two nations. This is the latest in a series of compliments that Trump has given to CDF Field Marshal Munir since their meeting in Washington in June. On June 19, he extended an unprecedented invitation to the army chief for a historic luncheon at the White House. The US president has since lauded Munir on several occasions, even referring to him as “my favourite field marshal”. On October 29, Trump praised CDF Field Marshal Munir, calling him a “great fighter” while talking about the Pakistan and India conflict in May. In his comments, he said: “I’m doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love, as you know, for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said. “Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the field marshal — they have a field marshal. You know why he’s a field marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy, too.” A day prior, he had lauded the role of the CDF in the ceasefire agreement following the May conflict. The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”. In November, he stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.",

During the press conference, Trump announced a new class of heavily armed warships that will be named after himself — an honour usually reserved for leaders who have left office. Asked about the progress of talks between Russia and Ukraine, Trump said that his administration had so far “stopped eight wars” — a claim that he has repeated in the past. “We stopped a potential nuclear war between Pakistan and India,” Trump said. “The head of Pakistan and a highly respected general — he is a field marshal — and also the prime minister of Pakistan said that President Trump saved 10 million lives, maybe more, by getting that war [ sic ].” “You know, eight planes were shot down, the war was starting to rage,” he said. “We have solved many wars; the only one we have not solved yet is Russia and Ukraine,” the US president said. He noted that there was a lot of “hatred” between the two nations. This is the latest in a series of compliments that Trump has given to CDF Field Marshal Munir since their meeting in Washington in June. On June 19, he extended an unprecedented invitation to the army chief for a historic luncheon at the White House. The US president has since lauded Munir on several occasions, even referring to him as “my favourite field marshal”. On October 29, Trump praised CDF Field Marshal Munir, calling him a “great fighter” while talking about the Pakistan and India conflict in May. In his comments, he said: “I’m doing a trade deal with India, and I have great respect and love, as you know, for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as you know. We have a great relationship,” he said. “Likewise, the prime minister of Pakistan is a great guy, and the field marshal — they have a field marshal. You know why he’s a field marshal? He’s a great fighter. He really is. He’s a great guy, too.” A day prior, he had lauded the role of the CDF in the ceasefire agreement following the May conflict. The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets. Months later in September, PM Shehbaz — during a United Nations General Assembly speech — said that the Pakistan Air Force turned “seven of the Indian jets” into scrap and dust. Later, Trump also described how he confronted both nations during a conflict that saw “seven aircraft shot down”. In November, he stated that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.",

      "summary_orig": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that he was reiterating his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. The proposition by the premier was made during a federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, where he referred to news reports of the opposition PTI and its “companions talking about dialogue“. He recalled that he had previously invited the opposition for talks on multiple occasions, including in the assembly. “If they are ready for this, the government of Pakistan is definitely ready,” he said, adding that harmony among all political parties was necessary for the progress and prosperity of the country. However, he continued, there should be no “blackmailing” under the guise of talks and dialogue could only move forward “in light of legitimate matters”. The need for dialogue between the government and the opposition has been stressed as Pakistan continues to face political and economic crises. On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. They were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before. The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence. This call for reconciliation among political actors was made at the Khawaja Rafique Shaheed reference in Lahore. Speaking on the occasion, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar urged a new national political charter rooted in tolerance and dialogue while PM’s Adviser Rana Sanaullah stressed that political stability could only be achieved through restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year. After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December 2024 to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations , the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024 , and the release of PTI prisoners. The Shehbaz government once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February this year as National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped. However, a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI. Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country. In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA. The PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue. More recently, Sadiq reiterated his offer on November 13 to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties. The offer was made by the speaker at a time when the opposition members belonging to the PTI were protesting in the assembly during the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill. He had again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on November 28 that dialogue was the way to resolve issues. On December 6, after a fiery speech in the Senate by a PTI-backed lawmaker, deploring the absence of rule of law and an unannounced ban on meetings with incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, the ruling party once again held out an olive branch to the PTI, reassuring it that all issues could be resolved through dialogue. Speaking in the upper house of parliament, Sana­ullah said the PTI had always rejected the path of negotiations, even though all issues could be reso­lved through dialogue rather than deadlock. He said the government was ready to hold a dialogue with the opposition to take the country forward, but the PTI leadership remained unwilling. Without naming the military establishment, the adviser to the premier said, “Those who they want [to have] dialogue [with] are not ready for talks with them.”",

      "summary_en": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday that he was reiterating his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”. The proposition by the premier was made during a federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, where he referred to news reports of the opposition PTI and its “companions talking about dialogue“. He recalled that he had previously invited the opposition for talks on multiple occasions, including in the assembly. “If they are ready for this, the government of Pakistan is definitely ready,” he said, adding that harmony among all political parties was necessary for the progress and prosperity of the country. However, he continued, there should be no “blackmailing” under the guise of talks and dialogue could only move forward “in light of legitimate matters”. The need for dialogue between the government and the opposition has been stressed as Pakistan continues to face political and economic crises. On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy. They were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before. The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence. This call for reconciliation among political actors was made at the Khawaja Rafique Shaheed reference in Lahore. Speaking on the occasion, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar urged a new national political charter rooted in tolerance and dialogue while PM’s Adviser Rana Sanaullah stressed that political stability could only be achieved through restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue. The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year. After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December 2024 to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations , the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024 , and the release of PTI prisoners. The Shehbaz government once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February this year as National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped. However, a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI. Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country. In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA. The PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue. More recently, Sadiq reiterated his offer on November 13 to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties. The offer was made by the speaker at a time when the opposition members belonging to the PTI were protesting in the assembly during the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill. He had again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on November 28 that dialogue was the way to resolve issues. On December 6, after a fiery speech in the Senate by a PTI-backed lawmaker, deploring the absence of rule of law and an unannounced ban on meetings with incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, the ruling party once again held out an olive branch to the PTI, reassuring it that all issues could be resolved through dialogue. Speaking in the upper house of parliament, Sana­ullah said the PTI had always rejected the path of negotiations, even though all issues could be reso­lved through dialogue rather than deadlock. He said the government was ready to hold a dialogue with the opposition to take the country forward, but the PTI leadership remained unwilling. Without naming the military establishment, the adviser to the premier said, “Those who they want [to have] dialogue [with] are not ready for talks with them.”",

      "summary_orig": "LAKKI MARWAT: Five cops were martyred after a police mobile came under attack in Gurguri area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak on Tuesday. The district police spokesman, Shaukat Khan, confirmed the incident and the casualties, saying that all of the martyred personnel were constables. The martyred policemen were identified as constables Shahid Iqbal, Samiullah, Arif, Safdar and Muhammad Abrar, who was also the mobile’s driver, Khan added. He said that a large police contingent, including the district police officer, was present at the scene and a search operation was underway. While the exact nature of the incident is not yet clear, an image shared by the police spokesman showed what appeared to be the charred remains of the vehicle which came under attack. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the incident, expressing deep sorrow and grief over the lives lost and offering prayers for martyred officers, according to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office. He extended his condolences to the bereaved families and assured them of the government’s full support during this difficult time. The prime minister paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police force, stating that police personnel had always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism and rendered “unparalleled” services to ensure peace and security in the country. “The entire nation salutes the martyrs who laid down their lives in the line of duty,” the prime minister said, adding that their sacrifices would never be forgotten. Reiterating the government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan remained fully committed to the complete elimination of terrorism in all its forms. This is the latest in a series of attacks targeting police personnel in the province. Last week, a police official and his brother were martyred in a gun attack in KP’s Lakki Marwat. Earlier this month, a cop was martyred while five others were injured in a suicide blast targeting a police mobile in Lakki Marwat. In November, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in Hangu.",

      "summary_orig": "• Dhaka suspends consular, visa services in New Delhi; Indian centre in Chattogram reciprocates • Inqilab Moncho threatens to topple interim govt, demands resignations • 17 held as govt promises speedy trial • Journalists protest amid death threats, attacks on media After student leader Osman Hadi’s assassination , crises on both the external and internal fronts have deepened in Bangladesh, which has halted all consular and visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi, while the nation grapples with unrest stemming from arrests, journalists’ protests, and threats of a government overthrow. “Due to unavoidable circumstances, all consular and visa services from the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi are temporarily suspended until further notice,” a notice posted by the Bangladesh mission said. “Any inconvenience caused is sincerely regretted.” The move came two days after a demonstration by 20 to 25 people outside the diplomatic mission in New Delhi. Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain told reporters on Sunday that Bangladesh High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah received death threats from the protesters. However, Indian Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Sunday there was no attempt to breach the mission’s security and that police dispersed the small group within minutes. The protesters were demonstrating against the killing of a garment worker, Dipu Chandra Das, in Bangladesh and demanding protection for minorities, he said. Tensions have been reciprocal. On Sunday, the Indian Visa Application Centre in the Bangladeshi city of Chattogram suspended its operations, citing security concerns at India’s mission there. High commissioners for both countries have been summoned by their respective host governments. The developments indicated increasing friction between the two nations, as The Daily Star noted that these developments point to diplomatic tensions escalating towards a crisis and advised that both Delhi and Dhaka should work towards reducing the tensions. Threats to interim govt The turmoil stems from the killing of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in a pro-democracy uprising last year that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has since taken refuge in India. Masked gunmen shot Hadi earlier this month, and he died from his injuries on Thursday. His death ignited furious protests , with mobs setting fire to several buildings, including the offices of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo , two of the country’s leading newspapers, which some protesters perceive as favourable to India. In response, the student group Inqilab Moncho on Monday threatened a movement to remove the interim government, holding it responsible for Hadi’s death. The group demanded the immediate resignations of the home adviser, his special assistant and the law adviser for failing to provide security. “Justice must be ensured before the election; no election will take place before that,” Abdullah Al Jaber, member secretary of the group, said at a press conference. He warned that activists would not leave the streets until Hadi’s killers are brought to justice and would topple the government if their demands were not met. The group also called for an international investigation by agencies like the FBI or Scotland Yard. Law Adviser Asif Nazrul responded by announcing the murder case would be tried at a speedy trial tribunal, with a verdict expected within 90 days of the police report being filed. Journalists’ protest Meanwhile, journalists in Dhaka held a human chain protest on Monday to condemn the arson attacks and threats against the press. Media leaders said threats have escalated from debates over free expression to concerns for their very survival. “On social media, we have seen messages saying journalists of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo should be hunted down and killed in their homes,” said Mahfuz Anam, editor and publisher of The Daily Star . “This is no longer about opinions. These are murder threats.” He made the remarks while delivering a solidarity speech at a joint protest titled “Bangladesh Under the Attack of Mob Viole­nce”, organised by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) at a hotel in Dhaka. Nahid Islam, convener of the National Citizen Party (NCP), today said they believe the attacks involved a section of the government and had political backing. “The whole incident was planned,” he said. AK Azad said about 28 journalists were trapped inside The Daily Star ’s office during the firebombing and claimed that pleas for help were ignored until after the attack was over. He said security forces were present but did not intervene. He also announced plans to hold a conference in Dhaka for journalists from across the country in mid-January, vowing to continue protests until those responsible for recent arson attacks on The Daily Star and Prothom Alo are brought to justice. Nurul Kabir, editor of the New Age daily, said the attackers intended to kill. “They set newspaper offices on fire and blocked the fire service from entering,” he said. “This clearly shows they wanted to burn people alive simply because they disagreed with them.” Arrests and violence Separately, Police said they have arrested 17 people in connection with the newspaper attacks. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner SN Nazrul Islam said officers exercised restraint to avoid casualties among the 4,000 to 5,000 protesters. “The fact that no human life was lost in such a major incident is what we see as our achievement,” he said, adding that social media misinformation had inflamed the situation. Political figures from across the spectrum have voiced concern over the escalating violence as the country prepares for general elections in February. “Today, democracy itself has been attacked,” said Mirza Fakh­rul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of the opposition Bangla­desh Nationalist Party. “This is the time for all democratic people to unite.” The broader unrest was highlighted by a separate incident where Border Guard Bangladesh intensified surveillance along the Benapole border after an NCP leader, Md Motaleb Shikdar, was shot and injured in Khulna.

During a five-hour-long hearing, the prosecution recorded statements of eight witnesses in the case registered against 11 suspects, including Ms Khan. Aleema Khan appeared before the court along with her counsel while prosecutor Faisal Malik represented the state. The acquittal application was formally taken up by the court, which sought responses from the relevant parties. The defence side, however, requested that further proceedings be scheduled after the winter vacation. Accepting the request, the court adjourned the hearing till Jan 2. Earlier, Ms Khan apprised the court during the proceedings that 11 books had been submitted with a request that they be delivered to the PTI founder. The court informed her that the books had been received by the PTI founder and that a confirmation report had been received from the jail authorities. Aleema Khan thanked the court for ensuring the delivery. The case pertains to the Nov 26 protest, in which a nu­­­mber of PTI leaders face trial before the anti-terrorism co­­urt. The witnesses inc­luded Noor Ahmed of PID, Nader Khan of Pemra, Muh­a­mmad Sabtain of NCCIA, Inspector Yaqub Shah of Ra­­walpindi police, and jail ad­­­ditional superintendent Ali Amir Shah, among others. On the other hand, Mr Khan could not sign the papers of attorney, enabling his lawyers to file an appeal against his recent conviction in Toshakhana case. According to Advocate Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry, the jail authorities kept him waiting for three hours and then refused his meeting with Mr Khan for taking his signature on the papers of attorney.

Aleema Khan thanked the court for ensuring the delivery. The case pertains to the Nov 26 protest, in which a nu­­­mber of PTI leaders face trial before the anti-terrorism co­­urt. The witnesses inc­luded Noor Ahmed of PID, Nader Khan of Pemra, Muh­a­mmad Sabtain of NCCIA, Inspector Yaqub Shah of Ra­­walpindi police, and jail ad­­­ditional superintendent Ali Amir Shah, among others. On the other hand, Mr Khan could not sign the papers of attorney, enabling his lawyers to file an appeal against his recent conviction in Toshakhana case. According to Advocate Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry, the jail authorities kept him waiting for three hours and then refused his meeting with Mr Khan for taking his signature on the papers of attorney.

      "title": "Aleema files plea for her acquittal in Nov 26 case",
      "summary": "RAWALPINDI: Aleema Khan, sister of former prime minister Imran Khan, on Monday moved an application seeking her acquittal under Section 265-K of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in the November 26 protest case, as the Special Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC), Rawalpindi, issued notices to the parties to address the plea. During a five-hour-long hearing, the prosecution recorded statements of eight witnesses in the case registered against 11 suspects, including Ms Khan. Aleema Khan appeared before the court along with her counsel while prosecutor Faisal Malik represented the state. The acquittal application was formally taken up by the court, which sought responses from the relevant parties. The defence side, however, requested that further proceedings be scheduled after the winter vacation. Accepting the request, the court adjourned the hearing till Jan 2. Earlier, Ms Khan apprised the court during the proceedings that 11 books had been submitted with a request that they be delivered to the PTI founder. The court informed her that the books had been received by the PTI founder and that a confirmation report had been received from the jail authorities. Aleema Khan thanked the court for ensuring the delivery. The case pertains to the Nov 26 protest, in which a nu­­­mber of PTI leaders face trial before the anti-terrorism co­­urt.

      "title_orig": "Meetings with Imran Khan will remain suspended till February 8: minister",
      "summary_orig": "Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said on Monday that meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan would remain suspended till February 8. “Meetings with Khan will remain suspended till Feb 8,” the minister said while speaking on Geo News’ show ‘Capital Talk’, in reply to a question by the show’s host about whether meetings with Imran would remain suspended. As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. Chaudhry maintained that the prison is “not the headquarters of a political party”, and criticised the PTI for “spreading venom against institutions and leaders of the institutions“. The PML-N leader said that regular meetings were held between PTI leaders and its founder in Adiala jail in the past, and the government had no issues. However, he stated that the meetings then turned into political press conferences outside the prison, and the opposition party started to create narratives, which were then “run by Indian media”. Responding to the minister, PTI‘s Barrister Ali Zafar said the the Constitution of the country considers solitary confinement akin to torture, adding the Chaudhry’s statement is against human rights, international and local laws. “PTI asks party leaders and parliamentarians to gather outside Adiala prison to express solidarity with Khan, but the government uses water canons and violence against peaceful protesters.” Last week, water cannons were used to disperse Imran‘s sisters, party leaders and PTI workers after they staged sit-ins outside the Adiala prison against the officials’ refusal to let them meet with the ex-premiere. Zafar maintained that the PTI “will not back down till we meet with Khan”. He elaborated that if the government considered the possibility of dialogue to break the current political impasse and was sincere about moving forward, then meetings with Imran would be part of the process. Prison meetings with Imran used to plan PTI protests: Sanaullah Meanwhile, Prime Minister‘s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said prison meetings with Imran had been suspended because they were being used to plan and coordinate a large protest in Islamabad to mark the anniversary of the PTI’s November 26 , 2024, march to the capital. On November 26, 2024, Islamabad witnessed pitched battles between security forces and PTI supporters as the latter inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk for the party’s ‘final call’ powershow, with intense teargas shelling used to disperse the protesters. A late-night crackdown by the government ended in a hasty retreat of the PTI’s top leadership and supporters, following which the party abruptly suspended its protest movement. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘ Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath ’, Sanaullah said that the party founder and his sister were discussing preparations for a large protest on November 26 this year before the meetings were suspended. “Before the meetings were stopped four or five weeks ago, they discussed that on November 26, 2025, they would arrange a programme of this sort to mark what happened on that day in 2024,” he stated. “The preparations, messaging and strategic planning were discussed in these meetings, which is why we stopped them,” The PM’s aide added that stopping the meetings had led to rumours about Imran’s condition while incarcerated, including reports of poor health, and clarified that the PTI founder had “every facility available to him.” Sanaullah said that statements by Imran’s sister Aleema Khan were “not her own words” and claimed that the party founder had outlined what she should say during a meeting with another sister, Uzma Khan, several weeks earlier. Responding to a question about the TTAP’s nationwide strike call on February 8 next year, the PM’s aide said there would be no wheel-jam strike in “any street or neighbourhood” anywhere in Pakistan. “The PM has tried negotiations four times. I do not know whether he has presented the option again,” he added. “From the other side, based on the response we are getting, do you think they want to resolve this through talks?” Referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s call for a march to Islamabad, Sanaullah asked, “Why would they be permitted to protest in Islamabad? Does he have a legal basis? He says he is coming to Islamabad armed and that he will either conquer the city or return in a coffin. Is this in the national interest?” “We’ll see what kind of protests they stage and how different they are,” he added. “Sohail Afridi cannot come down from Peshawar and take over the country.” Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes. Earlier this month, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards. Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”",

A special court sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case on Saturday. In protest, the PTI announced it would observe a black day on Sunday against the conviction, as per an announcement posted on Imran’s social media account. Following the protest call, extensive security arrangements had been put in place in Rawalpindi, with over 1,300 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order. Though the day passed peacefully, as not a single activist of PTI appeared on the roads. Police said that a group of political workers. led by PTI leader Seemabia Tahir and nine others. gathered on Adiala Road on Sunday night at about 9:15pm. The protesters, nine of whom were identified in the first information report, gathered on Adiala Road near Nasir Bakery and blocked the road, causing traffic congestion and public disorder, despite the enforcement of Section 144, a legal provision prohibiting public gatherings of more than five people. Constable Rizwan Nazir lodged an FIR with Morgah Police Station, claiming that he was on security duty when some political activists, led by Tahir and carrying PTI flags while riding on motorcycles and in cars, gathered on the road. The protesters, who were chanting slogans, blocked the road and caused traffic congestion. The FIR stated that the protesters were carrying batons, despite the constable informing them that they were violating Section 144. Instead of responding, they began shouting slogans against the government, incited by the former PTI MPA. The police registered the FIR on the charges of blocking the road, violating Section 144 and under Section 16 (dissemination of rumours) of the MPO. Those booked were also charged under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case. Over the past several weeks, the PTI founder has been denied meetings in prison with his family, prompting his sisters and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to stage sit-ins near or outside the prison complex. These have sometimes been dispersed by police using water cannons and baton charges.",

      "summary_orig": "Tariq 180 (left) and Saqib Sanki during a race on the Super Highway in 2024 | Screengrab It’s a situation most drivers on Karachi’s major thoroughfares have experienced, especially on weekend nights and public holidays: a ghost motorcycle closing in at breakneck speed. At first, it is little more than a blur in the rear-view mirror. Then, as it bears down, the driver finally registers the young man lying flat along the length of the motorcycle, his eyes peering forward just above the handlebar. The speedometer is missing. The rider’s arms are tucked tight to the side — either holding the handle or, in some cases, clutching the suspension on the sides and using shoulders to steer the handlebar. His legs lie flat or are scissored tightly at the ankle, his body locked in an aerodynamic pose. Most drivers know what to do when faced with such a motorcycle: hold your line without moving in either direction. Do not brake suddenly. Do not swerve. Almost without fail, the rider veers away at the very last second, zigzagging between vehicles and vanishing in the blink of an eye. But it is rarely a lone escape. A swarm of similar motorcycles arrives next, streaking past from every direction, forcing drivers to grip the steering wheel and mutter silent prayers — for the rider’s safety as much as their own. At these speeds, even a minor error — a sudden lane change, a startled brake, a moment’s hesitation — can prove fatal: not just for the motorcyclist but anyone sharing the road. Daredevil motorbike riders speeding through the busy roads of Karachi without any protective gear have built up a vibrant subculture around themselves that is sustained often as much through social media as word of mouth. Why does this perilous practice continue to attract thrill-seekers and can it be made less dangerous, not just for the riders but also for those they share the roads with? These riders, mostly young and often underage, wear no protective gear beyond goggles to keep the dust from blurring their vision. Their motorcycles are stripped to the bare minimum, every unnecessary part removed in pursuit of speed and control. On Karachi’s roads, they are known by a single name: Shapatars . Motorcyclists known as shapatars hold an aerodynamic pose during races and don't use any protective gear | Mohammad Ali Addarsh/White Star WHAT MAKES A SHAPATAR? The origins and the exact meaning of the term is unclear, though most experienced motorcycle racers in Karachi suggest it’s a portmanteau of sharp and funter [a local version of the term punter] and refers to those who show street smarts and mastery on two wheels at a young age. The term has circulated since the 1990s, sometimes loosely associated with political muscle and petty crime, though racers insist this is no longer representative. “Most of us are simply hardworking people who are passionate about racing,” says Muhammad Tariq, a stocky 24-year-old racer popularly known as Tariq 180. He is also a proficient mechanic and now runs a workshop. He left school early and started work as an apprentice in 2009. Tariq’s forays into racing started with wheelies on his motorcycle. “Around 2013-14, I bought a CB 180cc bike, which resulted in me getting the name 180,” he says. But Tariq has one major advantage over a majority of his peers: he is not only a rider but also an ustaad, an expert mechanic who understands the ins and outs of a motorcycle and knows how to get the best out of it for any particular race. But one young man, arguably the most well-known shapatar of Karachi, rose to the top of this illegal racing circuit based solely on his riding skills. His most famous race, also his last, remains shrouded in mystery and, seemingly, adds to his legend. Uzaib Mustafa, popularly known as Babu 70, with his daugther a few months before his fatal accident | Family archive THE LEGEND OF BABU 70 Like Tariq, Uzaib Mustafa’s love for daredevilry began with doing wheelies on his bicycle while growing up in Gazdarabad (aka Ranchore Lines) in downtown Karachi. Like most young men of his area, which has a large number of motorcycle parts and repair shops, he started hanging out at the workshop of one Rehan Ustaad, according to his brother Murtaza. A slightly-built teen, around 5’6” in height, he was the ideal racer. His proficiency in doing wheelies, initially, on his bicycle and, later, on motorcycles, had already established his credentials. He became known as Babu 70, after his father — a former department-level footballer who drove a 70cc bike. Babu 70 started racing before he had a license, as most shapatars do. His big break came in 2011, at 18, after beating champion racer Bali X. Over five years, he established dominance on Sharae Faisal — the city’s main thoroughfare — and other tracks. By 2016, he was neck-and-neck with Saqib Sanki, Karachi’s reigning shapatar. Their rivalry would culminate in one final, fatal race. Murtaza, Babu’s brother, says that there was a point when Sanki wanted to back out of the race due to some bad blood between Babu and him, over the verdict of an earlier race. But it went ahead after Babu insisted, citing his planned departure to Dubai two days later, where his friends were helping him set up a business. The race was set for 4am in early November 2016. Initially, it was planned as a 12km race on Sharae Faisal, starting from near the airport and ending at the FTC Bridge. But oil on the road meant that the distance was adjusted, with the starting point moved up to the crossing on the Drigh Road Railway Station. Once the race started, Babu quickly took the lead. It stayed that way well beyond the halfway mark. This is what everyone agrees on. What happened after is contested. Babu’s brother Murtaza, who was at the race, says that he was hit by a car, but is unsure if it was a sedan or a hatchback. Ali, a young man who is no longer involved in racing, claims it was Sanki’s boys in the vehicle and that Sanki also kicked Babu’s motorcycle. Tariq 180 dismisses claims of foul play. “Babu’s motorcycle’s engine malfunctioned due to the race and was dripping oil, which fell on the wheel and led to him losing control,” he asserts. Murtaza says that Babu’s accident took place while victory was just a short distance away. “He got dragged for almost a km and sustained multiple injuries,” he tells Eos at his motorcycle parts shop. Babu spent almost four weeks in the hospital before passing away. The family didn’t file any police report over his death, lending credence to Tariq’s assertion that there was no foul play. Eos made several efforts to contact Saqib Sanki but was informed by his apprentices that he didn’t want to speak to a journalist, even though they regularly upload his videos and races on social media. One reason could be his legal troubles: Saqib is currently on bail in a 2022 dacoity case, with the hearings ongoing. Saqib’s legal troubles means he often takes unscheduled breaks from racing. Despite that, he still enjoys a massive following, with his acolytes running multiple accounts dedicated to him on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. But there still remain those who think Babu was better than him. “Babu was clearly a better rider and his victory against Sanki would have established him as the undisputed champion shapatar of Karachi,” says Ibrahim, another former racer who knew Babu well. “If you ask young boys who they want to be like, most will say Babu 70,” he adds. For a few years after his death, Babu’s admirers took out commemorative rallies on his death anniversary. His race videos and exploits continue to dominate digital platforms. Any discussion about the best racers in Karachi or Pakistan invariably sees his name mentioned, with claims and counterclaims on who is the greatest shapatar to ride on the roads of Karachi. Most aspiring shapatars perform their fi rst stunts on a bicycle | Mohammad Asim/White Star THE RACE, THE RIDER AND THE RIDE For a rider to achieve greatness, he needs an equally good ustaad, says Tariq. “Yes, it’s the rider who is putting his life on the line, but it is the ustaad who will alter the motorcycle for the race,” he explains. Despite being mostly uneducated, these riders have an experiential, if not instinctive, grasp of select physics concepts, including aerodynamics and air pressure. The shapatar riding posture is aerodynamically optimal and riding in a vehicle’s slipstream reduces air pressure and increases speed. Tariq even has a GPS meter downloaded in his phone, which he uses to assess the performance of his motorcycle before races. But it is the ustaad who is likely to have the magical touch. Their understanding is developed over years of trial and error, taking apart motorcycles and putting them back together, tinkering and tailoring with various components. “That’s how a 70cc bike reaches speeds of 150+ [km/h],” says Tariq. “An ustaad can ensure his rider stays unbeatable, but not the other way round,” he adds, saying both the rider and the ustaad are equally important. This is why when a rider wants to race against someone, he will mention his ustaad in the challenge — which are now posted on social media groups, primarily on Facebook. Once a challenge is accepted, the two parties decide on a munsif, a judge — mostly a veteran racer and, ideally, one with a fast motorcycle to tailgate the racers and record a video for the final verdict. The race wager — ranging from Rs15,000 to even Rs150,000 or more — is deposited with the munsif to be handed over to the winner. Race conditions are negotiated in unique terminology: such as “apni hawa” (not entering another’s slipstream) or “CS Alter” (carburetor and sprockets can be modified). The most dangerous format is “freestyle”, where riders can hit, grab and kick rivals. “This has mostly been discontinued following consensus between ustaads,” says Tariq. Before racing, both parties inspect vehicles to ensure no violations. The munsif can disqualify either party if objections are upheld. There are also “showroom-to-showroom” races, in which the two parties acquire motorcycles from a showroom and take them directly to the designated track for the race. This emerged, according to Tariq, because of the innovation in alterations. “We have such funtergiri [cleverness] nowadays that even ustaads can’t detect alterations,” he says before adding that most such alterations are done by mechanics in Lahore. “Karachi has better riders, but Lahore has better ustaads.” Races are extremely popular and attract large crowds, including supporters of the racers | Mohammad Ali Addarsh/White Star THE COST OF DAREDEVILRY For all the skill, bravado and mythology surrounding shapatars, the risks they take extend far beyond themselves. Karachi’s busy and poorly regulated roads are already a menace for commuters, with the city reporting at least 500 road traffic casualties (RTC) last year. The majority of these casualties tend to be motorcyclists. However, this data doesn’t differentiate for motorcyclists. The Road Traffic Injury Research and Prevention Programme (RTIRPP), initiated by neurosurgeon Dr Rashid Jooma, was the only programme through which data regarding road traffic accidents in Karachi was collected. The programme, which was shut down due to lack of support and funding in 2017, found that there were 9,129 road fatalities from 2007-2014. “Motorbikes as primary vehicles were responsible for 3,871 (44.7 percent) RTC fatalities out of the 8,654, for which this information was available,” it observed in its November 2016 report. A conversation with any motorcycle racer will see them list off a litany of names of friends killed while racing or practising for it. Tariq shows off the scar on his head which, he says, required two dozen stitches. He has another one on his back. “Around five, six boys of Mehmoodabad [in Karachi] have died in the last few years, including Ustaad Sohail S-1,” he says. Traffic police officials say enforcement remains difficult, as races are organised spontaneously and often take place in the early hours of the morning, when roads appear deceptively empty. “These motorcyclists often ride without number plates or safety gear and are difficult to intercept due to their riding skills,” says Pir Muhammad Shah, the deputy inspector general of Traffic in Karachi. Shah tells Eos that they have recently introduced aerial surveillance and hope to crackdown on such elements. Most motorcycle racers shrug off concerns over the latest e-challans or crackdown by traffic authorities. They are more concerned with law enforcement, particularly at the time of the start of the race. “When there is a race, even on the highway, riders congregate at the starting point and momentarily block the road, so the racers can have a clear, vehicle-free track,” explains Tariq. “Cops showing up during that time can land the people who are blocking the road in trouble,” he adds. Nasrullah Khan, a seasoned police officer who served as the station house officer in various localities that were racing hotspots, says that such races are not only illegal, but those who alter motorcycles are also committing a crime. “You pay the government tax of a 70cc bike while your vehicle functions as 150cc,” he points out. Khan adds the popular “Devil’s Point” on Sea View was a hotbed of all kinds of races, until the erection of barriers in the middle of the road. “I’d have entry and exit points blocked and conduct raids to apprehend racers, whether in cars or on bikes,” he says, admitting they could only charge them with negligent driving and seize their vehicles over it. Khan contends that a lot of motorcycles used in such races are stolen or fitted with stolen parts. Tariq, the racer and mechanic, says that, to avoid such an eventuality, he asks customers to bring their vehicles’ documents with them. Both the cop and the racer agree that bike racing will continue, regardless of restrictions or crackdowns. The only solution, suggests Nasrullah, is to make racing less dangerous — not just for the shapatars but for others on the road. “One possible solution could be to provide them a dedicated area, so they can race there,” says Khan, citing the example of jeep rallies and other races that take place. Karachi’s mayor Murtaza Wahab tells Eos that the city administration is open to the idea. “If we could find such a space, it would be on the outskirts of the city and most people don’t want to go that far,” he tells Eos. Tariq would tell the mayor that most major races are already taking place on stretches of the highway, sometimes as far out as Nooriabad on the outskirts of the city. But until they find a space of their own, shapatars will continue to appear in rear-view mirrors across Karachi — a blur closing in at impossible speed, forcing drivers to hold their line and hope. On these roads, the distance between legend and tragedy is measured not in kilometres, but in split seconds. And for every Babu 70 who becomes a myth, there are dozens more willing to risk everything for that same fleeting immortality. The writer is a staff member.

      "summary_en": "Tariq 180 (left) and Saqib Sanki during a race on the Super Highway in 2024 | Screengrab It’s a situation most drivers on Karachi’s major thoroughfares have experienced, especially on weekend nights and public holidays: a ghost motorcycle closing in at breakneck speed. At first, it is little more than a blur in the rear-view mirror. Then, as it bears down, the driver finally registers the young man lying flat along the length of the motorcycle, his eyes peering forward just above the handlebar. The speedometer is missing. The rider’s arms are tucked tight to the side — either holding the handle or, in some cases, clutching the suspension on the sides and using shoulders to steer the handlebar. His legs lie flat or are scissored tightly at the ankle, his body locked in an aerodynamic pose. Most drivers know what to do when faced with such a motorcycle: hold your line without moving in either direction. Do not brake suddenly. Do not swerve. Almost without fail, the rider veers away at the very last second, zigzagging between vehicles and vanishing in the blink of an eye. But it is rarely a lone escape. A swarm of similar motorcycles arrives next, streaking past from every direction, forcing drivers to grip the steering wheel and mutter silent prayers — for the rider’s safety as much as their own. At these speeds, even a minor error — a sudden lane change, a startled brake, a moment’s hesitation — can prove fatal: not just for the motorcyclist but anyone sharing the road. Daredevil motorbike riders speeding through the busy roads of Karachi without any protective gear have built up a vibrant subculture around themselves that is sustained often as much through social media as word of mouth. Why does this perilous practice continue to attract thrill-seekers and can it be made less dangerous, not just for the riders but also for those they share the roads with? These riders, mostly young and often underage, wear no protective gear beyond goggles to keep the dust from blurring their vision. Their motorcycles are stripped to the bare minimum, every unnecessary part removed in pursuit of speed and control. On Karachi’s roads, they are known by a single name: Shapatars . Motorcyclists known as shapatars hold an aerodynamic pose during races and don't use any protective gear | Mohammad Ali Addarsh/White Star WHAT MAKES A SHAPATAR? The origins and the exact meaning of the term is unclear, though most experienced motorcycle racers in Karachi suggest it’s a portmanteau of sharp and funter [a local version of the term punter] and refers to those who show street smarts and mastery on two wheels at a young age. The term has circulated since the 1990s, sometimes loosely associated with political muscle and petty crime, though racers insist this is no longer representative. “Most of us are simply hardworking people who are passionate about racing,” says Muhammad Tariq, a stocky 24-year-old racer popularly known as Tariq 180. He is also a proficient mechanic and now runs a workshop. He left school early and started work as an apprentice in 2009. Tariq’s forays into racing started with wheelies on his motorcycle. “Around 2013-14, I bought a CB 180cc bike, which resulted in me getting the name 180,” he says. But Tariq has one major advantage over a majority of his peers: he is not only a rider but also an ustaad, an expert mechanic who understands the ins and outs of a motorcycle and knows how to get the best out of it for any particular race. But one young man, arguably the most well-known shapatar of Karachi, rose to the top of this illegal racing circuit based solely on his riding skills. His most famous race, also his last, remains shrouded in mystery and, seemingly, adds to his legend. Uzaib Mustafa, popularly known as Babu 70, with his daugther a few months before his fatal accident | Family archive THE LEGEND OF BABU 70 Like Tariq, Uzaib Mustafa’s love for daredevilry began with doing wheelies on his bicycle while growing up in Gazdarabad (aka Ranchore Lines) in downtown Karachi. Like most young men of his area, which has a large number of motorcycle parts and repair shops, he started hanging out at the workshop of one Rehan Ustaad, according to his brother Murtaza. A slightly-built teen, around 5’6” in height, he was the ideal racer. His proficiency in doing wheelies, initially, on his bicycle and, later, on motorcycles, had already established his credentials. He became known as Babu 70, after his father — a former department-level footballer who drove a 70cc bike. Babu 70 started racing before he had a license, as most shapatars do. His big break came in 2011, at 18, after beating champion racer Bali X. Over five years, he established dominance on Sharae Faisal — the city’s main thoroughfare — and other tracks. By 2016, he was neck-and-neck with Saqib Sanki, Karachi’s reigning shapatar. Their rivalry would culminate in one final, fatal race. Murtaza, Babu’s brother, says that there was a point when Sanki wanted to back out of the race due to some bad blood between Babu and him, over the verdict of an earlier race. But it went ahead after Babu insisted, citing his planned departure to Dubai two days later, where his friends were helping him set up a business. The race was set for 4am in early November 2016. Initially, it was planned as a 12km race on Sharae Faisal, starting from near the airport and ending at the FTC Bridge. But oil on the road meant that the distance was adjusted, with the starting point moved up to the crossing on the Drigh Road Railway Station. Once the race started, Babu quickly took the lead. It stayed that way well beyond the halfway mark. This is what everyone agrees on. What happened after is contested. Babu’s brother Murtaza, who was at the race, says that he was hit by a car, but is unsure if it was a sedan or a hatchback. Ali, a young man who is no longer involved in racing, claims it was Sanki’s boys in the vehicle and that Sanki also kicked Babu’s motorcycle. Tariq 180 dismisses claims of foul play. “Babu’s motorcycle’s engine malfunctioned due to the race and was dripping oil, which fell on the wheel and led to him losing control,” he asserts. Murtaza says that Babu’s accident took place while victory was just a short distance away. “He got dragged for almost a km and sustained multiple injuries,” he tells Eos at his motorcycle parts shop. Babu spent almost four weeks in the hospital before passing away. The family didn’t file any police report over his death, lending credence to Tariq’s assertion that there was no foul play. Eos made several efforts to contact Saqib Sanki but was informed by his apprentices that he didn’t want to speak to a journalist, even though they regularly upload his videos and races on social media. One reason could be his legal troubles: Saqib is currently on bail in a 2022 dacoity case, with the hearings ongoing. Saqib’s legal troubles means he often takes unscheduled breaks from racing. Despite that, he still enjoys a massive following, with his acolytes running multiple accounts dedicated to him on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. But there still remain those who think Babu was better than him. “Babu was clearly a better rider and his victory against Sanki would have established him as the undisputed champion shapatar of Karachi,” says Ibrahim, another former racer who knew Babu well. “If you ask young boys who they want to be like, most will say Babu 70,” he adds. For a few years after his death, Babu’s admirers took out commemorative rallies on his death anniversary. His race videos and exploits continue to dominate digital platforms. Any discussion about the best racers in Karachi or Pakistan invariably sees his name mentioned, with claims and counterclaims on who is the greatest shapatar to ride on the roads of Karachi. Most aspiring shapatars perform their fi rst stunts on a bicycle | Mohammad Asim/White Star THE RACE, THE RIDER AND THE RIDE For a rider to achieve greatness, he needs an equally good ustaad, says Tariq. “Yes, it’s the rider who is putting his life on the line, but it is the ustaad who will alter the motorcycle for the race,” he explains. Despite being mostly uneducated, these riders have an experiential, if not instinctive, grasp of select physics concepts, including aerodynamics and air pressure. The shapatar riding posture is aerodynamically optimal and riding in a vehicle’s slipstream reduces air pressure and increases speed. Tariq even has a GPS meter downloaded in his phone, which he uses to assess the performance of his motorcycle before races. But it is the ustaad who is likely to have the magical touch. Their understanding is developed over years of trial and error, taking apart motorcycles and putting them back together, tinkering and tailoring with various components. “That’s how a 70cc bike reaches speeds of 150+ [km/h],” says Tariq. “An ustaad can ensure his rider stays unbeatable, but not the other way round,” he adds, saying both the rider and the ustaad are equally important. This is why when a rider wants to race against someone, he will mention his ustaad in the challenge — which are now posted on social media groups, primarily on Facebook. Once a challenge is accepted, the two parties decide on a munsif, a judge — mostly a veteran racer and, ideally, one with a fast motorcycle to tailgate the racers and record a video for the final verdict. The race wager — ranging from Rs15,000 to even Rs150,000 or more — is deposited with the munsif to be handed over to the winner. Race conditions are negotiated in unique terminology: such as “apni hawa” (not entering another’s slipstream) or “CS Alter” (carburetor and sprockets can be modified). The most dangerous format is “freestyle”, where riders can hit, grab and kick rivals. “This has mostly been discontinued following consensus between ustaads,” says Tariq. Before racing, both parties inspect vehicles to ensure no violations. The munsif can disqualify either party if objections are upheld. There are also “showroom-to-showroom” races, in which the two parties acquire motorcycles from a showroom and take them directly to the designated track for the race. This emerged, according to Tariq, because of the innovation in alterations. “We have such funtergiri [cleverness] nowadays that even ustaads can’t detect alterations,” he says before adding that most such alterations are done by mechanics in Lahore. “Karachi has better riders, but Lahore has better ustaads.” Races are extremely popular and attract large crowds, including supporters of the racers | Mohammad Ali Addarsh/White Star THE COST OF DAREDEVILRY For all the skill, bravado and mythology surrounding shapatars, the risks they take extend far beyond themselves. Karachi’s busy and poorly regulated roads are already a menace for commuters, with the city reporting at least 500 road traffic casualties (RTC) last year. The majority of these casualties tend to be motorcyclists. However, this data doesn’t differentiate for motorcyclists. The Road Traffic Injury Research and Prevention Programme (RTIRPP), initiated by neurosurgeon Dr Rashid Jooma, was the only programme through which data regarding road traffic accidents in Karachi was collected. The programme, which was shut down due to lack of support and funding in 2017, found that there were 9,129 road fatalities from 2007-2014. “Motorbikes as primary vehicles were responsible for 3,871 (44.7 percent) RTC fatalities out of the 8,654, for which this information was available,” it observed in its November 2016 report. A conversation with any motorcycle racer will see them list off a litany of names of friends killed while racing or practising for it. Tariq shows off the scar on his head which, he says, required two dozen stitches. He has another one on his back. “Around five, six boys of Mehmoodabad [in Karachi] have died in the last few years, including Ustaad Sohail S-1,” he says. Traffic police officials say enforcement remains difficult, as races are organised spontaneously and often take place in the early hours of the morning, when roads appear deceptively empty. “These motorcyclists often ride without number plates or safety gear and are difficult to intercept due to their riding skills,” says Pir Muhammad Shah, the deputy inspector general of Traffic in Karachi. Shah tells Eos that they have recently introduced aerial surveillance and hope to crackdown on such elements.
