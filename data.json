The Senate vote on a short-term Republican funding bill failed for the 10th time with just 51 votes. A second vote on Pentagon funding in the afternoon similarly failed in a floor vote, meaning the process to begin fully funding military operations also becomes a non-starter.

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that terrorists would pay a “heavy price,” regardless of “wherever the source of terrorism lies”, adding that the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past. “There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” said the defence minister in a post on X. On the night of October 11, Afghanistan launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistani border posts, triggering a series of skirmishes that carried on until Wednesday, leaving 23 troops martyred and over 200 Taliban fighters dead. The Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and the capital Kabul. A temporary ceasefire was then agreed at Afghanistan’s request for 48 hours. Asif added that Afghanistan was “sitting in India’s lap and plotting conspiracies against Pakistan” and that Islamabad “can no longer afford to have relations with Kabul like in the past”. “All Afghans on Pakistani soil will have to go back to their homeland,” he wrote. “Now they have their own government [or] caliphate in Kabul. It has been five years since the Islamic revolution … they must live with Pakistan as neighbours.” In the post, the defence minister elaborated on the visits by Pakistani delegations to Kabul and provided figures for acts of terrorism by groups operating out of Afghanistan and the total number of casualties. Since the Taliban took power in 2021, Pakistani foreign ministers visited Kabul four times; defence ministers and the ISI chiefs visited twice; the special representative and foreign secretaries carried out five visits each; the national security adviser visited once, and the Joint Coordination Committee had eight meetings in the Afghan capital. He added that there were 225 border flag meetings, 836 protest notes and 13 demarches. “From 2021 to date: 3,844 martyred (civilians, military, and law enforcement agencies combined). Terrorist incidents: 10,347,” the defence minister listed. The temporary ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan was extended earlier today, a senior diplomatic source confirmed to Dawn.com . Islamabad’s delegation is still in Pakistan and is scheduled to depart for the Qatari capital Doha tomorrow morning, said security sources. “The temporary ceasefire was extended at the request of the Afghan Taliban government,” the source said. “High-level talks are expected to begin on Saturday.”",

      "title_orig": "Three more ministers quit AJK cabinet, two urge PM to step down",
      "summary_orig": "Three more ministers from the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) cabinet on Friday announced their resignation, with two of them calling upon Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq to step down for what they described as his “failure to safeguard the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees”. Earlier this week, AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed announced that he had resigned from his position, citing “some unavoidable reasons”. However, a senior official at the AJK prime minister’s office told Dawn.com that the resignation had been “received but not yet accepted”. AJK Finance Minister Abdul Majid Khan and Food Minister Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim announced today they would step down at a joint press conference at the Muzaffarabad Press Club, while Sports, Youth and Culture Minister Asim Sharif Butt sent his resignation directly to the prime minister, opting to stay away from media interaction. All three were elected on PTI tickets in the 2021 general elections from LA-45 (Valley-VI), LA-38 (Jammu-V) and LA-42 (Valley-III) — constituencies reserved for Kashmiri refugees who migrated to Pakistan after 1947. However, the trio had later joined the faction of PTI defectors led by PM Haq in 2023. Their resignations came in protest against the agreement recently signed by a seven-member federal government committee and the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC), which, among other matters, addressed the contentious issue of the 12 legislative assembly seats reserved for Kashmiri refugees settled across Pakistan. Calling the JAAC an “unelected, baton-wielding group”, Khan and Ibrahim said the accord had effectively legitimised an “unconstitutional and morally indefensible demand, reached under pressure and without wider consultation”. They alleged that the deal violated the fundamental rights of thousands of Kashmiri refugees and struck at the heart of AJK’s constitutional and political framework. They maintained that the campaign against the refugee seats was a malicious move by a small group of traders and self-styled representatives pursuing narrow interests “under the guise of reforms”. The real target, they asserted, was not the government but the identity, representation and political recognition of the refugee community that had made immense sacrifices for Pakistan and the cause of Kashmir’s accession. Both ministers argued that these seats were not a privilege but a historic and conscious constitutional decision, which was part of AJK’s political setup since 1947. The reserved seats, they said, symbolised the constitutional acknowledgment of the sacrifices and long displacement endured by those who lost everything for the cause of Pakistan. They termed the JAAC’s questioning of these seats’ existence a denial of the pain, identity and political significance of an entire generation exiled for its struggle for accession to Pakistan. They said they had brought this issue to the notice of the president and prime minister of Pakistan in black and white, and added that they would “knock on all doors to frustrate the designs of the elements hellbent upon creating a wedge between local and migrant Kashmiris and thus damaging the Kashmir cause”. Khan also shared his two-page resignation letter, in which he reaffirmed his belief in the ideology of the State of Jammu and Kashmir’s lawful accession and integration with Pakistan, in accordance with the wishes of its entire population, including the 2.5 million Pakistan-based refugees. He said it had become “utterly impossible to continue to serve under the present government, which has failed to effectively defend and protect the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees, nor shown the will to assume responsibility or challenge this serious constitutional violation”. Declaring that he had no moral choice but to resign from the AJK cabinet, effective today, Khan vowed to continue defending the rights of Jammu and Kashmir refugees and to raise his voice for their rightful place in the political and constitutional structures of both AJK and Pakistan. In his resignation letter, Ibrahim echoed similar views, stating that Prime Minister Haq had failed to stop the “unlawful demand” raised by the JAAC and to protect the rights of around three million Pakistan-based refugees from occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Both Khan and Ibrahim charged PM Haq of conspiring against the refugee members of the legislative assembly and called upon him to resign from office. Butt, in his letter, expressed his and his constituents’ loss of confidence in the AJK government in the wake of the agreement, saying he could no longer remain part of it. Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down at the end of September. Since then, rival groups staged protests and strikes, trading blame for the violence which marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory. On October 2, a delegation from the federal government travelled to Muzaffarabad for talks with the JAAC in a bid to put an end to the ongoing unrest in the territory. The agreement was signed after two rounds of talks .",

      "summary_en": "Three more ministers from the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) cabinet on Friday announced their resignation, with two of them calling upon Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq to step down for what they described as his “failure to safeguard the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees”. Earlier this week, AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed announced that he had resigned from his position, citing “some unavoidable reasons”. However, a senior official at the AJK prime minister’s office told Dawn.com that the resignation had been “received but not yet accepted”. AJK Finance Minister Abdul Majid Khan and Food Minister Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim announced today they would step down at a joint press conference at the Muzaffarabad Press Club, while Sports, Youth and Culture Minister Asim Sharif Butt sent his resignation directly to the prime minister, opting to stay away from media interaction. All three were elected on PTI tickets in the 2021 general elections from LA-45 (Valley-VI), LA-38 (Jammu-V) and LA-42 (Valley-III) — constituencies reserved for Kashmiri refugees who migrated to Pakistan after 1947. However, the trio had later joined the faction of PTI defectors led by PM Haq in 2023. Their resignations came in protest against the agreement recently signed by a seven-member federal government committee and the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC), which, among other matters, addressed the contentious issue of the 12 legislative assembly seats reserved for Kashmiri refugees settled across Pakistan. Calling the JAAC an “unelected, baton-wielding group”, Khan and Ibrahim said the accord had effectively legitimised an “unconstitutional and morally indefensible demand, reached under pressure and without wider consultation”. They alleged that the deal violated the fundamental rights of thousands of Kashmiri refugees and struck at the heart of AJK’s constitutional and political framework. They maintained that the campaign against the refugee seats was a malicious move by a small group of traders and self-styled representatives pursuing narrow interests “under the guise of reforms”. The real target, they asserted, was not the government but the identity, representation and political recognition of the refugee community that had made immense sacrifices for Pakistan and the cause of Kashmir’s accession. Both ministers argued that these seats were not a privilege but a historic and conscious constitutional decision, which was part of AJK’s political setup since 1947. The reserved seats, they said, symbolised the constitutional acknowledgment of the sacrifices and long displacement endured by those who lost everything for the cause of Pakistan. They termed the JAAC’s questioning of these seats’ existence a denial of the pain, identity and political significance of an entire generation exiled for its struggle for accession to Pakistan. They said they had brought this issue to the notice of the president and prime minister of Pakistan in black and white, and added that they would “knock on all doors to frustrate the designs of the elements hellbent upon creating a wedge between local and migrant Kashmiris and thus damaging the Kashmir cause”. Khan also shared his two-page resignation letter, in which he reaffirmed his belief in the ideology of the State of Jammu and Kashmir’s lawful accession and integration with Pakistan, in accordance with the wishes of its entire population, including the 2.5 million Pakistan-based refugees. He said it had become “utterly impossible to continue to serve under the present government, which has failed to effectively defend and protect the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees, nor shown the will to assume responsibility or challenge this serious constitutional violation”.

However, the visuals do not show any Afghan missile test. On Sunday, fierce border clashes between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban resulted in the martyrdom of 23 troops and left over 200 Taliban fighters dead, including a number of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan terrorists. Both nations claimed to have destroyed the border posts of the other side. On Tuesday, fighting flared up again between the neighbours in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The next day, the third major skirmish also took place, with the Pakistani security forces saying an attack by the Afghan Taliban was repulsed in Spin Boldak, killing about 15-20 Taliban fighters. Meanwhile, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said in a social media post that the Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. Mujahid claimed that more than 12 civilians were killed and over 100 were injured in the attacks carried out by Pakistani forces with the use of “light and heavy weapons”. On October 16, a pro-Afghan account shared an image on X of a missile being fired. The caption of the post, which gained 83,000 views, said: “Breaking news: Afghanistan’s defence forces have successfully tested a missile capable of hitting a target up to 400 kilometres away. Our own missile … congratulations, from our hands to yours.” The same image with a similar claim was shared by another Afghan user with the caption: “Reliable security sources say that Afghanistan’s defence forces have successfully tested a missile capable of striking targets at a range of 400 kilometres.” The post gained over 93,000 views. Other Afghan users on X also shared the video and claim, as can be seen here , here , here and here ; collectively gaining more than 76,000 views. The image with the same claim was also shared by the Afghan government’s Urdu account on X, but was later deleted. Some Indian accounts shared a video of the missile launch as well, gaining over 11,000 views. Meanwhile, some users, Afghan and Indian, shared a different and longer video with the same claim, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , gaining over 35,500 views collectively. Russian news outlet RT International also shared the video with a similar claim, but later deleted the post. A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter. A keyword search conducted to corroborate whether any such missile tests were conducted in Afghanistan yielded no news or video reports from any mainstream and credible Afghan or international media outlets. The search also did not yield any news reports in general about the current Afghan regime having any such missile capabilities. A reverse image search for the first image and video yielded a news report dated February 24, 2023, from South Korean media outlet YTN titled: ‘North Korea: Yesterday, we launched four strategic cruise missiles into the East Sea … a show of nuclear warfare readiness’. Sharing the same visuals, YTN reported North Korea’s launch of four Arrow-2 strategic cruise missiles into the East Sea on February 23 to test its nuclear warfare readiness. The missile test was also covered in a news report by international wire news agency Reuters on February 24, 2023, titled: ‘North Korea test-fires cruise missiles to demonstrate nuclear counterattack’. Meanwhile, a reverse image search for the second and longer video yielded a May 10, 2025, YouTube video by Pakistani financial news outlet Business Recorder titled: “‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’: Pakistan’s Fatah-1 missile fired at Indian airbase”. The video showed a missile launched by the Pakistan Army at an Indian airbase during the fighting between the two countries in May 2025. The claim that viral visuals show the Afghanistan military conducting a missile test amid the recent hostilities with Pakistan is false . The videos are from older unrelated events and there is no evidence for Afghanistan conducting any such test.",

The claim that viral visuals show the Afghanistan military conducting a missile test amid the recent hostilities with Pakistan is false . The videos are from older unrelated events and there is no evidence for Afghanistan conducting any such test.",

      "summary_orig": "The temporary ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan has been extended, a senior diplomatic source confirmed to Dawn.com on Friday. The Pakistani delegation is still in Pakistan and is scheduled to depart for Doha tomorrow morning, said security sources. On the night of October 11, Afghanistan launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistani border posts, triggering a series of skirmishes that carried on until Wednesday, leaving 23 troops martyred and over 200 Taliban fighters dead. The Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and the capital Kabul. A temporary ceasefire was agreed at Afghanistan’s request for 48 hours, which expired at 6pm today. “The temporary ceasefire was extended at the request of the Afghan Taliban government,” the source said. “High-level talks are expected to begin on Saturday.” Islamabad Kabul working to resolve ‘complex but solvable’ issue Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) stated that Pakistan and Afghanistan are sincerely working towards resolving the “complex but solvable” issue of border clashes amid a temporary ceasefire. During a weekly press briefing at the FO, spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan highlighted that during the 48-hour ceasefire, both sides were making “sincere efforts to find a positive resolution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue”. “Pakistan greatly values dialogue and diplomacy and a mutually beneficial relationship with Afghanistan,” he said. “At the same time, the Government of Pakistan continues to closely monitor the situation and would take all possible measures to safeguard its territory and the lives of its people.” Khan added that Pakistan wants a “peaceful, stable, friendly, inclusive, regionally connected, and prosperous Afghanistan” but highlighted that Kabul needs to fulfil its obligations and promises under the Doha Process. He also reiterated Pakistan’s requests to the Afghan Taliban to prohibit the use of their soil for terrorism. “Pakistan has repeatedly shared its concerns related to the presence of Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan operating from Afghan soil,” Khan said. “Pakistan expects concrete and verifiable actions against these terrorist elements by the Taliban regime.” Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Islamabad was ready to talk if Kabul agreed to fulfil Pakistan’s “justified” conditions following recent hostilities between the two countries. “Yesterday we decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready. The ball is in their court,” he said during a cabinet meeting. Last week, the FO censured Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for remarks during a visit to India and said “deflecting” the responsibility of controlling terrorism could not absolve the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities towards regional peace. “Whatever the problems are in each country should be solved by themselves,” he said, seemingly in response to Pakistan’s repeated requests to prevent terrorists from operating in Afghan territory. He added that there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan. The FO responded by saying terrorism was not an internal problem and highlighted the presence of Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan in Afghan territory. The border clashes come against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty. While Kabul maintains that it does not provide safe havens to terrorists, Afghan officials blamed Pakistan on Friday for bombing a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line and also violating the territory of the capital Kabul. This was after an explosion was reported in Afghanistan last Thursday night. The FO in Islamabad avoided directly acknowledging the incident in Kabul during a weekly briefing last Friday, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil. Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the Inter-Services Public Relations director general also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out any strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan opener Omaima Sohail said on Friday that the team was still looking forward to a chance to make the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s World Cup , ahead of their clash with New Zealand on Saturday. On Wednesday, Pakistan’s hopes of a first victory at the World Cup were hit by rain , with their crucial fixture against England being abandoned after a second downpour in Colombo. Chasing a revised target of 113 to win after earlier rains had reduced the match to 31 overs per side, Pakistan were well on their way at 34-0 in 6.4 overs when rains returned to end any chance of the match being completed — saving England from their first ever loss against the Green Shirts. Speaking at the pre-match press conference at the R. Pramedasa Stadium in Colombo, Omaima said: “We are not relaxed at all. We have a chance to go [to the] semis if we win the matches, like three matches. “So maybe the scenario is open, so maybe we will win the three matches, so we have a chance in the semis.” Omaima showed glimpses of form in the England encounter, hitting a couple of sublime drives through the covers on her way to an unbeaten run-a-ball 18. She, along with fellow opener Muneeba Ali, will be pivotal to providing stability at the top for a batting line-up that has failed to cross the 200-run mark in the tournament so far. “I think the main challenge is to open — play the new ball. If you saw the matches, they are seaming and the pitch is [helping] seam. I’m trying to play the new ball and working on it,” the right-handed batter said of the challenges of opening. Pakistan’s bowling, however, has been the real positive for the Green Shirts so far — having strong sides like England and Australia 78-7 and 76-7 in back-to-back matches. New Zealand head coach Ben Sawyer was also wary about the danger posed by the Pakistani bowling at the presser. “From Pakistan, Yeah. Look, they’ve put some teams in some real tough spots, so I think they had Australia 6 for 60. And then obviously the other night England was 7 for 70. So, their bowling attack is one that we’ve got to be really wary of. Sawyer also spoke about the improvements seen in the Pakistani top-order in the previous outing against England, saying: “Their top order is, they made a little bit — look like light work of maybe chasing down that total the other night. So, they’ve been impressive.” The Kiwis also go into the encounter with a washout of their own against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. The match got called off after Sri Lanka scored a daunting 258-6 batting first. Last week‘s defeat against Australia had left the Green Shirts’ knockout hopes hanging by a thread as Pakistan registered three losses on the trot. Pakistan will be hoping to register their first win and get on the board on Saturday, and then hope the permutations and other teams’ results go in their favour to make it into the semis somehow — a quintessentially Pakistani World Cup experience.",

For the fifth time in a row, our passport holds the dubious distinction of being among the world’s least powerful. Consistency demands commitment and successive governments have shown plenty of that, especially when it comes to standing still. While others jostle up and down the index, Pakistan’s passport remains a model of stability. Holders of the green booklet can travel visa-free to a grand total of 31 destinations — a list that mostly includes islands most have never heard of and countries one might only encounter in a geography quiz. Meanwhile, top spot holders, Singaporeans, can breeze into 193 destinations, and South Koreans into 190. One could blame geopolitics, global suspicion, or our own bureaucratic enthusiasm for paperwork. But the truth is that passport strength reflects far more than airport convenience: it mirrors international trust, governance standards and economic credibility. The weaker the state, the weaker its passport. And ours, sadly, carries the weight of poor diplomacy, inconsistent policies, and a brand image that does not inspire confidence abroad. What can be done? For starters, the government might invest in the kind of soft power that cannot be stamped or embossed — improving governance, security, and regional relationships. Trade, tourism and academic exchange do more for mobility than slogans about ‘image building’. A modern passport design or biometric upgrade will not help if the world continues to view Pakistan as unpredictable rather than a reliable partner with a coherent vision for engagement. Until then, Pakistanis can take comfort in the one privilege our passport still offers: the ability to stay firmly grounded. After all, who really needs jet lag anyway?

      "summary": "PAKISTAN has done it again. The country has held on to its spot near the bottom of the Henley Passport Index, ranking 103rd out of 106, just above Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. For the fifth time in a row, our passport holds the dubious distinction of being among the world’s least powerful. Consistency demands commitment and successive governments have shown plenty of that, especially when it comes to standing still. While others jostle up and down the index, Pakistan’s passport remains a model of stability. Holders of the green booklet can travel visa-free to a grand total of 31 destinations — a list that mostly includes islands most have never heard of and countries one might only encounter in a geography quiz. Meanwhile, top spot holders, Singaporeans, can breeze into 193 destinations, and South Koreans into 190. One could blame geopolitics, global suspicion, or our own bureaucratic enthusiasm for paperwork. But the truth is that passport strength reflects far more than airport convenience: it mirrors international trust, governance standards and economic credibility. The weaker the state, the weaker its passport. And ours, sadly, carries the weight of poor diplomacy, inconsistent policies, and a brand image that does not inspire confidence abroad. What can be done? For starters, the government might invest in the kind of soft power that cannot be stamped or embossed — improving governance, security, and regional relationships. Trade, tourism and academic exchange do more for mobility than slogans about ‘image building’. A modern passport design or biometric upgrade will not help if the world continues to view Pakistan as unpredictable rather than a reliable partner with a coherent vision for engagement. Until then, Pakistanis can take comfort in the one privilege our passport still offers: the ability to stay firmly grounded. After all, who really needs jet lag anyway?

      "summary_orig": "A high-level meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, was informed on Friday that as of October 16, a total of 1,477,592 Afghan nationals have been repatriated and the government will grant no further extension. A drive to expel more than 1.3 million Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders, the last category of refugees legally living in the country without visas, has been underway since Sept 1 this year. According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the meeting’s attendees were told that only those Afghans who possess a valid Pakistani visa would be allowed to stay in Pakistan and the number of exit points on the Afghan side are being increased to make the repatriation process smoother and faster. “Officials informed the meeting that harboring Afghan nationals residing illegally in Pakistan or allowing them to stay in guesthouses is a criminal offense, and efforts are underway to identify such individuals. The public will be involved in the repatriation process, and no one will be allowed to violate government policy by providing shelter to Afghan nationals,” stated the statement from the PMO. PM Shehbaz emphasised that during the repatriation of illegal Afghan refugees, elderly persons, women, children, and minorities must be treated with dignity. The meeting was attended by Chief of the Staff Army Field Marshall Asim Munir, chief ministers of all provinces except KP, premier of Azad Kashmir, federal ministers and other officials. Referring to Afghanistan, the prime minister said that senior Pakistani officials, including the deputy prime minister, had visited Kabul multiple times to hold discussions with the Afghan interim government, urging them to prevent Afghan soil from being used for terrorism against Pakistan. “Pakistan has made serious diplomatic and political efforts to stop the infiltration of militants from Afghanistan,” said the prime minister during the meeting. “The brave people of Pakistan, who have lost loved ones in the war against terrorism, now ask: how long will the government continue to bear the burden of Afghan refugees?” The prime minister maintained that the recent attack on the border areas of Pakistan from Afghanistan and support for terrorist infiltration is a “matter of serious concern”. “The brave armed forces of Pakistan gave a strong and decisive response to this attack. Under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled the Afghan attacks. The entire nation joins me in paying tribute to them,“ added Shehbaz. Concluding the meeting, the premier urged all provinces to extend full cooperation regarding the repatriation of Afghan refugees. The forum also decided that all recommendations presented would be “strictly implemented”. The UN’s refugee agency had reported that more than 3.5 million Afghans had been living in Pakistan, including around 700,000 people who came after the Taliban takeover in 2021. The UN estimated that half of them were undocumented. Though Pakistan had taken care of Afghans during the past decades of war, the government is now compelled to say that the high number of refugees is eventually posing risks to national security and causing pressure on public services.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Friday approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC), seeking permission to meet PTI founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail. On Thursday, Afridi, who was elected as the provincial chief minister on Monday, was denied a meeting with Imran during a visit to the prison. The PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. Afridi said he waited outside the prison for around two hours yesterday bef­ore departing. Speaking to reporters, he said he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran and seeking his input. He claimed he had officially notified the Punjab government and the federal government of his plan to visit Adiala, but received no response, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not reply to his subsequent request, made during a phone call , to facilitate a meeting with Imran. Per Afridi’s writ petition seen by Dawn.com , as a chief minister, he was  constitutionally responsible for governance of the province, and was “under both legal and moral obligation” to consult Imran for “guidance and instructions of urgent and sensitive provincial matters” concerning the governance and formation of the provincial cabinet. The petition was filed against the federal secretary of the Interior Ministry, the secretary of the Punjab Home Department, the inspector general of Punjab prisons, and the superintendent of Central Prison Adiala, Rawalpindi. Filed through counsel Syed Ali Bukhari, the petition stated that Afridi had approached the Interior Ministry and Punjab Home Department on October 15, 2025, seeking a meeting with Imran through an official letter that was “duly received” by both offices. Aside from approaching the IHC, CM Afridi also wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, requesting the arrangement of a meeting with Imran. According to the letter, seen by Dawn.com , it was “necessary in the public interest that a periodical meeting” of the KP CM be permitted under the supervision of the competent authorities at Central Prison Adiala, Rawalpindi. Per the letter, Afridi has been elected CM of KP on the ticket of PTI, a province with a population of 45 million, for the governance and securing/safeguarding the fundamental rights and matters relating to law and order situation, formation of provincial cabinet, critical economic challenges being faced by the province’s people and important policy matters. “There is a pressing need to seek direction from [Imran] regarding [these] matters and others, including relations regarding certain important matters with the federation and other provinces,” said the letter. “The seeking of direction is extremely essential, even presently the province of Punjab has stopped the inter-provincial trade, i.e., of wheat, etc,” the letter said. Separately, in a post on X, Afridi apologised for not attending the meeting regarding agriculture and Afghan refugees with the federal government today, saying that he was unable to do so without consulting Imran first. “Until I meet [Imran Khan] and receive policy guidelines, participating in such a meeting would be an insult to the mandate of the province’s people,” he said. “I hope that the federal government will resolve this issue as soon as possible and issue directions to the relevant authorities so that arrangements can be made for my regular meetings with my leader and the representative of the mandate of the people of KP.” Pre-election controversy Afridi was elected the new KP chief executive on Monday during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and amid the prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur. Declaring Afridi’s election constitutional, Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah had orderered KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Tuesday to administer the oath by 4pm the next day or else the provincial assembly speaker would perform the ceremony the same day under Article 255(2) of the Constitution.",

      "summary_orig": "India has halved its purchases of Russian oil, a White House official said, but Indian sources said no immediate reduction had been seen, as President Donald Trump’s administration presses New Delhi and other nations to buy less Russian crude. Russian oil is a main irritant for Trump in prolonged trade talks with India — half of his 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods are in retaliation for those purchases.

The Indian oil ministry and refiners that buy Russian oil did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Trump said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him on Wednesday that India would stop buying Russian oil. India’s foreign ministry did not respond to Trump’s assertion except to say it was not aware of any telephone conversation between the two leaders that day.

      "summary_orig": "Four terrorists were killed after security forces foiled a suicide attack on a military camp in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali district, state-run PTV reported on Friday. “According to sources, a khawarij attempted to carry out a suicide attack against security forces in Mir Ali. One kharji rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the wall of the security forces’ camp after which three more khawarij tried to enter the camp,” the report said. “As a result of security forces’ timely and courageous action, the three khawarij were killed outside the camp. Security forces did not suffer any losses in the incident. In the last two days alone, 88 terrorists supported by the Afghan Taliban have been killed,” the report said. Khawarij is a term that the state uses to refer to terrorists. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to security forces for foiling the attack and praised their professionalism. “Salute to the brave soldiers who thwarted the evil intentions of Khawarij,” Naqvi said, according to a statement issued by the ministry. “Security forces took timely action and brought the khawarij to an exemplary end,” he said, adding that the nation was “proud of the brave soldiers”. The development comes a day after the ISPR’s said that 34 “India-backed” terrorists had been killed in multiple operations in KP’s North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Bannu districts over the previous three days. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Last week, a lieutenant colonel and a major were among 11 military personnel martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Orakzai, in which 19 terrorists were reported killed. The same week, the ISPR reported that 30 terrorists who were involved in the incident had been killed in a “retribution operation”. A day after the Orakzai operation, another officer was martyred in an operation in Dera Ismail Khan, in which seven terrorists were also killed, according to the ISPR. In July, the government designated the TTP as Fitna al Khawarij , mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks, even before the most recent deadly border clashes between the two countries this past week. However, Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations. Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy. The development also comes tensions have flared between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the past few days after the two countries engaged in border clashes over the weekend. Tensions escalated to the point where both sides agreed to a temporary ceasefire 48-hour ceasefire after Islamabad carried out strikes in Kabul and Kandahar. On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made it clear that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.",

      "summary_orig": "Japan’s former prime minister Tomiichi Murayama, best known for making a statement apologising over World War II, died Friday aged 101, officials said. Murayama issued the 1995 proclamation on the 50th anniversary of Japan’s surrender, expressing “deep remorse” over the country’s atrocities in Asia. The statement became a benchmark for Tokyo’s subsequent apologies over World War II. “Tomiichi Murayama, the father of Japanese politics, passed away today at 11:28am at a hospital in Oita City at the age of 101,” Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Social Democratic Party, seen as the successor to Murayama’s now-defunct Socialist Party, said on X. Hiroyuki Takano, the secretary general of the Social Democratic Party in Oita, Murayama’s hometown, told AFP he had been informed that the former premier died of old age. In the landmark statement in August 1995, Murayama said that “Japan …\nthrough its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations”. “In the hope that no such mistake be made in the future, I regard, in a spirit of humility, these irrefutable facts of history, and express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and state my heartfelt apology,” he added. The phrases “deep remorse” and “heartfelt apology” were used by successive Japanese prime ministers when marking the 60th and 70th World War II anniversaries. Murayama, who was also well-known for his distinctive bushy eyebrows, was elected as the prime minister in a coalition government that also included the Liberal Democratic Party, Japan’s dominant postwar political force. He was in office from 1994 to 1996, a turbulent period that saw a huge 1995 earthquake in western Japan, and a sarin gas attack on Tokyo’s subway that killed more than a dozen people and injured more than 5,800. Murayama was conscripted into the Japanese Imperial Army in 1944 while studying at university. In a 2015 interview with public broadcaster NHK , he called the military a “dreadful thing”, describing how “rebellion or argument was absolutely forbidden”. He also recalled his difficult memories of the run-up to the end of the war, when “food was already scarce, and very few weapons remained”. “We had weapons made of bamboo. I wondered if we could wage war in this condition,” he said at the time.",

      "summary_orig": "Saudi Arabia is discussing a defence deal with the United States which it hopes to seal when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits the White House next month, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. A senior Trump administration official told the Financial Times there were discussions about signing something when the crown prince comes, but the details are in flux. The FT said the deal in discussion was similar to the recent US-Qatar pact that pledged to treat any armed attack on Qatar as a threat to the United States. The US deal with Qatar came after Israel last month attempted to kill leaders of Hamas with an air strike on Doha. The US State Department told the FT that defence co-operation with the kingdom was a “strong bedrock of our regional strategy,” but declined to comment on details of the potential deal. The US State Department, the White House and the Saudi government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the FT report. Last month, Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. It also came just months after a deadly India-Pakistan conflict in May, as well as the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.",

      "summary_orig": "Nearly 300 Afghan refugee families are living under the open sky in Islamabad’s Argentina Park, just miles from Islamabad’s ‘Red Zone’, the heavily secured government and diplomatic district in the federal capital. They sleep on the wet ground under plastic tarps, with no access to sanitation, medical care or legal protection — caught between Pakistan’s intensifying deportation campaign and the Taliban regime they fled. The day after rain showers swept through parts of Islamabad on September 18, teenager Uswa Kohistani sits alone under a tree, writing poetry in Dari about the crisis unfolding around her. Families spread soaked clothing across the grass to dry. Passports and school certificates lie damp inside a mosquito net. “We can neither go to work nor buy food from the markets,” says Kohistani, 19. “The police arrest us and forcibly take us to the border for deportation to Afghanistan.” Caught between Pakistan’s intensifying campaign to expel Afghans and the Taliban regime many of them fled, nearly 300 families live under tarps in Islamabad’s Argentina Park. Facing a legal vacuum, even registered refugees find themselves with no right to stay The Policy Behind the Crisis This makeshift camp is a direct consequence of a stringent government policy that began two years ago. In September 2023, Pakistan announced that it was launching its “Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan”, giving undocumented Afghans till the end of October to leave the country or face forced expulsion. At the time, Pakistan said it was hosting over four million Afghans — having arrived in the country in various waves over the last four decades, including after the return of the Taliban to power in 2021. The policy distinguished between three categories: undocumented Afghans, those holding Afghan Citizen Cards (ACC) — documents issued by Pakistan since 2017 to those who couldn’t obtain refugee status — and those with Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, issued by Pakistan’s National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) with the support of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Approximately 1.4 million PoR cards had been issued to registered refugees, with another over 800,000 Afghans having ACCs. The first phase, beginning in October 2023, focused on expelling undocumented Afghans. Within months, Pakistan had deported over half a million people. At the same time, the government also found ways to reclassify legal refugees as deportable. When PoR cards expired, authorities refused to renew them — effectively stripping documented refugees of their legal status. Following appeals from UN agencies amid mass deportation, Pakistan agreed to extend the PoR cards by a year, in June 2024. They expired again on June 30, 2025, after which started the third phase of deportations. But before that came the second phase, in April 2025, targeting the ACC holders. Returns surged dramatically — in April alone, fear of arrest drove the vast majority of departures. Since September 2023, more than 1.5 million Afghans have returned to Afghanistan, according to data released earlier this month by UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration. In the final week of September 2025, over 45,000 Afghans crossed back through border points at Torkham, Chaman and elsewhere. Among recent returnees, 56 percent held PoR cards — proof that even “legal” refugees are being pressured to leave. Nearly 40 percent were undocumented and five percent held ACC cards, the data adds. But with PoR cards no longer being renewed, over 1.4 million registered refugees became technically undocumented on June 30. The categories have collapsed and nearly everyone faces deportation risk. The camp in Argentina Park represents those who refuse to go back. Life in the Park Noora Khandhari, from Kabul, says landlords evicted refugee families from rented homes as the crackdown intensified. She has lived in the park for close to two months, with only plastic sheeting for shelter. “The whole area flooded last night,” she says, referring to the September 18 rainfall that hit G-6 and surrounding sectors. “We stayed awake while the kids were terrified and crying,” she tells Eos. Around 180 children under age five live in the camp, according to residents’ own count. Lina Mehrabzada, a widow with five children, says families pool money for one shared meal daily. “Every other child has diarrhoea,” says Mehrabzada. “The government hospital near the park refuses treatment without a national ID card,” she adds. Women at the camp say they use washrooms in a nearby mosque or hospital once a day. There is no privacy for sleeping, bathing or changing clothes, they add. “We can’t go back to Afghanistan with the Taliban still in charge,” says Mehrabzada. “We see no future for our children there,” she adds. The Resettlement Bottleneck It is the same for Hassina Rafy, who worked as a journalist and human rights activist in Kabul before fleeing to Pakistan in 2022 after receiving Taliban threats. “The Taliban were against women’s voices like mine — journalists, musicians, activists,” she says. “UNHCR registered us when we arrived and promised support,” Rafy continues. “Now they’re nowhere to be seen.” Rafy says she and others entered Pakistan legally but the government stopped extending visas. Sanam Kabiri, a human rights activist who recently resettled in Australia after more than two years in Pakistan, describes the bureaucratic maze refugees face while waiting for third-country resettlement. “Every two months, our SIM cards were locked,” she tells Eos via WhatsApp. “We kept applying for visas, but most were rejected and we had to reapply,” she continues. She says she was taken ill during her last few months in Pakistan, but the stress stemmed more from her precarious situation than from direct harassment by authorities. Kabiri left in February this year, before the crackdown on documented migrants. At the same time, the refugee resettlement process can take one to three years, according to UNHCR. The annual global resettlement quotas for Afghan refugees, determined by individual countries, have dropped sharply — from over 116,000 refugees resettled last year to a few thousand this year. The United States and Germany both suspended or severely restricted their resettlement programmes in 2025, further narrowing options for those waiting. “I know many people still stranded in Pakistan—journalists, activists,” says Kabiri. “Many had flights to the US cancelled and remain in limbo.” A Legal Vacuum Pakistan is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol — the international treaties that establish legal protections for refugees in 149 countries worldwide. Instead, it operates under the Foreigners Act, which empowers the authorities to arrest, hold and deport foreigners, including refugees and asylum seekers who do not possess valid documentation. This means refugees in Pakistan exist in a legal vacuum. The absence of a legal framework explains why visa extensions stopped, why no registration mechanism exists, and why refugees like those in Argentina Park have no recourse when threatened with deportation. Qaiser Khan Afridi, UNHCR’s spokesperson in Pakistan, says the agency met with protesters at Argentina Park and has assigned a legal team to assist refugees who are detained. “Many Afghans in need of protection cannot regularise their stay, leaving them exposed to serious risks,” Afridi tells Eos. “We are urging the government to establish a registration and documentation mechanism.” He acknowledges processing delays, but disputes claims of abandonment, noting that resettlement quotas are set by receiving countries, not UNHCR. UNHCR stresses that refugees should not be returned to situations of danger — a principle known as non-refoulement. But without Pakistan’s signature on the Refugee Convention, this remains an appeal to humanitarian norms rather than enforceable law. No Return, No Future Back in Argentina Park, Uswa Kohistani closes her poetry notebook as evening approaches. She came to Pakistan seeking safety. Now, even stepping out of the park leaves her vulnerable to harassment; police in Islamabad can detain Afghan refugees at will and force them to cough up a bribe due to their status. “We are not criminals, we are educated families,” she says. “Most importantly, we are human beings,” Kohistani adds. “The Pakistani state should treat us as such.” The writer is Dawn’s correspondent in Shangla, KP.

In the final week of September 2025, over 45,000 Afghans crossed back through border points at Torkham, Chaman and elsewhere. Among recent returnees, 56 percent held PoR cards — proof that even “legal” refugees are being pressured to leave. Nearly 40 percent were undocumented and five percent held ACC cards, the data adds. But with PoR cards no longer being renewed, over 1.4 million registered refugees became technically undocumented on June 30. The categories have collapsed and nearly everyone faces deportation risk. The camp in Argentina Park represents those who refuse to go back. Life in the Park Noora Khandhari, from Kabul, says landlords evicted refugee families from rented homes as the crackdown intensified. She has lived in the park for close to two months, with only plastic sheeting for shelter. “The whole area flooded last night,” she says, referring to the September 18 rainfall that hit G-6 and surrounding sectors. “We stayed awake while the kids were terrified and crying,” she tells Eos. Around 180 children under age five live in the camp, according to residents’ own count. Lina Mehrabzada, a widow with five children, says families pool money for one shared meal daily. “Every other child has diarrhoea,” says Mehrabzada. “The government hospital near the park refuses treatment without a national ID card,” she adds. Women at the camp say they use washrooms in a nearby mosque or hospital once a day. There is no privacy for sleeping, bathing or changing clothes, they add. “We can’t go back to Afghanistan with the Taliban still in charge,” says Mehrabzada. “We see no future for our children there,” she adds. The Resettlement Bottleneck It is the same for Hassina Rafy, who worked as a journalist and human rights activist in Kabul before fleeing to Pakistan in 2022 after receiving Taliban threats. “The Taliban were against women’s voices like mine — journalists, musicians, activists,” she says. “UNHCR registered us when we arrived and promised support,” Rafy continues. “Now they’re nowhere to be seen.” Rafy says she and others entered Pakistan legally but the government stopped extending visas. Sanam Kabiri, a human rights activist who recently resettled in Australia after more than two years in Pakistan, describes the bureaucratic maze refugees face while waiting for third-country resettlement. “Every two months, our SIM cards were locked,” she tells Eos via WhatsApp. “We kept applying for visas, but most were rejected and we had to reapply,” she continues. She says she was taken ill during her last few months in Pakistan, but the stress stemmed more from her precarious situation than from direct harassment by authorities. Kabiri left in February this year, before the crackdown on documented migrants. At the same time, the refugee resettlement process can take one to three years, according to UNHCR. The annual global resettlement quotas for Afghan refugees, determined by individual countries, have dropped sharply — from over 116,000 refugees resettled last year to a few thousand this year. The United States and Germany both suspended or severely restricted their resettlement programmes in 2025, further narrowing options for those waiting. “I know many people still stranded in Pakistan—journalists, activists,” says Kabiri. “Many had flights to the US cancelled and remain in limbo.” A Legal Vacuum Pakistan is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol — the international treaties that establish legal protections for refugees in 149 countries worldwide. Instead, it operates under the Foreigners Act, which empowers the authorities to arrest, hold and deport foreigners, including refugees and asylum seekers who do not possess valid documentation. This means refugees in Pakistan exist in a legal vacuum. The absence of a legal framework explains why visa extensions stopped, why no registration mechanism exists, and why refugees like those in Argentina Park have no recourse when threatened with deportation. Qaiser Khan Afridi, UNHCR’s spokesperson in Pakistan, says the agency met with protesters at Argentina Park and has assigned a legal team to assist refugees who are detained. “Many Afghans in need of protection cannot regularise their stay, leaving them exposed to serious risks,” Afridi tells Eos. “We are urging the government to establish a registration and documentation mechanism.” He acknowledges processing delays, but disputes claims of abandonment, noting that resettlement quotas are set by receiving countries, not UNHCR. UNHCR stresses that refugees should not be returned to situations of danger — a principle known as non-refoulement. But without Pakistan’s signature on the Refugee Convention, this remains an appeal to humanitarian norms rather than enforceable law. No Return, No Future Back in Argentina Park, Uswa Kohistani closes her poetry notebook as evening approaches. She came to Pakistan seeking safety. Now, even stepping out of the park leaves her vulnerable to harassment; police in Islamabad can detain Afghan refugees at will and force them to cough up a bribe due to their status. “We are not criminals, we are educated families,” she says. “Most importantly, we are human beings,” Kohistani adds. “The Pakistani state should treat us as such.” The writer is Dawn’s correspondent in Shangla, KP.

      "summary": "Nearly 300 Afghan refugee families are living under the open sky in Islamabad’s Argentina Park, just miles from Islamabad’s ‘Red Zone’, the heavily secured government and diplomatic district in the federal capital. They sleep on the wet ground under plastic tarps, with no access to sanitation, medical care or legal protection — caught between Pakistan’s intensifying deportation campaign and the Taliban regime they fled. The day after rain showers swept through parts of Islamabad on September 18, teenager Uswa Kohistani sits alone under a tree, writing poetry in Dari about the crisis unfolding around her. Families spread soaked clothing across the grass to dry. Passports and school certificates lie damp inside a mosquito net. “We can neither go to work nor buy food from the markets,” says Kohistani, 19. “The police arrest us and forcibly take us to the border for deportation to Afghanistan.” Caught between Pakistan’s intensifying campaign to expel Afghans and the Taliban regime many of them fled, nearly 300 families live under tarps in Islamabad’s Argentina Park. Facing a legal vacuum, even registered refugees find themselves with no right to stay The Policy Behind the Crisis This makeshift camp is a direct consequence of a stringent government policy that began two years ago. In September 2023, Pakistan announced that it was launching its “Illegal Foreigners’ Repatriation Plan”, giving undocumented Afghans till the end of October to leave the country or face forced expulsion. At the time, Pakistan said it was hosting over four million Afghans — having arrived in the country in various waves over the last four decades, including after the return of the Taliban to power in 2021. The policy distinguished between three categories: undocumented Afghans, those holding Afghan Citizen Cards (ACC) — documents issued by Pakistan since 2017 to those who couldn’t obtain refugee status — and those with Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, issued by Pakistan’s National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) with the support of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Approximately 1.4 million PoR cards had been issued to registered refugees, with another over 800,000 Afghans having ACCs. The first phase, beginning in October 2023, focused on expelling undocumented Afghans. Within months, Pakistan had deported over half a million people. At the same time, the government also found ways to reclassify legal refugees as deportable. When PoR cards expired, authorities refused to renew them — effectively stripping documented refugees of their legal status. Following appeals from UN agencies amid mass deportation, Pakistan agreed to extend the PoR cards by a year, in June 2024. They expired again on June 30, 2025, after which started the third phase of deportations. But before that came the second phase, in April 2025, targeting the ACC holders. Returns surged dramatically — in April alone, fear of arrest drove the vast majority of departures. Since September 2023, more than 1.5 million Afghans have returned to Afghanistan, according to data released earlier this month by UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration. In the final week of September 2025, over 45,000 Afghans crossed back through border points at Torkham, Chaman and elsewhere.
