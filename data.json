      "summary_orig": "Korea plans to test anti-drone equipment at the Saemangeum wetland in the country's southwestern region, officials said Wednesday, as the country seeks to sharpen response capabilities against rising drone threats. Under an agreement jointly signed by the science ministry, the arms procurement agency and the Saemangeum Development and Investment Agency, the government plans to conduct the tests at the reclaimed land in North Jeolla Province. The move enables relevant ministries to safely test anti-drone technologies that involve the use of electromagnetic shielding, without breaching the safety and telecommunications rights of the public, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration said. The Saemangeum wetland was created under a state project aimed at developing a total of a 409-square-kilometer reclaimed area by 2050, equivalent to around two-thirds of the capital city of Seoul.",

      "summary_orig": "The military sent propaganda leaflets to North Korea at least 23 times last year under the former President Yoon Suk Yeol administration, following an order issued the previous year to resume leaflet operations, a lawmaker said Wednesday. The office of ruling party Rep. Choo Mi-ae disclosed the information, citing the result of a defense ministry probe, as Yoon faces charges of sending drones to North Korea last year to provoke a retaliation and use it as a pretext for his declaration of martial law last December. The National Security Council approved a decision to resume leaflet operations in October 2023 before carrying them out between February and November last year ahead of Yoon's failed martial law bid on Dec. 3, according to the probe results submitted to Choo's office. The decision by the security council to resume such operations came shortly after the Constitutional Court ruled a law banning such campaigns unconstitutional in September 2023, citing freedom of expression. Leaflet operations had been suspended since July 2017. Then Defense Minister Shin Won-sik, then Unification",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Navy’s fourth Hangor-class submarine, named Ghazi, was launched at Shuangliu Base in Wuhan, China, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) announced on Wednesday. With the Ghazi’s launch, the ISPR hailed “another significant milestone” by the navy, where all four submarines being built in China are currently undergoing “rigorous sea trials and are in the final stages of being handed over to Pakistan”. “The Government of Pakistan signed an agreement with China for [the] acquisition of eight Hangor-class submarines. Under this contract, four submarines are being built in China and [the] remaining four will be constructed in Pakistan by Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works Ltd (KS&EW), under Transfer of Technology (ToT),” the ISPR said in a statement. The military’s media wing added that the submarines will be fitted with advanced weaponry and sensors capable of engaging targets at standoff ranges. “Hangor-class submarines will be pivotal in maintaining peace and stability in the region,” the statement read, adding that the launch ceremony was attended by senior officials from China and Pakistan, exemplifying deepening bilateral cooperation. The navy launched the first of the new submarines in April 2024, while the second and third were launched on March 15 and August 15 this year, respectively. The submarine class, named after the PNS Hangor, is a diesel-electric attack submarine with air-independent propulsion technology, which allows it to travel over greater distances before resurfacing. During the 1971 Pakistan-India war, the then-PNS Hangor became the first submarine to sink a warship after World War II, sinking an Indian frigate. After being decommissioned, the Hangor is now on display at the Pakistan Maritime Museum in Karachi.",

      "summary_orig": "A meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, chaired by Aga Rafiullah, was informed on Wednesday that 51,000 passengers were offloaded at Pakistani airports this year after failing immigration checks, with a large number of them being offloaded at Lahore and Karachi airports. Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. These actions followed a crackdown on migrant smuggling launched after the 2024 Greece boat tragedy , which claimed several Pakistani lives. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also ordered the formation of a committee to investigate the frequent offloading of passengers from international flights, an issue that has reportedly affected numerous travellers despite them holding valid documents. Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Riffat Mukhtar Raja informed the committee that, “Passengers are offloaded on the basis of document verification, data checks, and online authentication.” Raja told the parliamentary panel that of the 66,000 passengers offloaded this year, 51,000 were stopped by the FIA for insufficient or unverified documentation. He added that many of those offloaded lacked complete information related to their courses, universities or employment details abroad. “In many cases, passengers attempt to travel through agents using incomplete or incorrect information,” DG FIA added. The committee was further informed that 180 FIA officials involved in corruption had been dismissed from service, while all major airports had been connected to NADRA’s online database to strengthen immigration controls. “No passenger was cleared under political influence or VIP pressure,” he stressed. The official further informed the lawmakers that cameras have been installed at immigration counters at airports and that monitoring is being carried out from the control headquarters. “The immigration system is using artificial intelligence to identify suspicious cases in advance.” He added that most offloaded passengers belonged to the visit, Umrah and work visa categories. During the current year, 8.5 million people travelled abroad from Pakistan, while 226 cases were registered for various offences. “Over the past three months, 450 people were arrested while attempting to cross into Iran illegally,” the DG FIA told the committee. He also revealed that several Bangladeshi nationals were found attempting to travel illegally to Europe via Pakistan. “Bangladeshi citizens travelling on Pakistani tourist visas were caught while heading to Europe,” added DG FIA. He further stated that 287 people were deported last year and 170 this year over the use of fake documents. The parliamentary panel was also told that 24,000 accused of begging have been deported from Saudi Arabia this year. $1 trillion investment coming to Saudi Arabia; opportunities to increase for Pakistanis Secretary Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry informed the committee that investment worth $1 trillion is coming to Saudi Arabia under Saudi Vision 2030, creating multiple employment opportunities. “If we can provide better training to skilled manpower, Pakistan can benefit from these opportunities,” he added. The secretary told the committee that 451,000 Pakistanis travelled to Saudi Arabia last year, while more than 500,000 Pakistanis have been sent to Saudi Arabia during the current year. Chairman of the committee Agha Rafiullah said that the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission was “not functioning at all”, adding that officers posted there were temporarily fixing matters instead of resolving them permanently. Committee member Muhammad Ilyas Chaudhry said drivers have been provided to community welfare attachés, questioning how Grade 17–18 officers were being assigned drivers in Europe. He said “more than 50 per cent of community welfare attachés have been provided drivers”, asking whether the ministry was aware of the cost of providing a driver to a Grade 17 officer in Europe. Community welfare attachés are officials of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, posted abroad to assist Pakistani migrant workers, safeguard their interests, and provide legal or financial protection. Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that “no passenger with complete travel documents is being stopped from travelling, and they will not be stopped,” adding that, however, passengers in possession of “incomplete or bogus documents will definitely not be allowed to travel”. “No passenger who brings disrepute to the country can be allowed to travel,” he further stated, according to PTV News. In November, the FIA clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers. The same day, the agency also initiated legal action against those involved in spreading fabricated information on social media regarding the offloading of passengers. FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar had also acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.",

The alleged father-and-son perpetrators opened fire on the celebration at Sydney’s famed Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing 15 in an attack that shook the nation and intensified fears of rising anti-Semitism and violent extremism. Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene, while his 24-year-old son, Naveed Akram, emerged from a coma on Tuesday afternoon after also being shot by police. On Tuesday, it emerged that Sajid was originally from the Indian city of Hyderabad, with police saying his family did not know about his “radical mindset”. In a statement, Philippine National Security Advisor Eduardo Ao said that a mere visit to the country does not substantiate allegations of terrorist training and the duration of their stay would not have permitted any meaningful or structured training. Ao said the government was investigating the two men’s travel from November 1 to 28 and coordinating with Australian authorities to determine the purpose of the visit, dismissing media reports portraying the southern Philippines as a hotspot for violent extremism as “outdated” and “misleading”. Immigration records show the pair landed in Manila and travelled to Davao City in Mindanao, a region long-plagued by militancy, before the attack that Australian police say appeared to have been inspired by the Islamic State. Since the 2017 Marawi siege, a five-month battle in which the Islamic State-inspired Maute group seized the southern city and fought government forces, Philippine troops have significantly degraded ISIS-affiliated groups, Ao said. “The remnants of these groups have been fragmented, deprived of leadership, and operationally degraded,” he added. Earlier today, one of the alleged gunmen was charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, police said. New South Wales Police said on Wednesday that a man had been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of wounding with attempt to murder, as well as a terror offence and other charges. “Police will allege in court the man engaged in conduct that caused death, serious injury and endangered life to advance a religious cause and cause fear in the community,” it said in a statement. “Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by ISIS, a listed terrorist organisation in Australia”. A court filing on Wednesday named Naveed, who remains in a Sydney hospital under heavy police guard, as the man charged. Australian state to pass emergency gun laws Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state where the attack took place, told a news conference on Wednesday that parliament would return on December 22 to hear “urgent” reforms, including capping the number of firearms allowed by a single person and making certain types of shotguns harder to access. The state government will also look at reforms making it harder to hold large street protests after terror events, in order to prevent further tensions. “We’ve got a monumental task in front of us. It’s huge,” he said. “It’s a huge responsibility to pull the community together. I think we need a summer of calm and togetherness, not division.” Naveed remains in a Sydney hospital under heavy police guard. The men accused of carrying out Sunday’s attack had travelled to the southern Philippines, weeks before the shooting that Australian police said appeared to be inspired by Islamic State. US President Donald Trump told a Hanukkah event at the White House late on Tuesday that he was thinking of the victims of the “horrific and anti-Semitic terrorist attack”. “We join in mourning all of those who were killed, and we’re praying for the swift recovery of the wounded,” he said. Trump called for a global fight against “radical Islamic terrorism”. “All nations must stand together against the evil forces of radical Islamic terrorism, and we’re doing that,” he said. Funerals begin Funerals of the Jewish victims of Sunday’s attack began on Wednesday, amid anger over how the gunmen — one of whom was briefly investigated for links to extremists — were allowed access to powerful firearms. A funeral for Rabbi Eli Schlanger, an assistant rabbi at Chabad Bondi Synagogue and a father of five, was held on Wednesday. He was known for his work for Sydney’s Jewish community through Chabad, a global organisation fostering Jewish identity and connection. Schlanger would travel to prisons and meet with Jewish people living in Sydney’s public housing communities, Jewish leader Alex Ryvchin said on Monday. Albanese is facing criticism that his centre-left government did not do enough to prevent the spread of anti-Semitism in Australia during the two-year Israel-Gaza war. “We will work with the Jewish community, we want to stamp out and eradicate anti-Semitism from our society,” Albanese told reporters. The government and intelligence services are also under pressure to explain why Sajid was allowed to legally acquire the high-powered rifles and shotguns used in the attack. The government has already promised sweeping reforms to gun laws. His son, meanwhile, was briefly investigated by Australia’s domestic intelligence agency in 2019 over alleged links to Islamic State, but there was no evidence at the time he posed a threat, Albanese said. Man praised as hero to undergo surgery Albanese said Ahmed al-Ahmed, 43, the man who tackled one of the shooters to disarm his rifle and suffered gunshot wounds, was due to undergo surgery on Wednesday. Al-Ahmed’s uncle, Mohammed al-Ahmed in Syria, said his nephew left his hometown in Syria’s northwest province of Idlib nearly 20 years ago to seek work in Australia. “We learned through social media. I called his father and he told me that it was Ahmed. Ahmed is a hero, we’re proud of him. Syria in general is proud of him,” the uncle told Reuters . The family of 22-year-old police officer Jack Hibbert, who was shot twice on Sunday and had been on the force for just four months, said in a statement on Wednesday that he had lost vision in one eye and faced a “long and challenging recovery” ahead. “In the face of a violent and tragic incident, he responded with courage, instinct, and selflessness, continuing to protect and help others whilst injured, until he was physically no longer able to,” the family said. Health authorities said 22 people were still in several Sydney hospitals. Holocaust survivor among victims Other shooting victims included a Holocaust survivor, a husband and wife who first approached the gunmen before they started firing, and a 10-year-old girl named Matilda, according to interviews, officials and media reports. Matilda’s father told a Bondi vigil on Tuesday night he did not want his daughter’s legacy to be forgotten. “We came here from Ukraine and I thought that Matilda is the most Australian name that can ever exist. So just remember the name, remember her,” local media reported him as saying. In Bondi on Wednesday, swimmers gathered on Sydney’s most popular beach and held a minute’s silence. “This week has obviously been very profound, and this morning, I definitely feel a sense of the community getting together, and a sense of everyone sitting together,” Archie Kalaf, a 24-year-old Bondi man, told Reuters . “Everyone’s grieving, everyone’s understanding and processing it in their own way.”",

      "title_orig": "Campaign falsely linking Bondi shooting suspect to Pakistan launched from ‘hostile countries’: Tarar",
      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Wednesday that it was falsely claimed after the Bondi Beach shooting in Australia that one of the attackers was from Pakistan, holding “hostile countries” responsible for this campaign. The tragic attack by two men on Sunday resulted in the death of 16 people, including one of the attackers. Soon after the incident, a Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney was misidentified as one of the attackers. Later, it was confirmed that among the father-son duo of suspects, the former, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, was from India, and the latter, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was born in Australia. View this post on Instagram “When the incident happened, certain media outlets were very quick to state that one of the attackers was from Pakistan and the other one was born in Australia. “There was no evidence to prove this claim, there was no documentation, and there was no verification of this claim. But somehow, we know that this campaign was launched from hostile countries trying to malign Pakistan,” Tarar said during a media briefing in Islamabad. The minister continued, “In Israel and India, this campaign was proliferated and posted on social media platforms, as well as electronic media platforms, which is very, very sad.” He highlighted that Pakistan had been a frontline state in the war against terrorism and continued to combat terrorists. Here, he also mentioned the Army Public School massacre that took place on December 16, 2014. A total of 147 people, including 132 students, were martyred and 180 were injured in the attack. “So, we are a country whose children have also given sacrifices, whose children have laid down their lives in this war against terrorism,” Tarar said, adding that it was unfortunate that a “false campaign” was run against Pakistan. He reiterated that there was not even a shred of evidence or any reliable source to back the claim that one of the Bondi Beach attackers was from Pakistan. View this post on Instagram Tarar further stated that the “misinformation campaign” against Pakistan was run deliberately, adding that it saddened him that very well-reputed media outlets fell prey to this “disinformation campaign”. The minister said that these media houses and outlets, operating globally, had editorial boards and systems in place to verify information. “There are structures, there is a hierarchy through which information is passed on, and editorial control is exercised. Even then, they failed to exercise the basic norms of journalism,” he said, reiterating that it was falsely claimed that one of the attackers was from Pakistan. The claim, he said, was refuted as Indian police issued a press release on Tuesday stating that one of the suspects was from Hyderabad in India. He added that it had also been confirmed that the Indian embassy in Sydney had issued the suspect his passport. “In fact, he travelled to the Philippines on that Indian passport as confirmed by the Philippines authorities,” Tarar said. “So, I don’t know why this campaign was run. But, it is very, very unfortunate.” The minister then played a video that he said detailed how the campaign was run and which media outlets were involved in it. ‘Organised campaign’ After the video ended, the minister said the campaign seemed to be an organised one. “It spread like wildfire, and no editorial board, no management, no reporter questioned where the information was coming from.” He went on to say that one of the news outlets had gone as far as claiming that the attackers were from Lahore, without showing any documentation. “How is it possible that when you give news with regard to a terrorism incident, and you claim that the attackers are from a certain country or are of a certain origin, you have no evidence whatsoever to substantiate your claim? “It really saddens us as victims of terrorism.” He said Pakistan had always and would always condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Tarar pointed out that Pakistan did not instantly react to the false claim as “a responsible state acts like a responsible state by actually verifying information”. He also questioned how it was possible that the Indian government did not know that the suspects were of “Indian origin or had Indian passports or were Indian citizens”. “Every country has a national database through which,[using] facial recognition, it can be easily identified to which country a certain individual belongs. There are retinal scans, there are fingerprints, there is facial recognition — there is so much technology in the world now that any database would have revealed where they were from. “But unfortunately, there was a vicious campaign to instantly say that one of the attackers, the father, was a Pakistani national,” Tarar added. The minister linked the occurrence also to the suspects having a name that “is common in certain parts of the world”. He said it was not sufficient evidence to pin the blame on Pakistan. ‘Who is going to cover the damage?’ Tarar also appreciated Australian authorities for “conducting themselves very professionally throughout the investigation. Despite the vicious campaign which was run all over the international media, they did not cast any aspersions in this regard, and they actually waited for this information to be verified”. Saying that now that it was clear that the suspect was from India, Tarar added, “My question is, and I have the right to question, that who is going to cover the damage that was caused to Pakistan through these fake posts and false information. “How do we go back to the position before the Bondi Beach attack? Should we initiate legal proceedings? Should we request an apology? Or will it just become a part of history as a campaign based on absolutely fake and false information to malign Pakistan?” ‘’India-backed terrorism in Pakistan’ He said acts of terrorism had been taking place elsewhere in the world as well, recalling the murder and assassination of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. Nijjar was shot dead by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over in 2023 after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. India was accused of being involved in his assassination, but New Delhi termed the allegation “absurd”. “We have seen transnational assassinations taking place. We have seen this incident,” Tarar said during his briefing, adding, “We know that India supports terrorism in Pakistan.” The minister said the Inter-Service Public Relations director general and he, too, had shared evidence of terrorism in Balochistan and Kyber Pakhtunkhwa being backed and funded by India. “There is irrefutable evidence to prove that.” In addition, he said, “Whenever Afghan soil is used for an attack in Pakistan, somewhere there is an indian link.” Saying that the Afghanistan government had been cosying up to India these days, Tarar questioned: “What is the main reason behind it? Do they have any bilateral trade? Do they have other areas of mutual cooperation the great potential of which they want to realise?” Reiterating that there was “irrefutable evidence of Indian terrorism in Pakistan”, he alleged that the country was not just involved in funding terrorism but also planning the attacks in Balochistan and KP. Again highlighting that Pakistan had been fighting terrorism for long and rendered sacrifices in doing so, Tarar repeated that the campaign against Pakistan following the Bondi Beach shooting was unfortunate. “And a country from where this campaign originated, and most of the Indian outlets that aired the [false] news without verification, they had no right to do this. “Because their country is supporting terrorism, and we are fighting terrorism. That is the difference between India and Pakistan,” he continued. Tarar further stated that now that there was credible information and irrefutable evidence of one of the suspects hailing from Indian, “how do you vindicate Pakistan in this? How do you say that ‘we are sorry and this should not have happened’”. He asserted that while Pakistan had stood for peace, would always promote peace and condemn incidents of terrorism, the media was required to act responsibly and “pin the blame where it lies”. The media, he stressed, needed to verify the information and then disseminate it. Again mentioning Nijjar’s assassination, Tarar said it “shows you the true face of the Indian state”. He also mentioned the recent incident of the chief minister of Indian state of Bihar pulling off a woman doctor’s hijab at a graduation ceremony. “This just shows the mindset that is prevalent in that country with regard to extremism of any kind. Their society is absolutely disoriented. They don’t have any narrative to sell to the world, any story to tell to the world. “All you can find within India is extremism of every kind being promoted. Because you have a government [there] which believes in extremism, suppressing the minorities and their rights and promoting terrorism and extremism,” Tarar commented. ‘Highly condemnable’ Earlier in the media briefing, the minister termed the Bondi Beach shooting “highly condemnable”, adding that “since Pakistan is a victim of terrorism and has remained a victim for so many years, we actually know what it feels like”. “We can feel the pain of Australia, the citizens of Australia. We can relate to them because we see this happening in Pakistan,” he said, expressing solidarity with the government and people of Australia. He also lauded the Australian citizen who wrestled a gun from one of the alleged attackers and “saved several lives”. During the Bondi Beach incident, 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed had hid behind parked cars before charging at one of the gunmen from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. He was hospitalised after getting injured in his bid to stop the attackers and has been hailed as a hero around the world.",

      "summary_en": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said on Wednesday that it was falsely claimed after the Bondi Beach shooting in Australia that one of the attackers was from Pakistan, holding “hostile countries” responsible for this campaign. The tragic attack by two men on Sunday resulted in the death of 16 people, including one of the attackers. Soon after the incident, a Pakistan-origin man living in Sydney was misidentified as one of the attackers. Later, it was confirmed that among the father-son duo of suspects, the former, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, was from India, and the latter, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was born in Australia. View this post on Instagram “When the incident happened, certain media outlets were very quick to state that one of the attackers was from Pakistan and the other one was born in Australia. “There was no evidence to prove this claim, there was no documentation, and there was no verification of this claim. But somehow, we know that this campaign was launched from hostile countries trying to malign Pakistan,” Tarar said during a media briefing in Islamabad. The minister continued, “In Israel and India, this campaign was proliferated and posted on social media platforms, as well as electronic media platforms, which is very, very sad.” He highlighted that Pakistan had been a frontline state in the war against terrorism and continued to combat terrorists. Here, he also mentioned the Army Public School massacre that took place on December 16, 2014. A total of 147 people, including 132 students, were martyred and 180 were injured in the attack. “So, we are a country whose children have also given sacrifices, whose children have laid down their lives in this war against terrorism,” Tarar said, adding that it was unfortunate that a “false campaign” was run against Pakistan. He reiterated that there was not even a shred of evidence or any reliable source to back the claim that one of the Bondi Beach attackers was from Pakistan. View this post on Instagram Tarar further stated that the “misinformation campaign” against Pakistan was run deliberately, adding that it saddened him that very well-reputed media outlets fell prey to this “disinformation campaign”. The minister said that these media houses and outlets, operating globally, had editorial boards and systems in place to verify information. “There are structures, there is a hierarchy through which information is passed on, and editorial control is exercised. Even then, they failed to exercise the basic norms of journalism,” he said, reiterating that it was falsely claimed that one of the attackers was from Pakistan. The claim, he said, was refuted as Indian police issued a press release on Tuesday stating that one of the suspects was from Hyderabad in India. He added that it had also been confirmed that the Indian embassy in Sydney had issued the suspect his passport. “In fact, he travelled to the Philippines on that Indian passport as confirmed by the Philippines authorities,” Tarar said. “So, I don’t know why this campaign was run. But, it is very, very unfortunate.” The minister then played a video that he said detailed how the campaign was run and which media outlets were involved in it. ‘Organised campaign’ After the video ended, the minister said the campaign seemed to be an organised one. “It spread like wildfire, and no editorial board, no management, no reporter questioned where the information was coming from.” He went on to say that one of the news outlets had gone as far as claiming that the attackers were from Lahore, without showing any documentation. “How is it possible that when you give news with regard to a terrorism incident, and you claim that the attackers are from a certain country or are of a certain origin, you have no evidence whatsoever to substantiate your claim? “It really saddens us as victims of terrorism.” He said Pakistan had always and would always condemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Tarar pointed out that Pakistan did not instantly react to the false claim as “a responsible state acts like a responsible state by actually verifying information”. He also questioned how it was possible that the Indian government did not know that the suspects were of “Indian origin or had Indian passports or were Indian citizens”. “Every country has a national database through which,[using] facial recognition, it can be easily identified to which country a certain individual belongs. There are retinal scans, there are fingerprints, there is facial recognition — there is so much technology in the world now that any database would have revealed where they were from. “But unfortunately, there was a vicious campaign to instantly say that one of the attackers, the father, was a Pakistani national,” Tarar added. The minister linked the occurrence also to the suspects having a name that “is common in certain parts of the world”. He said it was not sufficient evidence to pin the blame on Pakistan. ‘Who is going to cover the damage?’ Tarar also appreciated Australian authorities for “conducting themselves very professionally throughout the investigation. Despite the vicious campaign which was run all over the international media, they did not cast any aspersions in this regard, and they actually waited for this information to be verified”. Saying that now that it was clear that the suspect was from India, Tarar added, “My question is, and I have the right to question, that who is going to cover the damage that was caused to Pakistan through these fake posts and false information. “How do we go back to the position before the Bondi Beach attack? Should we initiate legal proceedings? Should we request an apology? Or will it just become a part of history as a campaign based on absolutely fake and false information to malign Pakistan?” ‘’India-backed terrorism in Pakistan’ He said acts of terrorism had been taking place elsewhere in the world as well, recalling the murder and assassination of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. Nijjar was shot dead by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over in 2023 after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. India was accused of being involved in his assassination, but New Delhi termed the allegation “absurd”. “We have seen transnational assassinations taking place. We have seen this incident,” Tarar said during his briefing, adding, “We know that India supports terrorism in Pakistan.” The minister said the Inter-Service Public Relations director general and he, too, had shared evidence of terrorism in Balochistan and Kyber Pakhtunkhwa being backed and funded by India. “There is irrefutable evidence to prove that.” In addition, he said, “Whenever Afghan soil is used for an attack in Pakistan, somewhere there is an indian link.” Saying that the Afghanistan government had been cosying up to India these days, Tarar questioned: “What is the main reason behind it? Do they have any bilateral trade? Do they have other areas of mutual cooperation the great potential of which they want to realise?” Reiterating that there was “irrefutable evidence of Indian terrorism in Pakistan”, he alleged that the country was not just involved in funding terrorism but also planning the attacks in Balochistan and KP. Again highlighting that Pakistan had been fighting terrorism for long and rendered sacrifices in doing so, Tarar repeated that the campaign against Pakistan following the Bondi Beach shooting was unfortunate. “And a country from where this campaign originated, and most of the Indian outlets that aired the [false] news without verification, they had no right to do this. “Because their country is supporting terrorism, and we are fighting terrorism. That is the difference between India and Pakistan,” he continued. Tarar further stated that now that there was credible information and irrefutable evidence of one of the suspects hailing from Indian, “how do you vindicate Pakistan in this? How do you say that ‘we are sorry and this should not have happened’”. He asserted that while Pakistan had stood for peace, would always promote peace and condemn incidents of terrorism, the media was required to act responsibly and “pin the blame where it lies”. The media, he stressed, needed to verify the information and then disseminate it. Again mentioning Nijjar’s assassination, Tarar said it “shows you the true face of the Indian state”.

      "summary_orig": "The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Wednesday reported that more than 2.5 million undocumented migrants have left the US since the Trump administration took office on January 20, 2025, amid a sharp expansion of immigration enforcement. According to DHS, the total includes over 605,000 formal deportations and approximately 1.9m “self-departures”, referring to migrants who left voluntarily amid intensified enforcement pressure. The department said removals have focused on individuals it describes as criminal offenders, while also encouraging undocumented migrants to leave on their own through a government-run mobile application offering free flights and a $1,000 incentive. The announcement — the administration’s most significant immigration update this year — comes as Washington tightens entry rules, expands travel bans , and increasingly links immigration control to national security and counter-terrorism concerns. While DHS presented the figures as evidence of restored “law and order”, immigration experts caution that the numbers combine distinct categories that were historically reported separately. Formal deportations — court-ordered or administrative removals — are being counted alongside voluntary exits, many of which occur under the implicit threat of detention or arrest. At the same time, the scale of interior enforcement has expanded sharply. Detention facilities operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are holding record numbers of migrants, straining capacity and raising due process concerns as immigration courts continue to face massive case backlogs. Travel bans expanded The DHS announcement coincides with a major expansion of US travel restrictions. On Dec 16, the White House added seven countries — including Syria and Palestinian Authority travel document holders, along with Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, Laos, and Sierra Leone — to the list of nations whose citizens face full or near-total entry bans. With these additions, 20 countries now face broad US travel restrictions, many of them Muslim-majority or conflict-affected states. The administration argues that weak identity verification systems and limited information-sharing cooperation make proper vetting impossible. Human rights groups counter that nationality-based bans punish entire populations and undermine international norms of individual assessment, while also complicating diplomatic relations and counter-terrorism cooperation. Security and terrorism as policy drivers US officials have increasingly framed immigration enforcement as a national security imperative, particularly following violent incidents involving foreign nationals. The White House cited the arrest of an Afghan suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend as justification for accelerating travel restrictions. But Senator Bernie Sanders,  a prominent progressive voice in US politics, cited last week’s terrorist attack in Sydney to argue against religious hatred, noting that a Muslim father risked his life to stop an attack on Jewish worshippers. In a social media statement, Sanders, who is also Jewish, said religion must not divide humanity and called for an end to antisemitism, Islamophobia and all forms of hate, describing the act as a reminder of shared human values that transcend faith and identity. Recent terrorist attacks have stirred a global debate on immigration — as some underscored the disconnect between individual acts of solidarity and broad-brush security policies. Implications for Pakistanis Pakistan is not included in the current travel ban, but the broader enforcement climate has implications for Pakistani nationals in the United States. Pakistani citizens largely reside in the US on student, work, family-based, or visitor visas, but immigration lawyers report increased scrutiny of visa renewals, status changes, and airport inspections. Visa overstays — including those who entered legally — now face a higher enforcement risk than in previous years. Community organisations say fear of detention has reduced engagement with public institutions, particularly among mixed-status families. While no targeted measures have been announced against Pakistanis, the environment has become less predictable. Economists warn that sudden return migration often leads to underemployment, especially for workers whose experience is tied to US labour markets. Within the US, reduced migrant labour is already being felt in agriculture, construction, and services, with employers reporting shortages and rising costs. Internationally, the US approach has drawn mixed reactions. Some governments acknowledge Washington’s security concerns, while others warn that sweeping bans and mass deportations risk eroding humanitarian commitments and straining bilateral ties. The DHS announcement marks a defining moment in US immigration policy — one that reflects a decisive shift toward enforcement-driven governance anchored in security concerns.",

      "title_orig": "Is international law truly ‘law’?",
      "summary_orig": "In recent years, the legitimacy of international law as a licit system has become a matter of profound scholarly interrogation and diplomatic preoccupation. This inquiry transcends the merely semantic or pedantic; instead, it excavates the very architecture of global order, shaping how nations comport themselves, how disputes are adjudicated, and how justice, stability, and predictability may be sustained across an ever-interdependent planet. This is underscored by contemporary crises such as the genocide in Gaza and the Indus Water Treaty , both cases illustrating how international law functions as a stabilising framework and normative guidance even in contexts characterised by stark power asymmetries and conflict. The fact is rather straightforward: international law is not contingent upon flawless compliance, but rather emerges from the interplay of institutional coherence, collective recognition, and structured mechanisms of accountability. Law or wistful aspiration? Critics, particularly those beholden to English legal theorist John Austin’s Command Theory of Law , argue that international law cannot properly be considered law. Their charge is beguilingly simple: states flout their obligations with disconcerting regularity, and enforcement mechanisms appear weak, inconsistent, or entirely spectral. In Austin’s schema, law is nothing more than a sovereign’s command buttressed by tangible sanctions. Remove coercive force, and law dissolves into wistful aspiration. Viewed through this tapered prism, international law becomes a mere compendium of norms, perennially hostage to the oscillations of national self-interest, geopolitical realpolitik, and the caprices of power. Such critiques, though intellectually stimulating, crumble under more rigorous scrutiny. Two rebuttals prove decisive. First, the illusion of perfect compliance is a profoundly flawed metric for assessing legal validity because even the most sophisticated domestic legal systems are replete with breaches, infractions, and unresolved disputes that do not, for a moment, impugn the legitimacy of the law itself. If obedience were the lodestar of legal existence, few, if any, legal orders would endure. Second, Austinian critics import criteria appropriate to hierarchical, coercive domestic structures into the unique, horizontal, and consensual realm of international relations. International law operates among sovereign equals who recognise no global Leviathan. To judge it by domestic parameters is to commit a categorical error. The legitimacy of any legal system inheres not in immaculate obedience but in the presence of an internally coherent constellation of norms, institutions, and authoritative procedures. British legal professional and philosopher H. L. A. Hart, in his seminal work The Concept of Law , provides the most illuminating framework for apprehending this legitimacy. He repudiated the reduction of law to crude coercion and conceived law as an intricate tapestry woven from primary and secondary rules. Primary rules impose duties and confer powers, guiding conduct and maintaining social order. They exhibit three characteristics: engender an insistent demand for conformity, be indispensable to the maintenance of societal life, and require individuals or states to subordinate parochial preferences to collective imperatives. Secondary rules imbue a legal system with coherence, adaptability, and authority. The Rule of Recognition furnishes the criteria of legal validity. The Rule of Change offers mechanisms for amendment and evolution. The Rule of Adjudication provides authoritative procedures for dispute resolution. Together, these rules comprise a functioning legal order founded not upon brute force but upon structural sophistication and institutional legitimacy. Absent these secondary rules, law is a formless nebula, incapable of guiding conduct or resolving disputes. ‘Systematic ordering of social life’ Through this Hartian lens, international law unmistakably presents the hallmarks of a mature legal system. Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice functions as an international rule of recognition, identifying treaties, customary norms, general principles, and subsidiary jurisprudence as authoritative sources. Treaty-making procedures, customary formation, and UN Security Council deliberations operate as rules of change, facilitating the perpetual evolution of international norms. The International Court of Justice, regional courts, and arbitral bodies furnish reliable mechanisms of adjudication. These institutions exercise authority not through coercive diktat but through the persuasive force of reason, legitimacy, and collective expectation. Primary sources of international law readily satisfy Hart’s criteria of obligation. Consider the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , which codifies a finely calibrated system of privileges, immunities, and behavioural standards for diplomats, reinforced not by coercion but by reciprocity. No state wishes to endanger the safety of its own emissaries abroad. Thus, compliance flows from enlightened self-interest and the recognition that diplomatic intercourse is the lifeblood of international comity. Crucially, these obligations often compel states to restrain short-term impulses. The immunity provisions in Article 31 oblige states to place the dignity of a legal order above the allure of expedient retribution. Customary international law provides further illustration. Norms such as the prohibition of torture, elevated to jus cogens — a body of peremptory norms in international law from which no derogation is permitted — bind all states. In Prosecutor v. Furundžija , the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia affirmed this status. Such norms generate moral suasion, institutional authority, and global opprobrium against breaches. They embody a universal conscience that no state can legitimately contravene. General principles recognised by civilised nations serve as stabilising forces when treaties fall silent or custom proves ambiguous. Principles such as estoppel, equity, and good faith preserve coherence, integrity, and reason. The Argentina-Chile Frontier Arbitration vividly demonstrates estoppel’s ability to anchor states to their prior undertakings, forestalling chaotic inconsistency. Judicial decisions and scholarly interpretations, though subsidiary under Article 59, wield immense interpretative influence. They refine the law’s contours, crystallise its principles, and guide state behaviour. Their authority is derived not from coercion but from erudition, logic, and the institutional legitimacy of international courts and tribunals. When apprehended holistically, international law emerges as a sophisticated union of primary and secondary rules. Austinian critiques, fixated on coercion, overlook this deeper structural and normative architecture. Hart teaches that the essence of law resides not in the immediacy of its sanctions but in the systematic ordering of social life, the predictability it engenders, and the institutional mechanisms it employs to resolve disputes. Procedural and moral anchor Case in point: the Indus Waters Treaty. Operational for over six decades, it demonstrates the endurance of legal norms despite intermittent political turbulence. India’s unilateral suspension of the treaty in April 2025 challenged the immediate authority of the legal order but did not annul its binding force . From a Hartian perspective, the treaty’s legitimacy derives not from immediate obedience but from the robustness of its primary and secondary rules: the institutional architecture underpinning dispute resolution, the sustained collective recognition by the parties, and the adjudicative mechanisms, including recourse to the Permanent Court of Arbitration . These structural features ensure that the treaty continues to exert normative influence, compelling compliance through reasoned expectation and procedural authority rather than through coercion. Similarly, the catastrophe in Gaza illustrates the resilience of international law under extreme conditions. Peremptory norms: prohibiting genocide, torture, and crimes against humanity operate as primary rules, binding states. The legitimacy of these norms is reinforced by secondary rules embodied in tribunals, fact-finding commissions, and the International Court of Justice, which provide structured avenues for recognition, adjudication, and accountability. Even where direct enforcement is limited, these mechanisms sustain the authority of the legal order, asserting claims to justice and normative compliance. In November last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the first leader of a “western-style” democracy to have an arrest warrant issued in his name by the International Criminal Court. The three-judge panel said it had found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu “bears criminal responsibility for … the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts”. Bibi, of course, was not arrested because Israel is not a member of the ICC. However, the order did, in theory, limit his movement, as any of the court’s 124 national members could arrest him on their territory. This explains why the Israeli premier chose to skip an event marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, or why his plane avoided the French airspace on the way to the 80th United Nations General Assembly session in September. But more than that, what the warrant did was establish that there was someone out there seeing, noting and keeping a record of the grave crimes Netanyahu’s government committed. And that there was someone who would try, at least, to hold him accountable for it, even if on paper. In both instances — the Indus Water Treaty and Israeli assault on Gaza — international law serves as a procedural and moral anchor, maintaining authority through institutional integrity, collective commitment, and the internal logic of the legal system, rather than relying solely on coercive power. The enduring challenge lies in the continuous engagement of states; the effectiveness and legitimacy of international law remain contingent on their sustained recognition, highlighting that its authority is fundamentally procedural, consensual, and structurally grounded rather than purely coercive. This understanding gives rise to urgent and arresting questions. If law is something more than the shadow of force, what then is the true source of legitimate authority in an otherwise anarchic world? If justice aspires beyond coercion, can a global community genuinely exist without recognising the binding nature of shared norms? And if states willingly partake in the benefits of legal order, can they, with any honesty, disclaim the obligations that sustain it? These questions, echoing through the long arc of international jurisprudence, challenge states to acknowledge that legitimacy does not originate from compulsion alone but from procedural integrity, collective consent, and a shared commitment to the governance of reason. To deny this legitimacy is to imperil justice itself, to unravel the threads of accountability, and to erode the fragile architecture upon which the international system rests. To affirm it is to accept that humanity, despite its frailties, is capable of rising above the tyranny of unrestrained power through the ennobling discipline of law. The choice between law and might The question has never been whether international law is flawless. Perfection is an illusion to which no human institution can credibly aspire. The real question is whether we are prepared to embrace international law as indispensable: the essential foundation of global justice, shared responsibility, and a world in which reasoned norms constrain unfettered force. Even with all its imperfections, the international legal order we possess today offers something infinitely more valuable than the void. It provides a platform on which accountability can be demanded, a vocabulary through which injustice can be named, and a structure through which the powerful can, at least in principle, be held to account. In moments of profound crisis, such a framework becomes not an academic abstraction but a lifeline. Without it, we would stand before atrocity with empty hands and no legal ground on which to challenge those who perpetrate grave violations. With it, imperfect though it may be, humanity retains a foothold: a means to contest impunity, to invoke norms against barbarity, and to insist that even in the darkest hours there exists a higher standard to which the world must answer. The choice is stark yet simple. We can reject the system for its inadequacies and be left with nothing, or we can uphold it as the best and indeed the only civilisational instrument we possess to express our collective yearning for order, dignity, and justice. The future of global society depends on recognising that in the contest between law and might, it is only through the persistent affirmation of law’s legitimacy that humanity can hope to transcend the brutal logic of force.

      "summary": "In recent years, the legitimacy of international law as a licit system has become a matter of profound scholarly interrogation and diplomatic preoccupation. This inquiry transcends the merely semantic or pedantic; instead, it excavates the very architecture of global order, shaping how nations comport themselves, how disputes are adjudicated, and how justice, stability, and predictability may be sustained across an ever-interdependent planet. This is underscored by contemporary crises such as the genocide in Gaza and the Indus Water Treaty , both cases illustrating how international law functions as a stabilising framework and normative guidance even in contexts characterised by stark power asymmetries and conflict. The fact is rather straightforward: international law is not contingent upon flawless compliance, but rather emerges from the interplay of institutional coherence, collective recognition, and structured mechanisms of accountability. Law or wistful aspiration? Critics, particularly those beholden to English legal theorist John Austin’s Command Theory of Law , argue that international law cannot properly be considered law. Their charge is beguilingly simple: states flout their obligations with disconcerting regularity, and enforcement mechanisms appear weak, inconsistent, or entirely spectral. In Austin’s schema, law is nothing more than a sovereign’s command buttressed by tangible sanctions. Remove coercive force, and law dissolves into wistful aspiration. Viewed through this tapered prism, international law becomes a mere compendium of norms, perennially hostage to the oscillations of national self-interest, geopolitical realpolitik, and the caprices of power. Such critiques, though intellectually stimulating, crumble under more rigorous scrutiny. Two rebuttals prove decisive. First, the illusion of perfect compliance is a profoundly flawed metric for assessing legal validity because even the most sophisticated domestic legal systems are replete with breaches, infractions, and unresolved disputes that do not, for a moment, impugn the legitimacy of the law itself. If obedience were the lodestar of legal existence, few, if any, legal orders would endure. Second, Austinian critics import criteria appropriate to hierarchical, coercive domestic structures into the unique, horizontal, and consensual realm of international relations. International law operates among sovereign equals who recognise no global Leviathan. To judge it by domestic parameters is to commit a categorical error. The legitimacy of any legal system inheres not in immaculate obedience but in the presence of an internally coherent constellation of norms, institutions, and authoritative procedures. British legal professional and philosopher H. L. A. Hart, in his seminal work The Concept of Law , provides the most illuminating framework for apprehending this legitimacy. He repudiated the reduction of law to crude coercion and conceived law as an intricate tapestry woven from primary and secondary rules. Primary rules impose duties and confer powers, guiding conduct and maintaining social order. They exhibit three characteristics: engender an insistent demand for conformity, be indispensable to the maintenance of societal life, and require individuals or states to subordinate parochial preferences to collective imperatives. Secondary rules imbue a legal system with coherence, adaptability, and authority. The Rule of Recognition furnishes the criteria of legal validity. The Rule of Change offers mechanisms for amendment and evolution. The Rule of Adjudication provides authoritative procedures for dispute resolution. Together, these rules comprise a functioning legal order founded not upon brute force but upon structural sophistication and institutional legitimacy. Absent these secondary rules, law is a formless nebula, incapable of guiding conduct or resolving disputes. ‘Systematic ordering of social life’ Through this Hartian lens, international law unmistakably presents the hallmarks of a mature legal system. Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice functions as an international rule of recognition, identifying treaties, customary norms, general principles, and subsidiary jurisprudence as authoritative sources. Treaty-making procedures, customary formation, and UN Security Council deliberations operate as rules of change, facilitating the perpetual evolution of international norms. The International Court of Justice, regional courts, and arbitral bodies furnish reliable mechanisms of adjudication. These institutions exercise authority not through coercive diktat but through the persuasive force of reason, legitimacy, and collective expectation. Primary sources of international law readily satisfy Hart’s criteria of obligation. Consider the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , which codifies a finely calibrated system of privileges, immunities, and behavioural standards for diplomats, reinforced not by coercion but by reciprocity. No state wishes to endanger the safety of its own emissaries abroad. Thus, compliance flows from enlightened self-interest and the recognition that diplomatic intercourse is the lifeblood of international comity. Crucially, these obligations often compel states to restrain short-term impulses. The immunity provisions in Article 31 oblige states to place the dignity of a legal order above the allure of expedient retribution. Customary international law provides further illustration. Norms such as the prohibition of torture, elevated to jus cogens — a body of peremptory norms in international law from which no derogation is permitted — bind all states. In Prosecutor v. Furundžija , the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia affirmed this status. Such norms generate moral suasion, institutional authority, and global opprobrium against breaches. They embody a universal conscience that no state can legitimately contravene. General principles recognised by civilised nations serve as stabilising forces when treaties fall silent or custom proves ambiguous. Principles such as estoppel, equity, and good faith preserve coherence, integrity, and reason. The Argentina-Chile Frontier Arbitration vividly demonstrates estoppel’s ability to anchor states to their prior undertakings, forestalling chaotic inconsistency. Judicial decisions and scholarly interpretations, though subsidiary under Article 59, wield immense interpretative influence. They refine the law’s contours, crystallise its principles, and guide state behaviour. Their authority is derived not from coercion but from erudition, logic, and the institutional legitimacy of international courts and tribunals. When apprehended holistically, international law emerges as a sophisticated union of primary and secondary rules. Austinian critiques, fixated on coercion, overlook this deeper structural and normative architecture. Hart teaches that the essence of law resides not in the immediacy of its sanctions but in the systematic ordering of social life, the predictability it engenders, and the institutional mechanisms it employs to resolve disputes. Procedural and moral anchor Case in point: the Indus Waters Treaty. Operational for over six decades, it demonstrates the endurance of legal norms despite intermittent political turbulence. India’s unilateral suspension of the treaty in April 2025 challenged the immediate authority of the legal order but did not annul its binding force . From a Hartian perspective, the treaty’s legitimacy derives not from immediate obedience but from the robustness of its primary and secondary rules: the institutional architecture underpinning dispute resolution, the sustained collective recognition by the parties, and the adjudicative mechanisms, including recourse to the Permanent Court of Arbitration . These structural features ensure that the treaty continues to exert normative influence, compelling compliance through reasoned expectation and procedural authority rather than through coercion. Similarly, the catastrophe in Gaza illustrates the resilience of international law under extreme conditions. Peremptory norms: prohibiting genocide, torture, and crimes against humanity operate as primary rules, binding states. The legitimacy of these norms is reinforced by secondary rules embodied in tribunals, fact-finding commissions, and the International Court of Justice, which provide structured avenues for recognition, adjudication, and accountability. Even where direct enforcement is limited, these mechanisms sustain the authority of the legal order, asserting claims to justice and normative compliance. In November last year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the first leader of a “western-style” democracy to have an arrest warrant issued in his name by the International Criminal Court. The three-judge panel said it had found reasonable grounds to believe that Netanyahu “bears criminal responsibility for … the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts”. Bibi, of course, was not arrested because Israel is not a member of the ICC. However, the order did, in theory, limit his movement, as any of the court’s 124 national members could arrest him on their territory. This explains why the Israeli premier chose to skip an event marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, or why his plane avoided the French airspace on the way to the 80th United Nations General Assembly session in September. But more than that, what the warrant did was establish that there was someone out there seeing, noting and keeping a record of the grave crimes Netanyahu’s government committed. And that there was someone who would try, at least, to hold him accountable for it, even if on paper. In both instances — the Indus Water Treaty and Israeli assault on Gaza — international law serves as a procedural and moral anchor, maintaining authority through institutional integrity, collective commitment, and the internal logic of the legal system, rather than relying solely on coercive power. The enduring challenge lies in the continuous engagement of states; the effectiveness and legitimacy of international law remain contingent on their sustained recognition, highlighting that its authority is fundamentally procedural, consensual, and structurally grounded rather than purely coercive. This understanding gives rise to urgent and arresting questions. If law is something more than the shadow of force, what then is the true source of legitimate authority in an otherwise anarchic world? If justice aspires beyond coercion, can a global community genuinely exist without recognising the binding nature of shared norms? And if states willingly partake in the benefits of legal order, can they, with any honesty, disclaim the obligations that sustain it? These questions, echoing through the long arc of international jurisprudence, challenge states to acknowledge that legitimacy does not originate from compulsion alone but from procedural integrity, collective consent, and a shared commitment to the governance of reason. To deny this legitimacy is to imperil justice itself, to unravel the threads of accountability, and to erode the fragile architecture upon which the international system rests. To affirm it is to accept that humanity, despite its frailties, is capable of rising above the tyranny of unrestrained power through the ennobling discipline of law. The choice between law and might The question has never been whether international law is flawless. Perfection is an illusion to which no human institution can credibly aspire. The real question is whether we are prepared to embrace international law as indispensable: the essential foundation of global justice, shared responsibility, and a world in which reasoned norms constrain unfettered force. Even with all its imperfections, the international legal order we possess today offers something infinitely more valuable than the void. It provides a platform on which accountability can be demanded, a vocabulary through which injustice can be named, and a structure through which the powerful can, at least in principle, be held to account. In moments of profound crisis, such a framework becomes not an academic abstraction but a lifeline. Without it, we would stand before atrocity with empty hands and no legal ground on which to challenge those who perpetrate grave violations. With it, imperfect though it may be, humanity retains a foothold: a means to contest impunity, to invoke norms against barbarity, and to insist that even in the darkest hours there exists a higher standard to which the world must answer. The choice is stark yet simple. We can reject the system for its inadequacies and be left with nothing, or we can uphold it as the best and indeed the only civilisational instrument we possess to express our collective yearning for order, dignity, and justice. The future of global society depends on recognising that in the contest between law and might, it is only through the persistent affirmation of law’s legitimacy that humanity can hope to transcend the brutal logic of force.

      "title_orig": "Imran’s sons planning to visit Pakistan in January, say ex-premier being held in ‘death cell’",
      "summary_orig": "PTI founder Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan has said he and his brother Suleiman have applied for their visas and are planning a trip to Pakistan in January, while also commenting on the conditions in which the ex-premier was kept and saying that he was being held in a “death cell”. The remarks were made during an interview to Yalda Hakim for Sky News, which came as another sit-in held outside Adiala jail by Imran’s sisters over being denied a meeting with him was dispersed using water cannons; the party alleged that authorities used “chemical-laced” water. As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. During their interview with Hakim, released early on Wednesday, Kasim and Suleiman, who live in London, were asked whether they had tried to engage with the Pakistani government to get permission to visit Imran. Hakim also noted that they had previously talked about “being warned not to come” even though Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said they “were welcome to come and can visit him [Imran]”. At that, Kasim replied: “We are now planning to because they said it openly. So — unless they go against their word — we should be hopefully going in January. We have applied for our visas. […] It hasn’t come through yet. We are expecting it to come through, so we are planning a trip in January.” Hakim then asked them what they would say to Imran upon seeing him, and whether they would ask him to consider “cutting a deal”. But Kasim explained that “what you have to understand is it’s his life. It’s literally his passion and his goal. He calls it his life’s purpose to help rid Pakistan of corruption”. “And so if he just took a deal and came over to us and lived in England, I know there would be this burning desire and this aching that he has left his country for dead. And he would be depressed, to be honest. I know he would. “This is his goal, and as much as we’d love to have our father watching all of our cricket matches or football matches over here, he has a purpose which is far greater. So, you can only respect it,” he said. Asked what else they would want to say to Imran or what message they would like to send to him, Kasim said, “I want to know how we can get him out, how we can help because the main point is we feel so helpless at this point. I mean, there’s so much to catch up on.” He also shared that during their interactions, Imran would always refuse to talk about his jail conditions. “He’s like, ‘Oh, you know, don’t worry about me. How’s everything?’” Kasim said, adding that he would also enquire about their grandmother Lady Annabel Goldsmith, who died in October. “We haven’t spoken to him since she died only a couple of months ago, and I would love to speak to him about that. He called her his mother after his own mother had passed, and their relationship was so close. So, I’d love to speak to him about that,” he added. When Hakim asked them whether they think Imran “will ever get out”, their reply was not too optimistic. “The conditions are getting worse. The people in power are becoming more entrenched. So, it’s very hard to see a way out and a lot of the people we speak to […] are seeming less and less confident every time we speak to them. “So, we’re now worried we might never see him again,” Kasim said. He added that while the defence minister had said that they were welcome to visit Imran, he had his doubts. Suleiman also pointed out that Imran was “not the sort of person who’s going to make any compromises or cut a deal. So yeah, at the moment, that looks like the only easy route out, but I think international pressure is always an effective way of forcing change in these situations”. ‘Awful conditions’ Hakim also asked the two about the condition of Imran’s jail cell, to which Kasim said, “The conditions are awful. Like, they are not bad, they are awful.” Suleiman said the cell in which Imran was kept had been described as a “death cell”. “There are barely any lights, sometimes the electricity is cut off, there’s dirty water […] completely substandard conditions that don’t meet international laws for any sort of prisoner,” he claimed. They were also asked about “what went through their minds” when they came across rumours about Imran’s possible death on social media. Suleiman described that experience as “incredibly stressful”. “I went straight to my family group chat because that’s the only reliable source that we have on the ground in Pakistan,” he added. For his part, Kasim said coming across the rumours on social media was “jarring”. It “obviously pulls you out of whatever you are trying to do in your normal life. Especially, [given] how helpless we are over here, not able to do much at all,” he said. Hakim also brought up the subject of one of Imran’s sisters, Uzma, being allowed to meet him in jail in early December after weeks of restricted access. Following the meeting, a post on Imran’s X account against the military leadership, dubbed his message from jail, had led to a hard-hitting press briefing by Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry. Asked what Uzma shared with Kasim and Suleiman after the meeting, the latter replied that she had assured them that Imran was well but furious about the conditions he had been kept in. “And he put out — he dictated a tweet (post on social media platform X) I think through her, or maybe potentially through her. And I think that tweet has partly led to this reaction from the establishment to completely try and isolate him,” Suleiman said. When Hakim asked them what would be their message to the international community, Suleiman said, “At minimum, just to make sure that the standards of international human rights are being upheld, and right now they’re clearly being violated. “We just want to ensure that basic human rights for our father are being respected,” he said. He also highlighted the need for “independent monitoring” of Imran’s conditions “because we have no idea what it’s like until someone goes to see him and speaks to him”. For his part, Kasim stressed the need for implementing court orders for Imran’s visitation rights, respecting the rule of law and allowing the PTI founder to see his personal physician. Hakim also asked the brothers about what Imran’s opinion would be on recent constitutional amendments in Pakistan, especially the immunity given to the army chief under the tweaks. To that, Kasim said he believed Imran would not be surprised. “Because I think it’s quite clear that it was heading towards basically what it is now, which is a military dictatorship in everything but name. I think he probably knows about this already. And part of the reason he’s being silenced, isolated is because they know that he’s inevitably not going to stand for this,” he added. ‘Afraid of his popularity’ The duo also shared that they were looking to do more advocacy and visit Brussels or Geneva in January to speak to politicians and officials about Imran’s situation. Hakim then asked them whether they ever thought that one day they would be lobbying for their father’s release. “Yes, probably, realistically, because we spent, he especially, my brother spent a lot of time asking him not to go into politics when there were kind of these dangerous characters killing people consistently,” Kasim replied. Adding that several other Pakistani politicians had also been imprisoned, Kasim said: “This is just completely different. They’re not all tortured in solitary confinement cells and staying there for upwards of two years.” Without naming anyone, Hakim then asked them, “What do you think they’re afraid of?” “Popularity,” the two replied in unison. “He’s the most popular person in the country by a landslide. So the moment he’s out, there’s no chance they’ll hold on to power. So they’re desperately clinging on to it however they can,” Kasim said. ‘Doesn’t sound like solitary confinement’ Meanwhile, Mosharraf Zaidi, who is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s spokesperson for foreign media, also appeared on Hakim’s show and said that Imran had been incarcerated for around 860 days. “How many unique visits — interviews is what we call them in our system — do you think he’s had in those 860 days? … He’s supposed to get, as you said, one every week, and it’s been about 112 weeks. He’s had 870,” he said. He further said that Imran had held 137 meetings with his sisters, 45 with Aleema, 45 with Uzma and 43 with Noreen, noting that Aleema had held two more meetings since the numbers were tabulated. “This doesn’t sound like solitary confinement to me,” Zaidi said, adding that Imran had held 451 interviews with his lawyers. He insisted that Imran’s personal physician was allowed to see him. “There was a gap of about three and a half weeks in which the meetings were suspended. Now, those meetings were suspended because in every instance, there was a huge security issue that was being created. Every interaction that the former prime minister has had with his lawyers, with his family, becomes a political meeting,” Zaidi said. When Hakim pointed out that his sons had not spoken to him for five months, Zaidi said, “His last phone call was in September. I’m not sure whether one of the boys was on it or not.” He further said that neither he nor anyone in the government wanted to “get into an argument with two young men who have not seen their father in a long time but against whom there is no sanction to not see or not speak to their father”. At this point, Hakim pointed out that Zaidi had not answered any of her questions, to which he said he could not respond if she did not let him. “Your questions are coming from a place of genuinely seeking the truth and seeking justice … I think that these are honest people who are dealing with bad information. And so what I’m trying to do is provide you information but you don’t let me get all of it out,” he said. He also read out rule 265 of the Prison Rules, which states, “The discussion of political matters shall not be allowed at these interviews.” He said that since Imran had been jailed, there had been 575 posts from his X account. At this point, Hakim pulled up an old X post by Zaidi from 2023 when Imran had been arrested, in which he had called the move “disgraceful”. She also read out a similar post from 2024. She then asked whether he stood by his posts. “At the time, I [posted] them, absolutely,” he said, adding that more developments had taken place since then. He pointed to the May conflict with India, the 2024 attacks by Iran and constant attacks emanating from Afghanistan, saying that the way Pakistan had to respond to security and governance challenges had changed. “Are you saying Imran Khan is a threat?” Hakim asked, to which Zaidi replied, “Absolutely.” At one point, Hakim pointed to the report by the UN special rapporteur, asking Zaidi whether he thought she was lying. “I don’t think anybody is lying. I think people are consuming bad information,” he said, then pointing out that Hakim had not visited Pakistan in a decade. “If you give me a visa, I would happily [visit]. Would you give me an interview with Imran Khan?” she asked. Zaidi responded by saying she could interview Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “I’m not sure that, given the prison rules that I just cited, we’ll be allowed to afford Sky News the chance to break Pakistan’s laws,” he said. “I think people want rule of law, but they want it very specifically in circumstances that allow Imran Khan to enjoy total freedom at a time of incarceration. The whole purpose of being a convicted criminal is that you’re in jail and you lose your freedom,” he said. He further said that concerns raised by the UN had come from those who “had not visited Pakistan”.",

I’m not sure whether one of the boys was on it or not.” He further said that neither he nor anyone in the government wanted to “get into an argument with two young men who have not seen their father in a long time but against whom there is no sanction to not see or not speak to their father”. At this point, Hakim pointed out that Zaidi had not answered any of her questions, to which he said he could not respond if she did not let him. “Your questions are coming from a place of genuinely seeking the truth and seeking justice … I think that these are honest people who are dealing with bad information. And so what I’m trying to do is provide you information but you don’t let me get all of it out,” he said. He also read out rule 265 of the Prison Rules, which states, “The discussion of political matters shall not be allowed at these interviews.” He said that since Imran had been jailed, there had been 575 posts from his X account. At this point, Hakim pulled up an old X post by Zaidi from 2023 when Imran had been arrested, in which he had called the move “disgraceful”. She also read out a similar post from 2024. She then asked whether he stood by his posts. “At the time, I [posted] them, absolutely,” he said, adding that more developments had taken place since then. He pointed to the May conflict with India, the 2024 attacks by Iran and constant attacks emanating from Afghanistan, saying that the way Pakistan had to respond to security and governance challenges had changed. “Are you saying Imran Khan is a threat?” Hakim asked, to which Zaidi replied, “Absolutely.” At one point, Hakim pointed to the report by the UN special rapporteur, asking Zaidi whether he thought she was lying. “I don’t think anybody is lying. I think people are consuming bad information,” he said, then pointing out that Hakim had not visited Pakistan in a decade. “If you give me a visa, I would happily [visit]. Would you give me an interview with Imran Khan?” she asked. Zaidi responded by saying she could interview Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “I’m not sure that, given the prison rules that I just cited, we’ll be allowed to afford Sky News the chance to break Pakistan’s laws,” he said. “I think people want rule of law, but they want it very specifically in circumstances that allow Imran Khan to enjoy total freedom at a time of incarceration. The whole purpose of being a convicted criminal is that you’re in jail and you lose your freedom,” he said. He further said that concerns raised by the UN had come from those who “had not visited Pakistan”.",
      "title": "Imran’s sons planning to visit Pakistan in January, say ex-premier being held in ‘death cell’",
      "summary": "PTI founder Imran Khan’s son Kasim Khan has said he and his brother Suleiman have applied for their visas and are planning a trip to Pakistan in January, while also commenting on the conditions in which the ex-premier was kept and saying that he was being held in a “death cell”. The remarks were made during an interview to Yalda Hakim for Sky News, which came as another sit-in held outside Adiala jail by Imran’s sisters over being denied a meeting with him was dispersed using water cannons; the party alleged that authorities used “chemical-laced” water. As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment. During their interview with Hakim, released early on Wednesday, Kasim and Suleiman, who live in London, were asked whether they had tried to engage with the Pakistani government to get permission to visit Imran. Hakim also noted that they had previously talked about “being warned not to come” even though Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said they “were welcome to come and can visit him [Imran]”. At that, Kasim replied: “We are now planning to because they said it openly. So — unless they go against their word — we should be hopefully going in January. We have applied for our visas. […] It hasn’t come through yet. We are expecting it to come through, so we are planning a trip in January.” Hakim then asked them what they would say to Imran upon seeing him, and whether they would ask him to consider “cutting a deal”. But Kasim explained that “what you have to understand is it’s his life. It’s literally his passion and his goal. He calls it his life’s purpose to help rid Pakistan of corruption”. “And so if he just took a deal and came over to us and lived in England, I know there would be this burning desire and this aching that he has left his country for dead. And he would be depressed, to be honest. I know he would. “This is his goal, and as much as we’d love to have our father watching all of our cricket matches or football matches over here, he has a purpose which is far greater. So, you can only respect it,” he said. Asked what else they would want to say to Imran or what message they would like to send to him, Kasim said, “I want to know how we can get him out, how we can help because the main point is we feel so helpless at this point. I mean, there’s so much to catch up on.” He also shared that during their interactions, Imran would always refuse to talk about his jail conditions. “He’s like, ‘Oh, you know, don’t worry about me. How’s everything?’” Kasim said, adding that he would also enquire about their grandmother Lady Annabel Goldsmith, who died in October. “We haven’t spoken to him since she died only a couple of months ago, and I would love to speak to him about that. He called her his mother after his own mother had passed, and their relationship was so close. So, I’d love to speak to him about that,” he added. When Hakim asked them whether they think Imran “will ever get out”, their reply was not too optimistic. “The conditions are getting worse. The people in power are becoming more entrenched. So, it’s very hard to see a way out and a lot of the people we speak to […] are seeming less and less confident every time we speak to them. “So, we’re now worried we might never see him again,” Kasim said. He added that while the defence minister had said that they were welcome to visit Imran, he had his doubts. Suleiman also pointed out that Imran was “not the sort of person who’s going to make any compromises or cut a deal. So yeah, at the moment, that looks like the only easy route out, but I think international pressure is always an effective way of forcing change in these situations”. ‘Awful conditions’ Hakim also asked the two about the condition of Imran’s jail cell, to which Kasim said, “The conditions are awful. Like, they are not bad, they are awful.” Suleiman said the cell in which Imran was kept had been described as a “death cell”. “There are barely any lights, sometimes the electricity is cut off, there’s dirty water […] completely substandard conditions that don’t meet international laws for any sort of prisoner,” he claimed. They were also asked about “what went through their minds” when they came across rumours about Imran’s possible death on social media. Suleiman described that experience as “incredibly stressful”. “I went straight to my family group chat because that’s the only reliable source that we have on the ground in Pakistan,” he added. For his part, Kasim said coming across the rumours on social media was “jarring”. It “obviously pulls you out of whatever you are trying to do in your normal life. Especially, [given] how helpless we are over here, not able to do much at all,” he said. Hakim also brought up the subject of one of Imran’s sisters, Uzma, being allowed to meet him in jail in early December after weeks of restricted access. Following the meeting, a post on Imran’s X account against the military leadership, dubbed his message from jail, had led to a hard-hitting press briefing by Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry. Asked what Uzma shared with Kasim and Suleiman after the meeting, the latter replied that she had assured them that Imran was well but furious about the conditions he had been kept in. “And he put out — he dictated a tweet (post on social media platform X) I think through her, or maybe potentially through her. And I think that tweet has partly led to this reaction from the establishment to completely try and isolate him,” Suleiman said. When Hakim asked them what would be their message to the international community, Suleiman said, “At minimum, just to make sure that the standards of international human rights are being upheld, and right now they’re clearly being violated. “We just want to ensure that basic human rights for our father are being respected,” he said. He also highlighted the need for “independent monitoring” of Imran’s conditions “because we have no idea what it’s like until someone goes to see him and speaks to him”. For his part, Kasim stressed the need for implementing court orders for Imran’s visitation rights, respecting the rule of law and allowing the PTI founder to see his personal physician. Hakim also asked the brothers about what Imran’s opinion would be on recent constitutional amendments in Pakistan, especially the immunity given to the army chief under the tweaks. To that, Kasim said he believed Imran would not be surprised. “Because I think it’s quite clear that it was heading towards basically what it is now, which is a military dictatorship in everything but name. I think he probably knows about this already. And part of the reason he’s being silenced, isolated is because they know that he’s inevitably not going to stand for this,” he added. ‘Afraid of his popularity’ The duo also shared that they were looking to do more advocacy and visit Brussels or Geneva in January to speak to politicians and officials about Imran’s situation. Hakim then asked them whether they ever thought that one day they would be lobbying for their father’s release. “Yes, probably, realistically, because we spent, he especially, my brother spent a lot of time asking him not to go into politics when there were kind of these dangerous characters killing people consistently,” Kasim replied. Adding that several other Pakistani politicians had also been imprisoned, Kasim said: “This is just completely different. They’re not all tortured in solitary confinement cells and staying there for upwards of two years.” Without naming anyone, Hakim then asked them, “What do you think they’re afraid of?” “Popularity,” the two replied in unison. “He’s the most popular person in the country by a landslide. So the moment he’s out, there’s no chance they’ll hold on to power. So they’re desperately clinging on to it however they can,” Kasim said. ‘Doesn’t sound like solitary confinement’ Meanwhile, Mosharraf Zaidi, who is Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s spokesperson for foreign media, also appeared on Hakim’s show and said that Imran had been incarcerated for around 860 days. “How many unique visits — interviews is what we call them in our system — do you think he’s had in those 860 days? … He’s supposed to get, as you said, one every week, and it’s been about 112 weeks. He’s had 870,” he said. He further said that Imran had held 137 meetings with his sisters, 45 with Aleema, 45 with Uzma and 43 with Noreen, noting that Aleema had held two more meetings since the numbers were tabulated. “This doesn’t sound like solitary confinement to me,” Zaidi said, adding that Imran had held 451 interviews with his lawyers. He insisted that Imran’s personal physician was allowed to see him. “There was a gap of about three and a half weeks in which the meetings were suspended. Now, those meetings were suspended because in every instance, there was a huge security issue that was being created. Every interaction that the former prime minister has had with his lawyers, with his family, becomes a political meeting,” Zaidi said. When Hakim pointed out that his sons had not spoken to him for five months, Zaidi said, “His last phone call was in September. I’m not sure whether one of the boys was on it or not.” He further said that neither he nor anyone in the government wanted to “get into an argument with two young men who have not seen their father in a long time but against whom there is no sanction to not see or not speak to their father”. At this point, Hakim pointed out that Zaidi had not answered any of her questions, to which he said he could not respond if she did not let him. “Your questions are coming from a place of genuinely seeking the truth and seeking justice … I think that these are honest people who are dealing with bad information. And so what I’m trying to do is provide you information but you don’t let me get all of it out,” he said.

      "title_orig": "Trump adds 7 countries, including Syria, to full travel ban list",
      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday expanded a list of countries subject to a full travel ban, prohibiting citizens from an additional seven countries, including Syria, from entering the country. The White House said in a statement that Trump signed a proclamation “expanding and strengthening entry restrictions on nationals from countries with demonstrated, persistent, and severe deficiencies in screening, vetting, and information-sharing to protect the Nation from national security and public safety threats”. Tuesday’s move banned citizens from Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, Syria and those holding Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents. The action also imposes a full ban on Laos and Sierra Leone, which had previously only been subject to partial restrictions. The White House said the expanded ban goes into effect on January 1. The action comes despite Trump’s vow to do everything he could to make Syria successful after landmark talks in November with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who until recently was sanctioned by Washington as a foreign terrorist. Trump has backed Sharaa, whose visit capped a stunning year for the rebel-turned-ruler who toppled longtime autocratic leader Bashar al-Assad and has since traveled the world trying to depict himself as a moderate leader who wants to unify his war-ravaged nation and end its decades of international isolation. But in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump vowed “very serious retaliation” after the US military said two US Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed in Syria by a suspected Islamic State attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead. He described the incident in remarks to reporters as a “terrible” attack. The White House cited visa overstay rates for Syria in its justification for the ban. “Syria is emerging from a protracted period of civil unrest and internal strife. While the country is working to address its security challenges in close coordination with the United States, Syria still lacks an adequate central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures,” the White House said. US adds more nations to partial restrictions list Trump signed a proclamation in June banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats. The bans apply to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travelers. The travel ban remains on those twelve countries, the White House said. Trump also added partial restrictions and entry limitations on an additional 15 countries, including Nigeria, which is under scrutiny from Trump, who in early November threatened military action over the treatment of Christians in the country. Nigeria says claims that Christians face persecution misrepresent a complex security situation and do not take into account efforts to safeguard religious freedom. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. The expansion of the countries subject to entry restrictions marks a further escalation of immigration measures the administration has taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last month. Investigators say the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define the term.",

While the country is working to address its security challenges in close coordination with the United States, Syria still lacks an adequate central authority for issuing passports or civil documents and does not have appropriate screening and vetting measures,” the White House said. US adds more nations to partial restrictions list Trump signed a proclamation in June banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats. The bans apply to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travelers. The travel ban remains on those twelve countries, the White House said. Trump also added partial restrictions and entry limitations on an additional 15 countries, including Nigeria, which is under scrutiny from Trump, who in early November threatened military action over the treatment of Christians in the country. Nigeria says claims that Christians face persecution misrepresent a complex security situation and do not take into account efforts to safeguard religious freedom. Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border. The expansion of the countries subject to entry restrictions marks a further escalation of immigration measures the administration has taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last month. Investigators say the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement programme under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting. Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define the term.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: White House chief of staff Susie Wiles revealed internal tensions in the Trump administration over issues from immigration enforcement to government downsizing in comments published by Vanity Fair on Tuesday that paint an unflattering picture of the role played by some of President Donald Trump’s close aides. In a series of 11 interviews with author Chris Whipple conducted over Trump’s first year back in office, Wiles, the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff, described the teetotaling president as having “an alcoholic’s personality” and an eye for vengeance against perceived enemies. She also said Vice President J D Vance has “been a conspiracy theorist for a decade” and described his shift from Trump critic to supporter as “sort of political”, motivated by his Senate campaign rather than principle. In a post on X, Wiles called the Vanity Fair story “a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest president, White House staff, and cabinet in history”, saying it omitted important context and selectively quoted her to create a negative narrative. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also responded on X, saying Wiles is a loyal and trusted adviser to Trump, and the administration fully supports her. Vance defended Wiles, telling reporters in Pennsylvania that he admires her consistency and authenticity both in and out of the president’s presence. “I’ve never seen her be disloyal to the president of the United States and that makes her the best White House chief of staff the president could ask for,” he said. According to Susie Wiles, the magazine omitted context and quoted her selectively to create a ‘negative narrative’ In the interviews, Susie Wiles took aim at the way billionaire Elon Musk dismantled the US Agency for International Development and how Attorney General Pam Bondi initially responded to the planned release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Wiles said she warned Trump against pardoning the most violent participants in the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and pressed him to delay his decision on sweeping trade tariffs, but was unable to change his mind in either case. She said the administration should have applied greater scrutiny to the deportation of immigrants in the country illegally to avoid errors. “He has an alcoholic’s personality,” Wiles said of Trump, explaining that her upbringing with an alcoholic father prepared her for managing “big personalities”. Trump does not drink, she noted, but operates with “a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing”. In the interviews, Wiles said Bondi “completely whiffed” her early handling of the Epstein files, an issue that upset Trump’s right-wing base. Bondi had initially suggested she was going to release incriminating information about Epstein’s alleged network of acquaintances but then backed off. Bondi said on X that Wiles works tirelessly to advance Trump’s agenda with loyalty, adding that any effort to sow division within the administration would not succeed and that the team remains united. Susie Wiles said in the interviews that she had read the Epstein documents and acknowledged that Trump’s name is in them, but that “he’s not in the file doing anything awful”. Trump’s push to have New York Attorney General Letitia James prosecuted on allegations of mortgage fraud was perhaps motivated by feelings of vengeance against the Democratic official, Wiles said. The case against James, a Trump critic, “was maybe the one retribution”, Wiles said. She added that while Trump may not wake up thinking about retribution, “when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it”. Published in Dawn, December 17th, 2025",

So far this year around 2.5 million Afghans have returned to the country, the UN’s special representative Georgette Gagnon told a Security Council briefing in New York last week. That represents “a six per cent population increase, compounding the deep-rooted economic, climate and humanitarian crises the country already faces”, she said. Citing Afghanistan’s “deepening humanitarian crisis”, Amnesty said there is an increased “real risk of serious harm for returnees”. The organisation said that nations must comply with international law that “prohibits the forcible return of anyone to a place where they face a real risk of grave human rights violations”. Generations of Afghans have fled to Pakistan and Iran over decades of successive wars, meaning that many young people have never lived in the country. But Pakistan and Iran began forcing them to leave in recent years, with Islamabad alleging the population includes “terrorists and criminals”. Amnesty also cited media reports that “Germany, Austria, and the European Union are in negotiations with the de facto Taliban authorities to facilitate forced returns”. Many of the newcomers to Afghanistan are shunned and unable to find jobs, while women and girls face severe restrictions under the Taliban. “This rush to forcibly return people to Afghanistan ignores why they fled in the first place and the serious dangers they face if sent back,” said Smriti Singh, Amnesty’s South Asia director.

      "summary_orig": "Water cannons were again used early on Wednesday to disperse PTI protesters staging a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, after his family was denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Imran’s sisters, party workers and supporters had staged a sit-in at Factory Naka, demanding their court-mandated meeting with the PTI founder. A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in , which was later dispersed with water cannons. Early on Wednesday, water cannons were again used to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2am. Initially, water cannon vehicles were used to disperse the protesters, with police later baton-charging those who remained. Some of the party workers were arrested but the number could not be confirmed. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir, who remained at the protest until late Tuesday night, condemned the inhuman treatment meted out to the protesters. Meanwhile, in a post on social media platform X at 4am on Wednesday, the party’s central information department said that it condemned “in the harshest possible terms” the disregard of the IHC order and the “extreme state brutality” witnessed outside Adiala jail. “These actions are not merely administrative failures; they constitute a direct assault on the Constitution, the rule of law, and the authority of the judiciary,” the party said, adding that the “willful defiance of judicial orders has effectively become official government policy”. “At the behest of the government, the Punjab police crossed all limits of oppression by launching an assault using chemical-laced water cannons against Imran Khan’s sisters, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, other party leaders, PTI workers, and peaceful sit-in participants,” the party said. “There was no emergency situation, no legal justification, and no provocation whatsoever. Despite this, women, elderly individuals, and peaceful protesters were subjected to chemical-infused water, physical violence, and the forcible arrest of multiple workers. This represents a textbook case of fascism, police brutality, and political victimisation at its worst,” it added. The PTI said that such actions “clearly reflect the panic, insecurity, and moral bankruptcy of a deeply frightened government”. It further said that such “oppression, repression, and fascism cannot last forever”. “History bears witness that no matter how powerful tyranny may appear, it ultimately meets its end. The day will surely come when those responsible for these unconstitutional, illegal, and inhumane actions will be held fully accountable,” it added. A video posted by the party on X showed a water cannon being used to disperse what appeared to be protesters as a large contingent of police stood on the side. Another video posted by a party showed what appeared to be a drenched protester, saying that his “chest was burning” and his eyes were also affected. In a separate video, Aleema, whose clothes were also drenched, looked at her hands and said, “They used a chemical, it is [burning] so much.” “Poisonous, chemical-laced water was used,” party lawyer Naeem Panjutha said on X. He said that the water cannon was unleashed on the protesters, including Imran’s sisters and others. “I myself fell; many workers fell; several were also arrested,” he said. During the sit-in, some of the demonstrators had scrawled pro-PTI messaging on the walls of petrol pumps and other structures near the protest site. Some of the messages included the number “804”, which is reportedly Imran’s prisoner number. Pro-PTI messaging is written on walls near Factory Naka in Rawalpindi on December 16. — Screengrab via author. ‘Have no other option left besides protesting’ On Tuesday, Imran’s sisters had marched toward the prison before being stopped. Speaking to a reporter as she marched, Aleema said, “We will sit wherever we are stopped”. When asked if she had prepared for the deployment of water cannons or a prolonged sit-in, she replied that she had brought warm clothes and a blanket, showing the latter on camera. Speaking to reporters, Aleema stated that this occurred every Tuesday at the same location, maintaining that the protesters were not engaging in any illegal or unconstitutional activities. “We have no other option left besides protesting,” she said. “Our founder’s demand is the restoration of the Constitution, democracy and the rule of law.” She claimed that the judiciary had been stripped of independence, unemployment was rising due to the stoppage of trade with Afghanistan and that the security situation was deteriorating. Referring to her sister Uzma’s brief meeting with Imran on December 2 and the government’s claim of “political conversations” that violated jail rules, Aleema urged the government to inform the family what was discussed. “Tell me what political matters my sister discussed in the last meeting. Political topics should be discussed with the people of the party,” she said. Asked about a recent AI (artificial intelligence)-generated image of Imran in prison, which went viral, Aleema acknowledged she was not aware of artificial intelligence, but maintained that he looked the same as the person in the photograph as recently as October. “Until two months ago, when we used to go visit the jail, the founder used to look exactly like this,” she said. “It may be AI, but it is the right AI. “I don’t know what the prison looks like from the inside, but I can say that Imran Khan looked like this on October 16, the last time we met,” Aleema added. She said that Imran told Uzma during their meeting that “the mental torture is far worse than the physical torture” and that he is being kept in solitary confinement. “They think he will break, but Imran Khan is a man with faith in God. He will not break,” Aleema emphasised. “Imran Khan has said he is ready to accept death, but he will not be subdued by cruelty and injustice.” She added that the government wants Imran to cut a deal with them, but insisted that he is not imprisoned for himself, but for the supremacy of the Constitution and rule of law. Naeem Haider Panjhuta, Imran’s spokesperson on legal affairs, filmed a video from the site of the sit-in, showing crowds of PTI workers staging the demonstration into this evening. “We are waiting for a meeting with Khan sahib . Today is the designated day for family and lawyers to meet him,” he said. “They are not letting us meet him, despite the IHC court order and visits being permitted in the jail manual.” PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who was also present at the sit-in, urged everyone to come and join the demonstration and express solidarity with the sisters of the party founder. “This is not only the job of the assembly members,” he said. “How can these people (the government) tell someone what they can and cannot discuss in a meeting?” However, the party’s secretary general gave a fiery response to a question, asking, “Do you think 20-30,000 people can overthrow a system that has been in place for the past 78 years? “We are calling out to the entire nation. We do not want to carry on this drama for another day, after which people will die,” Raja said. “We will make a conscious effort and will not submit to pressure.” He added that people’s consciences need to be shaken to ensure Imran’s release and said that the moment would come when hundreds of thousands of people would take to the streets. Meanwhile, Noreen Niazi told reporters that the PTI is a peaceful political party and claimed that they had been “injured” by the water cannons deployed last week. She added that they would “do whatever is necessary to free Imran Khan” and maintained that he was unlawfully imprisoned. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition. However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health. In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.” She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes. Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards. Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”",

      "summary_en": "Water cannons were again used early on Wednesday to disperse PTI protesters staging a sit-in near Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, after his family was denied a meeting with the ex-premier. Imran’s sisters, party workers and supporters had staged a sit-in at Factory Naka, demanding their court-mandated meeting with the PTI founder. A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in , which was later dispersed with water cannons. Early on Wednesday, water cannons were again used to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2am. Initially, water cannon vehicles were used to disperse the protesters, with police later baton-charging those who remained. Some of the party workers were arrested but the number could not be confirmed. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir, who remained at the protest until late Tuesday night, condemned the inhuman treatment meted out to the protesters. Meanwhile, in a post on social media platform X at 4am on Wednesday, the party’s central information department said that it condemned “in the harshest possible terms” the disregard of the IHC order and the “extreme state brutality” witnessed outside Adiala jail. “These actions are not merely administrative failures; they constitute a direct assault on the Constitution, the rule of law, and the authority of the judiciary,” the party said, adding that the “willful defiance of judicial orders has effectively become official government policy”. “At the behest of the government, the Punjab police crossed all limits of oppression by launching an assault using chemical-laced water cannons against Imran Khan’s sisters, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, other party leaders, PTI workers, and peaceful sit-in participants,” the party said. “There was no emergency situation, no legal justification, and no provocation whatsoever. Despite this, women, elderly individuals, and peaceful protesters were subjected to chemical-infused water, physical violence, and the forcible arrest of multiple workers. This represents a textbook case of fascism, police brutality, and political victimisation at its worst,” it added. The PTI said that such actions “clearly reflect the panic, insecurity, and moral bankruptcy of a deeply frightened government”. It further said that such “oppression, repression, and fascism cannot last forever”. “History bears witness that no matter how powerful tyranny may appear, it ultimately meets its end. The day will surely come when those responsible for these unconstitutional, illegal, and inhumane actions will be held fully accountable,” it added. A video posted by the party on X showed a water cannon being used to disperse what appeared to be protesters as a large contingent of police stood on the side. Another video posted by a party showed what appeared to be a drenched protester, saying that his “chest was burning” and his eyes were also affected. In a separate video, Aleema, whose clothes were also drenched, looked at her hands and said, “They used a chemical, it is [burning] so much.” “Poisonous, chemical-laced water was used,” party lawyer Naeem Panjutha said on X. He said that the water cannon was unleashed on the protesters, including Imran’s sisters and others. “I myself fell; many workers fell; several were also arrested,” he said. During the sit-in, some of the demonstrators had scrawled pro-PTI messaging on the walls of petrol pumps and other structures near the protest site.

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Amid negotiations between goods transporters and government departments to resolve a nationwide strike that has entered its 10th day, industrialists warned on Tuesday that each passing day was adding billions of rupees in trade and export losses . Transporters said talks were underway with representatives of the federal and Punjab governments and relevant departments, including the ministries of ports and shipping and communications, the motorway pol­i­ce, the National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) and senior officials of the Fede­ral Board of Revenue (FBR) and Customs. They claimed the federal and Punjab governments had ackno­wledged that their demands were justified. The negotiations were continuing late into the night and were ongoing at the time of going to press, officials said. Earlier, transporters said the strike would continue until their dema­nds were accepted. The Transp­orters’ Goods Association (TGA) also told a Sindh government committee at the Commissioner’s Office in Karachi that the shutdown would remain in place until issues raised in its charter of demands were addressed. The demands include designated parking for goods carriers near Karachi Port Trust (KPT), and matters related to licensing and the plying of 25- to 30-year-old vehicles. Industrialists urge PM to end goods transport shutdown as containers pile up Patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMEA) Muhammad Jawed Bilwani described the halt in port activity as “economic sabotage” and said the strike had disrupted the national supply chain, pushing exports and imports towards a standstill. He warned that exporters were being forced to consider costly and risky air consignments to meet delivery schedules and insisted that continued inaction could cause “heavy and irreparable” damage to the economy. Mr Bilwani said port operations had come to a halt, leaving thousands of export and import containers stranded, while several hundred containers already loaded on vessels remained at sea, awaiting berthing space. He cited Pakistan’s average daily exports at $92 million and monthly exports at $2.849 billion, adding that the textile sector alone accounted for $52m in daily exports and around $1.617bn per month. He urged the prime minister to take notice and intervene to end the strike, saying it was necessary to protect exports and domestic commerce from further damage. Atif Ikram Sheikh, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the transport strike was having serious negative consequences and freight forwarding at ports had been severely affected. He said imported goods were stuck at ports and exporters were unable to dispatch orders on time. Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Muhammad Ikram Rajput said the delay in resolving issues between transporters and authorities had become unbearable for the industry. He said businesses were already grappling with high energy costs, elevated interest rates and weak demand, and the collapse of transport services had added further pressure. Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PLGMEA) Chairman Nadeem Bukhari said that while efforts to improve road safety and regulatory compliance were welcome, the sudden disruption in freight movement had created significant operational challenges for export-oriented industries. Medicine supplies disrupted The strike has also begun disrupting the supply of essential medicines across the country, with shortages reported in several cities and towns as pharmaceutical products from major manufacturing hubs fail to reach pharmacies, medical stores and healthcare facilities, industry and market representatives said. They said medicines produced in Karachi and Lahore were not being transported to other parts of the country, warning that a prolonged disruption could create serious difficulties for patients, particularly those suffering from chronic illnesses. Tauqeerul Haq of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said pharmaceutical companies had received reports of shortages from different regions as manufacturers were unable to dispatch products from industrial centres. He said stocks of medicines used for diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and mental health conditions were running low, while demand had risen due to a flu outbreak. He added that many manufacturers had slowed or stopped production as warehouses reached capacity and finished goods could not be moved, while raw materials required for production were also failing to reach factories. Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, also stressed that transporters were not delivering medicines to different parts of the country and pharmacists were receiving complaints from patients unable to find essential drugs. Balochistan has been the worst-affected province, according to Malik Roohullah Kakar, president of the Medicines Traders Association of Balochistan. He said that around 80 per cent of medicines used in the province are supplied from Karachi, and the transporters’ strike had led to shortages in Quetta and other towns across Balochistan.

Transporters said talks were underway with representatives of the federal and Punjab governments and relevant departments, including the ministries of ports and shipping and communications, the motorway pol­i­ce, the National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) and senior officials of the Fede­ral Board of Revenue (FBR) and Customs. They claimed the federal and Punjab governments had ackno­wledged that their demands were justified. The negotiations were continuing late into the night and were ongoing at the time of going to press, officials said. Earlier, transporters said the strike would continue until their dema­nds were accepted. The Transp­orters’ Goods Association (TGA) also told a Sindh government committee at the Commissioner’s Office in Karachi that the shutdown would remain in place until issues raised in its charter of demands were addressed. The demands include designated parking for goods carriers near Karachi Port Trust (KPT), and matters related to licensing and the plying of 25- to 30-year-old vehicles. Industrialists urge PM to end goods transport shutdown as containers pile up Patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMEA) Muhammad Jawed Bilwani described the halt in port activity as “economic sabotage” and said the strike had disrupted the national supply chain, pushing exports and imports towards a standstill. He warned that exporters were being forced to consider costly and risky air consignments to meet delivery schedules and insisted that continued inaction could cause “heavy and irreparable” damage to the economy. Mr Bilwani said port operations had come to a halt, leaving thousands of export and import containers stranded, while several hundred containers already loaded on vessels remained at sea, awaiting berthing space. He cited Pakistan’s average daily exports at $92 million and monthly exports at $2.849 billion, adding that the textile sector alone accounted for $52m in daily exports and around $1.617bn per month. He urged the prime minister to take notice and intervene to end the strike, saying it was necessary to protect exports and domestic commerce from further damage. Atif Ikram Sheikh, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the transport strike was having serious negative consequences and freight forwarding at ports had been severely affected. He said imported goods were stuck at ports and exporters were unable to dispatch orders on time. Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Muhammad Ikram Rajput said the delay in resolving issues between transporters and authorities had become unbearable for the industry. He said businesses were already grappling with high energy costs, elevated interest rates and weak demand, and the collapse of transport services had added further pressure. Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PLGMEA) Chairman Nadeem Bukhari said that while efforts to improve road safety and regulatory compliance were welcome, the sudden disruption in freight movement had created significant operational challenges for export-oriented industries. Medicine supplies disrupted The strike has also begun disrupting the supply of essential medicines across the country, with shortages reported in several cities and towns as pharmaceutical products from major manufacturing hubs fail to reach pharmacies, medical stores and healthcare facilities, industry and market representatives said. They said medicines produced in Karachi and Lahore were not being transported to other parts of the country, warning that a prolonged disruption could create serious difficulties for patients, particularly those suffering from chronic illnesses. Tauqeerul Haq of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said pharmaceutical companies had received reports of shortages from different regions as manufacturers were unable to dispatch products from industrial centres. He said stocks of medicines used for diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and mental health conditions were running low, while demand had risen due to a flu outbreak. He added that many manufacturers had slowed or stopped production as warehouses reached capacity and finished goods could not be moved, while raw materials required for production were also failing to reach factories. Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, also stressed that transporters were not delivering medicines to different parts of the country and pharmacists were receiving complaints from patients unable to find essential drugs. Balochistan has been the worst-affected province, according to Malik Roohullah Kakar, president of the Medicines Traders Association of Balochistan. He said that around 80 per cent of medicines used in the province are supplied from Karachi, and the transporters’ strike had led to shortages in Quetta and other towns across Balochistan.
