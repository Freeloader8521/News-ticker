      "summary_orig": "An Indian national was charged with an assault on a flight travelling from Chicago to Germany, according to a press release issued by the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday. The DoJ stated that Praneeth Kumar Usiripalli, 28, stabbed two teenagers with a metal fork and was arrested on October 25 after the flight was diverted to Boston. He was charged in the US District Court with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm. “According to the charging documents, on October 25, 2025, while on board Lufthansa flight 431 en route from Chicago to Frankfurt, Germany, Usiripalli allegedly stabbed a 17-year-old male passenger (Minor A) in the shoulder area with a metal fork,” the statement read. “Usiripalli then allegedly stabbed a second 17-year-old male passenger (Minor B) in the back of the head with the same metal fork.” The DoJ said that when flight crew members attempted to subdue Usiripalli, he reportedly raised his hand, formed a gun with his fingers, put it in his mouth and pulled an imaginary trigger. “Immediately afterwards, Usiripalli allegedly turned toward a female passenger to his left and slapped her with his hand. Usiripalli also allegedly attempted to slap a flight crew member,” the statement read. “As a result of the disturbance, the flight was diverted to Boston Logan International Airport, where Usiripalli was immediately taken into custody.” The department added that while Usiripalli was admitted to the US on a student visa, it added that he presently does not have any legal status in the country. “The charge of assault with a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm while travelling on an aircraft in the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States provides for a sentence of up to 10 years in prison, up to three years of supervised release, and a fine of up to $250,000,” the statement read.",

      "summary_orig": "At least six suspects were killed in four separate encounters with the Crime Control Department (CCD) in different locations of Lahore late on Monday, the CCD said on Tuesday. Earlier this year, the Punjab government launched the CCD with a mandate to tackle organised crime, terrorism, and high-profile criminal gangs. Recently, the body has carried out a range of encounters. Officials have publicly praised the department for its successes, claiming it has “significantly reduced street crime and targeted major criminal figures.” As per a statement issued by the department’s spokesperson today, “CCD teams conducted four different encounters in Lahore’s Nishtar Colony, Green Town, Harbanspura, and Ring Road, where six suspects were killed.” In the first instance, in Nishtar Colony, the CCD team came under attack while they were out to arrest the suspects, the statement said. “An exchange of fire ensued, leaving two suspects dead by their associates’ fire,” the CCD said, adding that the “deceased had been involved in theft, previous encounters with the police, murder, and attempted murder.” In a separate incident that took place in Green Town, a detained suspect was killed by his own associates, it said, adding that two suspects were killed in an encounter on Ring Road as they were attempting to rob citizens, it added. The CCD spokesperson said, “The suspects opened fire on the police team. Two were killed while another two managed to escape.” In the fourth encounter that took place in the Harbasnpura area, one of the suspects died after sustaining severe injuries during an exchange of fire with the police, the statement said. “The injured suspect was taken to the hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries,” the CCD added. Rising number of ‘encounters’ The mounting death toll during the encounters has sparked concerns among legal experts and civil society. On October 14, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed deep alarm at the “growing normalisation” of police encounters, a pattern it says has become entrenched since the establishment of CCD as a special wing of the Punjab Police in February 2025. The rights body highlighted that the “trend undermines the rule of law and constitutional guarantees of due process.” According to data compiled by the HRCP, the province has witnessed more than 500 alleged encounters since January 2025, resulting in over 670 fatalities — a figure higher than in any other province. Human rights monitors allege that extrajudicial killings are being used as a substitute for the criminal justice system. Critics argue that the encounters often follow a similar narrative: a suspect is located, they open fire on police, and are subsequently killed in the ensuing shootout, leaving no possibility for arrest, investigation, or trial.",

The FII9 convened global leaders, investors, policymakers, and innovators to explore the theme, ‘The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth’ and discuss key topics such as innovation, sustainability, economic inclusion, and geopolitical shifts. “As part of the framework, several strategic and high-impact projects will be discussed in the economic, trade, investment and development fields that will contribute to strengthening cooperation between the two governments, enhancing the pivotal role of the private sector, and increasing trade exchange between the two countries,” the statement read. It added that the deal would prioritise sectors including energy, industry, mining, information technology, tourism, agriculture and food security. Additionally, Islamabad and Riyadh are studying several joint economic projects, including signing memoranda of understanding (MoU) for an electricity interconnection project between the two countries and cooperation in the energy field. “This framework represents an extension of both countries’ efforts to strengthen their fraternal relations and reaffirms their shared vision toward building a sustainable partnership across various economic, trade and investment fields in a manner that fulfils the aspirations of their leaderships and the brotherly peoples of both nations and serves their mutual interests,” the statement read.

At this point in time, we are undertaking most robust changes and deeprooted reforms which are deeply required,” the premier said, pointing to the digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue to tackle corruption. The prime minister said Pakistan was among the countries that were most exposed to the effects of climate change through no fault of theirs, adding that the country’s carbon emissions were “less than a fraction of one per cent”. PM Shehbaz said Pakistan was stuck in a loop of climbing the ladder and coming back down due to repeat climate disasters such as the floods of 2022 and this year. “This is not acceptable. This is not where humanity should be directed towards. It has to be mutual cooperation,” he said, adding that loans alone were not the solution. The premier said that if humanity was to move forward, it would have to do so in unison while sharing its “bounties and grievances together”. He said his government would turn Pakistan around with untiring efforts and making the best of its available resources. PM Shehbaz also said that Pakistan was fast moving towards the increasing adoption of technology and artificial intelligence, though he did also warn about the risks of the latter.

      "summary_orig": "United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday again stated that seven aircraft were shot down during the brief military escalation between Pakistan and India in May. Addressing a dinner with business leaders during his trip to Japan, Trump claimed that a lot of the wars he stopped were because of his tariffs imposed on multiple countries, stating that he did “a great service to the world”. “If you look at India and Pakistan, they were going at it,” he said. “Seven brand-new, beautiful planes were shot down. “I said to [Indian] Prime Minister Modi and I said to the Prime Minister [Shehbaz Sharif], very nice man, a very good man and the Field Marshal [Asim Munir] over in Pakistan … I said, ‘look we’re not going to do any trade if you’re going to be fighting’,” Trump said. “We said ‘no, we’re not doing any deals if you’re going to fight’ and within 24 hours that was the end of that. It was amazing, actually,” he added. “I think trade is responsible for 70 per cent of the fact that we didn’t have wars.” The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire . In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale . New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Tuesday said that the Peshawar corps commander visited the CM Secretariat earlier to “congratulate” him. The CM shared this information while speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court, where he was also asked what the two had discussed during the meeting. “He came to congratulate me, and it was not an official [exchange]. The conversation was unofficial. And our stance is the same [everywhere], what we say inside is what we say outside,” Afridi replied. Responding to a follow-up question, he further explained that he was the chief executive of a province and even the inspector general of police and the chief secretary had visited his office. Similarly, he continued, “the corps commander will also come there, and the officers of all of our security institutions will also come. We will discuss matters pertaining to the province with them.” Apparently referring to security officials, he said they should visit the chief ministers and the prime minister’s office instead of the office holders going to them. The CM also stressed that his government’s stance would be the same as that of the PTI and its incarcerated founder, Imran Khan. Imran, who was has been in jail since 2023, had blamed former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa for an alleged conspiracy that resulted in his ouster as the prime minister via a no-confidence vote in April 2022. Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him. Meanwhile, several PTI supporters have also been facing military trials and convictions following violent protests on May 9, 2023, over Imran’s arrest, during which civilian and military properties and installations were vandalised. The PTI has also been opposing military operations in KP, even though Afridi’s immediate predecessor as the provincial chief executive, Ali Amin Gandapur, had deviated from the party line in the past and justified the use of mortar shells, drones and fighter jets against terrorists as the constitutional right of the military. Gandapur was removed as the CM earlier this month on Imran’s directive while the PTI had named Afridi as his potential replacement. Later, Afridi was elected as the CM on October 13. Three days before his election, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had addressed a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters. He was asked on the occasion about the Pakistan government’s past engagement with the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and the change in the KP leadership. In his response, the DG ISPR had said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists)? […] Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations? ‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations? It is for everyone to see that today […] who is that person and the political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’ Regarding another question about the change in KP leadership and how it might signal a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR stated that the establishment is itself a part of the state. “Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’ ‘Courts held hostage’ Speaking outside the SC today, KP CM Afridi alleged that courts had been “held hostage” since April 9, 2022, when Imran was ousted as the premier . “We are firmly standing alongside the judges who want to deliver justice,” he said, regretting that a superintended was disregarding judges’ directives — an apparent reference to relevant authorities not allowing him to meet Imran in jail despite court orders. He said his name was in the visitor’s list for Imran today, adding that if he was denied a meeting even today, he would wait for the court’s decision.",

      "summary_orig": "Islamabad High Court (IHC) Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro on Tuesday recused himself from hearing the case challenging the eligibility of Justice Tariq Meh­mo­­od Jahangiri. A complaint pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake law degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council last year in July, while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC last year. The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s degree. Today, a two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Soomro, took up a miscellaneous application filed by the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) seeking to become a party in the matter. During the proceedings, Justice Soomro recused himself from hearing the case, following which the bench stood dissolved, and the hearing was adjourned without any further proceedings. His decision comes after a division bench hearing a writ petition filed by Advocate Mian Daw­o­­od, which questioned the legitimacy of Jus­ti­­ce Jahangiri’s LLB degree, was reconstituted . Justice Mohammad Azam Khan was previously part of the bench led by Justice Dogar. It may be recalled that Justice Jahangiri is one of the five judges who challenged the transfer of Justice Dogar, as well as of two other judges — Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif — to the IHC. In its application, the IBA argued that fair and transparent adjudication of the pending writ petition would be impossible without hearing the bar as a party, since the issues involved are of “fundamental importance” to the legal fraternity and the rule of law. The lawyers’ body emphasised that under its Memorandum of Association (2016), it is mandated to safeguard the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and civil liberties. It further maintained that the bar has historically been at the forefront of struggles for constitutional supremacy and must therefore be heard in this matter. The plea recalled that the bar’s functions include facilitating its members in the performance of their professional duties, protecting their interests, and maintaining high standards of integrity and ethical conduct. “The Islamabad Bar is resolute in shielding the superior judiciary from attacks, whether internal or external, and in striving for the supremacy of the Constitution,” the application stated. Case developments On September 16, a division bench comprising Justices Dogar passed an interim order restraining Justice Jahan­giri from performing his judicial functions. The judge then filed an appeal against the decision before the Supreme Court in person. Subsequently, the restraining order, issued without notice to the respondent, was suspended by a five-member Constitutional Bench of the SC on September 29. The next day, the bench set aside the IHC ruling, declaring it “ null and void ”. The bench led by Justice Aminuddin Khan observed that no sitting judge could be barred from performing judicial duties through an interim order of a high court. Four days earlier, the Sindh High Court (SHC) extended its earlier interim order suspending the KU syndicate’s decision to cancel Justice Jahangiri’s law degree. A two-judge bench of the SHC headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro stated that the interim order would continue till November 27 after federal and provincial law officers again sought more time to file comments. Advocate Mian Dawood’s petition against Justice Jahangiri, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a writ of quo warranto (by what authority) against him — a jurisdiction rarely invoked in such circumstances. It argues that his foundational qualification for judicial office — an LLB degree from KU — is “invalid”, thereby rendering his entire legal career and subsequent appointment illegitimate. The key allegations in the petition include the use of dual enrollment numbers, as the record shows two different enrollment numbers for Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I and Part-II examinations. The KU has previously stated that it is “impossible to allot two enrollment numbers to a student for one programme”. The petition argued that the appointment of a judge without the requisite legal qualification is not just an administrative error, but a violation of the fundamental rights of all citizens. Days before the controversy over his degree initially surfaced, Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions against alleged rigging in all three constituencies of Islamabad.",

Melissa is moving \ntoward the north-northeast near 7 mph (11 km/h). A turn toward the \nnortheast with an increase in forward speed is expected later today, \nfollowed by a faster northeastward motion on Wednesday and Thursday. \nOn the forecast track, the core of Melissa is expected to make \nlandfall on Jamaica during the next several hours, move across \nsoutheastern Cuba Wednesday morning, and move across the \nsoutheastern or central Bahamas later on Wednesday.\n \nMaximum sustained winds are near 175 mph (280 km/h) with higher\ngusts.  Melissa is a category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson\nHurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected \nbefore Melissa makes landfall on Jamaica. Melissa is expected to \nreach Jamaica and southeastern Cuba as an extremely dangerous major \nhurricane, and it will still be at hurricane strength when it moves \nacross the southeastern Bahamas.\n \nHurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from\nthe center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 195\nmiles (315 km). During the past few hours, Norman Manley \nInternational Airport in Kingston, Jamaica, reported a sustained \nwind of 43 mph (69 km/h) and a gust of 59 mph (93 km/h). Also \nduring the past few hours, Sangster International Airport in Montego \nBay, Jamaica, reported a sustained wind of 38 mph (61 km/h) and a \ngust of 54 mph (87 km/h).\n \nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 901 mb (26.61 inches). An \nAir Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft is enroute to \ninvestigate Melissa.\n \n \nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n----------------------\nKey messages for Melissa can be found in the Tropical Cyclone\nDiscussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.\n \nWIND: Tropical storm conditions are occurring in Jamaica, and\ncatastrophic hurricane-force winds are expected to begin during \nthe next few hours. Within the eyewall, total structural failure is \nlikely, especially in higher elevation areas where wind speeds atop \nand on the windward sides of hills and mountains could be up to 30 \npercent stronger.\n \nTropical storm conditions are expected to begin in eastern Cuba\ntoday, with hurricane conditions expected in the hurricane warning\narea starting tonight into Wednesday morning. Tropical storm\nconditions are expected in Haiti later today and Wednesday.\n \nHurricane conditions are expected in the southeastern and central\nBahamas on Wednesday. Tropical storm conditions are expected and\nhurricane conditions are possible in the Turks and Caicos Islands on\nWednesday.\n \nRAINFALL: Melissa is expected to bring rainfall of 15 to 30 inches\nto portions of Jamaica and additional rainfall of 6 to 12 inches for\nsouthern Hispaniola through Wednesday, with storm total local maxima\nof 40 inches possible. Catastrophic flash flooding and numerous\nlandslides are likely.\n \nFor eastern Cuba, storm total rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, with\nlocal amounts to 25 inches, is expected into Wednesday resulting in\nlife-threatening and potentially catastrophic flash flooding with\nnumerous landslides.\n \nOver the Southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos, rain is\nexpected to develop later today and continue into Wednesday. Total\nrainfall of 5 to 10 inches is expected to result in areas of flash\nflooding.\n \nFor a complete depiction of forecast rainfall associated with\nMelissa, please see the National Weather Service Storm Total\nRainfall Graphic, available at\nhurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?rainqpf\n \nSTORM SURGE: A life-threatening storm surge is likely along the\nsouth coast of Jamaica today. Peak storm surge heights could reach 9\nto 13 feet above ground level, near and to the east of where the\ncenter of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge will be\naccompanied by large and destructive waves. On the northwest coast\nof Jamaica, near Montego Bay, there is the possibility of 2 to 4\nfeet of storm surge above ground level.\n \nThere is a potential for significant storm surge along the southeast\ncoast of Cuba late today or Wednesday. Peak storm surge heights\ncould reach 7 to 11 feet above normal tide levels, near and to the\neast of where the center of Melissa makes landfall. This storm surge\nwill be accompanied by large and destructive waves.\n \nStorm surge of 4 to 6 ft above normally dry ground is possible in\nthe southeastern Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands on Wednesday.\n \nSURF: Swells generated by Melissa are expected to affect portions of\nHispaniola, Jamaica, eastern Cuba, and the Cayman Islands during the\nnext several days, likely causing life-threatening surf and rip\ncurrent conditions. These swells will reach the Bahamas, the Turks\nand Caicos Islands, and Bermuda later this week.

      "summary_orig": "A last-ditch effort is underway to salvage ongoing talks between Islamabad and Kabul, despite the Afghan Taliban’s “stubbornness”, security sources said on Tuesday. A second round of talks between the two sides had begun on Saturday in Istanbul. This followed the Pakistan-Afghanistan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on October 18-19 , which had resulted in a permanent ceasefire after days of intense border clashes. The Qatar talks had come after days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. The agreement reached in Doha extended an initial 48-hour truce and resulted in a permanent ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. “On the third day, the talks continued for 18 hours. During the 18 hours, the Afghan Taliban delegation repeatedly agreed to Pakistan’s logical and legitimate demand for credible and decisive action against the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and terrorism,” a well-placed security source said. They added that while the Afghan delegation acknowledged the central issue,  its position changed due to “instructions received from Kabul”. The security sources termed the “illogical and illegal advice received from Kabul” responsible for the “failure of the talks”. They affirmed that Pakistan and the hosts wanted to resolve the “complex issues in a very thoughtful and serious manner”. “A last-ditch effort is still underway, despite the Taliban’s stubbornness, to somehow resolve this issue through logic and talks and the talks are moving towards a final round,” the security official said. Earlier, sources familiar with the closed-door discussions said that while “most of the points had been mutually agreed between the two sides”, the mechanism for verifiable action against terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, particularly the outlawed TTP, continued to be the main sticking point. The atmosphere earlier yesterday had been markedly positive, with participants des­c­­ribing “encouraging progress” and “serious engagement” from both delegations. However, by nightfall, it appeared that the process had once again hit a roadblock. According to the participants, the Afghan Taliban delegation continued to resist putting anything in writing, especially on the issue of providing verifiable guarantees to end support for the TTP. “We kept hoping that we would be able to sign a mutual document with Afgha­nistan soon, followed by a joint statement, but it still remains out of our reach,” one source said yesterday. “The hosts understand Pakistan’s concerns,” one Pakistani official said, “but people in Kabul and Kandahar are not willing to commit“. “It is a difficult phase,” another source admitted, reflecting the growing sense of frustration within the room as stalemate persisted. “The Afghan side has made it clear that tensions benefit no one,” one member of the delegation said. “We are hopeful that these talks will produce a positive outcome.” Mediators from Turkiye and Qatar were said to share this sentiment. “Even if the talks didn’t produce a breakthrough, the fact that both sides stayed engaged for three straight days is important,” one mediator said. “It shows that neither wants the process to collapse.” The tone on Monday contrasted with the pessimism that followed Sunday’s nine-hour discussions, when Pakistani officials said Islamabad had presented its final position to the Taliban delegation. “Pakistan has made it clear that the ongoing patronage of terrorists by the Afghan Taliban is unacceptable,” a senior security official had said.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Adviser to the Nuclear Command Authority Lt Gen (retd) Mazhar Jamil said Pakistan would continue to pursue its policy of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus’ to reinforce strategic stability in South Asia, which has been undermined by great power politics and a technology bias in favour of India. Quid Pro Quo Plus is a military doctrine that entails a retaliatory response to Indian aggression exceeding the initial provocation in scale or severity. “Pakistan would continue to uphold its policy of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus,’ thereby reinforcing strategic stability in South Asia,” Gen Jamil said while addressing the concluding session of a three-day workshop hosted by the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) in Islamabad. “Pakistan,” he added, “stands fully prepared to respond to any act of aggression, strategic, operational, or tactical, with resolve and capability, ensuring the preservation of deterrence equilibrium in the region.” The statement follows an ongoing tense period this month, which revived brinkmanship last seen during India’s “Operation Sindoor” airstrikes in May. It also comes as Indian armed forces prepare for Exercise Trishul , a major drill from Oct. 30 to Nov 10 near the disputed Sir Creek region, with Indian officials warning of “overwhelming retaliation” against any cross-border terrorism. Jamil cautioned that global power politics were upsetting the regional balance of power. “Great power politics has facilitated a discriminatory transfer of advanced and emerging technologies to India, thereby undermining the strategic balance in South Asia,” he said. “Such preferential access is reshaping the regional security paradigm and transforming the nature and character of warfare across the region.” He said this international support has emboldened India’s actions. “Emboldened by these external enablers and strategic partnerships, India has increasingly exhibited adventurist tendencies, particularly evident in the post-Pahalgam incident,” he noted. Referring to a May confrontation between the two countries following the Pahalgam incident, Jamil said the episode “effectively challenged India’s misplaced notions of escalation dominance and escalation control”. Pakistan, he said, “once again demonstrated restraint and responsibility, reaffirming the credibility and maturity of its nuclear deterrence posture”. Jamil warned that India’s “Hindutva-driven nationalism” poses a “grave challenge to regional peace and strategic stability,” which he said reflects “the ideological and strategic imprint of Chanakya’s Mandala Theory” of power politics and regional dominance. “India’s increasingly offensive military doctrines, coupled with a culture of coercive behaviour, underscore both its intent and capability to project aggression in the region,” he cautioned.

      "summary_orig": "• Former ISI chief claims it was his own countrymen, not Pakistan, that handed Afghan envoy Mullah Zaeef over to the Americans • Retired Gen Ehsanul Haq says Zaeef insisted on remaining in Islamabad, despite warnings from Pakistani officials ISLAMABAD: Over 20 years after his now-infamous handover to American forces following their invasion of Afghan­istan, a former Pakistani spymaster has claimed that it was his own countrymen, and not Pakistan, that handed over former Taliban ambassador Abdus Salam Zaeef to the US. The claim, which comes in the midst of an escalating fracas with a resurgent Taliban in Kabul, was made by retired Gen Ehsanul Haq, who took over the reins of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) following the September 11, 2001 attacks. For years, it was believed that Zaeef — who was the Afghan Taliban regime’s envoy to Islam­abad at the time of the 9/11 atta­cks — was handed over to the Americans in violation of international law. In his book, My Life With The Taliban , the former envoy had asserted that he was given into US custody in Peshawar, and this account has never been publicly challenged by any Pakistani official. However, when asked about Zaeef’s claims during a recent seminar, the former four-star general recounted how the previous Taliban regime came to be ‘de-recognised’, and how Pakistani officials tried for months to convince the envoy to leave Islamabad to avoid the situation he later faced. Zaeef spent just under four years as a captive in the infamous US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, and was eventually released in 2005. When approached for comment, Zaeef said he rejected the former general’s statement. In his remarks at a recent seminar on Pakistan and Afgha­n­istan relations — organised by the Khyber Margalla Founda­tion, an Islamabad-based organisation of government servants, retired officials and professionals from Khyber Pakht­unkhwa — Gen Haq recalled that Zaeef was told that he should leave Islamabad. If he did not accept, he would be taken to Torkham and deported, the former general said. “When he was being flown in a helicopter, our people again told him that if you agree, we will drop you somewhere else rather than taking you to the border for deportation.” “Ultimately, he was taken to the Torkham border and asked to cross over. No one in Pakistan handed him over to the US. When he crossed… Afghan aut­h­orities arrested and han­d­ed him over to American forces. Then he was transferred to Guant­anamo. Pakistan has not done it,” the ex-ISI chief said. Although Pakistan had recognised the Taliban regime and accepted Zaeef as Kabul’s amb­a­ssador, the recognition was withdrawn in the wake of 9/11. The former spy chief — who has also served as the head of Military Intelligence and ret­ired as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee — recalled that despite the breakdown of ties, Zaeef continued to reside in the ambassador’s official residence, where the foreign media would remain camped out. He also recounted how Tali­ban leaders started leaving Afgh­anistan after the US began bombing Kabul in October 2001. They had plans to form a government-in-exile in Pakis­tan, with Zaeef as its head, he said. “A decision was made to ask Mullah Zaeef to leave Pakistan. There were five million Afghans living in Pakistan that time and we did not hand over any Afghan to the US,” he said. Gen Haq said Pakistani officials had advised Zaeef to move to a refugee camp, or any other place, to live as a common Afg­han and stop what he was doing. “This message was conveyed to him through the foreign ministry and other relevant govt functionaries.” However, the former ISI chief said, the erstwhile env­oy refused to leave Islamabad. “Our people would keep on ask­ing him for months to shift from Islamabad. Other countr­ies would also lodge protests that there are UN resolutions and Pa­­k­­istan had de-recognised the Af­g­han govt [but he is still] he is sitting in Islamabad,” he recalled.
