      "summary_orig": "An Indian fighter aircraft, the indigenously developed Tejas, crashed during a demonstration flight at the Dubai Air Show on Friday, a witness and officials told AFP . The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited Tejas jet crashed at about 2:10pm local time. A fireball was seen immediately after the aircraft impacted the ground, with thick black smoke rising from the site of the incident. In a post on X, the Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the death of the pilot in the incident. “An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at Dubai Air Show, today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident,” said the post. “IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief. A court of inquiry is being constituted, to ascertain the cause of the accident,” it added. View this post on Instagram Footage of the crash showed the fighter executing a low roll before crashing in flames about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from the show site. The Tejas, meaning “brilliance” in Hindi, is a domestically designed and built fighter jet that was commissioned into the Indian Air Force in 2016. The Tejas has been beset by design and other challenges and was once rejected by the Indian Navy as too heavy. The biennial airshow is being held at Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport from November 17-21. The show, according to its website , brought together over 1,500 exhibitors, 200 aircraft across flying and static displays, 12 conference tracks, and 450 global visionaries. This is the second known crash of the fighter jet, which is powered by General Electric (GE) engines. The first crash was during an exercise in India in 2024. The Tejas Mk-1A fighters are crucial for India’s efforts to bolster its air force’s depleting fighter squadrons and replace ageing jets in the face of China’s growing military strength and support for arch-rival Pakistan. The rollout of the fighter has been delayed due to slow deliveries from GE of 99 engines ordered in 2021, of which only four have arrived so far. GE has blamed supply chain issues following Covid-19. This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.",

Police officials told Dawn one among those killed was ‘good Taliban’ — a term used to refer to former militants who surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives. In their complaint to the police, the victims’ family has maintained that the attack was a result of a family feud. However, police say the family has taken the stance to avoid another potential attack carried out in retaliation. Peace committees, or village defence committees, were formed to assist law enforcement agencies in defending KP areas against terror attacks. These also include former militants, often referred to as ‘good Taliban’. Peace committee officials in KP have been targeted by terrorists in the past as well. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “strongly condemned” today’s attack, state-run APP reported. The prime minister expressed “deep grief and sorrow” over the loss of precious lives in the attack, which he said was carried out by “ Fitna-al-Khawarij ”. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term designated by the state for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP). APP , citing an official statement, reported that PM Shehbaz prayed for the “elevation of ranks of the departed souls in jannah (paradise) and for patience for their families”. He directed relevant authorities to identify those responsible and ensure they received due punishment, the report said. “Such cowardly acts, aimed at sabotaging peace efforts, expose the evil intentions of the Fitna-al-Khawarij to create unrest in Pakistan. These cowardly actions cannot, at any cost, weaken the resolve of the people. “The entire nation stands united to defeat anti-state elements,” the statement quoted him as saying. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack “carried out by *Fitna-al-Khawarij”,* a statement issued by his office said. “He expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life in the attack,” the statement said, adding that he also extended condolences to the bereaved families. The statement quoted him as saying: “This cowardly attack of terrorism is a nefarious attempt to undermine peace and stability. Such cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken the high morale of the people.

      "summary_orig": "Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb on Friday said she was “honoured” that members of the US Congressional Pakistan Caucus have recognised the provincial chief minister’s “bold vision” to mechanise brick kilns, end bonded labour and “peshgi” exploitation, and build a green, ethical and “investment-ready” brick kiln industry. Peshgi system is the commonly used term for the practice of debt bondage in Pakistan. Instead of just seeking wages in exchange for labour, poor workers take an advance from an employer (in cash or any other form) under the obligation to work for that employer until the debt is paid off. “Child labour at kilns, once a painful reality, was eliminated under a campaign initiated by [then chief minister] Shehbaz Sharif, neglected for [four] years, and now fully revived and strengthened by CM Maryam Nawaz,” Aurangzeb said in a post on X. The senior minister’s post highlighted that all brick kilns across Punjab have been geo-mapped, QR-coded, drone-surveyed and linked to a central monitoring dashboard. “Punjab is now also transitioning government construction towards block-based building, moving away from traditional kiln bricks,” she added, calling the development “not just reform” but a “human rights revolution”. According to a letter addressed to CM Maryam by Members of Congress Thomas R. Suozzi and Jack Bergman (shared by Aurangzeb on X), “the mechanisation and modernisation of this critical sector will not only support Pakistan in fulfilling its international obligations to end bonded [labour] but also position Punjab as a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment, particularly from American businesses committed to ethical and sustainable engagement”. The letter added that the progress is “vital” to enhancing bilateral economic relations and strengthening the overall Pakistan-US partnership, “fostering long-term growth and cooperation”. Moreover, it said that the province is “well-positioned to serve as a pilot province for this initiative”, setting a benchmark for the nation. “Modernising brick kilns is a critical step that will not only advance human rights but will also make Pakistan more attractive to long-term foreign investment,” stated the letter. Over 12.5 million children in Pakistan are involved in child labour, according to the Child Rights Movement National Secretariat. One in four households in Pakistan employs a child for domestic work, often in hazardous conditions, as per the International Labour Organisation. According to a provincial survey , working children accounted for 11.1 per cent of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s child population. On this year’s World Day Against Child Labour in June , President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged parents and employers to join forces in eliminating child labour.",

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter to his counterpart in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, has raised concerns over the alleged manhandling of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters by police and the obstruction of the incarcerated ex-premier’s visitation rights. The development comes after Afridi on Thursday was denied access to meet Imran for a seventh time. Further, two days ago police had allegedly manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with him. The letter, which was shared by the PTI on social media platform X early on Friday, said that Afridi wished to draw Maryam’s attention to “serious concerns” regarding the “administration of court-mandated visitation rights” of Imran and the recent treatment of his family members. “Clear and binding judicial directions govern Imran’s visitation schedule. These orders explicitly permit his close family members and nominated individuals to meet him on specified days. Despite the unambiguous nature of these instructions, repeated reports indicate persistent non-implementation by the authorities responsible for compliance,” Afridi said. He also termed accounts of the “inappropriate and rough treatment” of Imran’s sisters during a recent attempt to visit him as “particularly disturbing”. “These individuals are apolitical private citizens, seeking only to meet their brother in accordance with court permissions. Even if restrictions were to exist for political visitors — which is a different category altogether — there is no conceivable legal or administrative basis for obstructing or mishandling immediate family members whose presence is neither political nor disruptive in nature,” the KP chief minister said. “Their obstruction, physical restraint or temporary detention is therefore wholly unacceptable,” he said. Afridi said that such actions created a “clear impression” that judicial directives were being disregarded, and that jail and police authorities were not safeguarding or facilitating the rights of visitors. He urged Maryam to ensure a proper, safe and dignified waiting area for authorised visitors. “The current practice of stopping them nearly a kilometre away and compelling elderly family members — particularly women — to sit on roads is wholly inappropriate and must be discontinued,” he said. He said that the Punjab government should ensure the implementation of all court directives on visitation. He also called for identifying and holding individuals accountable for obstructing, insulting, or physically manhandling peaceful visitors, including Imran’s family and members of the KP cabinet. He said that the Punjab government should also issue instructions to the prison and police authorities to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Further, he called for establishing a mechanism ensuring that all future meetings were facilitated in an “orderly, respectful and legally compliant manner”. Afridi ended his letter by saying that Imran was a former prime minister and the leader of a political party he himself represented. “Any deviation from court-mandated procedures in his case, or any disrespectful treatment of his immediate family, becomes a matter of direct institutional concern,” he said, adding that he could not remain indifferent when Imran’s dignity and rights were being compromised. “I am therefore constrained to demand that these issues be addressed promptly, decisively and in full conformity with judicial directions,” he said. Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. On Thursday, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed concern over the reports of Imran’s sisters being “manhandled” and noted that the rights of prisoners’ families to meet their relatives and the right to peaceful assembly were protected under national and international human rights law. “HRCP calls for a transparent inquiry and urges authorities to ensure the rights, safety and dignity of all involved are fully respected,” it said in a post on X.",
