Explosions rocked the Iranian capital, Tehran, with satellite imagery showing extensive damage at the secure compound of the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. In a televised address, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, indicated that the strikes had killed Khamenei. Iran’s leader has not been heard from since the strikes began. “There are many signs that [Khamenei] is no longer alive,” Netanyahu said on Saturday evening. Netanyahu said that Israeli strikes had also killed “several leaders” involved in the Iranian nuclear programme and that strikes against sites linked to the programme would continue in the coming days. The remarks, which stopped short of confirming Khamenei’s death, were the strongest official indication yet that the missing leader is dead. Dozens of students were reportedly killed in a strike on a primary school in the south-east. Iranian media is reporting at least 201 people have been killed in total and 747 injured. Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister who has been leading the nuclear talks for the Iranian delegation, promised that Iran’s army would “teach aggressors the lesson they deserve”. Further explosions were reported in Gulf countries , including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait, all of which host US military bases. One person was killed by shrapnel from an Iranian missile in Abu Dhabi, UAE officials said. The US president, Donald Trump, described the US military campaign as “massive and ongoing” as he called on the people of Iran to “take over your government”. In a speech posted on Truth Social, he said the US would “raze their [Iran’s] missile industry to the ground” and claimed Tehran had refused to reach a deal with the US that would have averted war. Netanyahu said the US-Israeli attack could “create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands”. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Amid escalating tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, police on Saturday issued a public safety advisory which stated that Karachi had been placed on “high alert”. The advisory issued by the office of the Karachi additional inspector general of police, a copy of which is available with Dawn , said, “Karachi has been placed on high alert following increased military tensions between Pakistan and Afghan Taliban forces near the Pak-Afghan border.” “Police and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) have strengthened surveillance and tightened security at key entry-exit points, transportation hubs, sensitive and important places to pre-empt potential security threats,” it said. In the safety guidelines for residents and visitors, the Karachi police urged them to stay vigilant and alert to announcements from local police, law enforcement and provincial officials. The advisory urged the citizens to report suspicious activity and immediately notify local police or emergency services if they observe unusual movements, unattended packages, unfamiliar persons loitering in sensitive areas, illegal foreigners or any other suspicious activity. It also urged citizens to follow the directions of security personnel and comply promptly with instructions from police checkpoints or clearance operations. Further, it urged citizens to verify information and to avoid spreading unverified rumours or “panic content” on social media. The advisory pointed out to a recent fake threat alert on social media related to a few shopping centres and commercial areas that caused “fear and panic” in public. It advised the citizens to “rely on official statements from Sindh Police, local administration, or government press briefings”. Further, air travellers were advised to leave their homes for the airport at least one hour earlier than usual due to enhanced screening, stop-and-search measures and increased security around airport and key points. It stated that only one visitor or attendant should accompany one passenger to the designated drop off or pick-up point to avoid crowding at the airport. Citizens were also told to carry their computerised national identity cards (CNICs) with them at all times, as they may be required for verification at various checkpoints. “National security forces and law enforcement agencies are fully prepared to respond to threats and protect citizens. All measures are designed to maintain peace, stability, and public safety,” the advisory concluded.",

      "summary_orig": "Multiple videos have been circulating on social media platform X since February 27, claiming to show Afghan BM-21 rocket strikes, launched from the Alishero border district, targeting Pakistani military installations. However, the videos are unrelated to the current situation and are old. Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban, after the neighbouring country opened fire on multiple locations across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on late Thursday. Authorities in Kabul had called it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend. On Feb 27, a pro-Indian account on X shared a video of buildings set on fire. “Afghan BM-21 rocket strikes have begun from areas of Alishero district targeting Pakistani military installations across the so-called (imaginary) border… look what’s happened,” reads the caption. The post gained 100,800 views. Another pro-Indian account shared the same video with the caption: “Reports of BM 21 rocket strikes from Afghanistan’s Alishero district targeting Pakistani military installations.” That post garnered 11,100 views. The clip with similar captions was shared by several other pro-Indian and pro-Afghan accounts, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . A separate video, showing rockets being launched in the darkness of the night, was shared by pro-Afghan accounts with similar claims. One such user posted the clip with the caption: “Breaking BM-21 rocket strikes have begun from areas of Alishero district targeting Pakistani military installations across the so-called (imaginary) border.” The post gained 22,400 views. This video was further amplified by multiple pro-Afghan and pro-Indian accounts on X, as can be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the ongoing conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan. A keyword search was conducted to verify whether any credible Pakistani or international media outlets had reported Afghan rocket strikes targeting Pakistani military installations, but it did not yield any results. A reverse image search of the first viral video yielded Facebook posts and Egyptian news coverage. It was shared on Facebook by a user two weeks before the Pakistan-Afghanistan conflict broke out, with the caption, “Muslim extremists set fire to a Coptic Christian neighbourhood in the Egyptian capital Cairo”. Another Facebook page, namely Global Disaster News, also shared the clip on Jan 29 with a similar context. “Emergency teams respond to a large fire burning structures in the Mokattam area southeast of Cairo, Egypt; eyewitness video shows at least one person on top of a building. - factual,” the caption reads. This indicates that the video predates the current Pakistan-Afghanistan tensions and is unrelated to any cross-border rocket strikes. A pro-Christian Instagram account also posted the same video on February 8, 2026, describing a fire in “Garbage City,” a Christian area in Cairo, stating that 21 houses were destroyed and two children died. The post received 1,300 likes. An English-language Egyptian news outlet, Egypt Today , published a report on Jan 29 titled “Cairo fire brought under control; firefighting drone deployed”. The report stated that a fire broke out in several homes in Mansheyat Nasser in western Cairo and was later contained by Civil Defence forces. No fatalities were reported at the time, though several people were treated for smoke inhalation. Another Egyptian news portal, Gomhuria Online , published a report the same day titled “Fire in 3 houses in Manshiyat Nasser brought under control with no injuries”. Separately, a reverse image search of the second viral video, allegedly showing the BM-21 rocket launch, yielded a YouTube video dated August 29, 2018, titled “M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)”. The description states: “5thBN3rdFAR conducts a night live fire exercise with the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) in support of their Battery External Evaluations.” The video had 42,142 views, indicating it is years old and unrelated to current events. One video shows a residential fire in Cairo, Egypt, from January 2026, while another depicts a 2018 HIMARS live-fire exercise. Neither video is related to the current situation between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Therefore, the claim that viral videos show Afghan BM-21 rocket strikes on Pakistani military installations is false.

      "summary_orig": "The United States and Israel launched a wave of strikes against targets in Iran on Saturday, triggering explosions in the capital Tehran and an escalation across the region. “We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally — again — obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy,” said US President Donald Trump in an address from his Florida home posted to his Truth Social platform. On the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation aimed to “remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran”, and urged Iranians to overthrow the Islamic Republic’s clerical leadership. In response to the Israel-US aggression, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran later in the day confirmed the launch of the “first wave” of missile and drone attacks against Israel in response to the strikes on its territory. Political figures and analysts in Pakistan have condemned the recent developments, particularly criticising US President Donald Trump, and warned that the escalation could have grave consequences for the region. In a statement issued by the PPP Media Cell, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari condemned the Israeli attack on Iran, calling it a “matter of serious concern” for peace in the region. He further stated that the “cowardly attack” by Israel was an attempt to cover its atrocities in Gaza. The PPP chairman also called on the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to take all possible measures to stop the Israeli aggression. The international community should take notice of Israel’s open violation of Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added. Author and journalist Zahid Hussain noted in a post on social media platform X that “predictably, the US and Israel have attacked Iran”. “The so-called ‘peace time president’ has invaded two countries and attacked several others in the first year of his term,” he added, seemingly referring to Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that he has played a role in stopping multiple wars. Hussain also warned that the “latest US aggression will have serious consequences for Pakistan and the entire region”. Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, UK and United Nations Maleeha Lodhi called on Pakistan to condemn the US-Israeli aggression against Iran “without delay”. “The people of Pakistan expect no less than to stand in solidarity with Iran,” she said in a post on X. Meanwhile, former senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed pointed out that the Israeli-American aggression against Iran has “grave implications” for the region and Pakistan. “If God forbid, Iran loses, then Israel’s de facto border will be at Taftan on the Pakistan border […] India-Israeli axis will tighten the squeeze on Pakistan, creating a nutcracker situation. “Balochistan and Pakistan’s nuclear program could then also be targeted! Hence, urgent need for Pakistan to defuse tensions with Afghanistan as well as give a healing touch at home to defuse political polarisation,” he said. Lawyer and human rights professional Reema Omer noted that “preventative” or “preemptive” attacks had no basis in international law. “They are mere euphemisms for the crime of aggression, i.e. the use of force against another state without legal justification,”she wrote on X. “The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg described the crime of aggression as the ‘supreme international crime’ as it ‘contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole’,” she added. Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan former emir Sirajul Haq termed the attack on Iran “state terrorism” and urged Muslims to unite instead of “merely condemning it and waiting for their turn”. “Following Israeli aggression, Muslim countries should announce their withdrawal from Trump’s so-called peace board,” he said. Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari said: “Terrorist Israel has launched multiple attacks against Iran just as Iran and the US were supposedly near an agreement. “Given the lack of support within the US to attack Iran, Trump most likely sought an attack by Israel, knowing Iran would respond, which would allow the US to ‘justifiably’ attack Iran.” Separately, journalist Iftikhar Firdous said that with Iran being attacked during an active conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the entire Western border strip “is now under fire”. “The dynamics that emerge out of this conflict will shape global and regional geopolitics for the decades to come,” he wrote in a post on X. Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas condemned the “reckless and unlawful military attacks launched” against Iran. “This timing makes it clear that the talks were used as cover for a pre-planned aggression. Diplomacy was sabotaged deliberately. Who can trust any negotiation process now when advances in talks lead straight to bombardment? The Israeli claim of a ‘preemptive’ strike is absurd. There was no evidence Iran planned any attack on Israel,” he said. “Such actions by the US under Trump and Israel under Netanyahu are a grave violation of international law, including the UN Charter. They risk turning the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East into a catastrophe. The entire prospering region is now on fire because of this madness,” he said. He added that Iran’s response was a “legitimate act of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter”. “I call on the government of Pakistan to categorically and unequivocally condemn this aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he said. Author and activist Fatima Bhutto said, “If they succeed in Iran, Israel will turn to Pakistan next. They are the greatest threat to the world — a rogue terror state.” She further stated, “Bombing a sovereign country is not preemptive. The only state that has a right to defend itself now is Iran. May they do it, they would acting on behalf of the world.” Former federal minister Khawaja Saad Rafique said that the Israeli attack on Iran with American backing was “state terrorism”. “It is the fundamental right of the Iranian people to determine Iran’s national security priorities. The US and Israel cannot dictate this,” he said. “Attacks on Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear energy are nothing but global tyranny,” he said. Former federal finance minister and Awam Pakistan Party leader Miftah Ismail said the party condemned the “unwarranted attack” by Israel and the US on Iran. “It has sharply escalated tensions and risks far-reaching consequences across the region. It is particularly regrettable that this attack has come in the midst of negotiations being facilitated by Oman,” he said. “We call on Israel and the United States to immediately end this bombing campaign against Iran, so that dialogue can resume and peace can return to the Middle East,” he said. “We are also concerned about reports of missiles being fired on other Gulf States and call for this bombing to be stopped forthwith,” he added.

Diplomacy was sabotaged deliberately. Who can trust any negotiation process now when advances in talks lead straight to bombardment? The Israeli claim of a ‘preemptive’ strike is absurd. There was no evidence Iran planned any attack on Israel,” he said. “Such actions by the US under Trump and Israel under Netanyahu are a grave violation of international law, including the UN Charter. They risk turning the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East into a catastrophe. The entire prospering region is now on fire because of this madness,” he said. He added that Iran’s response was a “legitimate act of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter”. “I call on the government of Pakistan to categorically and unequivocally condemn this aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he said. Author and activist Fatima Bhutto said, “If they succeed in Iran, Israel will turn to Pakistan next. They are the greatest threat to the world — a rogue terror state.” She further stated, “Bombing a sovereign country is not preemptive. The only state that has a right to defend itself now is Iran. May they do it, they would acting on behalf of the world.” Former federal minister Khawaja Saad Rafique said that the Israeli attack on Iran with American backing was “state terrorism”. “It is the fundamental right of the Iranian people to determine Iran’s national security priorities. The US and Israel cannot dictate this,” he said. “Attacks on Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear energy are nothing but global tyranny,” he said. Former federal finance minister and Awam Pakistan Party leader Miftah Ismail said the party condemned the “unwarranted attack” by Israel and the US on Iran. “It has sharply escalated tensions and risks far-reaching consequences across the region. It is particularly regrettable that this attack has come in the midst of negotiations being facilitated by Oman,” he said. “We call on Israel and the United States to immediately end this bombing campaign against Iran, so that dialogue can resume and peace can return to the Middle East,” he said. “We are also concerned about reports of missiles being fired on other Gulf States and call for this bombing to be stopped forthwith,” he added.

      "summary": "The United States and Israel launched a wave of strikes against targets in Iran on Saturday, triggering explosions in the capital Tehran and an escalation across the region. “We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally — again — obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy,” said US President Donald Trump in an address from his Florida home posted to his Truth Social platform. On the other hand, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation aimed to “remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran”, and urged Iranians to overthrow the Islamic Republic’s clerical leadership. In response to the Israel-US aggression, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran later in the day confirmed the launch of the “first wave” of missile and drone attacks against Israel in response to the strikes on its territory. Political figures and analysts in Pakistan have condemned the recent developments, particularly criticising US President Donald Trump, and warned that the escalation could have grave consequences for the region. In a statement issued by the PPP Media Cell, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari condemned the Israeli attack on Iran, calling it a “matter of serious concern” for peace in the region. He further stated that the “cowardly attack” by Israel was an attempt to cover its atrocities in Gaza. The PPP chairman also called on the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to take all possible measures to stop the Israeli aggression. The international community should take notice of Israel’s open violation of Iran’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added. Author and journalist Zahid Hussain noted in a post on social media platform X that “predictably, the US and Israel have attacked Iran”. “The so-called ‘peace time president’ has invaded two countries and attacked several others in the first year of his term,” he added, seemingly referring to Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that he has played a role in stopping multiple wars. Hussain also warned that the “latest US aggression will have serious consequences for Pakistan and the entire region”. Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US, UK and United Nations Maleeha Lodhi called on Pakistan to condemn the US-Israeli aggression against Iran “without delay”. “The people of Pakistan expect no less than to stand in solidarity with Iran,” she said in a post on X. Meanwhile, former senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed pointed out that the Israeli-American aggression against Iran has “grave implications” for the region and Pakistan. “If God forbid, Iran loses, then Israel’s de facto border will be at Taftan on the Pakistan border […] India-Israeli axis will tighten the squeeze on Pakistan, creating a nutcracker situation. “Balochistan and Pakistan’s nuclear program could then also be targeted! Hence, urgent need for Pakistan to defuse tensions with Afghanistan as well as give a healing touch at home to defuse political polarisation,” he said. Lawyer and human rights professional Reema Omer noted that “preventative” or “preemptive” attacks had no basis in international law. “They are mere euphemisms for the crime of aggression, i.e. the use of force against another state without legal justification,”she wrote on X. “The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg described the crime of aggression as the ‘supreme international crime’ as it ‘contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole’,” she added. Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan former emir Sirajul Haq termed the attack on Iran “state terrorism” and urged Muslims to unite instead of “merely condemning it and waiting for their turn”. “Following Israeli aggression, Muslim countries should announce their withdrawal from Trump’s so-called peace board,” he said. Former human rights minister Shireen Mazari said: “Terrorist Israel has launched multiple attacks against Iran just as Iran and the US were supposedly near an agreement. “Given the lack of support within the US to attack Iran, Trump most likely sought an attack by Israel, knowing Iran would respond, which would allow the US to ‘justifiably’ attack Iran.” Separately, journalist Iftikhar Firdous said that with Iran being attacked during an active conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the entire Western border strip “is now under fire”. “The dynamics that emerge out of this conflict will shape global and regional geopolitics for the decades to come,” he wrote in a post on X.

      "summary_orig": "Countries in the Middle East and around the world were watching with bated breath after the United States and Israel carried out long-feared strikes on Iran on Saturday. Trump: ‘annihilate’ US President Donald Trump vowed that the strikes would cripple Iran’s military and urged Iranians to rise up against the Islamic republic. “We are going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally — again — obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy,” Trump said in the address from his Florida home posted to his Truth Social platform. Calling on Iranians to stand up to their government, Trump added: “The hour of your freedom is at hand.” But he also warned that “the lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties”. Netanyahu ‘cast off the yoke’ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation aimed to “remove the existential threat posed by the terrorist regime in Iran”, and urged Iranians to overthrow the Islamic republic’s clerical leadership. “Our joint action will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands,” Netanyahu added. “The time has come for all the people of Iran… to cast off the yoke of tyranny and bring about a free and peace-seeking Iran.” Russia: Talks a ‘cover’ Russia called on its citizens to leave Iran, with former president Dmitry Medvedev saying that talks with the United States had just been a “cover”. “The peacekeeper is at it again,” Medvedev, now the chair of Russia’s security council, said in a post on X. “The talks with Iran were just a cover. Everyone knew that. So who has more patience to wait for the enemy’s sorry end now?” he added. Qatar: ‘secure’ Qatar, which hosts a US military base, initially said it was secure after the US and Israeli attacks on neighbouring Iran but was monitoring developments closely. “The situation inside the State of Qatar is stable and secure,” an interior ministry statement said. An official later told AFP that Qatari defence systems had intercepted an Iranian missile, and the defence ministry said it had repelled “a number of attacks.” Shah’s son: ‘final victory’ near - Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran’s last shah and a leading critic of Tehran, said that “we are very close to final victory” following the strikes. “I want to be by your side as soon as possible so that together we can take back and rebuild Iran,” said Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the Washington area and had repeatedly urged Trump to intervene. Jordan: protect skies Jordan’s military said its air force was at work on Saturday to protect the kingdom and its people while the strikes were ongoing. “These sorties are part of aerial reconnaissance and inspection operations aimed at maintaining the safety of Jordanian airspace and ensuring that it is free from any attempts at infiltration or illegal activities,” a military source said, after sirens were reported in Amman. France: safety a priority France, which has several military bases in the Middle East, notably in Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan, said that Paris’s priority was the safety of its citizens. “Obviously our priority in these sort of cases is the protection of our nationals, the protection of our forces in the region and the monitoring of the situation in real time, which we are doing,” Alice Rufo, minister-delegate to the Armed Forces and Veterans’ Affairs ministry, told France 2 television. African Union: stability at risk The African Union called “for restraint, urgent de-escalation and sustained dialogue” after the strikes, warning that conflict could risk harming people on the continent. “Further escalation risks worsening global instability, with serious implications for energy markets, food security, and economic resilience —  particularly in Africa, where conflict and economic pressures remain acute,” said the pan-African body’s head, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf. Poland ‘prepared’ Polish staff at its embassy in Tehran were “safe” but the country is “prepared for various scenarios,” Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X. Netherlands: ‘restraint’ In a post on X, Dutch Foreign Minister Tom Berendsen said: “The Netherlands calls on all parties to exercise restraint and prevent further escalation. Stability in the region is essential.",

      "title_orig": "Trump directs US agencies to toss Anthropic’s AI as Pentagon calls startup a supply risk",
      "summary_orig": "US President Donald Trump said on Friday he is directing the government to stop work with Anthropic, and the Pentagon said it would declare the start-up a supply-chain risk, dealing a major blow to the artificial intelligence lab after a showdown about technology guardrails. Trump added there would be a six-month phase-out for the Defence Department and other agencies that use the company’s products. If Anthropic does not help with the transition, Trump said, he would use “the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow”. The actions mark an extraordinary rebuke by the United States against one of the premier companies that has kept it in the lead on national security-critical AI, threatening to give Anthropic a pariah status that Washington until now had reserved for enemy suppliers. Google and Amazon are among Anthropic’s financial backers. The moves further set a precedent that US law alone would constrain how AI is deployed on the battlefield, with the Pentagon seeking to preserve all flexibility in defence and not be limited by warnings from the technology’s creators against powering weapons with unreliable AI. In a statement, Anthropic said it would challenge any risk designation in court by the Department of Defence, which the Trump administration has renamed the Department of War. “We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government,” the company said. “No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons.” Late on Friday, rival OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, Amazon and others, announced its own deal to deploy technology in the Defence Department’s classified network. CEO Sam Altman on X said the Pentagon shared its principles for human responsibility over weapon systems and for having no mass US surveillance. “We put them into our agreement,” Altman said of the points. “We also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted.” It was not immediately clear whether these contractual details differed from the red lines proposed by Anthropic. The Pentagon and OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ‘Nuclear War’ Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said Anthropic would be designated a supply-chain risk, following an impasse in months of talks on whether the company’s policies could constrain military action. Meeting with Hegseth this week, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei argued for weapons and surveillance limits and irked Pentagon officials. The Pentagon said US law, not a private company, would determine how to defend the country. The designation could bar tens of thousands of contractors from using Anthropic’s AI when working for the Pentagon. That represents an existential threat to its business with the government and could harm its private-sector relationships, said Franklin Turner, an attorney who specialises in government contracts. “Blacklisting Anthropic is the contractual equivalent of nuclear war,” he said. Similar US action was taken to remove Chinese tech giant Huawei from the Pentagon’s supply chains. Starting in 2017, the US restricted Defence Department use of Huawei equipment, prohibited federal agencies from purchasing its technology, and halted federal grant and loan funds for Huawei equipment. Anthropic has raced to win fierce competition to sell novel technology to businesses and government, particularly for national security, ahead of a widely expected initial public offering. The company has said it has not finalised an IPO decision. Saif Khan, who served in the National Security Council in former President Joe Biden’s White House, said the Defence Department’s action “may be the most draconian domestic AI regulation any government has ever issued.” “The Department is arguably treating Anthropic as a greater national security threat than any Chinese AI companies, none of whom they’ve designated supply-chain risks,” Khan said. ‘Killer Robots’ Tech companies and the Pentagon have repeatedly locked horns since at least 2018, when employees at Google protested against the Pentagon’s use of its AI to analyse drone footage. A rapprochement ensued with companies including Amazon and Microsoft jousting for defence business, while several big-tech CEOs pledged co-operation last year with the Trump administration. But theoretical “killer robots” have worried human-rights and technology activists as wars in Ukraine and Gaza showcased increasingly automated systems. Bolder US military action in the past year has added to these concerns, said Jack Shanahan, who had directed the Pentagon’s algorithmic warfare effort Project Maven. “People might be a little bit more nervous about no restrictions,” Shanahan said. The White House’s legal sign-off could be “top cover for anybody that does anything that would potentially result in lack of due process, civilian casualties, collateral damage.” The Pentagon signed agreements worth up to $200 million each with major AI labs in the past year, including Anthropic, OpenAI and Google. Anthropic, negotiating for awards under that ceiling, had flagged concerns about the legal system’s ability to keep up with AI progress. At present, for instance, US laws do not prevent the use of technology to compile seemingly innocuous data to reveal information about people’s private lives, its CEO Amodei has said. Anthropic’s AI has been in use across the intelligence community and armed services, and it was first among peer AI companies to work with classified information, through a supply deal via cloud provider Amazon.",

      "summary_orig": "GENEVA: The UN rights chief has decried mounting threats to women’s rights worldwide, highlighting rampant femicide and horrific abuse exposed in cases like that of US sex offender Jefferey Epstein. Addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, Volker Turk slammed “social systems that silence women and girls” and allow powerful men to abuse them with impunity. “Violence against women, including femicide, is a global emergency,” the High Commissioner for Human Rights told the UN’s top rights body. He highlighted the extreme situation in Afghanistan, warning that the “system of segregation imposed on women is reminiscent of apartheid, based on gender rather than race”. He also pointed to two cases that have recently caused shock waves around the world: those of convicted Epstein and of French rape survivor Gisele Pelicot. Both cases “show the extent of the exploitation and abuse of women and girls”, Turk said, asking: “does anyone think there are not many more men like Dominique Pelicot or Jeffrey Epstein?” Epstein associated with the world’s rich, famous and powerful despite his conviction in 2008 to procuring a child for prostitution. He died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while facing trial on sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Gisele Pelicot gave the public insight into her shocking case when she waived her right to anonymity during the 2024 trial in France of her ex-husband Dominique and dozens of strangers who he brought in to rape her while she was unconscious. “Such horrific abuse is enabled by social systems that silence women and girls, and insulate powerful men from accountability,” Turk charged. “States must investigate all alleged crimes, protect survivors, and ensure justice without fear or favour,” he insisted.­ Published in Dawn, February 28th, 2026",

      "summary_orig": "human rights lawyer Imaan Mazari (right) with her husband Hadi Ali Chattha during a court hearing.—AFP/file ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Friday adjourned the hearing of applications seeking suspension of sentence filed by lawyer and rights activists Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chat­tha in the controversial tweets case, as the defence pressed for an early date before Eid. Justice Muhammad Asif took up the matter amid a request from the state to transfer the appeal to another bench. During the proceedings, the assistant attorney general submitted that a case of similar nature had earlier been heard by Justice Azam Khan and reques­ted that the present appeal also be placed before his court. He argued that it would be appropriate for the same bench to hear related matters. Rights activists granted bail by anti-terrorism court in two other cases However, the counsel for the appellants, Advocate Riasat Ali Azad, opposed the request, maintaining that no such case was pending before any other court of the country. He pointed out that the present appeal had been heard by Jus­tice Muhammad Asif since its inception and questioned how the government could raise objections to the bench at this stage. Expressing full confidence in the court, Mr Azad urged the ju­­dge to fix the matter for hearing before Eid, saying an early date would bring relief to his clients. Justice Asif asked the state to clarify which case was pending before Justice Azam Khan. Observers present in the courtroom noted that while other cases involving the accused might be pending elsewhere, the instant appeal had consistently remained before the same bench. The judge later rose and proceeded to his chambers after re­­marking, “Let’s see,” in response to the request for an early date. The state counsel informed the court that it had no objection if a date was fixed. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned without immediate scheduling of the suspension pleas. Bail granted In a separate development, Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Abul Hasanat Muhammad Zulqarnain granted bail to Ms Mazari and Mr Chattha in two other cases. The bail was allowed against surety bonds of Rs5,000 each in cases related to an alleged scuffle outside the Islamabad High Court and a protest outside the National Press Club. In the case concerning the al­­leged altercation outside the high court, an affidavit submitted by the complainant and Islamabad High Court Bar Association president Syed Wajid Ali Gillani was made part of the record. However, in the controversial tweets case — in which both rights activists have been convicted — bail has yet to be granted. Owing to the absence of relief in that matter, their release remains subject to the outcome of the pending suspension of sentence applications before the high court.

      "title_orig": "Israeli strikes kill seven more Palestinians across Gaza",
      "summary_orig": "• Israel’s Supreme Court freezes ban on foreign aid organisations in enclave • US public sympathy shifts to Palestinians over Israel, new Gallup poll reveals CAIRO: Relentless Israeli attacks killed at least seven Palestinians in Gaza on Friday, medics said, adding to a death toll of at least 600 people killed by Israeli fire since a US-brokered ceasefire agreement came into effect last October. Gaza’s health officials reported that in southern Gaza, five people were killed and several others were injured, some critically, in Israeli drone strikes. The strikes targeted two police checkpoints in Khan Yunis and in the Abu Hujair area northwest of the Bureij refugee camp later in the day, medics said. Separately, an Israeli airstrike against a group of Palestinians in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood in northern Gaza killed two people and wounded several others. Ban on NGOs frozen Meanwhile, Israel’s Supreme Court decided in a ruling published on Friday to freeze a government ban on 37 foreign NGOs working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank pending a final decision. “Without taking any position, a temporary interim order is hereby issued,” the court said in a ruling responding to a petition from more than a dozen NGOs, seeking to reverse the ban after Israel’s government revoked their status in Israel. The decision theoretically allows the NGOs to work in Gaza and the West Bank until a final ruling, but aid groups are unsure about the freeze’s implementation. Organisations like MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and CARE were informed on Dec 30, 2025, that their Israeli registrations expired and they had 60 days to renew them by providing Palestinian staff lists. If they failed to do so, they would have to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, from March 1. The NGOs, through AIDA, petitioned the Supreme Court after losing their charity registration in Israel, following a year-long refusal to disclose their Palestinian employees to Israeli authorities. The court said in its ruling that there existed a “genuine legal dispute” due to the foreign NGOs’ responsibilities to their employees’ privacy under European law. “We are still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate”, Athena Rayburn, AIDA director, told AFP, calling it “a step in the right direction”. Sympathy shifts to Palestinians Separately, a fresh Gallup poll shows that for the first time, Americans sympathise more with Palestinians than with Israelis in their decades-long conflict. The poll, released on Friday, found that 41 per cent of Americans sympathise more with the Palestinians and 36pc sided with Israel, a sharp reversal from just a year ago when Israel led in sympathies 46 to 33pc. For the first time in over two decades, Israel is not leading in Gallup’s poll, though the gap is not significant. Partisan views on the Middle East show more independents shifting towards Palestinians, with an 11-point preference over Israel in the past year. Democrats overwhelmingly support Palestinians, with 65pc sympathising with them versus 17pc for Israel. Democrats blame ex-president Joe Biden for insufficient action to curb Israel’s offensive in Gaza after October 7,2023, escalation. Gallup surveyed 1,001 US adults by telephone from February 2 to 16.

      "summary": "• Israel’s Supreme Court freezes ban on foreign aid organisations in enclave • US public sympathy shifts to Palestinians over Israel, new Gallup poll reveals CAIRO: Relentless Israeli attacks killed at least seven Palestinians in Gaza on Friday, medics said, adding to a death toll of at least 600 people killed by Israeli fire since a US-brokered ceasefire agreement came into effect last October. Gaza’s health officials reported that in southern Gaza, five people were killed and several others were injured, some critically, in Israeli drone strikes. The strikes targeted two police checkpoints in Khan Yunis and in the Abu Hujair area northwest of the Bureij refugee camp later in the day, medics said. Separately, an Israeli airstrike against a group of Palestinians in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood in northern Gaza killed two people and wounded several others. Ban on NGOs frozen Meanwhile, Israel’s Supreme Court decided in a ruling published on Friday to freeze a government ban on 37 foreign NGOs working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank pending a final decision. “Without taking any position, a temporary interim order is hereby issued,” the court said in a ruling responding to a petition from more than a dozen NGOs, seeking to reverse the ban after Israel’s government revoked their status in Israel. The decision theoretically allows the NGOs to work in Gaza and the West Bank until a final ruling, but aid groups are unsure about the freeze’s implementation. Organisations like MSF, Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council, and CARE were informed on Dec 30, 2025, that their Israeli registrations expired and they had 60 days to renew them by providing Palestinian staff lists. If they failed to do so, they would have to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, from March 1. The NGOs, through AIDA, petitioned the Supreme Court after losing their charity registration in Israel, following a year-long refusal to disclose their Palestinian employees to Israeli authorities. The court said in its ruling that there existed a “genuine legal dispute” due to the foreign NGOs’ responsibilities to their employees’ privacy under European law. “We are still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate”, Athena Rayburn, AIDA director, told AFP, calling it “a step in the right direction”. Sympathy shifts to Palestinians Separately, a fresh Gallup poll shows that for the first time, Americans sympathise more with Palestinians than with Israelis in their decades-long conflict. The poll, released on Friday, found that 41 per cent of Americans sympathise more with the Palestinians and 36pc sided with Israel, a sharp reversal from just a year ago when Israel led in sympathies 46 to 33pc. For the first time in over two decades, Israel is not leading in Gallup’s poll, though the gap is not significant. Partisan views on the Middle East show more independents shifting towards Palestinians, with an 11-point preference over Israel in the past year. Democrats overwhelmingly support Palestinians, with 65pc sympathising with them versus 17pc for Israel. Democrats blame ex-president Joe Biden for insufficient action to curb Israel’s offensive in Gaza after October 7,2023, escalation. Gallup surveyed 1,001 US adults by telephone from February 2 to 16.

      "summary_orig": "• Qatar, Saudi Arabia lead diplomatic scramble; Iran offers to facilitate talks • Trump ‘refuses’ to intervene because of ‘fondness’ for Pakistan • UN, China, Russia, UK call for immediate ceasefire ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers said on Friday they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan unleashed air strikes on major Afghan cities, killing dozens in the most serious clashes between the allies-turned-foes, which Defence Minister Khawaja Asif described as an “open war”. The Afghan Taliban, who claimed to have launched “retaliatory attacks” over strikes against terrorists’ hideouts last weekend, said on Friday that they were “ready for dialogue”. “Afghanistan… has always preferred to reso­lve issues based on mutual understanding and respect,” the Afghan foreign ministry quoted Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as telling Qatar’s junior Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khalifi by telephone. Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid echoed that sentiment, saying “now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue”. Key regional powers are also quickly mobilising to prevent the conflict from spiralling. Iran, which borders both nations, offered to mediate. “The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue and to enhance understanding and cooperation between the two countries,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X. Saudi Arabia and Qatar were also engaged in a diplomatic drive to halt the hostilities, a source with knowledge of the talks told AFP. “Saudi Arabia, in coordination with Qatar, is making efforts to reduce tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the source said, adding the goal is to “de-escalate the situation and prevent it from spiralling out of control”. Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister, Prince Faisal bin Farhan, in a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Muttaqi, expressed concern over the recent situation. Meanwhile, during a phone call with Paki­stan’s Ishaq Dar, the Saudi foreign minister agreed to stay closely engaged. Similarly, Turkish Fore­ign Minister Hakan Fidan held separate calls with his counterparts from Paki­stan, Afghanistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia to discuss the conflict, a Turkish diplomatic source said. From Moscow to Beijing, international powers also issued urgent calls for de-escalation. China, a neighbour and major investor in the region, expressed deep concern over the violence. “China supports combating all forms of terrorism and calls on both parties to remain calm and exercise restraint, properly resolve differences through dialogue and negotiation, achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further loss of life,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said. She confirmed that China was mediating through its own channels and had requested both sides ensure the safety of Chinese personnel and projects. Moscow urged an immediate halt to the attacks and a return to diplomacy. Russia, which is the only country to officially recognise the Taliban government and also maintains good relations with Pakistan, said the clashes were a dangerous development. “We call on our friends Afghanistan and Pakistan to abandon this dangerous confrontation and return to the negotiating table to resolve all differences through political and diplomatic means,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that Moscow was “closely monitoring this situation.” From Europe, Britain expressed grave concern. “We are deeply concerned by the significant escalation in tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan,” UK Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said on X. “We urge both sides to take immediate steps toward de-escalation, avoid further harm to civilians, and re-engage in mediated dialogue.” Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump, known for his enthusiasm in mediating conflicts and a strong desire for a Nobel Peace Prize, offered a stance that diverged from his usual eagerness to resolve disputes. In Washington, Trump suggested he would not be willing to step in, highlighting his strong ties with Pakistan’s leadership. Spe­aking to reporters before heading to Texas, Trump was asked about Pakistan’s retaliation to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban. Asked whether someone had asked for him to intervene, Trump said, “Well, I would but I get along with Pakistan, as you know, very well. Very, very well. “[They] have a great prime minister, a great general there … two of the people I really respect a lot,” he said. “And I think that Pakistan is doing terrifically well,” he said. The United Nations added its voice to the global chorus for peace. UN Secretary-General Ant­onio Guterres “is deeply concerned by the escalation of violence we’re seeing,” his spokesman Step­hane Dujarric said. “He calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and he reiterates his call on the parties to resolve any differences through diplomacy.” The International Comm­­ittee of the Red Cross also echoed calls to protect civilians. The organisation’s president has called for a de-escalation of hostilities between Afghanistan and Pakistan, AFP reports. ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric said in a statement that her organisation was “preparing an operational response to humanitarian needs on the ground”. Published in Dawn, February 28th, 2026",
